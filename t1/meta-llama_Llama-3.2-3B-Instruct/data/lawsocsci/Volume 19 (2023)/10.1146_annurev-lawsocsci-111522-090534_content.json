{"Literature Review": "The study of vaccines in the context of public health has been dominated by an instrumentalist approach, focusing on the promotion of vaccine acceptance and overcoming hesitancy. However, this approach has been criticized for its limitations in addressing the complex social and cultural factors that influence vaccine uptake. Recent research has highlighted the importance of considering the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, as well as the role of law in shaping vaccine policies and practices. This review aims to chart the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, exploring why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health, and examining the theoretical tools that enable alternative approaches. Research on vaccines has been shaped by a dominant instrumentalist approach, which views law as a tool for promoting public health and overcoming vaccine hesitancy. This approach has been criticized for its narrow focus on individual-level behaviors and its failure to account for the complex social and cultural factors that influence vaccine uptake. For example, research has shown that vaccine hesitancy is often linked to concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, as well as to issues of trust and confidence in the healthcare system. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of considering the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics. This approach recognizes that vaccines are not just medical products, but also commodities that are shaped by complex social and economic forces. For example, research has shown that the production and distribution of vaccines are often influenced by issues of global inequality and access to resources. In addition to considering the materiality of vaccines, research has also highlighted the role of law in shaping vaccine policies and practices. This includes the regulation of vaccine development and distribution, as well as the use of law to promote vaccine acceptance and overcome hesitancy. However, this approach has been criticized for its limitations in addressing the complex social and cultural factors that influence vaccine uptake. Recent research has highlighted the importance of using constructivist approaches to vaccines from feminist sociology and anthropology. These approaches recognize that vaccine debates are often shaped by issues of power and inequality, and that they can provide valuable insights into the social and cultural factors that influence vaccine uptake. For example, research has shown that vaccine debates can illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches have also been used to study vaccines, recognizing that vaccines are not just medical products, but also technologies that are shaped by complex social and economic forces. STS research has highlighted the importance of considering the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, as well as the role of law in shaping vaccine policies and practices. Despite the potential of these approaches, there are considerable methodological challenges for research on vaccines. For example, STS research often requires a high degree of collaboration between researchers from different disciplines, which can be challenging to achieve. Additionally, research on vaccines often requires access to sensitive and confidential data, which can be difficult to obtain. In conclusion, research on vaccines has been dominated by an instrumentalist approach, which views law as a tool for promoting public health and overcoming vaccine hesitancy. However, this approach has been criticized for its limitations in addressing the complex social and cultural factors that influence vaccine uptake. Recent research has highlighted the importance of considering the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, as well as the role of law in shaping vaccine policies and practices.
