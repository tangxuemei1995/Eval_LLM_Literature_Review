{"Literature Review": "Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for biomolecule sensing applications due to their unique properties and potential for revolutionizing healthcare through point-of-care diagnostics. This literature review aims to explore the current state of research on graphene and 2D materials for biomolecule sensing, highlighting their advantages, challenges, and future prospects.The exceptional properties of graphene, including its high specific surface area (SSA) and unique electronic structure, make it an ideal material for biosensing applications. Novoselov et al. (2004) first isolated graphene and demonstrated its remarkable electronic properties, paving the way for its use in various applications, including biosensors. The high SSA of graphene, typically around 2630 mÂ²/g, provides numerous binding sites for biomolecules, enhancing sensitivity and detection limits.One of the most common configurations for graphene-based biosensors is the field-effect transistor (FET) structure. Ping et al. (2016) demonstrated the use of graphene FETs for the detection of various biomolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The working principle of these sensors relies on the modulation of the electrical properties of graphene upon biomolecule binding, which can be detected through changes in conductance or capacitance.The density of states (DOS) of graphene plays a crucial role in its sensing capabilities. Unlike traditional semiconductors, graphene's DOS is linear near the Dirac point, resulting in a high sensitivity to changes in charge carrier concentration. This property enables the detection of biomolecules at extremely low concentrations, even down to the single-molecule level. Chen et al. (2019) reported the detection of DNA at zeptomolar concentrations using a graphene-based FET sensor, demonstrating the potential for ultra-sensitive biosensing.While graphene has been the most extensively studied 2D material for biosensing, other 2D materials have also shown promise. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2), have attracted attention due to their tunable bandgaps and unique electronic properties. Sarkar et al. (2014) demonstrated the use of MoS2 FETs for label-free detection of biomolecules with high sensitivity and selectivity.Despite the promising results, several challenges need to be addressed for the widespread adoption of 2D material-based biosensors. One major issue is the presence of defects in these materials, which can significantly affect their sensing performance. Banerjee et al. (2018) investigated the impact of defects on graphene-based biosensors and found that while some defects can enhance sensitivity, others can lead to false positives or reduced selectivity. Therefore, careful characterization and control of defects are crucial for developing reliable biosensors.Another challenge is achieving high specificity in complex biological samples. While 2D materials can detect biomolecules at extremely low concentrations, distinguishing between similar molecules in a mixture remains difficult. Functionalization of the 2D material surface with specific recognition elements, such as antibodies or aptamers, has been proposed as a solution. Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrated improved selectivity in protein detection using aptamer-functionalized graphene FETs.The development of standardized protocols and calibration methods is essential for the widespread adoption of 2D material-based biosensors. Liang et al. (2017) proposed a set of guidelines for characterizing and reporting the performance of graphene-based biosensors, emphasizing the need for reproducibility and comparability between different studies.Impedance spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing and optimizing 2D material-based biosensors. Yang et al. (2018) developed impedance models for graphene FET biosensors, providing insights into the sensing mechanisms and enabling the optimization of device performance.Looking ahead, the integration of 2D material-based biosensors into point-of-care platforms holds great promise for revolutionizing healthcare. Miniaturization, multiplexing, and integration with microfluidic systems are key areas of ongoing research. Liu et al. (2021) demonstrated a portable, smartphone-based biosensing platform using graphene FETs for rapid and sensitive detection of multiple biomarkers.In conclusion, graphene and other 2D materials offer unique advantages for biomolecule sensing, including high sensitivity, large surface area, and the potential for single-molecule detection. However, challenges such as defect control, specificity in complex samples, and standardization need to be addressed. With continued research and development, 2D material-based biosensors have the potential to enable rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective point-of-care diagnostics, ultimately transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Electric Field Effect in Atomically Thin Carbon Films", "authors": "Konstantin S.
