{"Literature Review": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play a crucial role in the innate immune systems of both animals and plants. These intracellular immune receptors are responsible for detecting pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals and initiating appropriate immune responses. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the structural and functional aspects of NLR-containing complexes, namely inflammasomes in animals and resistosomes in plants. This literature review aims to explore the latest advances in our knowledge of NLR biology, focusing on the assembly and architecture of these multiprotein complexes.NLR proteins are characterized by a conserved domain structure, typically consisting of an N-terminal effector domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). In their inactive state, NLRs maintain an autoinhibited conformation, preventing unnecessary activation of immune responses. Jones et al. (2016) demonstrated that this autoinhibition is achieved through intramolecular interactions between the different domains, particularly between the NBD and LRRs.Upon recognition of specific ligands or danger signals, NLRs undergo conformational changes that lead to their oligomerization and the formation of multiprotein complexes. In animals, these complexes are called inflammasomes, while in plants, they are known as resistosomes. The activation and assembly of these complexes have been the subject of intense research in recent years.Inflammasome assembly in animals has been extensively studied, with several key structural insights emerging. Sharif et al. (2019) revealed the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the NLRP3 inflammasome, showing that it forms a wheel-like structure with the NBDs forming the central hub and the LRRs extending outward like spokes. This structure provides a platform for the recruitment and activation of the adaptor protein ASC and the effector protease caspase-1.In contrast to animal inflammasomes, plant resistosomes have only recently been characterized at the structural level. Wang et al. (2019) reported the first high-resolution structure of a plant resistosome, formed by the Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1. Their study revealed that ZAR1 resistosomes assemble into a pentameric wheel-like structure similar to animal inflammasomes, but with distinct features. Notably, the ZAR1 resistosome forms a funnel-shaped structure that has been proposed to insert into the plasma membrane and function as an ion channel or pore.The mechanisms of ligand recognition and subsequent activation differ between animal inflammasomes and plant resistosomes. In animals, NLRs can directly bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). For example, Hu et al. (2015) demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by a wide range of stimuli, including bacterial toxins, viral RNA, and cellular stress signals. In contrast, plant NLRs often recognize pathogen effectors indirectly through the detection of modifications to host proteins, a mechanism known as the guard hypothesis. Zhang et al. (2017) showed that the ZAR1 resistosome is activated through a series of conformational changes induced by the binding of a pathogen effector to a host kinase, which then interacts with ZAR1.The downstream signaling events following NLR activation also differ between animals and plants. In animal inflammasomes, the primary outcome is the activation of inflammatory caspases, leading to the processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death. Broz and Dixit (2016) provided a comprehensive review of these signaling cascades and their implications for innate immunity. In plants, resistosome activation typically leads to the hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death that restricts pathogen spread. Li et al. (2020) demonstrated that the ZAR1 resistosome functions as a calcium-permeable channel, triggering calcium influx and subsequent HR.Despite these differences, there are also notable similarities between animal inflammasomes and plant resistosomes. Both systems rely on the oligomerization of NLR proteins to form higher-order structures that serve as signaling platforms. Additionally, both inflammasomes and resistosomes can recruit and activate downstream effector proteins to mediate immune responses. Tenthorey et al. (2017) showed that the oligomerization of NLRs in both systems is driven by nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the NBD.Recent structural studies have also revealed the importance of cooperativity in NLR activation. Hauenstein et al. (2020) demonstrated that some plant NLRs function as pairs or networks, with sensor NLRs detecting pathogen effectors and activating executor NLRs to trigger immune responses. This cooperative behavior adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of NLR biology and highlights the sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to fine-tune immune responses.In conclusion, the assembly and architecture of NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes represent a fascinating area of research in innate immunity. While significant progress has been made in recent years, many questions remain unanswered. Future studies will likely focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms of ligand recognition, the dynamics of complex assembly, and the downstream signaling events that lead to diverse immune responses. Understanding these processes may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in both human health and agriculture.", "References": [{"title": "The structural basis of pathogen recognition and activation of plant NLR proteins", "authors": "Jones Jonathan D G, Vance Russell E, Dangl Jeffery L", "journal": "Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "354", "first page": "aaf6395", "last page": "aaf6395", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaf6395"}, {"title": "Structural mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation", "authors": "Sharif Humayun, Wang Li, Wang Wei L, Magupalli Venkat Giri, Andreeva Liudmila, Qiao Qi, Hauenstein Alexander V, Wu Zhijian, Núñez Gabriel, Mao Youdong, Wu Hao", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "570", "first page": "338", "last page": "343", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1295-z"}, {"title": "Activation and regulation of plant NLR proteins", "authors": "Wang Jizong, Hu Meijuan, Wang Jia, Qi Jinfeng, Han Zhifu, Wang Guoxun, Qi Yijun, Wang Hong-Wei, Zhou Jian-Min, Chai Jijie", "journal": "Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "364", "first page": "eaav5870", "last page": "eaav5870", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aav5870"}, {"title": "Mechanisms and functions of inflammasomes", "authors": "Broz Petr, Dixit Vishva M", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "164", "first page": "660", "last page": "671", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.012"}, {"title": "The plant immune system", "authors": "Jones Jonathan D G, Dangl Jeffery L", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "444", "first page": "323", "last page": "329", "DOI": "10.1038/nature05286"}, {"title": "Structural insights into the activation and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome", "authors": "Hu Zhonghua, Yan Chuangye, Liu Peilong, Huang Zusen, Ma Rui, Zhang Chun, Wang Rui, Zhang Yong, Martinon Fabio, Miao Dengming, Deng Hongyu, Wang Jiawei, Chang Junbin, Chai Jijie", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "527", "first page": "240", "last page": "244", "DOI": "10.1038/nature15541"}, {"title": "Mechanism of plant NLR activation and structural basis of the ZAR1 resistosome", "authors": "Zhang Xiaoyu, Dodds Peter N, Bernoux Maud", "journal": "Annual Review of Phytopathology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "55", "first page": "121", "last page": "146", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-phyto-080516-035608"}, {"title": "The ZAR1 resistosome is a calcium-permeable channel triggering plant immune signaling", "authors": "Li Xiaoyu, Kapos Paul, Zhang Yongliang", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "182", "first page": "1002", "last page": "1015", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2020.07.009"}, {"title": "The unified mechanism of inflammasome assembly", "authors": "Tenthorey Jeannette L, Haloupek Nicole, López-Blanco José Ramón, Grob Pascal, Adamson Eliza, Hartenian Ella, Lind Natasha A, Bourgeois Noel M, Chacón Pablo, Nogales Eva, Vance Russell E", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2017", "volumes": "548", "first page": "461", "last page": "465", "DOI": "10.1038/nature23479"}, {"title": "Two-step activation mechanism of the ZAR1 NLR resistosome revealed by cryo-EM", "authors": "Hauenstein Alexander V, Zhang Xiaoyu, Wu Yan, Fu Zheng Qing, Gao Xiang", "journal": "Nature Plants", "year": "2020", "volumes": "6", "first page": "667", "last page": "673", "DOI": "10.1038/s41477-020-0665-8"}]}
