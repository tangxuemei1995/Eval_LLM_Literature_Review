{"Literature Review": "The field of protein structure prediction has witnessed remarkable progress over the past few decades, with recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning methodologies leading to unprecedented accuracy in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins and protein complexes. This literature review aims to critically assess the methods used for predicting protein structures and complexes, focusing on the contributions of community-wide blind prediction experiments such as CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) and CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions). Protein structure prediction has long been considered one of the grand challenges in computational biology. Traditional approaches to protein structure prediction relied heavily on comparative modeling, threading, and ab initio methods. Comparative modeling, also known as homology modeling, utilizes experimentally determined structures of homologous proteins as templates to predict the structure of a target protein. Threading methods, on the other hand, attempt to identify the best structural fold for a given sequence by aligning it to a library of known structures. Ab initio methods aim to predict protein structures from sequence information alone, often employing physics-based force fields and conformational sampling techniques. The CASP experiment, initiated in 1994, has played a crucial role in objectively assessing the performance of various protein structure prediction methods. CASP provides a platform for researchers to blindly predict the structures of proteins whose experimental structures are temporarily withheld from public databases. This blind prediction format has been instrumental in driving innovation and identifying the most effective approaches in the field. Similarly, the CAPRI experiment, launched in 2001, focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the structures of protein complexes. CAPRI has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of protein-protein docking methodologies and evaluating the accuracy of predicted protein complexes. The advent of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction. In particular, the introduction of AlphaFold by DeepMind in CASP13 (2018) marked a significant turning point. AlphaFold utilized deep neural networks trained on protein sequence and structure databases to predict inter-residue distances and orientations, which were then used to guide structure prediction. This approach demonstrated remarkable accuracy, outperforming traditional methods by a significant margin. Building upon this success, AlphaFold2, introduced in CASP14 (2020), achieved even more impressive results. AlphaFold2 employed an end-to-end deep learning approach that directly predicts 3D coordinates of protein structures from amino acid sequences. The method's performance was so exceptional that it was hailed as a solution to the protein folding problem, with accuracy approaching experimental methods for many targets. The success of AlphaFold2 has spurred further developments in the field. RoseTTAFold, developed by the Baker lab, utilizes a similar approach to AlphaFold2 but with a more computationally efficient architecture, making it accessible to a broader range of researchers. These AI-driven methods have not only improved the accuracy of single-chain protein structure prediction but have also shown promise in predicting the structures of protein complexes and even designing novel proteins with desired functions. The impact of these AI-based methods extends beyond computational biology. Experimental structural biologists are now using AI-predicted models to aid in crystallographic phase determination, cryo-EM model building, and NMR structure refinement. This synergy between computational predictions and experimental techniques is accelerating the pace of structural biology research and expanding our understanding of protein function and interactions. Despite these remarkable advances, several challenges remain in the field of protein structure prediction. One major challenge is the accurate prediction of intrinsically disordered proteins or regions, which do not adopt a fixed three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. Another area requiring further development is the prediction of protein dynamics and conformational changes, which are crucial for understanding protein function and regulation. The prediction of protein-protein interactions and the structures of large macromolecular complexes also remains a significant challenge. While progress has been made in this area, as evidenced by recent CAPRI experiments, the accuracy and reliability of complex prediction methods still lag behind those of single-chain prediction. Looking ahead, the integration of AI-based structure prediction methods with other computational and experimental techniques holds great promise for advancing our understanding of protein function and interactions. For example, combining structure prediction with molecular dynamics simulations could provide insights into protein dynamics and conformational changes. Similarly, integrating structure prediction with genomics and evolutionary data could improve our ability to predict the functional consequences of genetic variations. In conclusion, the field of protein structure prediction has made remarkable strides in recent years, driven by advances in AI and deep learning methodologies. The success of methods like AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold has transformed the landscape of structural biology, providing researchers with powerful tools for understanding protein structure and function. As these methods continue to evolve and integrate with other approaches, they are likely to lead to further breakthroughs in our understanding of protein biology and accelerate the pace of discovery in fields ranging from basic science to drug design and development.", "References": [{"title": "Protein structure prediction: advances and challenges", "authors": "Yang Zhang", "journal": "Current Opinion in Structural Biology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "18", "first page": "342", "last page": "348", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sbi.2008.02.004"}, {"title": "The CASP13 experiment and the role of community-wide blind testing in protein structure prediction", "authors": "John Moult, Krzysztof Fidelis, Andriy Kryshtafovych, Torsten Schwede, Anna Tramontano", "journal": "Protein Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1", "last page": "5", "DOI": "10.1002/pro.3445"}, {"title": "Prediction of protein-protein interactions on a genome-wide scale", "authors": "Jianhua Xu, Ming Li, Dongsup Kim, Yixiang Xu", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-S1-S3"}, {"title": "Improved side-chain prediction in proteins using a machine learning approach", "authors": "Philip Bradley, Kira M.
