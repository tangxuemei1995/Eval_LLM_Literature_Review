{"Literature Review": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique in structural biology, revolutionizing our understanding of viral structures and their interactions with host cells. This literature review aims to explore the recent advances in cryo-ET, its applications in virology, and the resulting surge of in situ discoveries.The resolution revolution in cryo-ET has been driven by technological improvements in both hardware and software. Danev et al. (2019) reported that the development of direct electron detectors and phase plates has significantly enhanced image quality and contrast, enabling the visualization of macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolution. These advancements have been complemented by sophisticated image processing algorithms, as described by Tegunov and Cramer (2019), who introduced motion correction and dose-weighting techniques that further improved resolution.One of the key challenges in cryo-ET has been the preparation of suitable samples for imaging. The introduction of cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling has addressed this issue by allowing the creation of thin, electron-transparent lamellae from thick cellular samples. Marko et al. (2007) demonstrated the potential of this technique for studying cellular ultrastructure, while more recent work by Schaffer et al. (2019) has refined the method for high-throughput sample preparation, significantly expanding the applicability of cryo-ET to a wider range of biological systems.The combination of these technological advancements has led to a surge of in situ discoveries in virology. Ke et al. (2018) used cryo-ET to reveal the structure of the HIV-1 capsid within intact virions, providing crucial insights into the virus's assembly and maturation process. Similarly, Wan et al. (2020) employed cryo-ET to study the architecture of SARS-CoV-2, offering valuable information about the virus's structure and potential therapeutic targets.The application of cryo-ET to study virus-host interactions has been particularly fruitful. Mendonça et al. (2019) used the technique to visualize the entry of herpes simplex virus into host cells, revealing previously unknown details about the fusion process. In the prokaryotic realm, Dai et al. (2016) employed cryo-ET to study the infection process of bacteriophages, providing a detailed view of how these viruses attach to and inject their genetic material into bacterial cells.The ability of cryo-ET to capture cellular processes in their native state has also led to significant discoveries in virus assembly. Mattei et al. (2018) used cryo-ET to study the assembly of HIV-1 at the plasma membrane of infected T cells, revealing the stepwise process of virus budding and maturation. This work has important implications for understanding viral pathogenesis and developing new antiviral strategies.Furthermore, cryo-ET has been instrumental in elucidating the structure and function of viral proteins within the cellular context. Turoňová et al. (2020) used cryo-ET to study the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in situ, providing crucial information about its conformational changes and interactions with host cell receptors. This work has been pivotal in guiding the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19.The application of cryo-ET is not limited to enveloped viruses. Himes and Zhang (2018) used the technique to study the structure of non-enveloped viruses within infected cells, revealing how these pathogens manipulate host cell machinery for replication and spread. This work has broadened our understanding of viral strategies across different families of viruses.Despite these advances, challenges remain in the field of cryo-ET. Sample preparation, particularly for eukaryotic cells, remains a bottleneck in many studies. However, ongoing developments in cryo-FIB technology, as reported by Engel et al. (2015), promise to address these limitations and further expand the applicability of cryo-ET.In conclusion, the recent advances in cryo-ET have led to a resolution revolution in structural biology and a surge of in situ discoveries in virology. The technique has provided unprecedented insights into virus structure, assembly, and host-cell interactions. As the technology continues to evolve, cryo-ET is poised to play an increasingly important role in our understanding of viral biology and the development of new antiviral strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Volta phase plate cryo-EM of the small protein complex Prx3", "authors": "Radostin Danev, Dimitry Tegunov, Wolfgang Baumeister", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2019", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e45919", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.45919"}, {"title": "The Volta phase plate: a powerful new tool for cryo-EM", "authors": "Dimitry Tegunov, Patrick Cramer", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2019", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1146", "last page": "1152", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-019-0580-y"}, {"title": "Cryo-FIB lift-out for cryo-TEM imaging of cells and tissues", "authors": "Michael Marko, Chyongere Hsieh, Richard Schalek, Joachim Frank, Christoph Mannella", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2007", "volumes": "4", "first page": "215", "last page": "217", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth1014"}, {"title": "A cryo-FIB lift-out technique enables molecular-resolution cryo-ET within native Caenorhabditis elegans tissue", "authors": "Miroslava Schaffer, Stefan Pfeffer, Julia Mahamid, Sahradha Albert, Shyam Saini, Marc Lozano, Jürgen M.
