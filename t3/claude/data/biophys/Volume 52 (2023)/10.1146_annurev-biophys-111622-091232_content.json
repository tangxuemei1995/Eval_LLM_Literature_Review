{"Literature Review": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a crucial family of membrane proteins that play vital roles in cellular physiology across all domains of life. In humans, these transporters are particularly significant due to their involvement in various physiological processes, including drug resistance and disease pathways. This literature review focuses on the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of these complex molecular machines.Human ABC transporters are encoded by 48 genes, organized into seven distinct families (ABCA to ABCG). Of these, 44 genes in five families encode membrane transporters, while the remaining four genes encode proteins involved in other cellular processes. The diversity of human ABC transporters reflects their wide range of functions, from drug efflux to lipid homeostasis and beyond.Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in our structural understanding of human ABC transporters, largely due to advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This technique has allowed researchers to overcome many of the challenges associated with studying these large, dynamic membrane proteins. As a result, high-resolution structures are now available for multiple members of each of the five families of human ABC transporters.One of the most extensively studied ABC transporters is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the ABCB1 gene. P-gp is notorious for its role in multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Alam et al. (2019) reported a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of human P-gp, revealing details of its drug-binding pocket and providing insights into its mechanism of action. This structure showed how P-gp can accommodate a wide variety of substrates, explaining its broad specificity in drug efflux.The ABCC family, which includes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), has also been the subject of intense structural investigation. Zhang and Chen (2016) determined the structure of human CFTR, shedding light on how mutations in this protein lead to cystic fibrosis. Their work revealed the unique architecture of CFTR among ABC transporters, with its regulatory (R) domain and the presence of a continuous ion pathway.Another medically relevant ABC transporter is the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), encoded by the ABCG2 gene. Taylor et al. (2017) reported the first high-resolution structure of human BCRP, revealing its homodimeric organization and providing insights into its substrate binding and transport mechanism. This structure has important implications for understanding multidrug resistance in cancer and for the development of new therapeutic strategies.The ABCA family, which includes transporters involved in lipid homeostasis, has also seen significant progress in structural elucidation. Qian et al. (2017) determined the structure of ABCA1, a key player in cholesterol efflux and high-density lipoprotein biogenesis. Their work revealed the unique architecture of ABCA1 and provided insights into how it facilitates lipid translocation across the membrane.While structural biology has provided unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture of human ABC transporters, understanding their dynamic behavior remains a challenge. Molecular dynamics simulations have emerged as a powerful tool to complement structural studies. For instance, Moradi and Tajkhorshid (2013) used large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the conformational changes associated with the transport cycle of P-gp.The physiological relevance of human ABC transporters extends beyond their roles in drug resistance and lipid homeostasis. For example, ABCB4 plays a crucial role in bile formation, and its dysfunction leads to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3. Andress et al. (2020) reported the cryo-EM structure of ABCB4, providing insights into its unique ability to flip phosphatidylcholine across the membrane.Despite these advances, many questions remain unanswered. The exact coupling mechanism between ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation is still debated for many ABC transporters. Moreover, the regulation of these transporters in vivo, including their interactions with other cellular components, is not fully understood.Looking forward, integrating structural information with functional and physiological data will be crucial for a comprehensive understanding of human ABC transporters. New techniques, such as single-molecule studies and in-cell structural biology, promise to bridge the gap between in vitro observations and physiological reality.In conclusion, recent advances in structural biology, particularly cryo-EM, have revolutionized our understanding of human ABC transporters. These studies have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture and mechanisms of these important membrane proteins. However, many challenges remain, including understanding the dynamic aspects of transporter function and translating structural insights into therapeutic strategies. As research in this field continues to evolve, we can expect further breakthroughs that will enhance our ability to modulate ABC transporter function for therapeutic benefit.", "References": [{"title": "Structure of the human multidrug transporter ABCG2", "authors": "Nicholas M.
