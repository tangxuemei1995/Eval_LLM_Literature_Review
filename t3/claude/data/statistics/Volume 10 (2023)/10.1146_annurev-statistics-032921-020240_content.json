{"Literature Review": "Quantile forecasting has emerged as a crucial tool in various fields, offering a more comprehensive view of predictive distributions beyond point estimates. This literature review explores the current state of research on model diagnostics and forecast evaluation for quantiles, highlighting key concepts, methodologies, and applications.Quantile regression, introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978), has become a fundamental technique in quantile forecasting. It allows for the estimation of conditional quantiles, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between variables across different parts of the distribution. Since its inception, numerous studies have extended and applied this method in various contexts.The concept of calibration is central to evaluating quantile forecasts. Gneiting et al. (2007) distinguish between unconditional and conditional calibration. Unconditional calibration, often referred to as coverage, assesses whether the proportion of observations falling below a given quantile forecast matches the nominal probability. This concept aligns with classical coverage criteria and has been widely used in forecast evaluation (Christoffersen, 1998).Conditional calibration, a stronger notion, requires that the conditional distribution of the observations, given the forecasts, matches the nominal probabilities. This concept has gained increasing attention in recent years. Bentzien and Friederichs (2014) introduced quantile reliability diagrams as a visual tool for assessing conditional calibration, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of forecast performance.Scoring functions play a crucial role in comparative assessment and ranking of quantile forecasts. Gneiting and Raftery (2007) formalized the concept of consistent scoring functions, which ensure that the expected score is optimized when the forecasted quantiles coincide with the true quantiles of the data-generating process. The asymmetric piecewise linear score, also known as the pinball loss, has become a widely used consistent scoring function for quantile forecasts (Koenker and Machado, 1999).Murphy diagrams, introduced by Ehm et al. (2016), offer a graphical tool for comparing quantile forecasts across multiple quantile levels simultaneously. These diagrams provide a comprehensive view of forecast performance and have been applied in various fields, including meteorology and finance.The coefficient of determination (R²) and skill scores have been adapted for quantile regression and forecasting. Koenker and Machado (1999) proposed a pseudo-R² measure for quantile regression, while Friederichs and Thorarinsdottir (2012) developed quantile verification skill scores for assessing the relative performance of quantile forecasts.Recent applications of quantile forecasting techniques have demonstrated their utility in diverse domains. In economics, Engel's food expenditure data has been a classic dataset for illustrating quantile regression techniques (Koenker and Hallock, 2001). The Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (Hong et al., 2016) showcased the importance of probabilistic forecasting, including quantile forecasts, in the energy sector.The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the significance of quantile forecasting in public health. The US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (Cramer et al., 2022) aggregates and evaluates quantile forecasts from multiple models, providing crucial information for decision-makers and demonstrating the practical importance of robust forecast evaluation techniques.Challenges and future directions in quantile forecast evaluation include addressing issues of model uncertainty and forecast combination. Techniques for combining quantile forecasts have been proposed (Vincentini and Meligkotsidou, 2013), but further research is needed to develop optimal combination methods and evaluate their performance.In conclusion, model diagnostics and forecast evaluation for quantiles have seen significant advancements in recent years. The development of sophisticated evaluation tools, such as quantile reliability diagrams and Murphy diagrams, alongside the refinement of scoring functions and skill scores, has enhanced our ability to assess and compare quantile forecasts. As quantile forecasting continues to find applications in diverse fields, ongoing research in this area remains crucial for improving decision-making under uncertainty.", "References": [{"title": "Regression Quantiles", "authors": "Roger Koenker, Gilbert Bassett", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "1978", "volumes": "46", "first page": "33", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.2307/1913643"}, {"title": "Probabilistic Forecasts, Calibration and Sharpness", "authors": "Tilmann Gneiting, Fadoua Balabdaoui, Adrian E.
