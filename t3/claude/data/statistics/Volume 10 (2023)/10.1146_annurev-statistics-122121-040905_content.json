{"Literature Review": "Simulation-based Bayesian analysis has revolutionized the field of statistics and data science over the past few decades, providing powerful tools for complex model estimation and inference. This literature review traces the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and their implementation in statistical software packages, highlighting their impact on applied Bayesian modeling across various scientific domains.The advent of Gibbs sampling in the late 1980s marked a significant milestone in Bayesian computation. Gelfand and Smith (1990) introduced Gibbs sampling as an efficient method for drawing samples from multivariate distributions, paving the way for more complex Bayesian analyses. This approach quickly gained traction due to its ability to handle high-dimensional problems and its relative ease of implementation.Building upon Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings algorithms emerged as a more flexible class of MCMC methods. Chib and Greenberg (1995) provided a comprehensive review of these algorithms, demonstrating their wide applicability in Bayesian inference. These methods allowed researchers to sample from posterior distributions that were previously intractable, opening up new avenues for statistical modeling.As MCMC methods evolved, so did the software packages designed to implement them. The BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) project, initiated by Spiegelhalter et al. (1996), was one of the first widely-used software packages for Bayesian analysis. BUGS provided a user-friendly interface for specifying complex hierarchical models and automatically generating MCMC algorithms for posterior inference.The success of BUGS inspired the development of other software packages, such as JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) by Plummer (2003). JAGS offered similar functionality to BUGS but with improved performance and a more modular design, making it easier to extend and customize.While MCMC methods continued to dominate Bayesian computation, alternative approaches also emerged. Rue et al. (2009) introduced Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), a deterministic method for approximate Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models. INLA provided a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC for certain classes of models, particularly in spatial statistics and time series analysis.The next major advancement in MCMC methods came with the introduction of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and its variants. Neal (2011) provided a comprehensive review of HMC, highlighting its ability to efficiently explore high-dimensional posterior distributions. HMC leverages gradient information to propose more intelligent moves in the parameter space, resulting in faster convergence and better mixing compared to traditional MCMC methods.The development of HMC led to the creation of Stan, a probabilistic programming language and software package introduced by Carpenter et al. (2017). Stan implemented an adaptive variant of HMC called the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which automatically tuned the algorithm's parameters. Stan's combination of a flexible modeling language and efficient sampling algorithms quickly made it a popular choice for applied Bayesian analysis across various fields.Recent years have seen the emergence of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) as a promising class of MCMC methods. Bierkens et al. (2018) introduced the Zig-Zag sampler, a continuous-time MCMC algorithm based on PDMPs. These methods offer potential advantages in terms of scalability and parallelization, particularly for big data applications.The evolution of MCMC methods and their implementation in statistical software has had a profound impact on applied Bayesian modeling. Gelman et al. (2013) provided a comprehensive overview of Bayesian data analysis, showcasing the wide range of applications enabled by these computational advances. From ecology to epidemiology, from finance to psychology, Bayesian methods have found applications in diverse scientific domains.As research into new MCMC methods continues, future generations of software are likely to incorporate these advancements. The challenge lies in balancing the complexity of these algorithms with user-friendly interfaces that hide the technical details from applied researchers. Betancourt (2017) emphasized the importance of diagnostics and visualization tools in MCMC software, highlighting the need for robust and interpretable results.In conclusion, the field of simulation-based Bayesian analysis has seen remarkable progress over the past few decades, driven by advances in MCMC methods and their implementation in statistical software. These developments have democratized Bayesian inference, making it accessible to researchers across various disciplines. As new methods continue to emerge, the future of Bayesian computation looks promising, with the potential for even more powerful and efficient tools for statistical modeling and inference.", "References": [{"title": "Sampling-based approaches to calculating marginal densities", "authors": "Alan E.
