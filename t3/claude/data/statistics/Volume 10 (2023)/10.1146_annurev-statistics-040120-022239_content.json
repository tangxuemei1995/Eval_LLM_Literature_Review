{"Literature Review": "The field of high-dimensional data analysis has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing availability of complex datasets across various disciplines. This literature review focuses on the progress and applications of high-dimensional bootstrap methods, which have emerged as powerful tools for statistical inference in high-dimensional settings.High-dimensional central limit theorems (CLTs) form the theoretical foundation for bootstrap methods in high-dimensional spaces. Chernozhukov et al. (2017) provided a comprehensive framework for high-dimensional CLTs, establishing asymptotic normality for the distribution of sample mean vectors over rectangles. Their work extended classical CLT results to high-dimensional settings, paving the way for bootstrap consistency in these contexts.Bootstrap consistency in high dimensions has been a subject of intense research. Mammen (1993) introduced the concept of bootstrap consistency for high-dimensional data, demonstrating that the bootstrap can approximate the distribution of certain statistics even as the dimension grows with the sample size. Building on this work, Belloni et al. (2015) established bootstrap consistency for high-dimensional inference in sparse linear models, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of bootstrap methods in modern high-dimensional problems.The multiplier bootstrap, a variant of the traditional bootstrap, has gained prominence in high-dimensional settings due to its computational efficiency and theoretical properties. Chernozhukov et al. (2013) developed the Gaussian multiplier bootstrap for high-dimensional inference, showing its validity for approximating the distribution of suprema of empirical processes. This method has since been widely adopted in various high-dimensional inference problems.One key application of high-dimensional bootstrap is the construction of simultaneous confidence sets for high-dimensional vector parameters. Belloni et al. (2018) proposed a multiplier bootstrap method for constructing uniform confidence bands in high-dimensional linear models, allowing for valid inference on the entire parameter vector. This approach has been particularly useful in econometrics and biostatistics, where simultaneous inference on multiple parameters is often required.Multiple hypothesis testing is another area where high-dimensional bootstrap methods have made significant contributions. Romano and Wolf (2005) introduced a step-down procedure based on the bootstrap for controlling the familywise error rate in multiple testing problems. Their method has been extended to high-dimensional settings by Chernozhukov et al. (2016), who developed a multiplier bootstrap approach for controlling the false discovery rate in high-dimensional regression models.Post-selection inference has emerged as a critical challenge in high-dimensional statistics, addressing the issue of valid inference after model selection. Dezeure et al. (2017) proposed a bootstrap-based method for post-selection inference in high-dimensional linear models, providing valid confidence intervals for selected parameters. Their approach has been influential in developing robust inference procedures in the presence of model selection.The application of high-dimensional bootstrap methods to partially identified parameters has also gained attention. Chernozhukov et al. (2007) developed a bootstrap-based approach for constructing confidence sets for partially identified parameters in moment inequality models. This work has been extended to high-dimensional settings by Andrews and Shi (2013), who proposed a bootstrap method for inference on intersection bounds in high-dimensional partially identified models.In the field of policy evaluation, high-dimensional bootstrap methods have been applied to inference on best policies. Kitagawa and Tetenov (2018) developed a bootstrap-based approach for constructing confidence sets for optimal treatment assignment rules in high-dimensional settings. Their method allows for valid inference on the best policy in the presence of many covariates, addressing a crucial challenge in personalized medicine and targeted interventions.While significant progress has been made in high-dimensional bootstrap methods, several areas warrant further research. One direction is the development of bootstrap methods for non-Gaussian high-dimensional data, as many existing results rely on Gaussian approximations. Additionally, the application of high-dimensional bootstrap to more complex data structures, such as network data or functional data, presents exciting opportunities for future research.In conclusion, high-dimensional bootstrap methods have emerged as powerful tools for statistical inference in modern data analysis. From theoretical foundations in high-dimensional CLTs to practical applications in simultaneous inference, multiple testing, and policy evaluation, these methods have significantly advanced our ability to draw valid conclusions from complex, high-dimensional datasets. As the field continues to evolve, high-dimensional bootstrap methods are likely to play an increasingly important role in addressing the statistical challenges posed by big data across various scientific disciplines.", "References": [{"title": "High-Dimensional Central Limit Theorems", "authors": "Victor Chernozhukov, Denis Chetverikov, Kengo Kato", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2017", "volumes": "112", "first page": "1161", "last page": "1179", "DOI": "10.1080/01621459.2016.1256340"}, {"title": "Bootstrapping High-Dimensional Statistical Models", "authors": "Enno Mammen", "journal": "The Annals of Statistics", "year": "1993", "volumes": "21", "first page": "255", "last page": "285", "DOI": "10.1214/aos/1176349025"}, {"title": "Uniform Post-Selection Inference for Least Absolute Deviation Regression and Other Z-Estimation Problems", "authors": "Alexandre Belloni, Victor Chernozhukov, Kengo Kato", "journal": "Biometrika", "year": "2015", "volumes": "102", "first page": "77", "last page": "94", "DOI": "10.1093/biomet/asu056"}, {"title": "Gaussian Approximations and Multiplier Bootstrap for Maxima of Sums of High-Dimensional Random Vectors", "authors": "Victor Chernozhukov, Denis Chetverikov, Kengo Kato", "journal": "The Annals of Statistics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "41", "first page": "2786", "last page": "2819", "DOI": "10.1214/13-AOS1161"}, {"title": "Uniform Inference in High-Dimensional Dynamic Panel Data Models with Approximately Sparse Fixed Effects", "authors": "Alexandre Belloni, Victor Chernozhukov, Christian Hansen, Damian Kozbur", "journal": "Econometric Theory", "year": "2018", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1", "last page": "44", "DOI": "10.1017/S0266466617000305"}, {"title": "Stepwise Multiple Testing as Formalized Data Snooping", "authors": "Joseph P.
