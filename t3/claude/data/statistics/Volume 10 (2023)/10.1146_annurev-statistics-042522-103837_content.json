{"Literature Review": "The concepts of generalizability and transportability have gained significant attention in the field of causal inference, as researchers strive to extend the applicability of their findings beyond the confines of their study populations. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on these crucial aspects of external validity, exploring their implications for both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies.Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a study sample can be applied to the broader target population from which the sample was drawn. Transportability, on the other hand, involves the application of causal effects estimated in one population to a different target population. Both concepts are fundamental to ensuring that research findings have practical relevance and can inform policy decisions effectively.The importance of generalizability and transportability stems from the recognition that internal validity alone is insufficient for making robust causal inferences about target populations. As Stuart et al. (2011) argue, even well-designed RCTs may have limited external validity if the study sample differs systematically from the target population. This limitation has led to increased interest in methods for assessing and improving the generalizability of research findings.One approach to addressing generalizability is through the use of propensity score methods. Westreich et al. (2017) propose a framework for using propensity scores to assess and improve generalizability in epidemiological studies. Their method involves estimating the probability of selection into the study sample and using these probabilities to weight the analysis, thereby adjusting for differences between the sample and target population.In the context of RCTs, Dahabreh et al. (2019) introduce a method for generalizing trial results to target populations using propensity score-based weighting. Their approach combines data from the trial and a sample from the target population to estimate population average treatment effects, providing a valuable tool for researchers seeking to extend the applicability of their findings.Transportability presents additional challenges, as it involves extrapolating causal effects across potentially different populations. Pearl and Bareinboim (2014) provide a formal framework for transportability, introducing graphical criteria and algorithmic methods for determining when and how causal effects can be transported from one population to another. Their work has been influential in developing a rigorous approach to assessing the feasibility of transporting causal effects.Building on this foundation, Rudolph and van der Laan (2017) propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) approach for transporting causal effects. Their method allows for the incorporation of individual-level data from both the source and target populations, providing a flexible framework for addressing transportability in various settings.The assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity is crucial for both generalizability and transportability. Kern et al. (2016) introduce a framework for detecting and characterizing treatment effect heterogeneity in RCTs, emphasizing the importance of pre-specifying potential effect modifiers and using appropriate statistical methods to assess heterogeneity.In observational studies, addressing confounding remains a primary concern for internal validity. However, recent work has highlighted the interconnected nature of internal and external validity. VanderWeele and Ding (2017) propose sensitivity analysis techniques for assessing the impact of unmeasured confounding on both internal and external validity, providing researchers with tools to evaluate the robustness of their findings.The integration of data from multiple sources has emerged as a promising approach to improving both generalizability and transportability. Dahabreh et al. (2020) present a framework for combining data from RCTs and observational studies to estimate population average treatment effects. Their method leverages the strengths of both study designs, potentially offering more robust and generalizable estimates of causal effects.Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the practical implementation of generalizability and transportability methods. Lesko et al. (2017) highlight the importance of collecting appropriate data on sample selection and population characteristics to enable the application of these methods. They argue for greater emphasis on external validity considerations in the design and reporting of epidemiological studies.In conclusion, the literature on generalizability and transportability has made significant strides in recent years, offering researchers a range of tools and methods for addressing external validity concerns. As the field continues to evolve, integrating these considerations into study design, analysis, and reporting will be crucial for enhancing the relevance and impact of causal inference research across various domains.", "References": [{"title": "Generalizability of Study Results: A Challenge for Epidemiology and Clinical Research", "authors": "Elizabeth A.
