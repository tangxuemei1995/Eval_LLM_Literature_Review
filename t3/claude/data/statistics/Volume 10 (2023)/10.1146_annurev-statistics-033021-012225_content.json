{"Literature Review": "The field of exoplanet detection has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with various observational techniques contributing to our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system. Among these methods, radial velocity (RV) measurements have emerged as a powerful tool for detecting and characterizing exoplanets. This literature review focuses on the statistical methods employed in exoplanet detection using RV data, highlighting the challenges and advancements in this rapidly evolving field.Radial velocity measurements rely on detecting the subtle Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets. This technique has been instrumental in discovering numerous exoplanets and providing crucial information about their masses and orbital properties [1]. However, the detection of Earth-like planets in habitable zones remains a significant challenge due to the small amplitude of their RV signals, typically on the order of centimeters per second [2].One of the primary challenges in RV exoplanet detection is dealing with complex, temporally correlated noise sources. These include both instrumental effects and astrophysical signals, such as stellar activity, which can mimic or mask planetary signals [3]. Traditional methods often assume white noise in RV data, leading to potential false positives or missed detections. To address this issue, researchers have developed various approaches to model and account for correlated noise.Gaussian Process (GP) regression has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling correlated noise in RV data [4]. GPs provide a flexible framework for capturing complex temporal correlations and have been successfully applied to separate planetary signals from stellar activity. However, the computational complexity of GP models can be a limiting factor, especially for large datasets or when exploring multiple potential planetary signals.Another approach to dealing with correlated noise is the use of moving average (MA) models. Tuomi et al. [5] introduced the application of first-order MA models to RV data analysis, demonstrating improved sensitivity to low-amplitude signals. This method has since been extended to higher-order MA models and combined with other noise modeling techniques to enhance exoplanet detection capabilities [6].The exploration of large parameter spaces in RV models presents another significant challenge. Traditional methods like grid searches or gradient-based optimization techniques can be computationally expensive and may fail to explore the full parameter space effectively. To address this, researchers have turned to advanced Bayesian inference techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [7].Nested sampling algorithms, such as MultiNest, have gained popularity in exoplanet detection due to their ability to efficiently explore complex parameter spaces and provide robust estimates of model evidences [8]. These methods allow for simultaneous parameter estimation and model comparison, enabling researchers to evaluate the relative probabilities of different planetary system configurations.The issue of model comparison is particularly crucial in RV exoplanet detection, as researchers must often choose between competing models with different numbers of planets or noise components. Bayesian model comparison techniques, such as the Bayes factor, provide a rigorous framework for assessing the relative merits of different models [9]. However, care must be taken to account for potential model misspecification, which can lead to biased results.Recent advancements in statistical methods for RV exoplanet detection have focused on developing more sophisticated noise models and improving computational efficiency. For example, Rajpaul et al. [10] introduced a novel framework for modeling stellar activity using a physically motivated basis set, allowing for more accurate separation of planetary and stellar signals. Additionally, the development of efficient sampling algorithms and the use of parallel computing techniques have enabled the analysis of larger datasets and more complex models.As the field of exoplanet detection continues to evolve, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary collaboration between astronomers, statisticians, and computer scientists. The integration of machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and Gaussian process regression, with traditional statistical methods shows promise for improving the sensitivity and reliability of exoplanet detection algorithms.In conclusion, the statistical methods for exoplanet detection with radial velocities have made significant strides in recent years, addressing challenges related to correlated noise, parameter space exploration, and model comparison. However, there remains ample room for improvement, particularly in the detection of Earth-like planets in habitable zones. Future advancements in this field will likely involve the development of more sophisticated noise models, improved computational techniques, and the integration of machine learning approaches to push the boundaries of exoplanet detection and characterization.", "References": [{"title": "The Exoplanet Handbook", "authors": "Michael Perryman", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/9781108304160"}, {"title": "Radial Velocity Techniques for Exoplanets", "authors": "Sharon X.
