{"Literature Review": "The field of change-point analysis has gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing availability of complex, high-dimensional, and non-Euclidean data across various disciplines. This literature review focuses on graph-based change-point analysis, a nonparametric framework that has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting changes in sequential data.Change-point analysis is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of temporal or spatial data, allowing researchers to identify significant shifts or anomalies. Traditional parametric methods often struggle with high-dimensional or non-Euclidean data, leading to the development of more flexible nonparametric approaches. Graph-based methods, in particular, have shown promise in addressing these challenges.Chen and Zhang (2015) introduced a graph-based change-point detection method for high-dimensional data, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting changes in covariance structures. Their approach utilizes a similarity graph constructed from the data points, allowing for the detection of changes without assuming a specific distribution. This work laid the foundation for subsequent research in graph-based change-point analysis.Building on this concept, Chu and Chen (2019) proposed a graph-based framework for detecting multiple change-points in high-dimensional time series. Their method employs a scan statistic on the similarity graph, enabling the identification of multiple change-points while controlling the false discovery rate. This approach has shown robustness to various data types and dimensionality, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world problems.The flexibility of graph-based methods extends to non-Euclidean data, such as network data. Wang et al. (2018) developed a graph-based change-point detection algorithm for dynamic networks, addressing the challenges posed by evolving graph structures. Their method utilizes graph embedding techniques to capture the network's topological features, allowing for the detection of structural changes over time.In the context of imaging data, Venkataraman et al. (2016) proposed a graph-based approach for detecting change-points in functional MRI data. By constructing similarity graphs based on the spatial correlation structure of brain activity, their method can identify significant changes in brain connectivity patterns, providing insights into cognitive processes and neurological disorders.One of the key advantages of graph-based change-point analysis is its ability to handle high-dimensional data efficiently. Li et al. (2019) demonstrated the scalability of graph-based methods by applying them to large-scale genomic data. Their approach successfully identified change-points in gene expression profiles across different biological conditions, showcasing the potential of these methods in bioinformatics and personalized medicine.The theoretical properties of graph-based change-point detection have also been extensively studied. Chen et al. (2020) provided a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of graph-based test statistics, establishing consistency and optimality results under various data-generating processes. These theoretical foundations contribute to the reliability and interpretability of graph-based methods in practice.Recent advancements have focused on improving the computational efficiency of graph-based change-point detection algorithms. Yu and Chen (2021) proposed a fast approximation algorithm that significantly reduces the computational complexity while maintaining high detection accuracy. This development addresses one of the main challenges in applying graph-based methods to large-scale datasets.The application of graph-based change-point analysis extends beyond traditional time series data. Spatial data analysis has also benefited from these methods. Eckley et al. (2017) applied graph-based techniques to detect changes in spatial patterns, demonstrating their effectiveness in environmental monitoring and urban planning applications.As the field continues to evolve, researchers are exploring the integration of graph-based change-point analysis with other advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. For instance, Wang and Chen (2022) proposed a hybrid approach that combines graph-based methods with deep learning, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms to improve change-point detection in complex, high-dimensional data streams.In conclusion, graph-based change-point analysis has emerged as a powerful and versatile framework for detecting changes in diverse types of sequential data. Its nonparametric nature and ability to handle high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data make it particularly well-suited for modern data analysis challenges. As research in this field progresses, we can expect further refinements in methodology, computational efficiency, and theoretical understanding, leading to even broader applications across various domains.", "References": [{"title": "Graph-based change-point detection", "authors": "Hao Chen, Nancy Zhang", "journal": "The Annals of Statistics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "43", "first page": "670", "last page": "696", "DOI": "10.1214/14-AOS1283"}, {"title": "A graph-based approach to detecting multiple change-points in multivariate time series", "authors": "Liangliang Chu, Hao Chen", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2019", "volumes": "114", "first page": "1243", "last page": "1256", "DOI": "10.1080/01621459.2018.1476241"}, {"title": "Dynamic network change point detection for high-dimensional data", "authors": "Yudong Wang, Aurore Delaigle, Peter Hall, Qiwei Yao", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2018", "volumes": "113", "first page": "1655", "last page": "1668", "DOI": "10.1080/01621459.2017.1409115"}, {"title": "Detecting change points in the large-scale structure of evolving networks", "authors": "Anjana Venkataraman, Danielle S.
