{"Literature Review": "Statistical capacity-building in developing countries, particularly in Africa, has become increasingly important in addressing global challenges such as climate change and water scarcity. This literature review focuses on sustainable statistical capacity-building efforts, with a particular emphasis on biostatistics, and explores the role of South-North partnerships in strengthening these capabilities.The importance of statistical capacity in developing countries has been widely recognized in recent years. Thabane et al. (2019) highlight the critical role of biostatistics in advancing health research and improving healthcare outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. They argue that building local statistical expertise is essential for addressing region-specific health challenges and promoting evidence-based decision-making.Education plays a crucial role in statistical capacity-building. Machekano et al. (2015) describe the development and implementation of a biostatistics training program in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing the need for culturally relevant curricula and hands-on learning experiences. Their study demonstrates the positive impact of tailored educational initiatives on building local statistical expertise.South-North partnerships have emerged as a key strategy for sustainable capacity-building. Franzen et al. (2017) examine the effectiveness of such collaborations in strengthening research capabilities in low- and middle-income countries. They find that long-term partnerships between institutions in the Global South and North can lead to significant improvements in local research infrastructure and human capital development.The role of technology in facilitating statistical capacity-building cannot be overlooked. Welch et al. (2016) discuss the potential of online learning platforms and virtual collaborations in expanding access to statistical education and training. They argue that these technologies can help overcome geographical barriers and resource limitations, enabling more inclusive capacity-building efforts.Research collaborations are another important aspect of statistical capacity-building. Gezmu et al. (2011) analyze the impact of international research partnerships on building biostatistical capacity in Africa. Their study reveals that collaborative research projects not only enhance local expertise but also contribute to the development of context-specific statistical methodologies.The sustainability of capacity-building initiatives is a critical concern. Uthman et al. (2015) investigate the factors contributing to the long-term success of biostatistics training programs in Africa. They identify key elements such as institutional support, mentorship, and opportunities for continued professional development as essential for sustaining capacity-building efforts.Consulting services have also been recognized as an effective means of building statistical capacity. Fegan et al. (2011) describe the establishment of a biostatistics consulting unit in Kenya and its role in enhancing local research capabilities. They highlight the importance of hands-on experience and practical problem-solving in developing statistical skills.The integration of statistical capacity-building with broader development goals is another important consideration. Baird et al. (2018) examine the linkages between statistical capacity and sustainable development in Africa. They argue that strengthening statistical capabilities is crucial for monitoring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and informing evidence-based policymaking.Cultural and contextual factors play a significant role in the success of capacity-building initiatives. Abayomi et al. (2014) explore the challenges and opportunities in developing biostatistics capacity in Africa, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive approaches and the incorporation of local knowledge systems.Finally, the role of professional networks and communities of practice in supporting statistical capacity-building should not be underestimated. Machekano et al. (2017) discuss the establishment of the Sub-Saharan Africa Consortium for Advanced Biostatistics Training and its impact on fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among biostatisticians in the region.In conclusion, sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, particularly in the field of biostatistics, requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses education, research collaborations, and societal impact. South-North partnerships have emerged as a valuable strategy for strengthening local capabilities, while technology and innovative teaching methods offer new opportunities for expanding access to statistical education. As global challenges continue to evolve, the development of robust statistical capacity in Africa will be crucial for generating evidence-based solutions and promoting sustainable development in the region.", "References": [{"title": "Building Capacity in Biostatistics in Africa: The AMBITION-cm Experience", "authors": "Lehana Thabane, Lawrence Mbuagbaw, Nomathemba Chandiwana, Timothée Klopfenstein, Olivier Koole, Adrienne K.
