{"Literature Review": "The field of integer-valued data modeling has seen significant growth and development in recent years, driven by the increasing need to analyze discrete data in various domains. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the models and approaches used for integer data, with a focus on both univariate distributions and time-series models.Univariate distributions for integer data form the foundation of many statistical analyses. The Poisson distribution has long been a cornerstone in modeling count data, but its assumption of equidispersion (equal mean and variance) is often violated in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, researchers have proposed several alternatives. The negative binomial distribution, for instance, allows for overdispersion and has found wide application in ecology and epidemiology (Hilbe, 2011). Another important distribution in this context is the Skellam distribution, which models the difference between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables. Karlis and Ntzoufras (2006) demonstrated its utility in modeling goal differences in soccer matches.For data that can take both positive and negative integer values, the discrete Laplace distribution has gained attention. Inusah and Kozubowski (2006) introduced this distribution and showed its applicability in modeling financial price changes. The discrete normal distribution, proposed by Roy (2003), provides another option for symmetric integer-valued data and has been applied in various fields, including psychology and social sciences.Time-series models for integer-valued data have also seen significant advancements. The Integer-valued Autoregressive (INAR) model, introduced by Al-Osh and Alzaid (1987), has been a fundamental approach in this area. It uses a thinning operator to generate autocorrelated count data. Building on this concept, McKenzie (1988) developed the Integer-valued Moving Average (INMA) model, which incorporates moving average components.The Poisson Autoregressive (PAR) model, proposed by Fokianos et al. (2009), offers an alternative approach to modeling count time series. This model assumes a Poisson distribution for the observations, with the mean following an autoregressive process. It has found applications in various fields, including finance and epidemiology.For modeling overdispersed count time series, the Negative Binomial Autoregressive (NBAR) model has been developed. Zhu (2011) demonstrated its effectiveness in analyzing financial transaction data, where overdispersion is common.In recent years, there has been growing interest in models that can handle both positive and negative integer-valued time series. The Integer-valued GARCH (INGARCH) model, introduced by Ferland et al. (2006), extends the concept of GARCH models to the integer domain. This model has been particularly useful in analyzing financial data, such as price changes in tick-by-tick data.The Skellam INGARCH model, proposed by Koopman et al. (2014), combines the Skellam distribution with the INGARCH framework. This model has shown promise in analyzing goal difference data in sports, as well as in modeling discrete price changes in high-frequency financial data.Another important development in this field is the Integer-valued Exponential Autoregressive (INEAR) model, introduced by Kachour and Yao (2009). This model allows for more flexible autocorrelation structures and has been applied to various types of count data, including crime statistics and disease incidence data.For multivariate integer-valued time series, several models have been proposed. The Multivariate Integer-valued Autoregressive (MINAR) model, developed by Latour (1997), extends the INAR concept to multiple dimensions. This model has been applied in various fields, including ecology and epidemiology, where multiple interrelated count time series are often observed.The Vector Integer-valued Autoregressive (VINAR) model, introduced by Pedeli and Karlis (2013), provides another approach to modeling multivariate count time series. This model allows for more complex dependency structures between the different series and has been used in analyzing economic and financial data.In conclusion, the field of integer-valued data modeling has seen significant advancements in recent years, with a wide range of models now available for both univariate and time-series data. These models have found applications in diverse fields, including finance, sports analytics, epidemiology, and social sciences. As the volume and complexity of integer-valued data continue to grow, further developments in this area are expected, particularly in handling high-dimensional data and incorporating machine learning techniques.", "References": [{"title": "Negative Binomial Regression", "authors": "Joseph M.
