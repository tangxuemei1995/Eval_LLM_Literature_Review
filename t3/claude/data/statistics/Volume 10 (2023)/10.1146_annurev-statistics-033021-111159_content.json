{"Literature Review": "The three-decision framework for significance testing, as proposed by John Tukey, offers a compelling alternative to the widely used null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach. This literature review explores the development, applications, and implications of the three-decision method in statistical analysis.The origins of the three-decision framework can be traced back to Tukey's work in the 1960s, where he sought to address the limitations of traditional binary decision-making in hypothesis testing (Tukey, 1960). Unlike NHST, which forces researchers to either reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis, the three-decision method introduces a third option: asserting nothing about the parameter of interest. This approach aligns more closely with the nuanced nature of scientific inquiry and the inherent uncertainty in statistical inference.One of the key advantages of the three-decision framework is its ability to mitigate the risk of false positives and negatives. Lehmann (1957) demonstrated that this approach can lead to more robust statistical inferences, particularly in cases where the effect size is small or the sample size is limited. Building on this work, Berger and Delampady (1987) showed that the three-decision method can provide a more accurate representation of the uncertainty associated with statistical estimates.The three-decision framework has found applications across various fields of study. In medical research, Spiegelhalter et al. (1994) applied this approach to clinical trials, demonstrating its utility in balancing the risks of Type I and Type II errors when making decisions about treatment efficacy. Similarly, in environmental science, Mapstone (1995) used the three-decision method to develop more effective monitoring strategies for detecting ecological changes.One of the most significant contributions of the three-decision framework is its ability to bridge the gap between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference. Berger (2003) showed that the three-decision method can be interpreted from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives, providing a unifying framework for these often-competing statistical paradigms. This integration has led to the development of novel statistical tools that combine the strengths of both approaches.The three-decision framework has also been instrumental in addressing some of the long-standing criticisms of p-values and significance testing. Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000) demonstrated how the three-decision approach can help mitigate the problem of p-hacking and reduce the likelihood of false discoveries in multiple comparisons. Furthermore, Storey (2002) used the three-decision framework to develop more powerful methods for controlling the false discovery rate in large-scale hypothesis testing scenarios.In recent years, there has been growing interest in applying the three-decision framework to complex statistical problems. For instance, Efron (2010) extended the approach to high-dimensional settings, showing how it can be used to improve the accuracy of gene expression studies and other large-scale genomic analyses. Similarly, Müller et al. (2007) demonstrated the utility of the three-decision method in Bayesian decision theory, particularly for problems involving multiple objectives or constraints.Despite its many advantages, the adoption of the three-decision framework in practice has been relatively slow. This can be attributed, in part, to the entrenched nature of NHST in many scientific disciplines and the lack of readily available software tools for implementing three-decision methods. However, recent efforts by statisticians and methodologists have sought to address these barriers. For example, Kruschke (2018) has developed user-friendly software packages that implement three-decision methods within a Bayesian framework, making these techniques more accessible to researchers across various fields.As the limitations of traditional NHST become increasingly apparent, the three-decision framework offers a promising alternative for improving the rigor and reliability of statistical inference. By providing a more nuanced approach to hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, this method has the potential to enhance the quality of scientific research and reduce the prevalence of false discoveries in the literature. Future research in this area should focus on developing more sophisticated three-decision methods for complex statistical problems, as well as on promoting the wider adoption of these techniques in applied research settings.", "References": [{"title": "The future of data analysis", "authors": "John W.
