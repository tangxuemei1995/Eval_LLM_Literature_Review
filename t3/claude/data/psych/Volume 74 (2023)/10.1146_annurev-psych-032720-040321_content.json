{"Literature Review": "Pride, a complex self-conscious emotion, has emerged as a critical factor in social rank attainment and interpersonal relationships across human societies. This literature review explores the multifaceted nature of pride, its distinct facets, and its role in shaping social hierarchies and individual behavior.Pride has been conceptualized as a dual-faceted emotion, comprising authentic and hubristic pride (Tracy & Robins, 2007). Authentic pride is characterized by feelings of accomplishment, confidence, and self-worth based on specific achievements. In contrast, hubristic pride involves feelings of arrogance, conceit, and inflated self-importance. This distinction has been supported by numerous studies, including factor analyses and behavioral experiments (Cheng et al., 2010).The expression of pride appears to be a human universal, recognized across diverse cultures. Shariff and Tracy (2009) demonstrated that the nonverbal expression of pride, characterized by an expanded posture, tilted head, and arms akimbo or raised above the head, is reliably identified in both Western and non-Western populations. This cross-cultural recognition suggests that pride may have evolved as an adaptive mechanism for navigating social hierarchies.Research has shown that authentic and hubristic pride are associated with distinct personality traits and behavioral outcomes. Authentic pride is positively correlated with prosocial traits such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, and self-esteem (Tracy et al., 2009). Individuals experiencing authentic pride are more likely to engage in cooperative behaviors and contribute to group success. In contrast, hubristic pride is associated with narcissism, aggression, and antisocial tendencies (Tracy et al., 2009).The two facets of pride appear to contribute to different strategies for attaining social rank. Cheng et al. (2013) proposed that authentic pride promotes a prestige-based strategy, where individuals gain respect and admiration through their skills, knowledge, and prosocial behaviors. This strategy is characterized by the voluntary conferral of status from others based on perceived merit. On the other hand, hubristic pride is associated with a dominance-based strategy, where individuals attain rank through intimidation, coercion, and the induction of fear in others (Cheng et al., 2013).Both prestige and dominance have been shown to be effective routes to power and influence in human groups, albeit through different mechanisms. Cheng et al. (2013) found that individuals employing either strategy could achieve high social rank, but prestige-based strategies were associated with greater likability and authentic pride, while dominance-based strategies were linked to perceived power and hubristic pride.The adaptive value of pride in social rank attainment is further supported by research on its motivational effects. Williams and DeSteno (2008) demonstrated that pride serves as a motivator for perseverance on difficult tasks, potentially facilitating the development of valued skills and abilities. This motivational aspect of pride may contribute to the accumulation of prestige and, consequently, social rank.Pride also plays a crucial role in regulating social relationships and group dynamics. Tracy and Robins (2007) argued that pride functions to enhance social status by motivating behaviors that increase others' valuations of the individual. This perspective aligns with the sociometer theory of self-esteem, which posits that self-conscious emotions like pride serve as internal gauges of social acceptance and status (Leary et al., 1995).Recent research has explored the neural underpinnings of pride and its relationship to social cognition. Zahn et al. (2009) used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of pride and found activation in regions associated with self-referential thinking and theory of mind. These findings suggest that pride involves complex social-cognitive processes, further supporting its importance in navigating social hierarchies.The universality of pride and its role in social rank attainment have important implications for understanding human social behavior across cultures. While the specific manifestations of pride may vary across societies, its fundamental function in regulating social relationships appears to be consistent. Sznycer et al. (2017) found that the intensity of pride experienced in response to personal characteristics closely tracked the degree to which those characteristics were valued by others across diverse cultures, supporting the idea that pride is a universal and functional emotion.In conclusion, the reviewed literature suggests that pride is a complex, multifaceted emotion that plays a crucial role in social rank attainment and interpersonal relationships. Its dual nature, comprising authentic and hubristic pride, contributes to distinct strategies for gaining status and influence. The cross-cultural recognition of pride expressions, its motivational effects, and its neural correlates all point to its importance as a fundamental aspect of human social cognition. Future research should continue to explore the nuances of pride across different cultural contexts and its implications for social behavior and hierarchy formation in an increasingly globalized world.", "References": [{"title": "The nature of pride", "authors": "Jessica L.
