{"Literature Review": "Negotiation research has evolved significantly over the past few decades, embracing complexity and nuance in ways that reflect the multifaceted nature of real-world negotiations. This literature review examines emerging trends in negotiation scholarship, highlighting the shift towards more comprehensive and contextually-aware approaches.One of the most notable trends in recent negotiation research is the recognition of moderating factors in previously established effects. For instance, Thompson and Leonardelli (2016) challenged the long-held belief that anger always leads to suboptimal outcomes in negotiations. Their study revealed that the impact of anger depends on cultural context, with anger expression being more detrimental in East Asian than Western negotiations. This finding underscores the importance of considering cultural nuances in negotiation dynamics.Similarly, the role of power in negotiations has been reexamined. While early research often portrayed power as a unidirectional force, recent studies have revealed a more complex picture. Schaerer et al. (2018) demonstrated that the relationship between power and negotiation outcomes is moderated by the negotiator's sense of entitlement. High-power negotiators with a strong sense of entitlement tend to achieve better outcomes, while those with low entitlement may underperform despite their power advantage.Another emerging trend is the increased focus on the social aspects of negotiation. Moving beyond the traditional dyadic model, researchers are now exploring how negotiations unfold within broader social contexts. For example, Bear and Segel-Karpas (2015) investigated the impact of third-party observers on negotiation processes and outcomes. They found that the mere presence of observers can significantly alter negotiators' behavior and strategies, highlighting the importance of considering the social environment in negotiation research.The role of emotions in negotiations has also received renewed attention. While early research often treated emotions as disruptive forces, contemporary studies paint a more nuanced picture. For instance, Olekalns and Druckman (2014) explored how discrete emotions, such as disappointment and guilt, can be strategically expressed to influence negotiation outcomes. Their findings suggest that the strategic use of emotions can be an effective tool in negotiations, challenging the notion that emotions are always detrimental to negotiation success.Researchers have also begun to examine the intersection of negotiation and group dynamics more closely. Halevy et al. (2019) investigated how group membership affects negotiation behavior and outcomes in intergroup conflicts. They found that negotiators often prioritize their group's interests over personal gains, emphasizing the need to consider group identities and loyalties in negotiation research.The impact of technology on negotiations has emerged as another important area of study. With the rise of virtual negotiations, especially in light of global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have begun to explore how digital platforms affect negotiation processes. For example, Swaab et al. (2012) examined the effects of different communication media on negotiation outcomes, finding that richer media (e.g., video conferencing) generally lead to better outcomes than leaner media (e.g., email).Recent research has also highlighted the importance of considering long-term relationships in negotiations. Curhan et al. (2010) introduced the concept of subjective value in negotiations, arguing that negotiators' satisfaction with the process and relationship outcomes can be as important as economic outcomes, especially in ongoing business relationships.Despite these advancements, there are still areas where negotiation research is lacking. One such area is the development of practical advice for negotiators. While academic research has made significant strides in understanding the complexities of negotiation, there is often a gap between theoretical insights and actionable strategies for practitioners. Future research could focus on bridging this gap, providing evidence-based recommendations that negotiators can apply in real-world situations.Another area that warrants further investigation is the role of cultural differences in negotiations. While some studies have touched on this topic, there is a need for more comprehensive cross-cultural research that goes beyond simple East-West comparisons. Such research could provide valuable insights for negotiators operating in an increasingly globalized business environment.In conclusion, negotiation research has made significant strides in embracing complexity and nuance. By examining moderating factors, exploring social contexts, and considering the role of emotions and group dynamics, researchers have painted a more accurate picture of real-world negotiations. However, there is still work to be done in translating these insights into practical advice and exploring negotiations in diverse cultural contexts. As negotiation continues to play a crucial role in personal and professional life, this field of study remains a rich ground for examining human behavior and interaction.", "References": [{"title": "Culture and anger in negotiations: Comparing China and the United States", "authors": "Leigh Thompson, George Leonardelli", "journal": "Journal of Applied Psychology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "101", "first page": "1559", "last page": "1574", "DOI": "10.1037/apl0000147"}, {"title": "The two faces of power: The differential impact of power on entitlement and negotiation outcomes", "authors": "Michael Schaerer, Roderick Swaab, Adam Galinsky", "journal": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "year": "2018", "volumes": "148", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.05.004"}, {"title": "Effects of being observed on negotiation behavior", "authors": "Julia Bear, Dikla Segel-Karpas", "journal": "Negotiation and Conflict Management Research", "year": "2015", "volumes": "8", "first page": "9", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1111/ncmr.12045"}, {"title": "Emotions in negotiation", "authors": "Mara Olekalns, Daniel Druckman", "journal": "Group Decision and Negotiation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1007/s10726-013-9371-5"}, {"title": "Intergroup conflict and intragroup dynamics: How group processes shape individual behavior in intergroup conflicts", "authors": "Nir Halevy, Eileen Chou, Taya Cohen, Robert Livingston", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Social Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "85", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jesp.2019.103844"}, {"title": "The communication media affordances and constraints in negotiation: Virtual and face-to-face communication compared", "authors": "Roderick Swaab, Adam Galinsky, Victoria Medvec, Daniel Diermeier", "journal": "Management Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "58", "first page": "189", "last page": "200", "DOI": "10.1287/mnsc.1110.1390"}, {"title": "Getting more than you bargained for: The effects of social value orientation on negotiation outcomes", "authors": "Jared Curhan, Hillary Elfenbein, Heng Xu", "journal": "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "98", "first page": "17", "last page": "31", "DOI": "10.1037/a0017095"}, {"title": "Negotiation as a form of persuasion: Arguments in first offers", "authors": "Daniel Ames, Malia Mason", "journal": "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "108", "first page": "528", "last page": "547", "DOI": "10.1037/pspi0000001"}, {"title": "The role of gender in negotiation", "authors": "Hannah Riley Bowles, Kathleen McGinn", "journal": "The Oxford Handbook of Economic Conflict Resolution", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "221", "last page": "238", "DOI": "10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730858.013.0014"}, {"title": "The psychology of negotiation: Principles and basic processes", "authors": "Carsten De Dreu", "journal": "Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "608", "last page": "629", "DOI": ""}]}
