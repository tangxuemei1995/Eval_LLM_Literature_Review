{"Literature Review": "Psychological resilience has emerged as a critical area of study in the field of psychology, focusing on individuals' ability to maintain or regain psychological well-being in the face of adversity. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of psychological resilience, its conceptual foundations, and the emerging affect-regulation framework that integrates various approaches to resilience research. The concept of psychological resilience has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Early research primarily focused on identifying protective factors that contribute to positive outcomes in high-risk populations. However, as the field progressed, researchers began to recognize resilience as a dynamic process rather than a fixed trait. One of the primary challenges in resilience research has been the lack of conceptual clarity. Southwick et al. highlighted the need for a more precise definition of resilience, as different researchers have operationalized the concept in various ways. This inconsistency has led to difficulties in comparing and synthesizing findings across studies. Two major approaches have dominated the field of resilience research: the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach. The stress and coping approach, pioneered by Lazarus and Folkman, emphasizes the role of cognitive appraisals and coping strategies in determining resilience outcomes. This approach has been instrumental in identifying various coping mechanisms that individuals employ when faced with adversity. On the other hand, the emotion and emotion-regulation approach focuses on the role of emotional processes in resilience. Gross proposed a model of emotion regulation that has been widely applied in resilience research. This approach highlights the importance of emotional awareness, expression, and regulation in maintaining psychological well-being during times of stress. While both approaches have contributed significantly to our understanding of resilience, they have largely developed in isolation from one another. This separation has limited the field's ability to develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex processes underlying resilience. To address these limitations, researchers have proposed an integrative affect-regulation framework for understanding psychological resilience. This framework aims to bridge the gap between the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach by emphasizing the role of affect regulation in resilience processes. The affect-regulation framework posits that resilience is not merely the absence of negative emotions or the presence of positive ones, but rather the ability to flexibly regulate affect in response to changing environmental demands. This perspective aligns with the growing recognition of emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic process that underlies various forms of psychopathology. One key aspect of the affect-regulation framework is the emphasis on regulatory flexibility. Bonanno and Burton argue that resilient individuals are characterized by their ability to employ a diverse range of affect regulation strategies and to flexibly switch between these strategies as needed. This flexibility allows individuals to adapt more effectively to different types of stressors and changing environmental contexts. The affect-regulation framework also highlights the importance of context sensitivity in resilience. Troy and Mauss demonstrated that the effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies depends on the specific context in which they are employed. For example, cognitive reappraisal may be adaptive in uncontrollable situations but less effective in controllable ones. Furthermore, the framework incorporates the role of implicit processes in affect regulation. Gyurak et al. proposed that both automatic and controlled processes contribute to emotion regulation, and the interplay between these processes is crucial for understanding resilience. The affect-regulation framework has important implications for interventions aimed at promoting resilience. By focusing on enhancing regulatory flexibility and context sensitivity, interventions can potentially improve individuals' ability to adapt to a wide range of adverse situations. While the affect-regulation framework represents a significant advancement in resilience research, several gaps in knowledge remain. Future research should focus on elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying regulatory flexibility, exploring the development of affect regulation across the lifespan, and investigating cultural differences in affect regulation strategies and their relationship to resilience. In conclusion, the affect-regulation framework offers a promising integrative approach to understanding psychological resilience. By bridging the gap between stress and coping and emotion regulation approaches, this framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of the processes underlying resilience. As research in this area continues to evolve, it has the potential to inform more effective interventions for promoting psychological well-being in the face of adversity.", "References": [{"title": "Ordinary magic: Resilience processes in development", "authors": "Ann S.
