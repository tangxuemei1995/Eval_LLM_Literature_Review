{"Literature Review": "The underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields remains a persistent challenge despite efforts to increase gender diversity and inclusion. This literature review examines the psychological factors contributing to women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM, with a focus on the role of gender stereotypes and their impact on various dimensions of person-environment fit. Historically, explanations for the gender gap in STEM have often centered on person-level factors such as differences in abilities, interests, and self-efficacy between men and women. However, research has consistently shown that these explanations are insufficient to account for the persistent underrepresentation of women in certain STEM fields, particularly in computer science and engineering. Instead, a growing body of evidence suggests that gender stereotypes play a crucial role in shaping women's experiences and perceptions of fit within STEM environments. Gender stereotypes can significantly impact women's sense of self-concept fit in STEM fields. Cheryan et al. (2015) found that stereotypes about computer scientists being socially awkward and singularly focused on technology deterred women from pursuing computer science careers, even when they had high ability and interest in the field. These stereotypes create a perceived mismatch between women's self-concept and their image of a typical STEM professional, leading to decreased interest and engagement in these fields. The concept of goal fit is another important dimension affected by gender stereotypes. Diekman et al. (2010) demonstrated that women are more likely to endorse communal goals, such as helping others and working with people, while STEM careers are often perceived as less likely to fulfill these goals. This perceived misalignment between personal goals and career opportunities can discourage women from pursuing STEM fields, even when they have strong STEM-related skills and interests. Social fit, or the sense of belonging within a particular environment, is also heavily influenced by gender stereotypes in STEM. Master et al. (2016) found that stereotypical physical environments in computer science classrooms, such as Star Trek posters and video game decorations, can signal a lower sense of belonging for women compared to men. This decreased sense of belonging can lead to lower interest and participation in STEM activities, perpetuating the gender gap. It is important to note that these effects of gender stereotypes occur independently of intentional interpersonal biases and discrimination. Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) demonstrated that both male and female faculty members exhibited subtle biases against female applicants for a laboratory manager position, despite identical qualifications. This suggests that even well-intentioned individuals may unconsciously perpetuate gender stereotypes, creating systemic barriers to women's advancement in STEM. The impact of gender stereotypes on women's fit and inclusion in STEM extends beyond the educational environment and into professional settings. Heilman and Caleo (2018) found that women in male-dominated STEM fields often face a \"lack of fit\" perception, where they are seen as less competent or less suited for leadership roles due to gender stereotypes. This can lead to reduced opportunities for advancement and lower job satisfaction for women in STEM careers. Addressing these systemic barriers requires a multifaceted approach to changing organizational and educational cultures. Interventions at the institutional level, such as implementing bias training and creating more inclusive physical environments, can help mitigate the effects of gender stereotypes. For example, Walton et al. (2015) demonstrated that a brief social-belonging intervention improved academic performance and well-being for women in male-dominated engineering programs. At the interpersonal level, promoting positive role models and mentorship opportunities for women in STEM can help counteract negative stereotypes and increase feelings of belonging. Stout et al. (2011) found that exposure to female STEM experts increased women's self-concept and sense of belonging in STEM fields, particularly for those who initially held stereotypical beliefs about these fields. Individual-level interventions, such as growth mindset interventions and values affirmation exercises, have also shown promise in reducing the impact of gender stereotypes on women's STEM engagement. Good et al. (2012) demonstrated that teaching students about the malleability of intelligence could help buffer against the negative effects of stereotypes on women's math performance and sense of belonging in STEM. In conclusion, addressing the underrepresentation of women in STEM requires a comprehensive understanding of the role of gender stereotypes in shaping perceptions of fit and inclusion. By implementing evidence-based interventions at multiple levels, we can work towards creating more inclusive STEM environments that allow all individuals, regardless of gender, to thrive and contribute to scientific and technological advancements.", "References": [{"title": "Why are some STEM fields more gender balanced than others?", "authors": "Sapna Cheryan, Sianna A.
