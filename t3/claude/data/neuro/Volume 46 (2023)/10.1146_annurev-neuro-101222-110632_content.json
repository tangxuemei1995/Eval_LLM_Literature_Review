{"Literature Review": "The study of cognition has traditionally been approached through the lens of language and introspection. However, this perspective has limitations, particularly when considering the evolutionary origins of brain mechanisms and their study in non-human animals. A growing body of research suggests that cognition, including memory, can be better understood through the exaptation and expansion of circuits and algorithms originally serving bodily functions.The concept of exaptation, first introduced by Gould and Vrba (1982), refers to the co-option of a trait for a function other than the one for which it was originally adapted. In the context of cognition, this idea proposes that brain circuits initially evolved for regulating and protecting metabolic and energetic processes were later repurposed for higher cognitive functions.One key area where this exaptation is evident is in the hippocampal system. Traditionally associated with memory formation and spatial navigation, recent research has revealed its dual role in both cognitive and homeostatic functions. Tomar et al. (2015) demonstrated that the hippocampus is involved in glucose regulation, suggesting a link between metabolic control and cognitive processes.The hippocampus's role in creating cognitive maps, as first proposed by O'Keefe and Nadel (1978), can be seen as an exaptation of its original function in bodily regulation. As organisms explored their environment, the ability to create mental representations of space became advantageous. This cognitive mapping ability, in turn, laid the groundwork for more abstract forms of memory and planning.Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), high-frequency oscillations observed in the hippocampus, provide a compelling example of how bodily functions and cognitive processes intertwine. Buzsáki (2015) proposed that SWRs serve as a mechanism for memory consolidation during sleep and quiet wakefulness. However, recent studies have shown that SWRs also play a role in metabolic regulation. For instance, Tingley et al. (2021) found that SWRs are coupled with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, suggesting a link between memory processes and energy homeostasis.The exaptation of circuits involved in bodily regulation for cognitive functions is not limited to the hippocampus. The insular cortex, traditionally associated with interoception and bodily awareness, has been shown to play a role in decision-making and emotional processing (Craig, 2009). This suggests that the neural substrates for higher cognitive functions may have evolved from systems originally dedicated to monitoring and regulating internal bodily states.The concept of allostasis, introduced by Sterling and Eyer (1988), provides a framework for understanding how the brain anticipates future bodily needs and adjusts accordingly. This predictive capacity, essential for maintaining homeostasis, may have been co-opted for more abstract forms of future-oriented cognition, such as planning and prospective memory. McEwen and Wingfield (2003) expanded on this idea, proposing that allostatic load – the cumulative wear and tear on the body resulting from chronic stress – has implications for both physical health and cognitive function.Sleep, a state traditionally associated with rest and recovery, has been increasingly recognized as a critical period for both bodily regulation and cognitive processing. Rasch and Born (2013) reviewed extensive evidence showing that sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation. Interestingly, the same sleep-associated brain activity patterns involved in memory processing, such as SWRs, also contribute to metabolic regulation (Mizuseki and Miyawaki, 2017).The exaptation of bodily regulatory circuits for cognitive functions has implications for our understanding of mental health and neurological disorders. For example, the high comorbidity between metabolic disorders and cognitive impairments, as observed in conditions like type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, may be explained by shared neural substrates (de la Monte and Wands, 2008).In conclusion, the emerging view of cognition as an exaptation of body-brain interactions offers a more comprehensive and evolutionarily grounded understanding of mental processes. This perspective not only bridges the gap between bodily functions and higher cognitive abilities but also provides new avenues for research in neuroscience, psychology, and medicine. Future studies should continue to explore the intricate relationships between metabolic processes, sleep, and cognitive functions to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this body-brain partnership.", "References": [{"title": "Exaptation—a missing term in the science of form", "authors": "Stephen Jay Gould, Elisabeth S.
