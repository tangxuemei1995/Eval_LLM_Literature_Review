{"Literature Review": "The concept of a cognitive map, an internal representation of space in the brain, has been a subject of intense research in neuroscience for decades. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the development of circuits and computations that underlie spatial representation in the mammalian brain, particularly within the entorhinal-hippocampal network.The entorhinal-hippocampal network is crucial for spatial navigation and memory formation. Within this network, various types of spatially tuned neurons have been identified, each contributing to the overall representation of space. Place cells in the hippocampus, first discovered by O'Keefe and Dostrovsky in 1971, fire when an animal is in specific locations within an environment (Moser et al., 2015). Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), discovered by Hafting et al. in 2005, exhibit a striking hexagonal firing pattern across space (Rowland et al., 2016). Other specialized cell types include head direction cells, border cells, and speed cells, each encoding different aspects of an animal's position and movement (Hartley et al., 2014).The development of these spatially tuned neurons and their integration into functional circuits is a complex process that occurs during early postnatal life in mammals. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the ontogeny of these neural representations. For instance, Wills et al. (2010) demonstrated that place cells in the rat hippocampus emerge around postnatal day 16 (P16), before the animal has had significant exploration experience. This suggests that some aspects of spatial representation may be innate or develop through intrinsic mechanisms.Grid cells, on the other hand, appear to have a more protracted developmental timeline. Wills et al. (2012) found that adult-like grid cell firing patterns do not emerge until approximately P30 in rats. This delayed development may reflect the need for more complex computations or the integration of multiple inputs to generate the characteristic hexagonal firing pattern.The maturation of head direction cells provides another interesting case study in the development of spatial representations. Tan et al. (2015) showed that head direction cells in the rat anterodorsal thalamic nucleus are present from the earliest age at which they could be recorded (P12), and their properties are similar to those observed in adults. This early emergence suggests that the head direction system may serve as a foundational element upon which other spatial representations are built.The development of these spatially tuned neurons is closely tied to the maturation of the underlying neural circuits. Donato et al. (2017) investigated the development of inhibitory circuits in the MEC and found that the maturation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons coincides with the emergence of grid cell firing patterns. They proposed that the development of these inhibitory circuits may be crucial for the formation of stable grid cell representations.Recent work has also begun to explore the role of early experience in shaping spatial representations. Muessig et al. (2015) found that environmental complexity during early development influences the maturation of place cells and the emergence of spatial memory abilities. Animals raised in complex environments showed earlier maturation of place cell properties and better performance in spatial memory tasks compared to those raised in standard laboratory cages.The development of spatial representations is not limited to early postnatal life but continues into adulthood through processes of plasticity and learning. Schmidt-Hieber and Häusser (2013) demonstrated that new neurons generated in the adult hippocampus rapidly develop place cell properties, suggesting ongoing refinement of spatial representations throughout life.Understanding the development of cognitive maps also has implications for our comprehension of memory formation and consolidation. As the hippocampus is crucial for both spatial navigation and episodic memory, the maturation of spatial representations may parallel the development of memory systems. Deng et al. (2010) reviewed the role of adult neurogenesis in hippocampal function, highlighting its importance in pattern separation and memory consolidation.Recent technological advances have enabled more detailed investigations of the neural circuits underlying spatial representations. For example, Heys et al. (2014) used optogenetic techniques to demonstrate the role of cholinergic inputs in modulating grid cell firing patterns, providing insights into the circuit mechanisms that support spatial navigation.In conclusion, the development of cognitive maps in the mammalian brain involves the coordinated maturation of various cell types, circuits, and computations. While significant progress has been made in understanding this process, many questions remain. Future research will likely focus on the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the development of spatially tuned neurons, the role of early experience in shaping these representations, and the relationship between the maturation of spatial navigation systems and other cognitive functions. Such investigations will not only enhance our understanding of brain development but may also provide insights into neurodevelopmental disorders and potential therapeutic interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Place cells, grid cells, and the brain's spatial representation system", "authors": "Edvard I.
