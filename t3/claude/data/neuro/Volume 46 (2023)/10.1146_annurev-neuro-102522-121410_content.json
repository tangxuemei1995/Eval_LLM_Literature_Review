{"Literature Review": "The primate brain has evolved specialized networks to process and interpret complex social information, enabling sophisticated social cognition. This literature review examines the current understanding of functional specialization in the primate brain for social cognition, focusing on face processing, social interaction understanding, and mental state attribution.Face processing is a fundamental aspect of social cognition in primates. Research has shown that the primate brain contains dedicated neural circuits for face perception and recognition. Tsao et al. (2006) identified a network of face-selective patches in the macaque temporal lobe using fMRI, demonstrating a hierarchical organization for face processing. These findings were further supported by Freiwald and Tsao (2010), who used single-unit recordings to reveal a progression of face selectivity across these patches, from simple feature detection to more complex identity and expression recognition.The specialization for face processing extends beyond the temporal lobe. Pitcher et al. (2011) used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to demonstrate the causal role of the right occipital face area (OFA) in early face perception in humans. This study highlighted the importance of specialized regions in the occipital cortex for face processing, supporting the idea of a distributed network for social cognition.Social interaction understanding is another crucial aspect of primate social cognition. Sliwa and Freiwald (2017) identified a network of brain regions in macaques that selectively respond to observed social interactions. This study revealed that the primate brain contains dedicated neural circuits for processing social interactions, distinct from those involved in processing individual actions or faces.The ability to attribute mental states to others, known as theory of mind or mentalizing, is a higher-order social cognitive function. Saxe and Kanwisher (2003) used fMRI to identify brain regions in humans that are selectively activated when reasoning about others' thoughts, including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These findings suggest that even abstract social cognitive processes are supported by specialized neural networks.Interestingly, the functional specialization for social cognition appears to be a pervasive theme throughout the primate brain hierarchy. Kiani et al. (2015) demonstrated that even in high-level decision-making areas like the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), there is a categorical organization for socially relevant stimuli. This suggests that specialization for social information processing extends to the apex of cortical hierarchies.The juxtaposition of social and nonsocial processing systems in the primate brain has been observed across multiple studies. For example, Haxby et al. (2000) proposed a distributed neural system for face perception that includes both face-selective regions and regions involved in other cognitive functions. This organization suggests that while there are specialized circuits for social cognition, they interact with domain-general systems to support complex social behaviors.Recent research has also highlighted the importance of connectivity between specialized social cognitive networks. Alcal치-L칩pez et al. (2018) used meta-analytic connectivity modeling to identify a large-scale social brain network in humans, comprising four distinct functional modules: visual-sensory, limbic, intermediate, and high-level cognitive. This study emphasizes the interconnected nature of social cognitive processes and the importance of considering both specialized regions and their interactions.The evolutionary perspective on social brain networks has been explored by Mars et al. (2013), who compared the organization of the human and macaque social brain. Their findings suggest that while there are homologous social brain networks across primate species, human-specific expansions and specializations have occurred, particularly in regions associated with mentalizing.In conclusion, the current literature supports the existence of specialized networks for social cognition in the primate brain. These networks span multiple levels of organization, from single cells to large-scale brain systems, and support various aspects of social information processing. The functional specialization observed in face processing, social interaction understanding, and mental state attribution reflects the importance of efficient social information processing in primate evolution. Future research should continue to explore the interactions between these specialized networks and their integration with domain-general cognitive systems to fully understand the neural basis of primate social cognition.", "References": [{"title": "A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells", "authors": "Doris Y.
