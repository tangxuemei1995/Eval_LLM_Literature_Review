{"Literature Review": "The visual cortex of mammals has long been a subject of intense study, with researchers seeking to understand its complex architecture and functional organization. This review focuses on recent findings that challenge the traditional view of rodent visual cortex, particularly in mice, and proposes a new understanding of its modular organization.Historically, the primary visual cortex (V1) of carnivores and primates has been characterized by the presence of radial cell columns, which are considered fundamental units of cortical processing (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). These columns are typically associated with orientation selectivity, where neurons within a column respond preferentially to stimuli of a particular orientation. However, such orientation columns have been notably absent in rodent V1, leading to the long-held belief that rodent visual cortex lacks a columnar organization altogether (Ohki et al., 2005).This apparent absence of columnar structure in rodents led to the assumption that their visual cortex operates on fundamentally different principles compared to that of carnivores and primates. However, recent research has begun to challenge this view, revealing a more nuanced understanding of rodent visual cortex organization, particularly in mice.One of the key findings supporting a modular organization in mouse visual cortex is the discovery of patchy connections in layer 1. These patches form distinct clusters of inputs that are thought to play a crucial role in organizing thalamocortical inputs and intracortical processing streams (D'Souza et al., 2016). The presence of these patchy connections suggests a level of functional organization that was previously unrecognized in rodent visual cortex.Further evidence for modular organization comes from studies of projection neurons in the layers below layer 1. These neurons have been found to form clusters that align with the patchy inputs in layer 1, suggesting a vertical integration of information processing (Ji et al., 2015). This alignment of input patches and output clusters indicates a potential parallel to the columnar organization seen in other species, albeit with some distinct characteristics.The modular organization in mouse visual cortex appears to be closely linked to specific molecular markers. One such marker is the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which has been found to be expressed in a patchy pattern that correlates with the functional organization of the visual cortex (Gong et al., 2018). This molecular patterning provides further support for the existence of discrete functional units within the mouse visual cortex.The emerging picture of mouse visual cortex organization suggests a system that integrates both feedforward and feedback information streams. Feedforward connections, primarily from thalamic inputs, appear to be organized into discrete patches in layer 1. These inputs are then processed by the underlying cortical layers, with feedback connections potentially modulating this processing through interactions with the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in layer 1 (Larkum, 2013).This modular architecture may serve to organize not only thalamocortical inputs but also intracortical processing streams. Different modules could potentially process distinct aspects of visual information, such as form, motion, or color, in parallel. This parallel processing capability could allow for efficient integration of multiple visual features, despite the apparent lack of orientation columns (Glickfeld & Olsen, 2017).Moreover, the modular organization may play a crucial role in transthalamic communication. Recent studies have shown that cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways are important for information transfer between cortical areas (Sherman, 2016). The modular organization of mouse visual cortex could facilitate this communication by providing discrete channels for information flow between cortical areas via the thalamus.The implications of this modular organization extend beyond basic visual processing. It may also underlie distinct sensory and sensorimotor functions, allowing for efficient integration of visual information with other sensory modalities and motor outputs. This integration is crucial for behaviors such as visually-guided navigation and object recognition (Guo et al., 2014).In conclusion, while mouse visual cortex may lack the classical orientation columns seen in carnivores and primates, it possesses a sophisticated modular architecture that organizes both inputs and outputs. This organization allows for the integration of feedforward and feedback information streams, facilitating complex visual processing and sensorimotor integration. These findings challenge the traditional view of rodent visual cortex and suggest a greater similarity in cortical organization across mammalian species than previously thought. Future research will undoubtedly continue to refine our understanding of this modular architecture and its functional implications for visual processing in mice and other rodents.", "References": [{"title": "Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex", "authors": "David H.
