{"Literature Review": "Context-dependent learning is a crucial aspect of adaptive behavior, allowing organisms to flexibly respond to changing environments. Recent advances in computational modeling and neuroscience have shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying this process, particularly in situations where contextual information is uncertain. This literature review aims to explore the computational and neural bases of context-dependent learning, with a focus on the role of contextual inference and its implications for continual learning in the brain.The importance of context in learning and memory has long been recognized in cognitive neuroscience. Early studies by Tulving and Thomson (1973) demonstrated that the retrieval of memories is facilitated when the context at recall matches the context during encoding. This concept, known as context-dependent memory, has since been extensively studied and expanded upon. However, recent computational approaches have revealed a critical challenge that had been largely overlooked: the inherent uncertainty of context in naturalistic settings.Gershman and Niv (2010) proposed a Bayesian framework for understanding how the brain might handle contextual uncertainty during learning. Their model suggests that the brain continuously performs inference about the current context, updating its beliefs based on incoming sensory information and prior knowledge. This contextual inference process is thought to be crucial for determining when to create new memories, update existing ones, or retrieve relevant information.Building on this idea, Collins and Frank (2013) developed a computational model that integrates contextual inference with reinforcement learning. Their work demonstrated how such a model could account for various behavioral phenomena observed in context-dependent learning tasks, including rapid adaptation to changing contexts and the ability to generalize knowledge across similar contexts.The neural substrates of context-dependent learning have been the subject of intense investigation, with several brain regions emerging as key players. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been consistently implicated in contextual processing and cognitive control. Miller and Cohen (2001) proposed that the PFC maintains task-relevant information, including contextual cues, to guide behavior. More recent work by Badre and Nee (2018) has further elucidated the role of the PFC in hierarchical cognitive control, suggesting that different subregions may be involved in processing contexts at varying levels of abstraction.The hippocampus, long known for its role in episodic memory, has also been shown to play a crucial role in context-dependent learning. Preston and Eichenbaum (2013) reviewed evidence suggesting that the hippocampus works in concert with the PFC to support the flexible use of contextual information in guiding behavior. They proposed that the hippocampus rapidly encodes conjunctions of items and contexts, while the PFC uses this information to guide goal-directed behavior.Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of the thalamus in context-dependent learning. Wolff and Vann (2019) reviewed evidence suggesting that the anterior thalamic nuclei play a critical role in contextual processing and memory formation. They proposed that the thalamus acts as a hub, integrating contextual information from various sources and relaying it to cortical and subcortical regions involved in learning and memory.The motor cortex, traditionally viewed as primarily involved in movement execution, has recently been implicated in context-dependent learning as well. Hwang et al. (2020) demonstrated that neurons in the motor cortex exhibit context-dependent activity patterns during a motor learning task, suggesting that this region may play a role in storing and retrieving context-specific motor memories.The computational approach to context-dependent learning has also provided insights into the phenomenon of continual learning, a long-standing challenge in both artificial intelligence and neuroscience. Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) proposed a method called elastic weight consolidation, inspired by synaptic consolidation in the brain, to address catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks. This approach allows networks to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones, a key aspect of context-dependent learning in biological systems.Building on these ideas, Zeng et al. (2019) developed a computational model that integrates contextual inference with continual learning. Their model demonstrates how contextual inference can facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge while preserving existing memories, providing a potential mechanism for lifelong learning in the brain.In conclusion, recent advances in computational modeling and neuroscience have significantly enhanced our understanding of context-dependent learning. The recognition of contextual uncertainty as a key challenge has led to the development of sophisticated models that incorporate contextual inference as a core component of learning. These models have begun to organize a diverse array of experimental observations from multiple brain regions and levels of organization into a coherent framework. As research in this field continues to progress, it is likely that the principles of contextual inference and context-dependent learning will play an increasingly important role in our understanding of adaptive behavior and cognition.", "References": [{"title": "Encoding and retrieval of episodic memories: Role of cholinergic and GABAergic modulation in the hippocampus", "authors": "Endel Tulving, Donald M.
