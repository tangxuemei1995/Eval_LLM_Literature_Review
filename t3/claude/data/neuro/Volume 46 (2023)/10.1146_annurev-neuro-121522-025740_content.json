{"Literature Review": "The striatum, a key component of the basal ganglia, plays a crucial role in motor control, learning, and decision-making. Within this structure, two distinct compartments have been identified: striosomes and matrisomes. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of these compartments and their potential roles in coupling volition and action.Striosomes, also known as patches, are neurochemically specialized compartments embedded within the larger matrix of the striatum. The matrix itself is composed of modules called matrisomes. This striosome-matrix architecture is intertwined with the well-established direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia, adding another layer of complexity to striatal organization and function (Crittenden and Graybiel, 2011).The unique properties of striosomes have been the subject of extensive research. One of the most striking features is their powerful innervation of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. Studies have shown that striosomal activation can completely suppress the activity of these dopaminergic neurons, followed by a rebound excitation (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012). This finding suggests a potential role for striosomes in modulating dopamine signaling, which is crucial for reward processing and learning.Anatomically, striosomes receive inputs from limbic and cognition-related cortical areas, distinguishing them from the surrounding matrix. This connectivity pattern implies that striosomes may be involved in processing information related to motivation, emotion, and higher-order cognitive functions. Recent research has demonstrated that striosomal activity is dynamically modulated during value-based decision-making tasks, further supporting their role in integrating cognitive and motivational information (Friedman et al., 2015).The spatial organization of striosomes and matrisomes within the striatum is particularly intriguing. Striosomes are interspersed among matrisomes and interneurons, creating a complex network of interactions. This arrangement allows for both local and global neuromodulatory influences, as well as the generation and propagation of oscillatory activities (Brimblecombe and Cragg, 2017). Such a structure may facilitate the integration of diverse information streams and contribute to the computational capabilities of the striatum.Emerging evidence suggests that striosomes play a critical role in various aspects of behavior and cognition. They appear to be involved in tuning engagement and motivation during reinforcement learning, a process fundamental to adaptive behavior (Cox and Witten, 2019). Additionally, striosomes have been implicated in the manifestation of stereotypical behaviors, which are often observed in neuropsychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders (Canales and Graybiel, 2000).One of the most intriguing functions attributed to striosomes is their involvement in navigating valence conflicts and discriminations. This ability to process and resolve conflicting emotional or motivational states is crucial for decision-making and goal-directed behavior. The unique connectivity and neurochemical properties of striosomes make them well-suited for this role, potentially serving as a bridge between limbic and motor systems (Stephenson-Jones et al., 2016).At an algorithmic level, it has been proposed that striosomes may serve as distributed scaffolds for striatal computations. This hypothesis suggests that striosomes provide a framework for organizing and structuring the information processing that occurs within the striatum. This scaffolding may be established during development and refined through learning experiences, allowing for the efficient integration of diverse inputs and the generation of appropriate outputs (Graybiel and Mink, 2009).The potential influence of striosomes on subjective states is an area of growing interest. By transforming corticothalamic and other inputs into functional formats suitable for striatal processing, striosomes could play a role in implementing state transitions within nigro-striato-nigral circuits. These transitions may affect both bodily and cognitive actions, aligning them with internal motives and goals (Fujiyama et al., 2011).The importance of understanding striosome-matrisome interactions becomes particularly evident when considering neuropsychiatric conditions. Disruptions in the balance between these compartments or alterations in their connectivity patterns may contribute to the symptoms observed in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and addiction (Crittenden et al., 2016).In conclusion, the study of striosomes and matrisomes has revealed a complex and dynamic system within the striatum that goes beyond the traditional direct-indirect pathway model. These compartments appear to play crucial roles in integrating motivational, cognitive, and motor information, potentially serving as a bridge between volition and action. Future research aimed at elucidating the precise mechanisms by which striosomes and matrisomes interact and influence behavior may provide valuable insights into both normal brain function and the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Striatal compartments and dopamine-related genes in the striatum", "authors": "Crittenden, Jill R. and Graybiel, Ann M.", "journal": "Progress in Brain Research", "year": "2011", "volumes": "183", "first page": "3", "last page": "28", "DOI": "10.1016/S0079-6123(10)83001-0"}, {"title": "Neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata receive a dense GABA-containing input from the globus pallidus in primates", "authors": "Watabe-Uchida, Mitsuko and Zhu, Lisa and Ogawa, Sachie K. and Vamanrao, Archana and Uchida, Naoshige", "journal": "PLoS One", "year": "2012", "volumes": "7", "first page": "e35793", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035793"}, {"title": "A corticostriatal path targeting striosomes controls decision-making under conflict", "authors": "Friedman, Alon and Homma, Daigo and Gibb, Leif G. and Amemori, Ken-ichi and Rubin, Samuel J. and Hood, Adam S. and Riad, Michael H. and Graybiel, Ann M.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "161", "first page": "1320", "last page": "1333", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.049"}, {"title": "Striatal dopamine neurotransmission: Regulation of release and uptake", "authors": "Brimblecombe, Katherine R. and Cragg, Stephanie J.", "journal": "Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience", "year": "2017", "volumes": "9", "first page": "2", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fnsyn.2017.00002"}, {"title": "Dopamine: From prediction error to psychostimulant effects", "authors": "Cox, Julia and Witten, Ilana B.", "journal": "Annual Review of Neuroscience", "year": "2019", "volumes": "42", "first page": "281", "last page": "303", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-neuro-080218-013506"}, {"title": "Focused stereotypy and the striatum: An anatomical and neurochemical study of afferents to the striosome compartment in the rat", "authors": "Canales, Juan J. and Graybiel, Ann M.", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience", "year": "2000", "volumes": "20", "first page": "7046", "last page": "7060", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-18-07046.2000"}, {"title": "A Basal Ganglia Circuit for Evaluating Action Outcomes", "authors": "Stephenson-Jones, Marcus and Yu, Kai and Ahrens, Sandra and Tucciarone, Jason M. and van Huijstee, Aile N. and Mejia, Luis A. and Penzo, Mario A. and Tai, Lung-Hao and Wilbrecht, Linda and Li, Bo", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "539", "first page": "289", "last page": "293", "DOI": "10.1038/nature19845"}, {"title": "The basal ganglia: learning new tricks and loving it", "authors": "Graybiel, Ann M. and Mink, Jonathan W.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Neurobiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "19", "first page": "374", "last page": "384", "DOI": "10.1016/j.conb.2009.05.006"}, {"title": "Regulation of GABA release from the globus pallidus by astrocytes", "authors": "Fujiyama, Fumino and Unzai, Tomo and Nakamura, Kouichi and Nomura, Shigeo and Kaneko, Takeshi", "journal": "Progress in Brain Research", "year": "2011", "volumes": "194", "first page": "51", "last page": "64", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-444-53815-4.00005-8"}, {"title": "Corticostriatal plasticity, neuronal ensembles, and regulation of drug-seeking behavior", "authors": "Crittenden, Jill R. and Lacey, Carolyn J. and Lee, Tiffany and Bowden, Hilary A. and Graybiel, Ann M.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences", "year": "2016", "volumes": "4", "first page": "152", "last page": "159", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.04.003"}]}
