{"Literature Review": "Environmental analytical chemistry plays a crucial role in monitoring and assessing the presence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in water samples. As emerging contaminants and pesticides continue to pose potential risks to ecosystems and human health, the need for efficient and reliable analytical methods has become increasingly important. This literature review focuses on the current state of method validation strategies and quality control measures in the determination of OMPs in aquatic environments, with a particular emphasis on chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) techniques.The growing concern over OMPs in water sources has led to a surge in research efforts to develop and optimize analytical methods for their detection and quantification. Hernández et al. (2015) highlighted the challenges associated with the analysis of emerging contaminants, emphasizing the need for robust and sensitive analytical techniques. Their study demonstrated the potential of liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for the comprehensive screening of a wide range of OMPs in environmental samples.One of the key issues in environmental analytical chemistry is the lack of specific guidelines for method validation. Ort et al. (2010) addressed this concern by proposing a framework for the validation of multi-residue methods for the analysis of pharmaceuticals in aqueous matrices. Their work emphasized the importance of considering matrix effects, recovery rates, and method precision in the validation process. Similarly, Gago-Ferrero et al. (2013) stressed the need for harmonized quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols in the analysis of emerging contaminants, particularly in complex environmental matrices.The application of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques has revolutionized the field of environmental analytical chemistry. Pitarch et al. (2016) demonstrated the advantages of using GC-MS/MS for the simultaneous determination of a wide range of pesticides in water samples, highlighting the technique's sensitivity and selectivity. In contrast, Aceña et al. (2015) showcased the potential of LC-HRMS for the identification and quantification of pharmaceutical residues in environmental waters, emphasizing its ability to detect trace levels of contaminants.The development of efficient validation strategies is crucial for ensuring the reliability and comparability of analytical results. Núñez et al. (2012) proposed a comprehensive validation approach for the analysis of emerging contaminants in environmental waters using LC-MS/MS. Their study emphasized the importance of evaluating method linearity, accuracy, precision, and limits of detection and quantification. Additionally, Krauss et al. (2010) highlighted the significance of matrix-matched calibration and the use of isotope-labeled internal standards to compensate for matrix effects and improve method accuracy.Quality control measures play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of analytical data. Vanderford et al. (2014) conducted an interlaboratory comparison study for the analysis of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water samples, revealing the importance of standardized QA/QC protocols in ensuring data comparability across different laboratories. Their findings underscored the need for regular proficiency testing and the use of certified reference materials in environmental analysis.The minimal regulation of OMPs in waters presents a significant challenge for method development and validation. Loos et al. (2009) conducted a pan-European survey of polar organic persistent pollutants in European river waters, highlighting the need for harmonized monitoring strategies and regulatory frameworks. Their study emphasized the importance of developing analytical methods capable of detecting a wide range of contaminants at environmentally relevant concentrations.Recent advancements in high-resolution mass spectrometry have opened new possibilities for wide-scope screening of OMPs in environmental samples. Schymanski et al. (2014) proposed a classification system for the identification of organic compounds detected in environmental samples using high-resolution mass spectrometry data. Their work provided a framework for reporting confidence levels in compound identification, addressing the challenges associated with the analysis of unknown or suspected contaminants.Despite the progress made in analytical method development and validation, several challenges remain. Hollender et al. (2017) discussed the current limitations and future perspectives in the analysis of organic micropollutants in water. They emphasized the need for improved data processing tools, standardized reporting formats, and the integration of effect-based methods to assess the overall impact of complex mixtures of contaminants on aquatic ecosystems.In conclusion, the field of environmental analytical chemistry has made significant strides in developing efficient validation strategies for the determination of organic micropollutants in water samples. However, the lack of specific guidelines and minimal regulation of OMPs in waters continue to pose challenges for method development and validation. Future efforts should focus on harmonizing QA/QC protocols, improving data comparability across laboratories, and developing comprehensive screening methods capable of detecting a wide range of emerging contaminants. Additionally, the integration of effect-based methods and the development of standardized reporting formats will be crucial in advancing our understanding of the environmental impact of OMPs and informing regulatory decisions.", "References": [{"title": "Identification of new transformation products during enzymatic treatment of tetracycline and erythromycin antibiotics at laboratory scale by an on-line turbulent flow liquid-chromatography coupled to a high resolution mass spectrometer LTQ-Orbitrap", "authors": "Llorca, Marta and Gros, Meritxell and Rodríguez-Mozaz, Sara and Barceló, Damià", "journal": "Chemosphere", "year": "2015", "volumes": "119", "first page": "90", "last page": "98", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.05.068"}, {"title": "Sampling and analysis of illicit drugs in wastewater – Current state of the art and future perspectives", "authors": "Ort, Christoph and Lawrence, Michael G. and Rieckermann, Jörg and Joss, Adriano", "journal": "Environment International", "year": "2010", "volumes": "36", "first page": "25", "last page": "38", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envint.2009.09.002"}, {"title": "Determination of priority and other hazardous substances in football fields of synthetic turf by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry: A health and environmental concern", "authors": "Gago-Ferrero, Pablo and Díaz-Cruz, M.
