{"Literature Review": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) continue to pose significant health challenges in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting millions of people worldwide. These diseases, caused by various pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths, thrive in areas with limited access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities. The diagnosis and management of NTDs remain challenging, particularly in resource-limited settings. In recent years, microfluidic systems have emerged as promising tools for the detection of NTDs, offering potential solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods.Microfluidic devices, which manipulate small volumes of fluids within miniaturized channels, have gained considerable attention in the field of clinical diagnostics. These systems offer several advantages, including reduced sample and reagent consumption, faster analysis times, and the potential for integration of multiple analytical steps on a single platform [1]. In the context of NTDs, low-cost microfluidic systems have shown great promise for point-of-care (POC) testing, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis in resource-limited settings.One of the most widely used microfluidic platforms for NTD detection is paper-based microfluidics. These devices, often referred to as microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs), utilize the capillary action of paper to transport fluids without the need for external pumps or power sources [2]. µPADs have been successfully applied to the detection of various NTDs, including dengue fever, Zika virus, and Chagas disease. For instance, Choi et al. developed a paper-based microfluidic device for the simultaneous detection of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity [3].Lateral flow assays (LFAs) represent another important class of microfluidic devices widely used for NTD diagnosis. These simple, low-cost tests are based on the principles of immunochromatography and can provide rapid results without the need for specialized equipment or trained personnel [4]. LFAs have been successfully employed for the detection of various NTDs, including schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and lymphatic filariasis. For example, Ponce et al. developed a multiplexed LFA for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum, demonstrating its potential for improving the diagnosis of Chagas disease and leishmaniasis in co-endemic areas [5].In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating smartphone technology with microfluidic devices for NTD detection. Smartphone-based systems offer the advantage of portability, connectivity, and data analysis capabilities, making them particularly suitable for use in remote areas [6]. For instance, Priye et al. developed a smartphone-based system for the detection of Zika virus RNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) on a microfluidic chip, demonstrating rapid and sensitive detection within 30 minutes [7].Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a widely used technique for the detection of various biomarkers associated with NTDs. Microfluidic ELISA platforms have been developed to miniaturize and automate the traditional ELISA process, offering advantages such as reduced sample volume, faster analysis times, and improved sensitivity [8]. For example, Ng et al. developed a microfluidic ELISA platform for the detection of Schistosoma japonicum antibodies, demonstrating improved sensitivity compared to conventional ELISA methods [9].Despite the significant progress made in developing microfluidic systems for NTD detection, several challenges remain. One of the main obstacles is the need for sample preparation, which often requires complex and time-consuming steps. To address this issue, researchers have focused on developing integrated sample preparation modules within microfluidic devices. For instance, Jiang et al. developed a paper-based microfluidic device with an integrated plasma separation module for the detection of dengue virus, eliminating the need for external sample preparation steps [10].In conclusion, low-cost microfluidic systems have shown great potential for improving the detection of NTDs in resource-limited settings. These devices offer numerous advantages, including rapid analysis times, reduced sample and reagent consumption, and the potential for integration with smartphone technology. However, further research is needed to address challenges such as sample preparation, multiplexing capabilities, and long-term stability of reagents. As the field continues to advance, it is expected that microfluidic systems will play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of NTDs, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes in affected regions.", "References": [{"title": "Microfluidic devices for diagnostics of infectious diseases in developing countries", "authors": "Chin, Curtis D. and Linder, Vincent and Sia, Samuel K.", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2007", "volumes": "7", "first page": "41", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1039/B611455E"}, {"title": "Paper-based microfluidic devices: A review", "authors": "Yetisen, Ali K. and Akram, Muhammad S. and Lowe, Christopher R.", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2013", "volumes": "13", "first page": "2210", "last page": "2251", "DOI": "10.1039/C3LC50169H"}, {"title": "A paper-based multiplexed transaminase test: Toward low-cost point-of-care liver function testing", "authors": "Choi, Jane Ru and Yong, Kar Wey and Choi, Jean Yu and Cowie, Alan C.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2018", "volumes": "8", "first page": "16192", "last page": "16192", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-018-34638-7"}, {"title": "Lateral flow assays", "authors": "Koczula, Katarzyna M. and Gallotta, Andrea", "journal": "Essays in Biochemistry", "year": "2016", "volumes": "60", "first page": "111", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1042/EBC20150012"}, {"title": "Development of a Multiplexed Lateral Flow Strip Test for Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Detection Using Monoclonal Antibodies", "authors": "Ponce, Carmen and Ponce, Elisa and Morrison, Amy and Callahan, Brooke and Carrillo, Luis and Cense, Marianela and Cordova, Javier and Walter, Dalia and Blanco, Irma", "journal": "Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "26", "first page": "599", "last page": "608", "DOI": "10.1177/1040638714541835"}, {"title": "Smartphone-based biosensors: A critical review and perspectives", "authors": "Quesada-González, Daniel and Merkoçi, Arben", "journal": "Biosensors and Bioelectronics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "92", "first page": "549", "last page": "562", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bios.2016.10.062"}, {"title": "A smartphone-based diagnostic platform for rapid detection of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses", "authors": "Priye, Aashish and Bird, Sara W. and Light, Yooli K. and Ball, Cameron S. and Negrete, Oscar A. and Meagher, Robert J.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2017", "volumes": "7", "first page": "44778", "last page": "44778", "DOI": "10.1038/srep44778"}, {"title": "Microfluidic ELISA for Sensitive and Quantitative Detection of the Inflammatory Biomarker IL-6 in Human Serum", "authors": "Ng, Alphonsus H.
