{"Literature Review": "Gel-based microscale electrophoresis has emerged as a powerful analytical technique in bioanalytical chemistry, particularly for the separation and analysis of biopolymers such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of gels in microscale channels, focusing on both capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microchannel gel electrophoresis (MGE) systems.The fundamental principle of gel electrophoresis relies on the sieving effect of the gel matrix, which allows for the separation of molecules based on their size and charge. In microscale electrophoresis, the use of gels as sieving matrices has significantly enhanced the resolution and efficiency of separations compared to traditional slab gel electrophoresis. Hjertén et al. (1985) first introduced CGE, demonstrating its potential for high-resolution separations of proteins and nucleic acids. Since then, numerous advancements have been made in gel formulations and applications.One of the key advantages of microscale gel electrophoresis is its ability to achieve rapid and high-resolution separations with minimal sample consumption. Karger et al. (1991) reported the use of CGE for DNA sequencing, achieving read lengths of up to 1000 bases in less than 2 hours. This breakthrough paved the way for the development of automated DNA sequencing instruments, which played a crucial role in the Human Genome Project.In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing novel gel matrices with enhanced properties. Zhu et al. (2012) introduced a thermally responsive gel formed through self-assembly, which exhibited excellent separation performance for proteins and DNA. This type of smart gel allows for easy loading and removal of samples, as well as in-situ gel formation, offering new possibilities for on-chip electrophoresis applications.Another area of active research is the development of selective polymers with added functionality. Liu et al. (2018) reported a novel gel matrix incorporating affinity ligands for the selective capture and separation of glycoproteins. This approach combines the high-resolution separation capabilities of gel electrophoresis with the specificity of affinity-based techniques, enabling more comprehensive analyses of complex biological samples.The application of microscale gel electrophoresis in protein analysis has been particularly impactful. Rustandi et al. (2008) demonstrated the use of CGE for the characterization of monoclonal antibodies, providing high-resolution separation of different isoforms and glycoforms. This technique has become an essential tool in the biopharmaceutical industry for quality control and product characterization.In the field of nucleic acid analysis, microscale gel electrophoresis has enabled significant advancements in both genomics and transcriptomics. Woolley and Mathies (1994) developed a microfabricated device for DNA sequencing using polyacrylamide gels, demonstrating the potential for miniaturization and integration of electrophoresis systems. More recently, Niu and Saraf (2021) reported a microfluidic gel electrophoresis system for high-throughput analysis of circulating cell-free DNA, with potential applications in liquid biopsy and cancer diagnostics.The analysis of glycans, which play crucial roles in various biological processes, has also benefited from advances in microscale gel electrophoresis. Kuo et al. (2013) developed a CGE method for the separation and quantification of N-glycans released from glycoproteins, providing a powerful tool for glycomics research and biopharmaceutical analysis.Emerging trends in microscale gel electrophoresis include the development of multifunctional assays for real-time biochemical processing. Cheng et al. (2020) reported a microfluidic device integrating gel electrophoresis with on-chip enzymatic reactions, enabling simultaneous separation and modification of biomolecules. This approach opens up new possibilities for studying dynamic biological processes and developing high-throughput screening assays.The integration of three-dimensional (3D) gel matrices in microfluidic devices represents another frontier in microscale electrophoresis. Sommer et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of 3D-printed hydrogel matrices for protein separations, offering unprecedented control over pore size distribution and channel geometry.In conclusion, gels in microscale electrophoresis have revolutionized the field of bioanalytical chemistry, enabling high-resolution separations of a wide range of biomolecules with minimal sample requirements. Ongoing research in novel gel formulations, selective matrices, and multifunctional assays continues to expand the capabilities and applications of this powerful analytical technique. As the field advances, microscale gel electrophoresis is poised to play an increasingly important role in various areas of life sciences, from fundamental research to clinical diagnostics and biopharmaceutical development.", "References": [{"title": "High-performance capillary electrophoresis using open tubes and gels", "authors": "Stellan Hjertén, Karin Elenbring, Ferenc Kilár, Jia-Li Liao, Anthony J.
