{"Literature Review": "Label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection have emerged as a promising approach in the field of biosensing, offering advantages such as simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and high sensitivity. This literature review aims to explore recent advancements in label-free electrochemical biosensors and their applications in disease detection.Electrochemical biosensors have gained significant attention due to their ability to provide rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of various biomarkers associated with diseases. Traditional biosensors often rely on labeled molecules for signal amplification, which can introduce complexity and increase costs. In contrast, label-free electrochemical biosensors offer a more straightforward approach by directly measuring changes in electrical properties upon target binding, eliminating the need for additional labeling steps [1].One of the primary mechanisms employed in label-free electrochemical biosensing is the blocking of the electrode surface. This approach involves immobilizing biorecognition elements, such as antibodies or aptamers, on the electrode surface. When target molecules bind to these elements, they create a physical barrier that impedes electron transfer, resulting in measurable changes in electrochemical signals [2]. For instance, Xu et al. developed a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using gold nanoparticles modified with anti-PSA antibodies. The binding of PSA to the antibodies led to a decrease in the electrochemical signal, allowing for sensitive detection of PSA in clinical samples [3].Another mechanism utilized in label-free electrochemical biosensing involves allowing greater access to the electrode surface. This approach often employs nanomaterials or conductive polymers to enhance the electrode's surface area and conductivity. When target molecules bind to the modified surface, they can facilitate electron transfer, resulting in an increase in the electrochemical signal [4]. Zhang et al. demonstrated this concept by developing a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of thrombin using graphene oxide-gold nanoparticle composites. The binding of thrombin to the aptamer-modified electrode surface led to an increase in the electrochemical signal, enabling sensitive and specific detection [5].A third mechanism involves changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity of a redox probe to a biorecognition unit. This approach relies on the interaction between a redox-active molecule and the target analyte, which alters the electrochemical properties of the system [6]. For example, Gao et al. developed a label-free electrochemical DNA sensor for the detection of microRNA using a ferrocene-labeled peptide nucleic acid probe. The binding of the target microRNA to the probe resulted in a change in the redox behavior of ferrocene, allowing for quantitative detection [7].The fourth mechanism focuses on modulating ion or electron transport properties due to conformational and surface charge changes. This approach exploits the changes in the electrical properties of the biosensor surface upon target binding, which can be measured through techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [8]. Li et al. utilized this mechanism to develop a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The binding of CEA to the aptamer-modified electrode surface led to changes in the electron transfer resistance, enabling sensitive detection of CEA in clinical samples [9].Recent advancements in label-free electrochemical biosensing have focused on improving sensitivity, selectivity, and multiplexing capabilities. Nanomaterials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and metal nanoparticles, have been extensively explored to enhance the performance of these biosensors. These materials offer large surface areas, excellent conductivity, and unique electronic properties, which can significantly improve the sensitivity and detection limits of label-free electrochemical biosensors [10].Furthermore, the integration of machine learning algorithms with label-free electrochemical biosensors has shown great potential for enhancing disease detection and diagnosis. Machine learning techniques can analyze complex electrochemical data patterns, enabling more accurate and reliable interpretation of biosensor signals. This approach has been particularly useful in multiplex analysis, where multiple biomarkers are simultaneously detected and analyzed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease states.In conclusion, label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection have demonstrated significant progress in recent years. The four main mechanisms discussed in this review offer unique advantages and have been successfully applied to detect various disease biomarkers. The integration of nanomaterials and machine learning algorithms has further enhanced the capabilities of these biosensors. As research in this field continues to advance, label-free electrochemical biosensors are poised to play a crucial role in point-of-care diagnostics and personalized medicine, offering rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective solutions for disease detection and monitoring.", "References": [{"title": "Label-free electrochemical biosensors for clinical diagnostics", "authors": "Justino, Celine I.
