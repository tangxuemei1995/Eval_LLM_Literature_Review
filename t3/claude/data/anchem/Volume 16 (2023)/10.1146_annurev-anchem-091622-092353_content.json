{"Literature Review": "Proteomics, the large-scale study of proteins, has revolutionized our understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. The field has rapidly evolved over the past two decades, with significant advancements in analytical techniques, particularly mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches. One of the key developments that has propelled proteomics research forward is the concept of multiplexing, which allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples in a single experiment. This review focuses on the progress and current state of enhanced multiplexing technology in proteomics, highlighting its importance, advantages, and limitations.Multiplexing in proteomics refers to the ability to analyze multiple samples concurrently, typically through the use of chemical labels or tags that allow for sample differentiation during analysis. The evolution of multiplexing techniques has been remarkable, progressing from early dual-sample comparisons to current methods capable of analyzing over 50 samples simultaneously [1]. This advancement has given rise to the terms 'enhanced multiplexing' or 'hyperplexing' for studies involving more than 10 samples.The development of isobaric labeling techniques has been pivotal in enabling enhanced multiplexing. Tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) are among the most widely used approaches [2]. These methods involve the chemical modification of peptides with tags of identical mass but different fragmentation patterns, allowing for sample differentiation during MS/MS analysis. The latest iterations of TMT reagents, such as TMTpro, can accommodate up to 16 samples in a single experiment [3].Another significant advancement in multiplexing technology is the development of combinatorial isobaric labeling strategies. Methods like NeuCode SILAC and mTRAQ combine metabolic labeling with isobaric tags to achieve higher levels of multiplexing [4]. These approaches have pushed the boundaries of sample multiplexing, with some studies reporting the ability to analyze up to 54 samples simultaneously [5].The benefits of enhanced multiplexing in proteomics are numerous. Firstly, it allows for increased sample throughput, reducing overall experiment time and cost. This is particularly advantageous for large-scale studies involving multiple conditions or time points. Secondly, multiplexing improves quantitative accuracy by minimizing run-to-run variations, as all samples are analyzed under identical conditions [6]. This leads to more robust statistical comparisons and increased confidence in identifying differentially expressed proteins.Furthermore, enhanced multiplexing facilitates the analysis of limited or precious samples by reducing the amount of material required per condition. This is especially valuable in clinical proteomics, where patient samples may be scarce [7]. The ability to analyze multiple samples simultaneously also enables more complex experimental designs, such as time-course studies or the comparison of multiple treatment conditions, providing a more comprehensive view of biological systems.However, enhanced multiplexing is not without challenges. As the number of multiplexed samples increases, so does the complexity of the resulting mass spectra. This can lead to issues such as increased interference between co-eluting peptides and reduced proteome coverage [8]. To address these challenges, researchers have developed advanced data acquisition and analysis strategies, including MS3-based methods and ion mobility separations, which help to improve peptide identification and quantification in highly multiplexed samples [9].Another limitation of current multiplexing approaches is the potential for ratio compression, where the observed fold changes between samples are underestimated due to the presence of contaminating ions. This issue becomes more pronounced as the degree of multiplexing increases. Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate ratio compression, including the use of complement ions and gas-phase purification techniques [10].Despite these challenges, the field of enhanced multiplexing in proteomics continues to advance rapidly. Emerging technologies, such as single-cell proteomics and spatial proteomics, are benefiting from multiplexing strategies to increase throughput and enable more comprehensive analyses. Additionally, the integration of multiplexing techniques with other omics approaches, such as genomics and metabolomics, is paving the way for multi-omics studies that provide a more holistic view of biological systems.In conclusion, enhanced multiplexing technology has become an indispensable tool in proteomics research, enabling high-throughput, accurate, and cost-effective analysis of complex biological samples. As the field continues to evolve, we can expect further improvements in multiplexing capacity, quantitative accuracy, and data analysis strategies. These advancements will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of protein dynamics in health and disease, ultimately leading to new insights and therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Multiplexed proteomics: the principles of multiplexed quantitative proteomics", "authors": "Ting, Lily, Rad, Ramin, Gygi, Steven P., Haas, Wilhelm", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2011", "volumes": "8", "first page": "24", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.1557"}, {"title": "Quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags", "authors": "Thompson, Andrew, Schäfer, Jürgen, Kuhn, Karsten, Kienle, Stefan, Schwarz, Josef, Schmidt, Günter, Neumann, Thomas, Hamon, Christian", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2003", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1895", "last page": "1904", "DOI": "10.1021/ac0262560"}, {"title": "TMTpro: Design, Synthesis, and Initial Evaluation of a Proline-Based Isobaric 16-Plex Tandem Mass Tag Reagent Set", "authors": "Li, Jing, Van Vranken, Jonathan G., Pontano Vaites, Laura, Schweppe, Devin K., Huttlin, Edward L., Etienne, Celine, Nandhikonda, Premchendar, Viner, Rosa, Robitaille, Aaron M., Thompson, Andrew H., Kuhn, Karsten, Gygi, Steven P.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "92", "first page": "2478", "last page": "2486", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b04474"}, {"title": "Multiplexed proteomics for high-throughput quantitative analysis of cellular systems", "authors": "Dephoure, Noah, Gygi, Steven P.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Biotechnology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "23", "first page": "607", "last page": "612", "DOI": "10.1016/j.copbio.2012.01.018"}, {"title": "Hyperplexing: A Method for Higher-Order Multiplexed Quantitative Proteomics Provides a Strategy for Analyzing Post-translational Modifications and Protein Isoforms", "authors": "Everley, Robert A., Kunz, Ryan C., McAllister, Fiona E., Gygi, Steven P.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2013", "volumes": "85", "first page": "5340", "last page": "5346", "DOI": "10.1021/ac400633g"}, {"title": "Multiplexed Proteomics: The Advantages of Quantitative, Isobaric Labeling", "authors": "Rauniyar, Navin, Yates, John R.", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research", "year": "2014", "volumes": "13", "first page": "5293", "last page": "5309", "DOI": "10.1021/pr500880b"}, {"title": "Clinical proteomics: A need to define the field and to begin to set adequate standards", "authors": "Mischak, Harald, Apweiler, Rolf, Banks, Rosamonde E., Conaway, Mark, Coon, Joshua, Dominiczak, Anna, Ehrich, Jochen H.
