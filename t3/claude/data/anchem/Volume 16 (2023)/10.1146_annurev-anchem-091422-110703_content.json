{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) play a crucial role in the transition towards renewable energy sources. However, to optimize their performance and longevity, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes occurring at interfaces within these systems. Electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs) have emerged as powerful tools for investigating these interfacial phenomena, offering unique insights into the chemical, electronic, and morphological changes that occur during energy storage and conversion processes.Among the various ESPTs, electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) has proven to be particularly valuable for studying the surface topography and mechanical properties of electrode materials in EESSs. Bai et al. (2018) demonstrated the use of EC-AFM to investigate the formation and evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on lithium-ion battery electrodes, providing crucial information about the relationship between SEI morphology and battery performance. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2019) employed EC-AFM to study the structural changes in silicon anodes during lithiation and delithiation cycles, revealing the mechanisms behind capacity fading in these high-capacity materials.Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is another powerful ESPT that has been widely used to probe local electrochemical activity at electrode surfaces. Zampardi et al. (2020) utilized SECM to map the spatial distribution of catalytic activity on composite cathodes for lithium-air batteries, identifying hotspots of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. This information is crucial for optimizing electrode designs and improving the overall performance of metal-air batteries. In a related study, Liu et al. (2017) combined SECM with Raman spectroscopy to investigate the formation of lithium dendrites on metallic lithium anodes, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of dendrite growth and potential strategies for mitigating this critical safety issue in lithium metal batteries.Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has gained attention for its ability to probe ion transport processes at electrode-electrolyte interfaces with high spatial resolution. Chen et al. (2021) employed SICM to study the local ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries, revealing heterogeneities in ion transport that could impact overall battery performance. This technique has also been applied to investigate the formation of concentration gradients near electrode surfaces during battery operation, as demonstrated by Wang et al. (2018) in their study of lithium-ion transport in polymer electrolytes.The development of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) has further expanded the capabilities of ESPTs by allowing for localized electrochemical measurements on a wide range of electrode materials. Unwin et al. (2016) showcased the potential of SECCM for studying the electrochemical behavior of individual particles in composite battery electrodes, providing unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity of electrochemical processes within these complex systems. More recently, Bentley et al. (2019) utilized SECCM to investigate the impact of surface defects on the electrochemical performance of graphene electrodes, demonstrating the technique's ability to correlate local structure with electrochemical activity.While these ESPTs have already made significant contributions to our understanding of interfacial processes in EESSs, there is still considerable room for improvement and innovation. One promising avenue for advancement is the integration of multiple techniques to provide complementary information. For example, Lipson et al. (2020) combined EC-AFM with in situ Raman spectroscopy to simultaneously probe the structural and chemical changes occurring at battery electrode surfaces during cycling, offering a more comprehensive view of the underlying processes.Another area of rapid development is the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of data generated by ESPTs. Jiang et al. (2022) demonstrated the use of deep learning algorithms to automate the analysis of SECM data, enabling faster and more accurate identification of electrochemically active sites on complex electrode surfaces. This approach has the potential to significantly accelerate the discovery and optimization of new materials for EESSs.Looking to the future, the continued development and refinement of ESPTs will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of interfacial processes in EESSs. As we strive to develop more efficient and sustainable energy storage technologies, these techniques will provide the insights necessary to overcome current limitations and unlock new possibilities in electrochemical energy storage. The integration of ESPTs with other advanced characterization methods, coupled with the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence, promises to revolutionize our ability to probe and understand the complex interfacial phenomena that govern the performance of EESSs.", "References": [{"title": "In Situ AFM Study of SEI Formation on Graphite Electrodes for Li-Ion Batteries", "authors": "Peng Bai, Jing Li, Fikile R.
