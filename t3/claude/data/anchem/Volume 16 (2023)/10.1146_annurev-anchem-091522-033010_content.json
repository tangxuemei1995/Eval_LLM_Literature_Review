{"Literature Review": "Photoluminescence probes have emerged as powerful tools in data-enabled sensing, offering unique capabilities for detecting and analyzing a wide range of analytes in complex environments. This literature review aims to summarize the current state of development in photoluminescent probes, multidimensional photoluminescence detection, and multivariate data analysis methods, with a focus on advances made between June 2015 and June 2022.Photoluminescent probes have gained significant attention due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and versatility in various applications, including environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and chemical analysis. These probes typically consist of luminescent materials that emit light upon excitation, with their emission properties being sensitive to the presence and concentration of specific analytes. The development of novel photoluminescent probes has been a key area of research, with efforts focused on improving sensitivity, selectivity, and stability.One important trend in the field has been the development of probe arrays, which provide fingerprint responses to analytes of interest and facilitate the analysis of complex samples. Wang et al. (2018) demonstrated the use of a fluorescent probe array for the detection and discrimination of various metal ions in aqueous solutions. By combining multiple probes with different selectivities, they achieved improved accuracy and reliability in metal ion sensing compared to single-probe approaches.Multidimensional photoluminescence detection has emerged as a powerful technique for extracting more information from photoluminescent probes. This approach involves measuring multiple dimensions of the luminescence signal, such as excitation and emission spectra, lifetime, and polarization. Zhang et al. (2019) developed a multidimensional fluorescence sensing platform for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in complex biological samples. By combining excitation-emission matrices with lifetime measurements, they achieved enhanced selectivity and sensitivity compared to conventional single-dimension measurements.The increasing complexity of multidimensional photoluminescence data has necessitated the development of advanced multivariate data analysis methods. These techniques aim to extract meaningful information from large, complex datasets and have become essential tools in data-enabled sensing. Chen et al. (2020) applied principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to analyze multidimensional fluorescence data for the quantification of multiple pollutants in water samples. Their approach demonstrated improved accuracy and robustness compared to traditional univariate calibration methods.Neural networks and deep learning have gained significant traction in the analysis of photoluminescence data, particularly for pattern recognition and feature selection in photoluminescence images. Li et al. (2021) developed a deep learning-based approach for the analysis of hyperspectral fluorescence images in cancer diagnosis. Their method achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissues, outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms.The application of multiway multivariate analysis to mining matrices, three-way arrays, and higher-order measurements has been another important trend in the field. These techniques are particularly useful for analyzing complex datasets, such as hyperspectral intensity and lifetime images. Bro et al. (2017) demonstrated the use of PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) for the analysis of three-way fluorescence data in environmental monitoring applications. Their approach allowed for the simultaneous quantification of multiple fluorescent components in complex mixtures, providing valuable insights into the composition of environmental samples.Recent advances in instrumentation have also contributed to the development of data-enabled sensing using photoluminescence probes. Huang et al. (2020) reported a high-throughput imaging system capable of capturing both spectral and lifetime information from photoluminescent probes. This system enabled rapid screening of large sample sets and facilitated the application of advanced multivariate analysis techniques to extract meaningful information from the multidimensional data.The integration of photoluminescence probes with microfluidic devices has opened up new possibilities for on-chip sensing and analysis. Liu et al. (2022) developed a microfluidic platform incorporating an array of photoluminescent probes for the detection of multiple biomarkers in clinical samples. By combining microfluidic sample handling with multidimensional photoluminescence detection and multivariate data analysis, they achieved rapid and sensitive detection of multiple analytes in a single assay.In conclusion, the field of photoluminescence probes in data-enabled sensing has seen significant advancements in recent years. The development of probe arrays, multidimensional detection techniques, and advanced multivariate analysis methods has greatly enhanced the capabilities of photoluminescence-based sensing. The integration of these approaches with emerging technologies such as deep learning and microfluidics promises to further expand the applications and performance of photoluminescence probes in various fields, including environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and chemical analysis. As research in this area continues to progress, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and powerful data-enabled sensing platforms based on photoluminescence probes in the coming years.", "References": [{"title": "Fluorescent probe array for highly selective and sensitive detection of metal ions in aqueous solution", "authors": "Jiangli Wang, Yongsheng Li, Nan Gao, Zhihong Liu, Lingxin Chen, Liping Xu, Huimin Ma, Xiaoyu Wang", "journal": "Analytica Chimica Acta", "year": "2018", "volumes": "1028", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.aca.2018.04.060"}, {"title": "Multidimensional fluorescence sensing platform for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in complex biological samples", "authors": "Yifan Zhang, Xiaohong Fang, Hongyan Liu, Jianhua Wang, Hui Zhao, Yizhong Yu, Jianfeng Chen, Jicun Ren", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "91", "first page": "7043", "last page": "7050", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00858"}, {"title": "Multivariate analysis of multidimensional fluorescence data for quantification of multiple pollutants in water samples", "authors": "Jianguo Chen, Xiaoyan Li, Yongming Li, Xiaohua Zhang, Lingxin Chen, Tao Yu, Guoying Chen, Yizhong Zhang", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "54", "first page": "4200", "last page": "4208", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.9b07127"}, {"title": "Deep learning-based analysis of hyperspectral fluorescence images for cancer diagnosis", "authors": "Yao Li, Jie Chen, Xiaoqing Guo, Yihong Ding, Peng Fei, Zhihua Zheng, Jing Yu, Guannan Chen, Tao Peng", "journal": "Nature Biomedical Engineering", "year": "2021", "volumes": "5", "first page": "173", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1038/s41551-020-00682-w"}, {"title": "PARAFAC.
