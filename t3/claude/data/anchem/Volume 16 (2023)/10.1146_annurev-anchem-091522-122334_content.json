{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical additive manufacturing (EAM) has emerged as a powerful technique for fabricating micro- and nanoscale structures with unprecedented precision and versatility. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles and recent advancements in EAM, focusing on its applications in various fields such as microelectronics, sensing, robotics, and energy storage.EAM is based on the principle of electrodeposition, where metal ions in an electrolyte solution are reduced to form solid metal structures on a conductive substrate. Unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, EAM allows for the creation of complex 3D structures with high resolution and design freedom. The process typically involves the use of a movable electrode or nozzle to deposit material in a controlled manner, enabling the fabrication of intricate geometries at the micro- and nanoscale [1].One of the key advantages of EAM is its ability to work with a wide range of conductive materials, including metals, alloys, and conductive polymers. This versatility has led to its application in various fields, such as the fabrication of microelectronic components, sensors, and energy storage devices [2]. The high resolution achievable with EAM techniques makes it particularly suitable for creating structures with feature sizes ranging from several micrometers down to a few nanometers [3].Several EAM techniques have been developed to address specific challenges and requirements in micro- and nanofabrication. Meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED) is one such technique that utilizes a nanopipette to create a localized electrochemical cell at the substrate surface. By controlling the meniscus formed at the tip of the nanopipette, MCED allows for precise deposition of material with nanoscale resolution [4]. This technique has been successfully employed to create complex 3D nanostructures, such as freestanding pillars and bridges, with feature sizes as small as 50 nm [5].Another promising EAM technique is FluidFM (Fluid Force Microscopy), which combines the principles of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with microfluidics. FluidFM utilizes a hollow AFM cantilever with a microfluidic channel to deliver electrolyte solution to the substrate surface. This approach enables precise control over the deposition process and allows for the fabrication of 3D structures with high aspect ratios and complex geometries [6].Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has also been adapted for EAM applications. SICM uses a nanopipette filled with electrolyte solution to scan the substrate surface and measure local ion currents. By incorporating electrodeposition capabilities into the SICM setup, researchers have demonstrated the ability to create 3D nanostructures with sub-100 nm resolution [7].Electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP) is a relatively new EAM technique that combines electrohydrodynamic phenomena with electrochemical reactions. In EHD-RP, an electric field is applied between a nozzle and the substrate, creating a jet of electrolyte solution that carries metal ions to the deposition site. This technique allows for high-speed printing of metal structures with feature sizes ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers [8].The microstructure and properties of the deposited materials can be tailored by controlling various process parameters, such as applied potential, electrolyte composition, and deposition time. For example, by adjusting the deposition conditions, researchers have demonstrated the ability to control the grain size, crystallographic orientation, and mechanical properties of electrodeposited metals [9]. This level of control over material properties is crucial for optimizing the performance of printed structures in specific applications.Recent advancements in EAM have focused on improving the resolution, speed, and scalability of the printing process. Multi-material printing capabilities have also been developed, allowing for the fabrication of complex structures with spatially varying compositions and properties [10]. These developments have expanded the potential applications of EAM in fields such as flexible electronics, biomedical devices, and advanced energy storage systems.In conclusion, electrochemical additive manufacturing has emerged as a powerful tool for micro- and nanoscale fabrication, offering unique advantages in terms of resolution, material versatility, and design freedom. As research in this field continues to advance, it is expected that EAM will play an increasingly important role in the development of next-generation devices and technologies across a wide range of industries.", "References": [{"title": "Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (EAM) and Finishing: A Review", "authors": "Chao Xu, Qian Zhang, Yingchao Yu, Yayue Pan, Jingyan Dong", "journal": "Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering", "year": "2021", "volumes": "143", "first page": "110801", "last page": "110801", "DOI": "10.1115/1.4051175"}, {"title": "Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing: Principles and Applications", "authors": "Yingchao Yu, Chao Xu, Qian Zhang, Jingyan Dong", "journal": "Advanced Materials Technologies", "year": "2020", "volumes": "5", "first page": "2000217", "last page": "2000217", "DOI": "10.1002/admt.202000217"}, {"title": "Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing at the Nanoscale", "authors": "Dmitry Momotenko, Ashley Page, Maria Adobes-Vidal, Patrick R.
