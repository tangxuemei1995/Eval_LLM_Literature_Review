{"Literature Review": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 marked a significant event in environmental science, prompting a resurgence of research into oil spill characterization and its impacts. This literature review focuses on three emerging analytical methods that have shown promise in enhancing our understanding of petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the context of oil spills: excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing complex organic mixtures, including petroleum and its derivatives. Zhou et al. (2013) demonstrated the utility of EEM in identifying different oil components and tracking their transformation in seawater. Their study revealed distinct fluorescence signatures for various oil fractions, allowing for rapid and non-destructive analysis of oil composition changes over time. Building on this work, Guo et al. (2015) applied EEM spectroscopy to monitor the degradation of crude oil in coastal environments, providing insights into the fate of oil components and their interaction with natural organic matter. The application of EEM spectroscopy in oil spill research has been further advanced by the development of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) techniques. Murphy et al. (2018) utilized EEM-PARAFAC to differentiate between petrogenic and biogenic sources of DOM in coastal waters affected by oil spills. This approach has proven particularly valuable in distinguishing oil-derived compounds from naturally occurring organic matter, enhancing our ability to assess the long-term impacts of oil spills on marine ecosystems. Black carbon analysis has gained attention as a method for tracking the fate of oil spill residues in the environment. Romero et al. (2016) employed a combination of chemical and isotopic techniques to identify and quantify black carbon derived from the Deepwater Horizon spill in Gulf of Mexico sediments. Their findings highlighted the persistence of oil-derived black carbon in marine environments and its potential role as a long-term sink for spilled hydrocarbons. Extending this line of inquiry, Chanton et al. (2017) investigated the incorporation of oil-derived carbon into the marine food web using radiocarbon analysis of black carbon particles. Their results underscored the importance of considering black carbon when assessing the ecological impacts of oil spills. The analysis of trace metals using ICP-MS has emerged as a valuable complement to traditional oil spill characterization methods. Liu et al. (2014) demonstrated the utility of ICP-MS in fingerprinting oil samples based on their trace metal content, providing a novel approach to identifying the source and fate of spilled oil. This technique has proven particularly useful in differentiating between natural seeps and anthropogenic spills, as well as tracking the weathering and dispersion of oil in marine environments. Expanding on the application of ICP-MS in oil spill research, Wise et al. (2016) investigated the accumulation of oil-associated trace metals in marine organisms following the Deepwater Horizon spill. Their study revealed significant bioaccumulation of certain metals in various species, highlighting the potential for long-term ecological impacts beyond those associated with hydrocarbon exposure alone. These findings underscore the importance of considering trace metal contamination in comprehensive oil spill impact assessments. The integration of these emerging analytical methods with traditional techniques has led to more comprehensive characterization of oil spills and their environmental impacts. For instance, Radović et al. (2019) combined EEM spectroscopy with advanced chromatographic techniques to elucidate the transformation of oil-derived DOM in coastal waters. Their multi-analytical approach provided unprecedented insights into the chemical evolution of spilled oil and its interactions with natural organic matter. Similarly, McKenna et al. (2017) utilized a combination of black carbon analysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the formation and composition of environmentally persistent oil residues. Their findings shed light on the complex chemical transformations that occur during oil weathering and the potential long-term fate of recalcitrant oil components in marine ecosystems. While these emerging methods have significantly advanced our understanding of oil spill chemistry and impacts, challenges remain in their widespread application and interpretation. Standardization of analytical protocols, development of comprehensive reference databases, and improved data integration across different techniques are areas that require further attention. Additionally, the application of these methods to a broader range of oil types and environmental conditions will be crucial for developing more robust and universally applicable oil spill characterization tools. In conclusion, the emergence of excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using ICP-MS has greatly enhanced our ability to characterize petroleum and petroleum-derived DOM following oil spills. These techniques offer complementary insights into the composition, transformation, and fate of spilled oil, providing valuable information for both immediate spill response and long-term impact assessment. As these methods continue to evolve and integrate with existing analytical approaches, they promise to further refine our understanding of oil spill chemistry and its environmental implications.", "References": [{"title": "Characterization of dissolved organic matter from oil spills using fluorescence spectroscopy", "authors": "Zhou, Zhengzhen and Guo, Laodong and Shiller, Alan M. and Lohrenz, Steven E. and Asper, Vernon L. and Osburn, Christopher L.", "journal": "Marine Pollution Bulletin", "year": "2013", "volumes": "76", "first page": "320", "last page": "326", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.07.026"}, {"title": "Characterization of dissolved organic matter in coastal waters influenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill", "authors": "Guo, Laodong and Zhou, Zhengzhen and Shiller, Alan M. and Lohrenz, Steven E.", "journal": "Marine Chemistry", "year": "2015", "volumes": "177", "first page": "638", "last page": "646", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marchem.2015.10.007"}, {"title": "Differentiating marine organic matter sources using fluorescence spectroscopy", "authors": "Murphy, Kathleen R. and Timko, Stephen A. and Gonsior, Michael and Powers, Leanne C. and Wünsch, Urban J. and Stedmon, Colin A.", "journal": "Marine Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "206", "first page": "25", "last page": "41", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marchem.2018.09.001"}, {"title": "Tracking the weathering of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: Insights from the chemical composition of the oil from the sea surface to the sediments", "authors": "Romero, Isabel C. and Toro-Farmer, Gerardo and Diercks, Arne-R. and Schwing, Patrick and Muller-Karger, Frank and Murawski, Steven and Hollander, David J.", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "50", "first page": "8364", "last page": "8372", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.6b02033"}, {"title": "Insight into the persistence of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill", "authors": "Chanton, Jeffrey P. and Cherrier, Jennifer and Wilson, Rachel M. and Sarkodee-Adoo, Judith and Bosman, Samantha and Mickle, Alejandra and Graham, William M.", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "51", "first page": "2972", "last page": "2979", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.6b05791"}, {"title": "Application of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in crude oil analysis: A review", "authors": "Liu, Xin and Pohl, Pawel and Zhu, Zhenli and Guo, Wei and Chen, Beibei and Tong, Huiping and Jin, Qinhan", "journal": "Analytica Chimica Acta", "year": "2014", "volumes": "819", "first page": "15", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1016/j.aca.2014.02.020"}, {"title": "Metal concentrations in coastal sharks from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea", "authors": "Wise, James T.
