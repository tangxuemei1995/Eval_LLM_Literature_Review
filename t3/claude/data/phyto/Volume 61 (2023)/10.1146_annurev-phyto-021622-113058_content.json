{"Literature Review": "Plant-parasitic nematodes represent a significant threat to global agricultural productivity, contributing substantially to the estimated 30% yield loss caused by biotic constraints worldwide. These microscopic pests, often operating unseen below ground, pose a complex challenge for farmers and researchers alike. This literature review explores the multifaceted approach of Integrated Nematode Management (INM) in the context of a rapidly changing world, addressing key aspects such as biotic and abiotic constraints, production system modifications, agricultural policies, the microbiome, genetic solutions, and remote sensing technologies.Biotic and abiotic constraints play a crucial role in exacerbating nematode damage. Soilborne pathogens, for instance, can interact synergistically with nematodes, leading to more severe crop losses than either pest alone would cause. Castillo et al. (2003) demonstrated this phenomenon in their study on the interaction between root-knot nematodes and Fusarium wilt in chickpea. Similarly, abiotic factors such as soil fertility degradation and climate variability can increase plant susceptibility to nematode infestations. Jones et al. (2013) provided a comprehensive review of how climate change is likely to affect plant-parasitic nematode populations and their impacts on crop production.The modification of production systems is an essential component of INM. Crop rotation, intercropping, and the use of cover crops have shown promise in managing nematode populations. Thoden et al. (2011) reviewed the potential of various cover crops for nematode management, highlighting their role in enhancing soil health and suppressing plant-parasitic nematodes. However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary depending on the specific nematode species and local conditions, necessitating a tailored approach.Agricultural policies play a significant role in shaping the development and implementation of INM strategies. Restrictions on certain pesticides, for example, have led to increased research into alternative management methods. Hillocks (2012) discussed the impact of pesticide regulations on nematode management in Europe, emphasizing the need for policy-driven innovation in sustainable pest control.The soil microbiome has emerged as a critical factor in nematode management. Beneficial microorganisms can enhance plant resistance to nematodes and even directly antagonize these pests. Sikora et al. (2018) provided an extensive overview of how rhizosphere microorganisms can be harnessed for biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes. This area of research holds great promise for developing sustainable INM strategies.Genetic solutions, including traditional breeding and modern genome editing techniques, offer powerful tools for nematode management. Resistant cultivars have long been a cornerstone of INM, but the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has opened up new possibilities for rapid development of nematode-resistant crops. Kyndt et al. (2019) reviewed the current state and future prospects of genetic engineering for nematode resistance in crops, highlighting both the potential and the challenges of this approach.Remote sensing technologies are increasingly being applied to nematode management. These tools can help detect nematode infestations early, allowing for more targeted and efficient control measures. Hillnhütter et al. (2011) demonstrated the potential of hyperspectral reflectance measurements for detecting nematode damage in sugar beet, illustrating the power of this emerging technology.The integration of these various approaches is crucial for effective INM. However, significant disparities exist between the Global North and Global South in terms of access to advanced technologies and resources for nematode management. Addressing these inequalities is essential for improving global food security. Coyne et al. (2018) discussed the challenges and opportunities for nematode management in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing the need for context-specific solutions and knowledge transfer.Looking to the future, the development of INM strategies must consider the complex interactions between nematodes, their host plants, and the broader ecosystem. This holistic approach, combined with advances in technology and a deeper understanding of nematode biology, offers the best hope for sustainable and effective management of these persistent pests. As we face the challenges of feeding a growing global population in a changing climate, improving INM across all scales of agricultural production will be critical to ensuring food security and human well-being.", "References": [{"title": "Interactions between root-knot nematodes and Fusarium wilt fungi in chickpea genotypes", "authors": "Pablo Castillo, Juan A.
