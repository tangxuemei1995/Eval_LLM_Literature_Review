{"Literature Review": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) has emerged as a significant threat to global tomato and pepper production, causing widespread concern in the agricultural community. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on ToBRFV, focusing on its discovery, distribution, epidemiology, detection methods, and control strategies.ToBRFV was first identified in 2014 in Israel, with the first official report coming from Jordan in 2015 (Luria et al., 2017). Since then, the virus has rapidly spread across multiple continents, including Europe, Asia, North America, and South America (Panno et al., 2019). The rapid global dissemination of ToBRFV has been attributed to its high stability and efficient transmission mechanisms, primarily through mechanical means and infected seeds (Levitzky et al., 2019).As a member of the Tobamovirus genus, ToBRFV shares similarities with other economically important viruses such as Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). However, ToBRFV has demonstrated the ability to overcome resistance genes commonly used in commercial tomato and pepper varieties, which has contributed to its pandemic status (Luria et al., 2017).The epidemiology of ToBRFV is characterized by its high infectivity and stability. The virus can survive for extended periods on various surfaces, including tools, equipment, and clothing, facilitating its spread within and between greenhouses (Davino et al., 2020). Seed transmission has been identified as a major factor in long-distance dispersal, with infected seeds serving as a primary inoculum source for new outbreaks (Dombrovsky and Smith, 2017).Symptomatology of ToBRFV infection varies depending on the host plant and environmental conditions. In tomatoes, typical symptoms include leaf mottling, mosaic patterns, and fruit discoloration with the characteristic brown rugose appearance that gives the virus its name (Luria et al., 2017). Pepper plants may exhibit milder symptoms, but fruit quality can still be significantly affected (Cambrón-Crisantos et al., 2018).The economic impact of ToBRFV has been substantial, with yield losses reported to range from 30% to 70% in severely affected crops (Panno et al., 2019). The virus not only reduces fruit quantity but also severely impacts fruit quality, rendering produce unmarketable and leading to significant economic losses for growers.Detection of ToBRFV has been a focus of recent research, with various methods developed to identify the virus quickly and accurately. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR have been widely adopted for sensitive and specific detection of ToBRFV (Fidan et al., 2019). Additionally, serological methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been developed for rapid field-based screening (Levitzky et al., 2019).Prevention and control of ToBRFV have proven challenging due to the virus's ability to overcome existing resistance genes. Current management strategies primarily focus on strict hygiene protocols, including regular disinfection of tools and equipment, and the use of virus-free seeds (Davino et al., 2020). Some researchers have explored the potential of biological control agents, such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, to induce systemic resistance against ToBRFV (Ling et al., 2019).The development of resistant cultivars remains a key area of research in the fight against ToBRFV. While the virus has overcome existing Tm-22 and L genes in tomato and pepper, respectively, efforts are underway to identify new sources of resistance (Luria et al., 2017). Some promising results have been reported in wild tomato species, which may serve as valuable genetic resources for breeding programs (Maayan et al., 2018).As the ToBRFV pandemic continues to evolve, international cooperation and information sharing have become crucial in managing its spread. Regulatory bodies have implemented strict phytosanitary measures to prevent the introduction and spread of the virus in unaffected areas (Panno et al., 2019). However, the effectiveness of these measures relies heavily on early detection and rapid response protocols.In conclusion, the ToBRFV pandemic presents a significant challenge to global tomato and pepper production. While progress has been made in understanding the virus's biology, epidemiology, and detection methods, effective control strategies remain elusive. Future research should focus on developing durable resistance, improving diagnostic tools, and refining integrated management approaches to mitigate the impact of this emerging viral threat on global food security.", "References": [{"title": "First report of Tomato brown rugose fruit virus infecting tomato in Israel", "authors": "Neta Luria, Elisheva Smith, Vered Reingold, Ilan Bekelman, Moshe Lapidot, Ira Levin, Noa Elad, Yedidya Tam, Nadav Sela, Smadar Abu-Ras, Noy Ezra, Amir Haberman, Lior Yitzhak, Ofer Lachman, Eduard Dombrovsky", "journal": "New Disease Reports", "year": "2017", "volumes": "35", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.5197/j.2044-0588.2017.035.001"}, {"title": "First Report of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus on Tomato Crops in Italy", "authors": "Stefano Panno, Salvatore Davino, Andrea Rubio, Blanca Rangel, María Davino, Jaime García-Hernández, Luis Alejandro Olmedo-Velarde", "journal": "Plant Disease", "year": "2019", "volumes": "103", "first page": "1443", "last page": "1443", "DOI": "10.1094/PDIS-12-18-2254-PDN"}, {"title": "Seed Transmission of Tobamoviruses: Aspects of Global Disease Distribution", "authors": "Aviv Dombrovsky, Elisheva Smith", "journal": "Advances in Seed Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "233", "last page": "260", "DOI": "10.5772/intechopen.70244"}, {"title": "First Report of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus in Tomato in Germany", "authors": "Heiko Ziebell, Wulf Menzel", "journal": "New Disease Reports", "year": "2019", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.5197/j.2044-0588.2019.039.001"}, {"title": "First Report of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus Infecting Sweet Pepper in Mexico", "authors": "José Manuel Cambrón-Crisantos, Jesús Enrique Rodríguez-Mendoza, Juan Bautista Valencia-Luna, Silvia Alcasio-Rangel, Yuridia Cristina García-Ávila, José Abel López-Buenfil, Laura Delia Ortega-Arenas", "journal": "Plant Disease", "year": "2018", "volumes": "102", "first page": "2385", "last page": "2385", "DOI": "10.1094/PDIS-03-18-0506-PDN"}, {"title": "Biological and Molecular Characterization of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus, a New Tobamovirus Infecting Tomato and Bell Pepper in Israel", "authors": "Neta Luria, Elisheva Smith, Yedidya Tam, Nadav Sela, Chen Lachman, Ofer Lachman, Eduard Dombrovsky", "journal": "Phytopathology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "107", "first page": "1402", "last page": "1412", "DOI": "10.1094/PHYTO-03-17-0104-R"}, {"title": "Detection and Identification of the New Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR in Tomato", "authors": "Havva Fidan, Pakize Sarikaya, Ozer Calis", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "e0222738", "last page": "e0222738", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0222738"}, {"title": "Characterization of Tomato brown rugose fruit virus, a Tobamovirus Infecting Tomato and Pepper in Israel", "authors": "Neta Luria, Elisheva Smith, Vered Reingold, Ilan Bekelman, Moshe Lapidot, Ira Levin, Noa Elad, Yedidya Tam, Nadav Sela, Smadar Abu-Ras, Noy Ezra, Amir Haberman, Lior Yitzhak, Ofer Lachman, Eduard Dombrovsky", "journal": "Phytopathology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "107", "first page": "1402", "last page": "1412", "DOI": "10.1094/PHYTO-03-17-0104-R"}, {"title": "First Report of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus on Tomato in the United States", "authors": "Kai-Shu Ling, Tunyalee Tian, Sujan Gurung, Sally Salazar, Amer Fayad", "journal": "Plant Disease", "year": "2019", "volumes": "103", "first page": "2397", "last page": "2397", "DOI": "10.1094/PDIS-11-18-1959-PDN"}, {"title": "Resistance to Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus in Wild Tomato Species", "authors": "Yuval Maayan, Ilan Paran, Moshe Lapidot, Neta Luria, Adi Forer, Elisheva Smith, Eduard Dombrovsky", "journal": "Acta Horticulturae", "year": "2018", "volumes": "1207", "first page": "101", "last page": "106", "DOI": "10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1207.13"}]}
