{"Literature Review": "The global forest health crisis represents a significant challenge to ecological sustainability, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. This crisis, primarily driven by the introduction of non-native pathogens and insects through global trade, has emerged as a critical public-good social dilemma requiring international collective action. This literature review aims to explore the various facets of this crisis, its impacts, and potential solutions through the lens of collective action principles.Forests play a crucial role in maintaining global ecological balance, providing essential ecosystem services, and supporting biodiversity. However, these vital ecosystems are increasingly threatened by invasive pests and pathogens, which have been inadvertently introduced through international trade and travel (Lovett et al., 2016). The scale and severity of this threat have led to what is now recognized as a global forest health crisis, with potentially devastating consequences for both natural ecosystems and human societies.The introduction of non-native forest pests is closely linked to the intensification of global trade. Aukema et al. (2011) estimated that approximately 70% of damaging forest insects and pathogens in the United States are non-native, with the majority introduced as a result of international commerce. This trend is not limited to the United States; similar patterns have been observed in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world (Santini et al., 2013).The impacts of these invasive species on forest ecosystems are multifaceted and often severe. They can lead to widespread tree mortality, alter forest structure and composition, and disrupt ecosystem processes (Boyd et al., 2013). For instance, the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) has caused extensive mortality of ash trees in North America, with cascading effects on forest ecosystems and the services they provide (Herms and McCullough, 2014).The forest health crisis extends beyond ecological impacts, affecting human societies in various ways. Forests provide numerous ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, and recreational opportunities. The degradation of forest health threatens these services, with potential economic and social consequences. Pimentel et al. (2005) estimated that the economic costs of invasive species in forests and other ecosystems in the United States alone exceed $120 billion annually.Climate change further exacerbates the forest health crisis by altering the distribution of both native and invasive species, potentially creating new opportunities for pest establishment and spread (Sturrock et al., 2011). This interaction between climate change and biological invasions adds another layer of complexity to the challenge of maintaining forest health.Addressing the global forest health crisis requires a shift in approach, moving from reactive management to proactive prevention and early intervention. However, this shift faces several challenges, including the public-good nature of forest health. Forest health benefits are often diffuse and shared by many, while the costs of prevention and management are typically borne by specific entities or governments. This creates a classic social dilemma, where individual interests may not align with collective benefits (Ostrom, 2015).To overcome this dilemma, a collective action framework is necessary. Such a framework should incorporate principles of broad stakeholder engagement, accountability, support for weakest-link partners, and comprehensive valuation of forest ecosystems. Marzano et al. (2017) emphasized the importance of stakeholder engagement in invasive species management, highlighting how inclusive approaches can build trust and facilitate more effective interventions.Accountability for pest introductions is another crucial aspect of collective action. While challenging to implement, mechanisms that hold entities responsible for inadvertently introducing harmful species could create stronger incentives for biosecurity measures. This approach aligns with the polluter-pays principle, which has been successfully applied in other environmental contexts (Perrings et al., 2002).Support for weakest-link partners is essential in a globalized world where the effectiveness of biosecurity measures is often limited by the least prepared participant. Developing countries, in particular, may lack the resources and capacity to implement robust forest health management strategies. International cooperation and resource sharing can help address these disparities and strengthen global forest health resilience (Chornesky et al., 2005).Incorporating the intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems into risk assessment and decision-making processes is crucial for developing more comprehensive and effective forest health strategies. Traditional economic analyses often undervalue the full range of ecosystem services provided by forests, leading to suboptimal management decisions. Integrating these broader values can help justify more substantial investments in forest health protection and management (Costanza et al., 2014).In conclusion, addressing the global forest health crisis requires a paradigm shift towards proactive, collective action. This approach must be grounded in scientific understanding, stakeholder engagement, and a comprehensive valuation of forest ecosystems. By adopting such a framework, we can work towards more resilient forest ecosystems and sustainable management practices in the face of ongoing global changes.", "References": [{"title": "Nonnative forest insects and pathogens in the United States: Impacts and policy options", "authors": "Gary M.
