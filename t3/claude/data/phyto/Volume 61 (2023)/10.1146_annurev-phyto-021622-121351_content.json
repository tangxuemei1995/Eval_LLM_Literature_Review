{"Literature Review": "Kitaviruses have emerged as a fascinating group of plant-infecting viruses that challenge our understanding of viral pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions. This literature review aims to explore the current knowledge on kitaviruses, their unique characteristics, and their impact on plant health and agriculture.Kitaviruses belong to the family Kitaviridae, which is characterized by multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments (Freitas-Astúa et al., 2018). The family is divided into three genera: Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, each with distinct genomic organizations (Quito-Avila et al., 2021). This diversity in genomic structure highlights the complexity and adaptability of kitaviruses within their host environments.One of the most intriguing aspects of kitaviruses is their atypical infection pattern. Unlike many plant viruses that cause systemic infections, kitaviruses produce locally restricted infections, often resulting in nonsystemic diseases (Ramos-González et al., 2020). This unusual behavior is thought to be a consequence of incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their host plants, which limits their ability to spread throughout the plant tissue effectively.The cell-to-cell movement of kitaviruses is facilitated by two main mechanisms. The first involves proteins belonging to the 30K family, which are well-known movement proteins in many plant viruses (Melzer et al., 2013). The second mechanism utilizes a binary movement block, considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses (Roy et al., 2015). These movement strategies, while functional, may contribute to the limited spread of kitaviruses within their host plants.Transmission of kitaviruses is primarily mediated by mites, particularly those belonging to the genus Brevipalpus (Childers et al., 2003). This vector specificity is a crucial factor in the epidemiology of kitavirus-associated diseases. Additionally, at least one species of eriophyid mite has been implicated in kitavirus transmission, expanding the range of potential vectors (Freitas-Astúa et al., 2018).The genomic structure of kitaviruses is particularly intriguing. While they encode numerous orphan open reading frames, two key components are consistently present: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a transmembrane helix-containing protein known as SP24 (Kuchibhatla et al., 2014). These conserved elements suggest a close phylogenetic relationship between kitaviruses and certain arthropod viruses, particularly those belonging to the negevirus group (Nunes et al., 2017).Kitaviruses infect a wide range of host plants, causing diseases of significant economic concern in various crops. Citrus leprosis, caused by citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C), is one of the most well-studied kitavirus diseases, affecting citrus production in South and Central America (Bastianel et al., 2010). Other important crops affected by kitaviruses include tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry (Quito-Avila et al., 2021).The economic impact of kitavirus infections can be substantial. For instance, the management of citrus leprosis in Brazil alone has been estimated to cost over $100 million annually (Bastianel et al., 2010). This high economic burden underscores the importance of understanding kitavirus biology and developing effective control strategies.Research into kitaviruses has also revealed interesting insights into virus evolution and host adaptation. The unique genomic features of kitaviruses, combined with their restricted movement within host plants, suggest a complex evolutionary history that may involve transitions between arthropod and plant hosts (Kuchibhatla et al., 2014).Despite the progress made in understanding kitaviruses, many questions remain unanswered. The mechanisms underlying their restricted movement within host plants are not fully understood, nor is the full extent of their host range and vector relationships. Additionally, the functions of many of the orphan open reading frames in kitavirus genomes remain to be elucidated.In conclusion, kitaviruses represent a unique and economically important group of plant viruses. Their atypical infection patterns, diverse genomic organizations, and specific vector relationships make them an intriguing subject for further research. As our understanding of these viruses grows, so too does the potential for developing targeted control strategies to mitigate their impact on agriculture. Future research directions may include exploring the molecular basis of kitavirus-host interactions, investigating potential resistance mechanisms in host plants, and developing novel approaches for disease management in affected crops.", "References": [{"title": "Citrus leprosis virus C infection results in hypersensitive-like response, suppression of the JA/ET plant defense pathway and promotion of the colonization of its mite vector", "authors": "Pedro L.
