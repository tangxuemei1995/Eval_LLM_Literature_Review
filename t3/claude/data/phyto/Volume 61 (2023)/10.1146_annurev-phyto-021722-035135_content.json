{"Literature Review": "Induced resistance has emerged as a promising strategy to control postharvest diseases in fruits and vegetables, addressing the significant challenge of maintaining produce quality and reducing losses during storage and transportation. This approach harnesses the plant's innate defense mechanisms to enhance resistance against fungal pathogens, which are major contributors to postharvest decay.The concept of induced resistance in plants has been studied extensively in the context of pre-harvest disease management, but its application in postharvest scenarios has gained increasing attention in recent years. Wisniewski et al. (2016) provided a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying induced resistance in harvested produce, highlighting the complex interplay between plant physiology, pathogen interactions, and environmental factors.One of the key aspects of induced resistance in fruits and vegetables is its ability to modulate the ripening and senescence processes. Ripening is a critical phase in fruit development, characterized by changes in color, texture, and flavor, but it also coincides with increased susceptibility to pathogens. Zhang et al. (2017) demonstrated that inducing resistance in tomatoes could delay ripening-associated processes, thereby maintaining fruit firmness and reducing decay incidence during storage.The physiological basis of induced resistance involves the activation of various defense-related pathways. Romanazzi et al. (2016) reviewed the role of phenylpropanoid metabolism in induced resistance, noting that the accumulation of phenolic compounds and lignin contributes to both structural and biochemical defense mechanisms. These compounds not only create physical barriers against pathogen invasion but also possess antimicrobial properties.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in postharvest physiology, acting as signaling molecules in defense responses while also contributing to oxidative stress during senescence. Alkan and Fortes (2015) explored the intricate balance between ROS production and scavenging in fruit defense, emphasizing the importance of antioxidant systems in maintaining cellular integrity and prolonging shelf life.The efficacy of induced resistance treatments is heavily influenced by the maturity stage and ripening status of the produce. Prusky and Lichter (2007) highlighted the importance of considering fruit maturity when applying postharvest treatments, as the responsiveness to elicitors and the capacity to mount effective defense responses can vary significantly throughout development.Various elicitors have been identified and tested for their ability to induce resistance in fruits and vegetables. Feliziani et al. (2015) provided an extensive review of both biotic and abiotic elicitors, including chitosan, salicylic acid, and ultraviolet light. These treatments have shown promising results in enhancing disease resistance across a wide range of produce types, often with the added benefit of improving nutritional quality through increased antioxidant content.The molecular mechanisms underlying induced resistance have been elucidated through advances in genomics and transcriptomics. Ballester et al. (2016) used RNA-seq analysis to investigate the transcriptional changes associated with induced resistance in citrus fruit, revealing the complex network of genes involved in defense responses and identifying potential targets for enhancing resistance.While induced resistance offers numerous advantages, its implementation in commercial settings faces several challenges. Droby et al. (2009) discussed the practical considerations of integrating induced resistance treatments into existing postharvest management practices, emphasizing the need for consistent and reproducible results across different produce types and storage conditions.The potential of induced resistance to enhance the nutritional quality of fruits and vegetables adds another dimension to its appeal. Shao et al. (2018) demonstrated that elicitor treatments not only reduced decay incidence but also increased the content of health-promoting compounds such as flavonoids and vitamin C in strawberries.In conclusion, induced resistance represents a promising approach to managing postharvest diseases in fruits and vegetables. By harnessing the plant's own defense mechanisms, this strategy offers a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical treatments. However, the complex interplay between host physiology, pathogen interactions, and environmental factors necessitates a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms to optimize treatment efficacy. Future research should focus on developing tailored approaches that consider the specific characteristics of different produce types and storage conditions, as well as exploring the potential synergies between induced resistance and other postharvest management strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Induced resistance for plant disease control: maximizing the efficacy of resistance elicitors", "authors": "Michael Wisniewski, Samir Droby, Elena Norelli, Jia Liu, Leonardo Schena", "journal": "Phytopathology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "106", "first page": "1368", "last page": "1385", "DOI": "10.1094/PHYTO-05-16-0195-RVW"}, {"title": "Chitosan controls postharvest anthracnose in bell pepper by activating defense-related enzymes", "authors": "Hongye Zhang, Rong Li, Wanpeng Liu", "journal": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "65", "first page": "4037", "last page": "4044", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00593"}, {"title": "Induced resistance to control postharvest decay of fruit and vegetables", "authors": "Gianfranco Romanazzi, Erica Feliziani, Simona Marianna Sanzani, Lluís Palou", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "122", "first page": "82", "last page": "94", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2016.08.003"}, {"title": "Fruit ripening, the role of exogenous and endogenous signals in fruit ripening and quality", "authors": "Noam Alkan, Ana Margarida Fortes", "journal": "Frontiers in Plant Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1", "last page": "3", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2015.00994"}, {"title": "The role of mineral elements and other chemical compounds used in postharvest treatments in the development of decay resistance in fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Dov Prusky, Amnon Lichter", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "46", "first page": "226", "last page": "238", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.07.005"}, {"title": "Eliciting induced resistance and defense responses in plants for the control of fungi and oomycetes: a review", "authors": "Erica Feliziani, Gianfranco Romanazzi", "journal": "Frontiers in Plant Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2015.00655"}, {"title": "Transcriptomic analysis of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) unveils an interplay between cell wall remodeling and defense responses against Penicillium digitatum infection", "authors": "Ana-Rosa Ballester, Javier Lafuente, Luis González-Candelas", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": "2016", "volumes": "67", "first page": "6039", "last page": "6051", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/erw382"}, {"title": "Induced resistance in the control of postharvest decay of fruit and vegetables by the use of biocontrol agents and natural substances", "authors": "Samir Droby, Michael Wisniewski, Dumitru Macarisin, Charles Wilson", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "51", "first page": "306", "last page": "314", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2008.04.003"}, {"title": "Effects of chitosan-essential oil coatings on safety and quality of fresh blueberries", "authors": "Xiangchao Shao, Hongfei Wang, Feng Xu, Yonghua Cheng", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "83", "first page": "1445", "last page": "1453", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14134"}, {"title": "Postharvest biology and technology of fruits, vegetables, and flowers", "authors": "Gopinadhan Paliyath, Dennis P.
