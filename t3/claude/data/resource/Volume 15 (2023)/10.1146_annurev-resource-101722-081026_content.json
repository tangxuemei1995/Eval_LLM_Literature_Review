{"Literature Review": "The intersection of air pollution and health outcomes has been a subject of intense research in recent years, with economists increasingly contributing to this field traditionally dominated by epidemiologists. This literature review aims to synthesize recent advances in causal inference methodologies applied to the study of air pollution's health effects, highlighting the unique contributions of economic research designs.Epidemiological studies have long established associations between air pollution exposure and various adverse health outcomes. Pope and Dockery (2006) provided a comprehensive review of the health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), demonstrating consistent links with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, these studies often rely on observational data and face challenges in establishing causal relationships due to potential confounding factors and selection bias.Economists have sought to address these limitations by employing quasi-experimental research designs that exploit natural experiments or policy changes. Chay and Greenstone (2003) pioneered this approach by using the 1981-1982 recession as an exogenous shock to air pollution levels, finding significant effects on infant mortality. This study demonstrated the potential of leveraging external events to isolate causal effects of air pollution on health.Building on this foundation, subsequent research has utilized various sources of exogenous variation in air pollution. For instance, Currie and Walker (2011) exploited the introduction of electronic toll collection systems to examine the impact of reduced traffic congestion and air pollution on infant health. Their findings revealed significant improvements in birth outcomes near toll plazas following the implementation of E-ZPass.Another innovative approach in causal inference involves the use of instrumental variables. Deryugina et al. (2019) employed wind direction as an instrument for air pollution levels, allowing them to estimate the causal effect of PM2.5 on mortality and healthcare costs among the elderly Medicare population. This method addresses concerns about measurement error and omitted variable bias that often plague traditional epidemiological studies.Natural experiments arising from policy changes have also provided valuable opportunities for causal inference. Greenstone and Hanna (2014) evaluated the impact of air quality regulations in India on infant mortality, demonstrating the potential for policy interventions to improve health outcomes in developing countries. Similarly, Ebenstein et al. (2017) examined the effects of China's Huai River policy, which provided free coal for heating to areas north of the river, on life expectancy. Their analysis revealed significant reductions in life expectancy due to increased air pollution levels resulting from the policy.While these economic approaches have made substantial contributions to our understanding of air pollution's health effects, they are not without limitations. Dominici et al. (2014) highlighted the importance of integrating epidemiological and economic methods to provide a more comprehensive assessment of air pollution impacts. They argued for the need to consider both short-term and long-term exposure effects, as well as the potential for non-linear concentration-response relationships.Recent advancements in data availability and computational methods have opened new avenues for research in this field. Di et al. (2017) utilized machine learning techniques to estimate air pollution exposure at a fine spatial resolution across the United States, enabling more precise estimates of health effects. This approach demonstrates the potential for big data and advanced statistical methods to enhance our understanding of air pollution's impacts.The economics literature has also made significant contributions to understanding the heterogeneity of air pollution effects across different populations. Hsiang et al. (2019) developed a unified econometric framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, which can be applied to air pollution studies to identify vulnerable subpopulations and inform targeted policy interventions.As research in this field continues to evolve, there is growing recognition of the need to consider multiple pollutants simultaneously and to account for potential interactions between different environmental stressors. Dominici et al. (2010) proposed methods for analyzing the health effects of multiple air pollutants, highlighting the importance of moving beyond single-pollutant models to capture the complexity of real-world exposures.In conclusion, the application of causal inference methods from economics has significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. By leveraging natural experiments, policy changes, and innovative research designs, economists have complemented traditional epidemiological approaches and provided more robust evidence for causal effects. As the field continues to evolve, integrating insights from economics, epidemiology, and other disciplines will be crucial for informing effective air quality policies and improving public health outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Health effects of fine particulate air pollution: lines that connect", "authors": "C.
