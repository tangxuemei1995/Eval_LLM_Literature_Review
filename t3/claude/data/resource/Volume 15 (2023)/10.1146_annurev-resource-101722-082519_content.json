{"Literature Review": "The field of impact assessment for international agricultural research has undergone significant transformations in recent years, particularly between 2006 and 2020. This literature review examines the evolution of methodologies and standards of evidence in this domain, highlighting the shift towards more rigorous approaches in causal inference, measurement, and statistical representativeness.Historically, impact assessments of agricultural research relied heavily on partial equilibrium models of supply and demand for agricultural products. This approach, pioneered by Griliches in the 1950s, dominated the field for several decades (Alston et al., 2011). However, the mid-2000s marked a turning point in the methodological landscape, as researchers began to recognize the limitations of these traditional methods and sought more robust ways to evaluate the impact of agricultural innovations.One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the increased emphasis on causal inference. Researchers have increasingly adopted experimental and quasi-experimental designs to establish causal relationships between agricultural interventions and outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in particular, have gained prominence as a gold standard for impact evaluation in agriculture (de Janvry et al., 2011). These methods allow for more precise estimation of treatment effects by controlling for confounding factors and selection bias.However, the application of RCTs in agricultural research is not without challenges. Bulte et al. (2014) highlight the potential for spillover effects and contamination between treatment and control groups in agricultural settings, which can complicate the interpretation of results. To address these issues, researchers have developed innovative designs such as cluster-randomized trials and encouragement designs, which can help mitigate some of the limitations of traditional RCTs in agricultural contexts (Duflo et al., 2008).Alongside the focus on causal inference, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of valid measurement in impact assessment. Agricultural outcomes are often complex and multidimensional, requiring sophisticated measurement techniques to capture the full range of impacts. For instance, Carletto et al. (2015) demonstrate the potential for measurement error in self-reported crop yields and propose alternative methods, such as crop cuts and satellite imagery, to improve accuracy.The development and validation of new measurement tools have been crucial in advancing the field. For example, Swindale and Bilinsky (2006) introduced the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) as a proxy measure for household food security, which has since been widely adopted in agricultural impact studies. Similarly, the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) was developed to assess the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector (Alkire et al., 2013).Statistical representativeness has emerged as another key consideration in impact assessment. Researchers are increasingly aware of the need to ensure that their findings are generalizable beyond the specific context of their study. This has led to a greater emphasis on sampling strategies that allow for inference at larger scales. Barrett and Carter (2010) argue for the importance of external validity in agricultural impact studies and propose methods for improving the generalizability of findings.The push for representativeness has also led to an increased focus on national-level assessments and the consideration of portfolios of innovations. Fuglie (2018) demonstrates the value of this approach by analyzing the aggregate impact of agricultural research and development investments across multiple countries and commodities. This broader perspective allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the overall impact of agricultural research efforts.However, the pursuit of representativeness and scale presents its own challenges. Beintema et al. (2012) highlight the difficulties in collecting consistent and comparable data across diverse agricultural systems and institutional contexts. To address these issues, researchers have developed innovative approaches such as adaptive sampling designs and the use of big data and remote sensing technologies to complement traditional data collection methods (Lobell et al., 2020).The trend towards more rigorous impact assessment has also highlighted the complexities of evaluating bundled interventions, which are common in agricultural development programs. Banerjee et al. (2015) discuss the challenges of disentangling the effects of individual components within a package of interventions and propose methods for addressing this issue, such as factorial designs and mediation analysis.In conclusion, the 'rigor revolution' in impact assessment of international agricultural research has led to significant advancements in methodology and standards of evidence. The field has moved towards more robust approaches in causal inference, measurement, and statistical representativeness. While these developments have undoubtedly improved the quality and reliability of impact assessments, they have also revealed new challenges and areas for future research. As the field continues to evolve, researchers must balance the pursuit of methodological rigor with the practical constraints and complexities of agricultural systems in diverse contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Economic impacts of agricultural research and development", "authors": "Julian M.
