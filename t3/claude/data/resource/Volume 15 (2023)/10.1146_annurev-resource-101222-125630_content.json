{"Literature Review": "The relationship between temperature and labor productivity has become an increasingly important area of research in recent years, particularly in light of global climate change. This literature review aims to synthesize recent economic studies on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity, highlighting key findings, methodologies, and areas for future research.One of the most consistent findings across the literature is the negative impact of extreme temperatures on labor productivity. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) conducted a seminal study using time-use data in the United States, demonstrating that high temperatures significantly reduce time allocated to labor, particularly in climate-exposed industries. This finding has been corroborated by numerous subsequent studies across various geographical contexts and economic sectors.The magnitude of temperature effects on productivity varies considerably across different social and economic factors. For instance, Somanathan et al. (2021) found that the negative impact of high temperatures on labor productivity in India was more pronounced in lower-income regions and among workers in physically demanding occupations. Similarly, Park (2020) observed that the productivity of factory workers in China declined more sharply with temperature increases in facilities lacking air conditioning.Interestingly, the effects of temperature on productivity extend beyond physical labor to encompass mental tasks as well. Graff Zivin et al. (2018) provided evidence that cognitive function and decision-making abilities are impaired by extreme temperatures, potentially affecting a wide range of occupations and industries. This finding underscores the pervasive nature of temperature effects on human performance across various types of work.The impact of temperature on learning and human capital accumulation has also garnered significant attention. Park (2020) found that high temperatures during the school year negatively affected student test scores in China, with potential long-term implications for human capital formation and economic productivity. These findings highlight the importance of considering the broader, long-term consequences of temperature effects on productivity.A particularly concerning aspect of temperature effects on productivity relates to early-life exposure. Isen et al. (2017) demonstrated that in utero exposure to extreme temperatures has profound and lasting effects on human development, including future labor market outcomes. This research emphasizes the potential for temperature shocks to have intergenerational impacts on productivity and economic well-being.The literature has also explored various adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of temperature on productivity. Barreca et al. (2016) found that the widespread adoption of air conditioning in the United States significantly reduced temperature-related mortality, suggesting a potential avenue for adaptation in the context of labor productivity. However, the effectiveness and accessibility of such adaptation measures may vary across different economic and geographical contexts.Despite the growing body of research on this topic, there are several limitations and areas for future investigation. First, many studies rely on short-term temperature variations, which may not fully capture the effects of long-term climate change. Future research could benefit from incorporating longer-term climate projections and exploring potential non-linear effects of sustained temperature changes.Additionally, the distributional effects of temperature on productivity warrant further investigation. While some studies have touched on this aspect, a more comprehensive understanding of how temperature effects vary across different demographic groups, industries, and regions could inform more targeted policy interventions.Finally, the interaction between temperature and other environmental factors, such as air pollution or humidity, remains an understudied area. Future research could explore these complex interactions to provide a more nuanced understanding of the environmental determinants of labor productivity.In conclusion, the literature on the effects of temperature on labor productivity has made significant strides in recent years, uncovering widespread negative impacts of extreme temperatures on both physical and mental productivity. The varying magnitudes of these effects across different contexts, coupled with the profound implications of early-life exposure, underscore the importance of this area of research. As climate change continues to alter global temperature patterns, further investigation into adaptation strategies and the long-term consequences of temperature effects on productivity will be crucial for informing effective policy responses.", "References": [{"title": "Temperature and Human Capital in the Short and Long Run", "authors": "Joshua Graff Zivin, Solomon M.
