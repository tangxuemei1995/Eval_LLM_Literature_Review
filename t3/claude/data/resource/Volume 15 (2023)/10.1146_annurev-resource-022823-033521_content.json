{"Literature Review": "Obesity has become a global health concern, affecting both developed and developing countries. This literature review explores the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy from a global perspective, examining the differences between developed and developing countries, as well as gender disparities. The prevalence of obesity has been increasing worldwide, with significant variations between countries and regions. In developed countries, obesity rates have reached alarming levels, with the United States leading the way. According to a study by Hales et al. (2020), the prevalence of obesity among adults in the United States was 42.4% in 2017-2018. In contrast, developing countries have traditionally had lower obesity rates, but recent trends show a rapid increase in obesity prevalence, particularly in urban areas. For instance, Popkin et al. (2020) reported that many low- and middle-income countries are experiencing a 'nutrition transition,' characterized by a shift towards energy-dense diets and sedentary lifestyles, leading to increased obesity rates. The relationship between obesity and life expectancy is complex and multifaceted. Numerous studies have demonstrated a negative association between obesity and longevity. A comprehensive meta-analysis by Di Angelantonio et al. (2016) found that, on average, severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) was associated with a reduction in life expectancy of 6.5 to 13.7 years compared to normal weight individuals. However, the impact of obesity on life expectancy varies between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, the obesity epidemic has been a significant contributor to the slowdown in life expectancy gains observed in recent years. Preston et al. (2018) estimated that the rise in obesity in the United States between 1988 and 2011 reduced life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 years for women and 0.8 years for men. The authors argued that without the increase in obesity, life expectancy gains would have been significantly larger during this period. In contrast, the impact of obesity on life expectancy in developing countries is less clear-cut. While obesity rates are increasing in these countries, they often coexist with undernutrition and infectious diseases. Popkin (2015) highlighted the 'dual burden' of malnutrition in many developing countries, where obesity and undernutrition occur simultaneously within the same population, or even within the same household. This complex nutritional landscape makes it challenging to isolate the effects of obesity on life expectancy in these settings. Gender disparities in the relationship between obesity and life expectancy have also been observed. A study by Stenholm et al. (2017) found that obese women had a greater reduction in life expectancy compared to obese men. The authors suggested that this difference might be due to the higher prevalence of severe obesity among women and the stronger association between obesity and certain health conditions in women, such as cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms through which obesity affects mortality are numerous and interconnected. Obesity is a major risk factor for various non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. A meta-analysis by Aune et al. (2016) demonstrated a strong positive association between BMI and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with each 5 kg/m² increase in BMI associated with a 55% higher risk of developing the disease. Cardiovascular diseases are another significant pathway through which obesity impacts life expectancy. Khan et al. (2018) found that obesity was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. The authors emphasized that the obesity-related cardiovascular risk was particularly pronounced in developing countries, where healthcare systems may be less equipped to manage these complex conditions. The association between obesity and cancer risk has also been well-documented. A large-scale study by Bhaskaran et al. (2014) found that higher BMI was associated with increased risk of 17 out of 22 specific types of cancer. The authors noted that the population impact of obesity on cancer risk was substantial, estimating that 41% of uterine and 10% of gallbladder, kidney, and liver cancers in the UK were attributable to overweight and obesity. At the population level, the relationship between obesity and life expectancy is influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and public health policies. Peeters et al. (2003) demonstrated that the impact of obesity on life expectancy was more pronounced in populations with higher overall life expectancy, suggesting that the relative importance of obesity as a mortality risk factor increases as other causes of premature death are addressed. The effectiveness of policies aimed at addressing obesity varies between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, interventions such as sugar taxes, food labeling regulations, and school-based programs have shown some promise. For example, Teng et al. (2019) found that the implementation of a sugar-sweetened beverage tax in Mexico was associated with a significant reduction in the purchase of taxed beverages. In developing countries, policy interventions must consider the unique challenges posed by the dual burden of malnutrition. Hawkes et al. (2020) argued for a 'double-duty' approach to address both undernutrition and obesity simultaneously, emphasizing the need for context-specific interventions that promote healthy diets and physical activity while addressing food insecurity. In conclusion, the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries, as well as by gender, highlight the need for tailored approaches to address this global health challenge. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions that consider the specific contexts of different populations, with the ultimate goal of improving health and well-being worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "Prevalence of Obesity and Severe Obesity Among Adults: United States, 2017–2018", "authors": "Craig M.
