{"Literature Review": "Food loss and waste have become critical issues in global food security and sustainability discussions. Since 2015, when the United Nations and G20 placed these concerns on the global agenda, there has been increased attention to understanding and addressing the problem. However, progress has been hindered by the conflation of food loss and food waste in measurements and analyses, as well as a lack of comprehensive data. This literature review aims to examine the current state of knowledge regarding food losses in agrifood systems, focusing on measurements, causes, determinants, and interventions. Measurements of food loss present a significant challenge due to the complexity of agrifood systems and the variability in definitions and methodologies. Xue et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of food loss and waste data, revealing substantial discrepancies in measurement approaches across studies. They found that estimates of food loss ranged from 8% to 20% of total food production, depending on the region and methodology used. This wide range highlights the need for standardized measurement techniques to accurately assess the scale of the problem. The causes and determinants of food loss are multifaceted and vary across different stages of the food supply chain. Parfitt et al. (2010) identified key factors contributing to food loss, including inadequate harvesting techniques, poor storage facilities, and inefficient transportation systems. In developing countries, these issues are often exacerbated by limited access to technology and infrastructure. Sheahan and Barrett (2017) further emphasized the role of institutional and policy factors in perpetuating food loss, such as market inefficiencies and lack of incentives for loss reduction. Interventions to reduce food loss have been proposed and implemented at various levels of the agrifood system. Hodges et al. (2011) reviewed post-harvest loss reduction strategies, highlighting the importance of improved storage technologies and handling practices. They found that simple interventions, such as the use of hermetic storage bags, could reduce grain losses by up to 98% in some cases. However, the effectiveness of interventions can vary widely depending on the context and scale of implementation. One critical aspect often overlooked in food loss research is the interconnectedness of agrifood systems. Springmann et al. (2018) demonstrated the complex relationships between food production, consumption, and environmental impacts. Their study emphasized the need to consider food loss reduction as part of a broader strategy to improve the sustainability of food systems. This systems-level approach is crucial for identifying intervention hot spots and potential trade-offs between different objectives. The impact of food loss on food security is another area of growing concern. Affognon et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review of post-harvest losses in sub-Saharan Africa, revealing that reducing food loss could significantly improve food availability and accessibility for vulnerable populations. However, they also noted that the relationship between food loss reduction and food security is not always straightforward, as it depends on various socioeconomic factors and market dynamics. Environmental implications of food loss have also gained attention in recent years. Kummu et al. (2012) estimated that food losses account for approximately 24% of total freshwater resources used in food production, 23% of total global cropland area, and 23% of total global fertilizer use. These findings underscore the potential environmental benefits of reducing food loss, particularly in terms of resource efficiency and climate change mitigation. To address the challenges in measuring and analyzing food loss, several researchers have called for improved data collection and standardized methodologies. Gustavsson et al. (2011) proposed a framework for estimating food losses and waste at different stages of the supply chain, emphasizing the need for country-specific data and consistent definitions. Building on this work, Hanson et al. (2016) developed the Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard, which provides guidelines for quantifying and reporting food loss and waste across the entire food supply chain. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in understanding the cascading effects and feedback loops within agrifood systems related to food loss. Integrating food loss considerations into broader analyses of food system dynamics could provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners. For example, Godfray et al. (2010) argued for a systems approach to food security that considers the interactions between production, distribution, and consumption, including the role of food loss reduction. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding food losses in agrifood systems, several key challenges persist. These include the need for improved microdata collection, standardized measurements that separate food loss from food waste, and a more integrated approach that considers the complex interactions within food systems. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive frameworks that can capture the trade-offs and synergies of interventions, as well as the broader impacts of food loss reduction on socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals. By addressing these gaps, researchers and policymakers can work towards more effective strategies for reducing food loss and improving the overall sustainability and efficiency of agrifood systems.", "References": [{"title": "The extent of food losses and waste: An overview of the current situation and its implications for the environment, food security, and the economy", "authors": "Xue, Li and Liu, Gang and Parfitt, Julian and Liu, Xiaojie and Van Herpen, Erica and Stenmarck, Åsa and O'Connor, Clementine and Östergren, Karin and Cheng, Shengkui", "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "year": "2017", "volumes": "141", "first page": "1235", "last page": "1252", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.054"}, {"title": "Food waste within food supply chains: quantification and potential for change to 2050", "authors": "Parfitt, Julian and Barthel, Mark and Macnaughton, Sarah", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2010", "volumes": "365", "first page": "3065", "last page": "3081", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2010.0126"}, {"title": "Review: Effective interventions to reduce post-harvest losses of agricultural produce", "authors": "Hodges, Richard J. and Buzby, Jean C. and Bennett, Ben", "journal": "Food Security", "year": "2011", "volumes": "3", "first page": "37", "last page": "43", "DOI": "10.1007/s12571-010-0109-8"}, {"title": "Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits", "authors": "Springmann, Marco and Clark, Michael and Mason-D'Croz, Daniel and Wiebe, Keith and Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon and Lassaletta, Luis and de Vries, Wim and Vermeulen, Sonja J. and Herrero, Mario and Carlson, Kimberly M. and Jonell, Malin and Troell, Max and DeClerck, Fabrice and Gordon, Line J. and Zurayk, Rami and Scarborough, Peter and Rayner, Mike and Loken, Brent and Fanzo, Jess and Godfray, H.
