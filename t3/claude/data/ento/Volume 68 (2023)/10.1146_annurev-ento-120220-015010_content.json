{"Literature Review": "Bed bugs (Cimex spp.) have emerged as a significant urban pest problem worldwide, with their resurgence in recent decades posing substantial challenges for pest management professionals and public health officials. This literature review aims to explore the historical context of bed bug infestations, their global spread, and the evolution of control strategies from past to present.The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) and the tropical bed bug (Cimex hemipterus) are the two primary species of concern in human dwellings. These obligate hematophagous insects have a long history of association with humans, with evidence suggesting their presence in human habitats dating back thousands of years (Usinger, 1966). However, the mid-20th century saw a significant decline in bed bug populations in developed countries, largely attributed to the widespread use of DDT and other synthetic insecticides (Potter, 2011).The global resurgence of bed bugs since the late 1990s has been well-documented and is believed to be multifactorial. Romero et al. (2007) identified insecticide resistance as a primary driver of this resurgence, with bed bugs developing resistance to various classes of insecticides, including pyrethroids. This resistance has been attributed to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel genes, which are the target sites for pyrethroids (Zhu et al., 2010).In addition to insecticide resistance, increased global travel and trade have facilitated the spread of bed bugs across continents. Doggett et al. (2004) reported on the rapid increase in bed bug infestations in Australia, linking it to international travel and the movement of second-hand furniture. Similarly, Hwang et al. (2005) documented the rise of bed bug infestations in shelters and hotels in Toronto, Canada, highlighting the role of human movement in bed bug dispersal.The detection and monitoring of bed bug infestations have evolved significantly over the years. Traditional visual inspections remain important, but new technologies have emerged to aid in early detection. Wang et al. (2009) evaluated the effectiveness of pitfall traps and adhesive traps in detecting low-level bed bug infestations, finding them to be useful tools when combined with visual inspections. More recently, canine scent detection has gained popularity as a rapid and sensitive method for identifying bed bug presence, although its accuracy can vary depending on handler and dog training (Cooper et al., 2014).Non-chemical control methods have seen renewed interest in light of insecticide resistance concerns. Heat treatment has emerged as an effective non-chemical approach, with Kells and Goblirsch (2011) demonstrating that exposure to temperatures above 50°C for several hours can achieve complete mortality of all life stages of bed bugs. Other physical control methods, such as vacuuming, steam treatment, and cold treatment, have also shown promise in managing bed bug infestations (Pereira et al., 2009).Chemical control remains a crucial component of bed bug management strategies, despite the challenges posed by insecticide resistance. The development of new insecticide formulations and active ingredients has been ongoing. Dang et al. (2017) evaluated the efficacy of various insecticide products against pyrethroid-resistant bed bugs, finding that some newer formulations, particularly those containing neonicotinoids, showed improved performance. However, the authors cautioned that resistance to these newer products could also develop over time.Integrated pest management (IPM) approaches have gained traction as a more sustainable and effective strategy for bed bug control. These approaches combine multiple tactics, including prevention, monitoring, non-chemical methods, and judicious use of insecticides. Wang et al. (2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of an IPM approach in multi-unit housing, achieving high levels of bed bug control while reducing insecticide use.Looking to the future, research into novel control methods continues. Potential avenues include the development of biopesticides, such as fungal pathogens (Barbarin et al., 2012), and the exploration of RNA interference (RNAi) as a targeted approach to bed bug control (Zhu et al., 2012). Additionally, there is growing interest in understanding the differences between C. lectularius and C. hemipterus in terms of their biology, behavior, and susceptibility to control methods, as highlighted by Doggett et al. (2018).In conclusion, the global resurgence of bed bugs has spurred significant research and innovation in control strategies. While challenges remain, particularly in the face of insecticide resistance, the integration of various detection, monitoring, and control methods offers promise for more effective management of these persistent pests. Future research should focus on developing sustainable, long-term solutions that can adapt to the evolving nature of bed bug infestations in urban environments.", "References": [{"title": "The History of Bed Bugs (Cimicidae)", "authors": "Robert L.
