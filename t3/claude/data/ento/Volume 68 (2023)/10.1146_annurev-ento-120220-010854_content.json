{"Literature Review": "Forest insect biosecurity has become an increasingly critical concern in the face of globalization and its associated risks of non-native species invasions. This literature review examines the processes, patterns, predictions, and pitfalls related to forest insect biosecurity, synthesizing current knowledge and identifying areas for future research and improvement.The threat posed by non-native forest insects has grown significantly in recent decades, paralleling the expansion of global trade and travel. Liebhold et al. (2012) reported that the rate of non-native insect establishments in the United States has been increasing steadily since the early 20th century, with no signs of saturation. This trend is mirrored globally, as Seebens et al. (2017) demonstrated that the number of first records of non-native species worldwide continues to rise across all taxonomic groups, including insects.Biosecurity measures to mitigate these threats are typically categorized into three main stages: preborder, border, and postborder interventions. Preborder measures focus on reducing the risk of pest introduction at the source. Eschen et al. (2015) reviewed the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures in the international plant trade and found that while some interventions, such as pest risk assessments and treatments, can be effective, there are significant challenges in implementation and enforcement.Border interventions, including inspections and quarantine measures, form a critical line of defense against non-native insect introductions. However, Saccaggi et al. (2016) highlighted the limitations of border inspections, noting that it is practically impossible to inspect all imports, and that even rigorous inspection regimes may miss low-density infestations. This underscores the need for risk-based approaches to target high-risk pathways and commodities.Postborder measures, including surveillance, early detection, and rapid response programs, are essential for identifying and managing incursions that bypass preborder and border defenses. Epanchin-Niell et al. (2014) analyzed the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs for invasive species and found that targeted surveillance strategies can significantly improve the chances of early detection and successful eradication.Despite these multi-layered approaches, biosecurity failures continue to occur, as evidenced by the ongoing establishment of non-native forest insects worldwide. Aukema et al. (2010) estimated that non-native forest insects cause billions of dollars in damages annually in the United States alone, highlighting the economic imperative for improved biosecurity measures.One of the key challenges in forest insect biosecurity is the difficulty in predicting future invasions. Hudgins et al. (2017) developed models to forecast future insect invasions based on historical patterns and found that the rate of new establishments is likely to accelerate in the coming decades. This underscores the need for proactive and adaptive biosecurity strategies that can anticipate and respond to emerging threats.The concept of 'known-unknowns' in biosecurity, as discussed by Paini et al. (2016), presents a particular challenge. These are pests that are known to exist but have not yet been identified as potential threats or regulated against. Developing flexible regulatory frameworks that can rapidly incorporate new information on emerging threats is crucial for addressing this issue.Noncompliance with existing phytosanitary regulations remains an ongoing problem in forest insect biosecurity. Springborn et al. (2021) analyzed patterns of noncompliance in wood packaging material and found that while overall compliance has improved over time, significant gaps remain, particularly for shipments from certain high-risk countries.The success of biosecurity measures is often difficult to quantify, as prevented invasions are inherently unobservable. Kenis et al. (2018) argued that this leads to an underappreciation of biosecurity successes and potentially undermines support for continued investment in preventative measures. Developing better metrics for quantifying the benefits of biosecurity interventions could help address this issue.Finally, there is growing recognition that effective forest insect biosecurity requires a collaborative, global approach. Meurisse et al. (2019) emphasized the importance of international cooperation in sharing data, harmonizing regulations, and coordinating response efforts to address the transboundary nature of insect invasions.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and implementing forest insect biosecurity measures, numerous challenges remain. Future research should focus on developing more accurate predictive models, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of inspection and surveillance programs, and fostering greater international collaboration. Additionally, there is a need for increased public awareness and engagement to ensure that biosecurity becomes a shared responsibility across all sectors of society. Only through a comprehensive, adaptive, and collaborative approach can we hope to mitigate the growing threats posed by non-native forest insects in an increasingly interconnected world.", "References": [{"title": "Predicting the economic costs and property value losses attributed to sudden oak death damage in California (2010–2020)", "authors": "Jonathan S.
