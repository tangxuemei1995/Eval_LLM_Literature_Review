{"Literature Review": "The study of arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants has revolutionized our understanding of the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. This field of research has provided valuable insights into the complex interactions between plants and their consumers over a 420-million-year history. The functional feeding groupâ€“damage type system has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing these interactions in fossil plant assemblages, allowing researchers to explore local, regional, and global patterns of herbivory through time.One of the most fundamental questions addressed by this research is the timing of the earliest evidence for herbivory on land plants. Labandeira (2007) reported that the oldest known plant-arthropod interactions date back to the Late Silurian, approximately 420 million years ago. These early interactions were primarily in the form of spore feeding and piercing-and-sucking on primitive vascular plants. As land plants diversified and became more complex, so did the herbivores that fed upon them.The early emergence of herbivore associations on land plants and their subsequent expansion on seed plants is another critical area of investigation. Labandeira and Currano (2013) demonstrated that major herbivore functional feeding groups, such as external foliage feeding, piercing-and-sucking, and boring, were established by the Middle Devonian. This early diversification of herbivory strategies laid the foundation for the complex plant-herbivore interactions observed in later periods.The Permian-Triassic ecological crisis, often referred to as the 'Great Dying,' had a profound impact on herbivore diversity. Schachat et al. (2018) found that herbivory levels decreased significantly during this mass extinction event, with a notable reduction in the diversity of damage types. However, the recovery period following the crisis saw the formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms. This resurgence of herbivory played a crucial role in shaping plant-herbivore coevolution in the Mesozoic era.The rise and diversification of angiosperms in the Cretaceous period marked another significant shift in the history of herbivory. Wilf et al. (2006) observed that the appearance of angiosperms was accompanied by an increase in herbivore damage diversity and intensity. This suggests that the evolution of flowering plants provided new opportunities for herbivores, leading to the development of novel feeding strategies and specialized plant-herbivore relationships.Recent studies have also focused on the effects of climate change on herbivory patterns. Currano et al. (2010) examined plant-insect associations during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a period of rapid global warming approximately 56 million years ago. They found that herbivory increased significantly during this warm interval, with a particular increase in specialized feeding damage. These findings have important implications for understanding how modern ecosystems might respond to ongoing climate change.The relationship between herbivory and latitude has been another area of interest. Wilf and Labandeira (1999) demonstrated that herbivory levels in fossil leaf assemblages tend to increase with decreasing latitude, mirroring patterns observed in modern ecosystems. This suggests that the latitudinal herbivory gradient has deep evolutionary roots and may be influenced by factors such as temperature, seasonality, and plant defense strategies.The antiquity of modern plant-herbivore interactions is a recurring theme in paleobotanical research. Labandeira et al. (2002) provided evidence for highly specialized interactions between insects and plants in the Late Cretaceous, including leaf mines and galls that closely resemble those produced by extant insects. These findings suggest that many modern plant-herbivore associations have ancient origins, persisting through major environmental and evolutionary changes.Differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms is another intriguing area of study. Carvalho et al. (2014) found that ferns in the fossil record generally show lower levels of herbivory compared to co-occurring angiosperms. This pattern is consistent with observations in modern ecosystems and may be related to differences in plant defenses and nutritional quality between these plant groups.The origins of modern tropical forests and their associated herbivore communities remain an active area of research. Wing et al. (2009) studied the recovery of tropical forests following the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and found that the diversity of both plants and herbivore damage types increased rapidly in the early Paleocene. This suggests that the complex plant-herbivore interactions characteristic of modern tropical forests began to develop soon after the mass extinction.In conclusion, the study of arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants has provided crucial insights into the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. By combining detailed analyses of fossil plant assemblages with modern ecological data, researchers have been able to reconstruct the 420-million-year history of plant-herbivore interactions. This field continues to advance rapidly, driven by improvements in sampling strategies, analytical methods, and the ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions. As we face the challenges of global change, understanding the long-term dynamics of plant-herbivore relationships becomes increasingly important for predicting and managing the future of terrestrial ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Arthropod herbivory in the early Triassic", "authors": "Sandra R.
