{"Literature Review": "The persistence of recessive lethal mutations in natural populations has been a longstanding puzzle in evolutionary biology. For nearly a century, researchers have observed chromosomes that cause lethality when homozygous persisting at surprisingly high frequencies (>25%) in various species. This phenomenon challenges our understanding of natural selection and genetic variation maintenance. This literature review examines the roles of mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining recessive lethal variation in natural populations.Mutation–selection balance has long been considered a primary mechanism for maintaining deleterious alleles in populations. This model posits that the influx of new mutations is balanced by purifying selection, resulting in an equilibrium frequency of deleterious alleles. However, Charlesworth and Charlesworth (1998) demonstrated that mutation–selection balance alone is insufficient to explain the high frequencies of lethal chromosomes observed in nature. Their theoretical work suggested that unrealistically high mutation rates would be required to maintain lethal alleles at the observed frequencies through mutation–selection balance alone.Heterozygote advantage, or overdominance, has been proposed as an alternative explanation for the maintenance of lethal variation. This mechanism suggests that individuals heterozygous for the lethal allele have a fitness advantage over both homozygous wild-type and homozygous lethal genotypes. A classic example is the sickle cell allele in humans, which confers resistance to malaria in heterozygotes but causes a lethal condition in homozygotes (Allison, 1954). However, Hedrick (2012) argued that true overdominance is rare in nature and unlikely to be a widespread explanation for the maintenance of lethal variation across species.Linked selection has emerged as a promising mechanism to explain the persistence of lethal alleles. This concept encompasses several related processes, including associative overdominance and hitchhiking. Associative overdominance occurs when lethal alleles are in linkage disequilibrium with beneficial alleles, resulting in a net heterozygote advantage for the linked region (Ohta, 1971). Hitchhiking, on the other hand, involves the increase in frequency of neutral or slightly deleterious alleles due to their linkage with positively selected alleles (Smith and Haigh, 1974).Recent genomic studies have provided evidence for the role of linked selection in maintaining lethal variation. For instance, Cheng and Kirkpatrick (2016) found that lethal alleles in Drosophila melanogaster were often associated with regions of low recombination and high linkage disequilibrium, suggesting that linked selection may play a crucial role in their persistence. Similarly, Huber et al. (2018) demonstrated that lethal alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana were frequently found in genomic regions with signatures of balancing selection, further supporting the importance of linked selection.The concept of supergenes, large genomic regions of suppressed recombination containing multiple adaptive alleles, has gained attention in recent years. Thompson and Jiggins (2014) reviewed the role of supergenes in maintaining polymorphisms, including lethal variants, across various taxa. They argued that supergenes could facilitate the maintenance of lethal alleles through complex interactions between linked loci and reduced effective recombination rates.Linked selection can also indirectly contribute to the maintenance of lethal alleles by reducing the effective population size (Ne) in genomic regions. Corbett-Detig et al. (2015) demonstrated that linked selection could substantially reduce Ne in many species, potentially weakening the efficacy of purifying selection against lethal alleles. This effect may be particularly pronounced in regions of low recombination, where lethal alleles are often found.Recent advances in genomic technologies and analytical methods have reinvigorated interest in the study of lethal variation. High-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association studies have enabled researchers to identify and characterize lethal alleles with unprecedented precision. For example, Salomon et al. (2019) used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple lethal alleles in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster and found evidence for both associative overdominance and hitchhiking in maintaining these alleles.Furthermore, new theoretical approaches have provided insights into the complex interplay between different evolutionary forces. Agrawal and Whitlock (2012) developed a framework for understanding how deleterious mutations, including lethals, can be maintained through a balance of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. Their work highlighted the importance of considering multiple evolutionary forces simultaneously when studying the maintenance of lethal variation.In conclusion, while mutation–selection balance alone cannot explain the high frequencies of lethal chromosomes observed in nature, a combination of heterozygote advantage and linked selection mechanisms likely plays a crucial role in maintaining recessive lethal variation. The resurgence of interest in this topic, coupled with advances in genomic technologies and analytical methods, promises to shed new light on this longstanding evolutionary puzzle. Future research should focus on disentangling the relative contributions of these mechanisms across different species and genomic contexts, as well as exploring the potential role of epigenetic factors in the maintenance of lethal variation.", "References": [{"title": "The evolutionary dynamics of complex polymorphisms", "authors": "Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth", "journal": "Nature", "year": "1998", "volumes": "396", "first page": "463", "last page": "466", "DOI": "10.1038/24867"}, {"title": "Protection afforded by sickle-cell trait against subtertian malarial infection", "authors": "Anthony C.
