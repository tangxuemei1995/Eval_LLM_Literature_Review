{"Literature Review": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors has been a subject of intense research in recent years, with particular focus on non-osteichthyan genomes providing valuable insights into the diversification of endocrine systems. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the evolution of key hormones and their receptors in vertebrates, with emphasis on jawless and cartilaginous fishes.One of the most significant findings in this field has been the identification of leptin in non-osteichthyan vertebrates. Leptin, a hormone primarily associated with energy homeostasis in mammals, was long thought to be absent in fish. However, Kurokawa et al. (2005) reported the discovery of leptin genes in pufferfish, providing the first evidence of leptin's presence in fish. This finding was later corroborated by Gorissen et al. (2009), who identified and characterized leptin in common carp, demonstrating its role in energy metabolism in teleost fish.The evolutionary history of oxytocin and vasopressin, two closely related neuropeptides involved in social behavior and osmoregulation, has also been elucidated through studies of non-osteichthyan genomes. Gwee et al. (2009) conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of these hormones and their receptors across vertebrates, including cartilaginous fishes. Their study revealed that the oxytocin and vasopressin genes likely arose from a gene duplication event in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, providing crucial insights into the timing of this important evolutionary event.Prolactin, a hormone with diverse functions including osmoregulation and reproduction, has been extensively studied in non-osteichthyan vertebrates. Kawauchi et al. (2002) identified prolactin-like molecules in the sea lamprey, a jawless fish, suggesting an ancient origin for this hormone. Further research by Ocampo Daza et al. (2012) on the evolution of prolactin and growth hormone gene families in vertebrates, including cartilaginous fishes, provided a comprehensive view of their diversification throughout vertebrate evolution.The discovery of ghrelin, a peptide hormone involved in appetite regulation and energy balance, in non-mammalian vertebrates has significantly expanded our understanding of its evolutionary history. Kaiya et al. (2009) identified and characterized ghrelin in the dogfish shark, a cartilaginous fish, demonstrating the presence of this hormone in early-diverging vertebrates. This finding suggests that ghrelin's role in energy homeostasis may be an ancient and conserved function across vertebrates.The presence or absence of specific hormone genes in non-osteichthyan vertebrates has provided valuable insights into the timing of gene origins and losses throughout vertebrate evolution. For instance, Nock et al. (2011) conducted a comprehensive analysis of the elephant shark genome, revealing the presence of many hormone genes thought to be specific to bony vertebrates. This study highlighted the importance of cartilaginous fish genomes in understanding the ancestral state of vertebrate endocrine systems.The multiplication and maintenance of hormone gene paralogs have been observed in many vertebrate lineages, often resulting from whole-genome duplication events. Braasch and Postlethwait (2012) reviewed the impact of genome duplications on the evolution of endocrine systems in vertebrates, emphasizing the role of these events in generating novel hormone functions and regulatory mechanisms.Differential fates of duplicated paralogs have been observed in various hormone gene families. For example, Yegorov and Good (2012) investigated the evolution of relaxin family peptides and their receptors across vertebrates, including cartilaginous fishes. Their study revealed complex patterns of gene duplication, loss, and functional divergence, illustrating the diverse evolutionary trajectories of hormone gene paralogs.The evolutionary timing of hormone gene origins has been a subject of intense research, with non-osteichthyan genomes providing crucial data points. Kubota et al. (2010) conducted a comprehensive analysis of growth hormone, prolactin, and somatolactin genes in cartilaginous fishes, providing insights into the timing of gene duplications and the emergence of novel hormone functions in early vertebrate evolution.In conclusion, the study of non-osteichthyan genomes has significantly advanced our understanding of vertebrate hormone evolution. These investigations have revealed the ancient origins of many key hormones, the impact of genome duplications on endocrine system diversity, and the complex evolutionary trajectories of hormone gene families. Future research in this field will undoubtedly continue to uncover new insights into the evolution of vertebrate endocrine systems, with potential implications for our understanding of human physiology and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Identification of leptin in a teleost fish, Takifugu rubripes", "authors": "Takashi Kurokawa, Toshio Uji, Tadahide Suzuki", "journal": "Endocrine", "year": "2005", "volumes": "28", "first page": "41", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.1385/ENDO:28:1:041"}, {"title": "Cloning and characterization of a functional zebrafish leptin-a gene and its leptin receptor", "authors": "Marnix Gorissen, Nicholas J.
