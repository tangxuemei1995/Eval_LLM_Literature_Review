{"Literature Review": "Zoos and aquariums have undergone a significant transformation over the past century, evolving from mere entertainment venues to multifaceted institutions with pivotal roles in conservation, education, and research. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the functions and impacts of modern zoos and aquariums in a rapidly changing world.Conservation efforts have become a primary focus for many zoos and aquariums. Conde et al. (2011) reported that zoos and aquariums collectively house about 15% of threatened terrestrial vertebrate species, highlighting their potential for ex situ conservation. These institutions have been instrumental in preventing the extinction of several species through captive breeding programs. For instance, Zimmermann et al. (2007) documented the successful reintroduction of the Arabian oryx, which was extinct in the wild, thanks to coordinated efforts among zoos.However, the effectiveness of captive breeding and reintroduction programs has been questioned. Snyder et al. (1996) argued that such programs often fail to address the root causes of species decline and may divert resources from in situ conservation efforts. Moreover, Kraaijeveld-Smit et al. (2006) found that captive-bred animals often lack the necessary skills to survive in the wild, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive pre-release training programs.Education is another crucial function of modern zoos and aquariums. These institutions have the potential to reach millions of visitors annually, providing unique opportunities for environmental education and fostering conservation awareness. Moss et al. (2015) demonstrated that zoo visits can lead to increased knowledge about biodiversity and conservation issues among visitors. Similarly, Falk et al. (2007) found that aquarium visits can positively influence visitors' conservation-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.Nevertheless, the educational impact of zoos and aquariums has been debated. Marino et al. (2010) argued that the evidence for long-term behavioral changes resulting from zoo and aquarium visits is limited and often methodologically flawed. They called for more rigorous research to assess the actual educational outcomes of these institutions.Research conducted in zoos and aquariums has contributed significantly to our understanding of animal biology, behavior, and conservation. Hosey (2005) highlighted how zoo-based research has advanced our knowledge of animal welfare, reproductive biology, and conservation medicine. Moreover, Loh et al. (2018) demonstrated how aquariums have facilitated groundbreaking research on marine ecosystems and climate change impacts.Despite these contributions, zoos and aquariums face ongoing challenges and criticisms. Animal welfare concerns remain at the forefront of debates surrounding these institutions. Clubb and Mason (2003) found that many large carnivores in zoos exhibit stereotypic behaviors, indicating potential welfare issues. This has led to increased scrutiny of the ethics of keeping certain species in captivity, particularly those with complex social or spatial needs.The tension between conservation goals and visitor expectations presents another challenge. Carr and Cohen (2011) noted that while zoos increasingly emphasize their conservation role, many visitors still primarily seek entertainment. This disconnect can lead to conflicts in resource allocation and exhibit design.Climate change poses additional challenges for zoos and aquariums. Pearce-Kelly et al. (2013) argued that these institutions must adapt their conservation strategies to account for rapidly changing ecosystems and species distributions. This may require reassessing which species to prioritize for captive breeding and how to prepare animals for reintroduction into potentially altered habitats.Looking to the future, zoos and aquariums must continue to evolve to meet growing social and environmental expectations. Gusset and Dick (2011) proposed that these institutions should focus on integrating their conservation, education, and research functions more effectively. This could involve developing more immersive and technologically advanced exhibits that better engage visitors while also facilitating research and conservation efforts.In conclusion, zoos and aquariums play complex and multifaceted roles in today's changing world. While they have made significant contributions to conservation, education, and research, they also face ongoing challenges and criticisms. The future relevance and success of these institutions will depend on their ability to adapt to evolving societal values, environmental conditions, and scientific understanding. By continually refining their approaches and addressing ethical concerns, zoos and aquariums have the potential to remain vital contributors to global biodiversity conservation efforts and public environmental awareness.", "References": [{"title": "The role of zoos in the conservation of threatened terrestrial vertebrates", "authors": "Dalia A.
