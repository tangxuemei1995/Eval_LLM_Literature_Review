{"Literature Review": "Zoonotic diseases, which are infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals, have become increasingly significant threats to global health in recent years. These diseases account for a substantial proportion of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), with domestic animals serving as potential reservoirs for many of these pathogens. This literature review aims to explore the role of domestic animals as reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, their impact on public health, and the importance of a One Health approach in addressing these challenges.Domestic animals, including livestock and pets, play a crucial role in human society, providing food, companionship, and economic benefits. However, their close proximity to humans also creates opportunities for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens. According to Jones et al. (2008), approximately 60% of all human pathogens are zoonotic, and 73% of emerging infectious diseases are of animal origin. This highlights the significant impact that animal reservoirs have on human health.Among the various types of zoonotic pathogens, viruses are of particular concern due to their ability to mutate rapidly and adapt to new hosts. Woolhouse et al. (2012) reported that viruses account for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections, with many having the potential to cause severe outbreaks or even pandemics. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences that zoonotic viral diseases can have on global health and economies.Domestic animals can act as reservoirs for both endemic and emerging viral zoonoses. Endemic zoonoses are those that are consistently present in animal populations and occasionally infect humans, while emerging zoonoses are newly recognized diseases or known diseases that are expanding in incidence or geographic range. Cleaveland et al. (2001) identified several important viral zoonoses associated with domestic animals, including rabies, influenza, and various arboviruses.Rabies, caused by the rabies virus (RABV), remains a significant public health concern, particularly in developing countries. Dogs are the primary reservoir for human rabies infections, accounting for 99% of human cases worldwide (Hampson et al., 2015). Despite the availability of effective vaccines, rabies continues to cause approximately 59,000 human deaths annually, highlighting the need for improved control measures in domestic animal populations.Influenza viruses, particularly avian and swine influenza, pose a constant threat to human health due to their ability to reassort and potentially cause pandemics. Domestic poultry and pigs serve as important reservoirs for these viruses. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which originated in swine, demonstrated the potential for novel influenza strains to emerge from domestic animal reservoirs and rapidly spread globally (Smith et al., 2009).Arboviruses, such as West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, often involve domestic animals in their transmission cycles. While birds are typically the primary reservoirs, domestic animals like horses and pigs can act as amplifying hosts, increasing the risk of human exposure (Weaver and Reisen, 2010).The emergence and spread of zoonotic viral diseases are influenced by various factors, including changes in land use, agricultural intensification, and increased human-animal contact. Keesing et al. (2010) discussed how biodiversity loss and ecosystem changes can affect disease dynamics, potentially increasing the risk of zoonotic disease transmission from domestic animals to humans.Climate change is another critical factor influencing the distribution and prevalence of zoonotic diseases. Alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect the geographic range of vectors and reservoirs, potentially exposing new populations to zoonotic pathogens (Semenza and Menne, 2009).Given the complex nature of zoonotic diseases and their transmission dynamics, a One Health approach is essential for effective prevention and control. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health and promotes collaboration across multiple sectors. Zinsstag et al. (2011) emphasized the importance of integrating human and veterinary medicine, as well as environmental sciences, to address zoonotic disease challenges comprehensively.Surveillance and early warning systems play a crucial role in detecting and responding to zoonotic disease outbreaks. Improved monitoring of domestic animal populations, coupled with enhanced diagnostic capabilities, can help identify potential threats before they become major public health crises. Morse et al. (2012) proposed a global early warning system for emerging zoonoses, emphasizing the need for coordinated efforts between human and animal health sectors.In conclusion, domestic animals serve as important reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic viral diseases, posing significant challenges to global public health. The complex interplay between human activities, environmental factors, and pathogen characteristics necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to address these threats effectively. By adopting a One Health perspective and fostering collaboration between human and veterinary medicine, as well as environmental sciences, we can better understand, prevent, and control zoonotic diseases originating from domestic animal reservoirs. Future research should focus on improving surveillance systems, developing novel diagnostic tools, and implementing targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease transmission from domestic animals to humans.", "References": [{"title": "Global trends in emerging infectious diseases", "authors": "Kate E.
