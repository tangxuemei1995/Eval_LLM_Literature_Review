{"Literature Review": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as significant threats to global public health over the past three decades, with the recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 being the most impactful. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of emerging human-infecting coronaviruses, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.Animal models have played a crucial role in understanding coronavirus pathogenesis and developing therapeutic interventions. Ferrets have been widely used as models for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, due to their susceptibility and ability to transmit the virus (Shi et al., 2020). Hamsters have also proven valuable, exhibiting similar clinical symptoms to humans and serving as effective models for testing antiviral therapies (Chan et al., 2020). Non-human primates, particularly rhesus macaques, have been instrumental in vaccine development and studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Munster et al., 2020).The zoonotic origin of many human coronaviruses underscores the importance of identifying animal reservoirs. Bats have been recognized as natural reservoirs for numerous CoVs, including those closely related to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020). The discovery of bat coronaviruses with high sequence similarity to human-infecting strains has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of these pathogens. However, intermediate hosts often play a crucial role in the zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses to humans. For instance, palm civets were identified as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV, while dromedary camels serve as reservoirs for MERS-CoV (Cui et al., 2019).Cross-species transmission of coronaviruses is a complex process involving various factors, including viral adaptations and host susceptibility. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect multiple animal species has raised concerns about potential reservoirs and the risk of reverse zoonosis. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can infect cats, dogs, and various wildlife species, highlighting the need for comprehensive surveillance in both domestic and wild animal populations (Shi et al., 2020).The rapid mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs), which pose significant challenges to pandemic control efforts. The Omicron variant, first detected in November 2021, quickly became the dominant strain worldwide due to its increased transmissibility and immune evasion properties (Karim and Karim, 2021). The origin of Omicron remains unclear, with hypotheses ranging from prolonged infection in an immunocompromised individual to evolution in a non-human animal host.Recombination events between different coronavirus strains have been identified as potential mechanisms for generating novel variants with altered pathogenicity or host range. Recent studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 recombinants, emphasizing the need for continued genomic surveillance and investigation of their potential impact on virus transmission and vaccine efficacy (Jackson et al., 2021).The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of One Health approaches in addressing zoonotic diseases. Integrating human, animal, and environmental health is essential for early detection and prevention of future coronavirus outbreaks. Enhanced surveillance of wildlife populations, particularly those in close contact with humans, is crucial for identifying potential zoonotic reservoirs and monitoring the emergence of new variants (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2021).Advancements in genomic sequencing technologies have greatly improved our ability to track the evolution and spread of coronaviruses. However, challenges remain in bridging the gap between animal and human surveillance systems. Establishing comprehensive databases that integrate genomic data from both human and animal sources could facilitate more rapid identification of emerging threats and inform targeted intervention strategies (Boni et al., 2020).As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, understanding the complex interplay between animal hosts, viral adaptation, and human susceptibility remains crucial. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms of cross-species transmission, identifying potential reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, and developing strategies to mitigate the risk of future coronavirus outbreaks. Additionally, continued investment in animal models and surveillance systems will be essential for advancing our knowledge of coronavirus biology and improving our preparedness for future pandemics.In conclusion, the study of animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of emerging human-infecting coronaviruses is critical for managing current and future pandemic threats. Integrating insights from virology, ecology, and epidemiology will be essential for developing effective strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to novel coronavirus outbreaks in an increasingly interconnected world.", "References": [{"title": "Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals to SARS-coronavirus 2", "authors": "Jianzhong Shi, Zhiyuan Wen, Gongxun Zhong,
