{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of female masculinization in talpid moles and spotted hyenas has captivated researchers for decades, offering unique insights into the plasticity of sexual dimorphism in mammals. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biology and evolution of these 'fierce females,' focusing on their distinctive anatomical features, physiological adaptations, and the underlying mechanisms driving their masculinization.Talpid moles, particularly species within the genus Talpa, exhibit remarkable female masculinization. Female moles develop ovotestes, gonads that contain both ovarian and testicular tissue, which produce testosterone (Whitworth et al., 2018). This androgen production contributes to the development of male-like external genitalia, including an enlarged clitoris that resembles a penis. Additionally, female moles close their vaginal orifice after each estrus cycle, a unique adaptation among mammals (Carmona et al., 2008).The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) presents an even more extreme case of female masculinization. Female hyenas lack an external vaginal opening and instead possess a pseudopenis through which they urinate, mate, and give birth. This elongated clitoris can reach lengths of up to 17 cm and is traversed by a central urogenital canal (Glickman et al., 2006). The external genitalia of female hyenas also include a pseudoscrotum, further blurring the visual distinction between sexes.The study of these unique anatomical features has required the development of specialized research methods. For moles, researchers have employed histological techniques to examine the structure of ovotestes and track seasonal changes in hormone production (Zurita et al., 2003). In hyenas, non-invasive hormone monitoring through fecal samples has proven invaluable for understanding the endocrine basis of their masculinization (Dloniak et al., 2006).The masculinized genitalia in both moles and hyenas significantly influence various physiological functions. In moles, the seasonal development of testicular tissue within the ovotestes allows females to produce androgens, which may play a role in maintaining their burrowing lifestyle and aggressive behaviors (Sánchez et al., 1996). For spotted hyenas, the pseudopenis poses considerable challenges during parturition, resulting in high rates of mortality for first-time mothers and their cubs (Frank et al., 1995).The role of steroid hormones in the development of these masculinized traits has been a focal point of research. In moles, it appears that androgens produced by the ovotestes during fetal development contribute to the masculinization of the external genitalia (Barrionuevo et al., 2004). For spotted hyenas, elevated androgen levels during gestation, particularly androstenedione, have been implicated in the development of the pseudopenis and aggressive behavior (Licht et al., 1998).Genetic factors also play a crucial role in the evolution of these traits. Recent genomic studies in moles have identified candidate genes potentially involved in ovotestes development and androgen sensitivity (Real et al., 2020). In hyenas, research has focused on understanding the genetic basis of androgen production and metabolism, as well as the sensitivity of target tissues to these hormones (Funk et al., 2019).Environmental factors, particularly those related to the social structure and ecology of these species, may have contributed to the evolution of female masculinization. In moles, the solitary and territorial nature of their lifestyle may have favored the development of aggressive traits in females (Sánchez et al., 1996). For spotted hyenas, their unique matriarchal social structure, where females dominate males, may have driven the evolution of enhanced female aggressiveness and associated physiological traits (Holekamp et al., 1996).Despite their masculinized features, both mole and hyena females are remarkably successful in their reproductive roles. Female moles have evolved mechanisms to regulate androgen production, ensuring proper ovarian function during the breeding season (Zurita et al., 2003). Spotted hyena females, despite the challenges posed by their unique anatomy, have developed behavioral and physiological adaptations to successfully rear their young (Holekamp et al., 1996).In conclusion, the study of fierce females in moles and hyenas continues to provide valuable insights into the plasticity of mammalian sexual differentiation. These species challenge our understanding of typical mammalian sex differences and highlight the complex interplay between hormones, genes, and environment in shaping sexual phenotypes. Future research directions may include more detailed genomic analyses, exploration of epigenetic factors, and comparative studies across a broader range of species to further elucidate the evolutionary pathways leading to female masculinization.", "References": [{"title": "The ovotestis of moles: a study of the genus Talpa", "authors": "Whitworth, D.
