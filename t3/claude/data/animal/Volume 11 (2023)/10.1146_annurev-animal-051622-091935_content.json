{"Literature Review": "The field of animal biosciences has long been dominated by Western scientific paradigms, often overlooking the valuable contributions and perspectives of Indigenous peoples. This literature review aims to explore the current state of Indigenous perspectives in animal biosciences, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for greater inclusion and representation.Indigenous peoples have maintained deep connections with animals and the natural world for millennia, developing sophisticated knowledge systems that are often referred to as Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). However, the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples from mainstream scientific discourse has resulted in a significant underrepresentation of their perspectives in animal biosciences (Whyte, 2013). This exclusion not only limits the diversity of knowledge and approaches in the field but also perpetuates historical injustices and power imbalances.One area where Indigenous perspectives have made some inroads is in the study of human-animal bonds. Traditional Indigenous worldviews often emphasize the interconnectedness of all living beings, viewing humans as part of nature rather than separate from it. This holistic approach aligns well with emerging concepts in animal biosciences, such as the One Health framework, which recognizes the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health (Rock et al., 2017). Indigenous knowledge can provide valuable insights into sustainable animal management practices and the complex relationships between humans, animals, and ecosystems.In the realm of genetic testing and breeding programs, there have been some efforts to incorporate Indigenous perspectives and traditional knowledge. For example, Cothran et al. (2011) studied the genetic diversity of American Indian horse populations, combining molecular genetic analysis with historical and cultural information provided by tribal members. This approach not only enhanced the scientific understanding of these horse populations but also respected and incorporated Indigenous knowledge systems.Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) represents a significant area where Indigenous perspectives can contribute to animal biosciences. TEK encompasses a wide range of practices, beliefs, and observations accumulated over generations of close interaction with the natural world. Berkes et al. (2000) argue that TEK can complement Western scientific approaches, particularly in areas such as wildlife management and conservation. For instance, Indigenous hunting practices often incorporate sophisticated understanding of animal behavior and population dynamics, which can inform modern conservation efforts (Menzies and Butler, 2006).Despite these potential contributions, the integration of Indigenous perspectives in animal biosciences remains limited. One significant barrier is the ongoing siloing of scientific disciplines, which contrasts sharply with the holistic, interconnected worldviews of many Indigenous cultures. The compartmentalization of knowledge into distinct fields such as biology, ecology, and veterinary science can make it challenging to incorporate Indigenous perspectives that often span multiple domains (Kimmerer, 2013).Another obstacle is the hierarchy of methodologies in Western science, which tends to prioritize quantitative, reductionist approaches over qualitative, holistic ones. This bias can lead to the dismissal or undervaluation of Indigenous knowledge systems, which often rely on oral traditions, experiential learning, and long-term observations (Kovach, 2010). Overcoming this bias requires a fundamental shift in how knowledge is valued and validated within the scientific community.The historical context of research in Native communities also plays a crucial role in the underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives. Past unethical research practices and exploitation have led to distrust and reluctance to engage with Western scientific institutions (Smith, 2013). Addressing this legacy requires building trust through respectful collaboration, proper tribal consultation, and adherence to ethical research practices that prioritize Indigenous rights and interests.To promote greater inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in animal biosciences, several strategies can be employed. First, there is a need for increased support for Indigenous scholars and researchers in the field. This includes providing funding, mentorship, and creating inclusive academic environments that value diverse knowledge systems. Second, collaborations between Western scientific institutions and Indigenous communities should be fostered, ensuring that such partnerships are equitable and mutually beneficial (Adams et al., 2014).Education and curriculum development also play a crucial role. Incorporating Indigenous perspectives and Traditional Ecological Knowledge into animal bioscience curricula can help train a new generation of researchers who are more attuned to diverse ways of knowing and practicing science (Bartlett et al., 2012). This approach can also help attract more Indigenous students to the field, addressing the underrepresentation of Native people in animal biosciences.In conclusion, while Indigenous perspectives remain underrepresented in animal biosciences, there is growing recognition of their potential contributions. By challenging the exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms, embracing holistic approaches, and creating spaces for Indigenous voices, the field of animal biosciences can become more inclusive, diverse, and ultimately more effective in addressing complex challenges related to animal health, welfare, and conservation. This transformation requires ongoing efforts to bridge cultural and epistemological divides, fostering a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to animal biosciences that benefits both human and animal communities.", "References": [{"title": "Traditional ecological knowledge and wisdom of aboriginal peoples in British Columbia", "authors": "Fikret Berkes, Johan Colding, Carl Folke", "journal": "Ecological Applications", "year": "2000", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1251", "last page": "1262", "DOI": "10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1251:TEKAWO]2.0.CO;2"}, {"title": "Decolonizing methodologies: Research and indigenous peoples", "authors": "Linda Tuhiwai Smith", "journal": "Zed Books", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Indigenous knowledge, science, and resilience: What have we learned from a decade of international literature on 'integration'?", "authors": "Erin L.
