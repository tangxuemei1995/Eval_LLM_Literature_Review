{"Literature Review": "The field of canine genetics has experienced significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the identification of genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex diseases in dogs. This progress has been largely driven by technological developments in DNA sequencing and analysis, which have revolutionized our understanding of canine genomics and opened new avenues for veterinary medicine. Monogenic diseases, which are caused by mutations in a single gene, have been the primary focus of many canine genetic studies due to their relatively straightforward inheritance patterns. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has greatly accelerated the discovery of causative mutations for these disorders. For instance, Broeckx et al. (2017) utilized whole-genome sequencing to identify a novel mutation in the ADAMTS3 gene responsible for hereditary nasal parakeratosis in Labrador Retrievers. This study exemplifies the power of NGS in rapidly pinpointing disease-causing variants, even in previously uncharacterized genes. Similarly, Jagannathan et al. (2019) employed whole-exome sequencing to identify a mutation in the PIGU gene associated with a severe neurodegenerative disorder in Alaskan Husky dogs. This discovery not only provided insights into the disease mechanism but also highlighted the potential of dogs as models for studying human neurological disorders. The identification of genetic risk factors for complex diseases, which involve multiple genes and environmental factors, has traditionally been more challenging. However, recent advancements in genomic technologies and analytical methods have made significant strides in this area. Hayward et al. (2016) conducted a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) of over 4,200 dogs, identifying genetic risk factors for various complex traits and diseases. This landmark study demonstrated the feasibility of using large-scale genomic approaches to unravel the genetic basis of complex canine diseases. In a more targeted approach, Tonomura et al. (2015) combined GWAS with targeted resequencing to identify genetic risk factors for canine atopic dermatitis, a complex inflammatory skin disease. Their study revealed multiple loci associated with the disease, highlighting the polygenic nature of many common canine disorders. The interpretation of sequence variants identified in these studies poses a significant challenge, particularly for complex diseases. Lessons from human clinical genetics have been invaluable in this regard. Lindblad-Toh et al. (2005) emphasized the importance of comparative genomics in interpreting canine genetic variants, demonstrating how cross-species comparisons can help prioritize potentially pathogenic mutations. Moreover, the concept of precision medicine, which aims to tailor medical treatments to individual genetic profiles, is gaining traction in veterinary medicine. Friedenberg et al. (2018) discussed the potential applications of precision medicine in canine oncology, highlighting how genetic testing could guide treatment decisions and improve outcomes for dogs with cancer. The identification of genetic risk factors in dogs has implications beyond veterinary medicine. The concept of 'One Health,' which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, has gained prominence in recent years. Ostrander et al. (2019) reviewed how studies of canine genetics can inform our understanding of human diseases, given the many similarities in disease presentation and genetic architecture between dogs and humans. As genetic testing becomes more accessible and affordable, its integration into clinical veterinary practice is becoming increasingly feasible. Donner et al. (2018) discussed the practical applications of genetic testing in veterinary medicine, including disease diagnosis, breed identification, and genetic counseling for breeding programs. However, the rapid pace of genetic discoveries also raises ethical considerations. Moses et al. (2018) explored the ethical implications of genetic testing in dogs, highlighting the need for responsible use of genetic information to improve canine health without promoting harmful breeding practices. In conclusion, the field of canine genetics has made remarkable progress in identifying genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex diseases. These advancements have been driven by technological innovations in DNA sequencing and analysis, as well as by insights gained from human genetics. As we move forward, the challenge lies in translating these genetic discoveries into practical applications that can improve canine health and inform human medicine. The integration of genetic testing into clinical veterinary practice, guided by ethical considerations and the principles of One Health and precision medicine, holds great promise for the future of both animal and human health.", "References": [{"title": "A deletion in the ADAMTS3 gene is associated with hereditary nasal parakeratosis in Labrador Retrievers", "authors": "Broeckx Bart J G,
