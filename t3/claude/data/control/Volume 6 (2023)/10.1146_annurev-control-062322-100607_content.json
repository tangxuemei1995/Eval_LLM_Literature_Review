{"Literature Review": "Soft robotics has emerged as a rapidly growing field in recent years, offering innovative solutions to challenges faced by traditional rigid robots. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of soft robotics, examining key aspects such as actuation, sensing, modeling, control, and applications.Actuation is a fundamental component of soft robots, enabling them to perform various tasks and movements. Pneumatic actuation has been widely adopted in soft robotics due to its simplicity and effectiveness. For instance, Marchese et al. (2015) developed a soft robotic arm using pneumatic actuators, demonstrating the potential for complex manipulations. However, pneumatic systems often require bulky external components, limiting their portability. To address this issue, researchers have explored alternative actuation methods. Shintake et al. (2018) presented a comprehensive review of soft actuators, highlighting the potential of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) and shape memory alloys (SMAs) for creating more compact and efficient soft robots.Sensing capabilities are crucial for soft robots to interact with their environment effectively. Traditional rigid sensors are often incompatible with the compliant nature of soft robots, necessitating the development of novel sensing technologies. Thuruthel et al. (2019) reviewed various soft sensing technologies, emphasizing the importance of stretchable and flexible sensors for soft robotics applications. One promising approach is the use of liquid metal-based sensors, as demonstrated by Wang et al. (2017), who developed a highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensor using liquid metal microchannels.Accurate modeling and simulation of soft robots present significant challenges due to their complex, nonlinear behavior. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been widely used to model soft robotic systems, as shown by Runge et al. (2017) in their study of a soft pneumatic actuator. However, FEA can be computationally expensive for real-time applications. To address this limitation, researchers have explored data-driven modeling approaches. For example, Thuruthel et al. (2018) proposed a machine learning-based model for soft continuum manipulators, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional analytical models.Control strategies for soft robots must account for their inherent compliance and nonlinear dynamics. Model-based control approaches, such as those presented by Della Santina et al. (2018), have shown promise in achieving precise control of soft robotic systems. However, the complexity of soft robots often necessitates the use of more advanced control techniques. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for controlling soft robots, as demonstrated by Yu et al. (2020), who developed a learning-based control framework for a soft manipulator.The unique properties of soft robots make them well-suited for a wide range of applications. In the field of medical robotics, soft robots have shown great potential for minimally invasive surgery and rehabilitation. Cianchetti et al. (2018) reviewed the applications of soft robotics in surgery, highlighting the advantages of compliant structures in reducing tissue damage and improving patient outcomes. In the realm of human-robot interaction, soft robots offer inherent safety advantages over their rigid counterparts. Laschi et al. (2016) discussed the potential of soft robots for assistive and wearable applications, emphasizing their ability to conform to the human body.Locomotion is another area where soft robots have demonstrated unique capabilities. Inspired by biological systems, researchers have developed soft robots capable of navigating complex terrains and environments. Calisti et al. (2017) presented a comprehensive review of soft robot locomotion, discussing various bio-inspired designs and their potential applications in search and rescue operations and environmental monitoring.Despite the significant progress in soft robotics, several challenges remain to be addressed. Material science plays a crucial role in advancing soft robotics, with the need for more durable, multifunctional materials. Wallin et al. (2018) reviewed the current state of materials in soft robotics, highlighting the potential of 3D-printed soft materials and self-healing polymers for creating more robust and adaptable soft robots.As the field of soft robotics continues to evolve, integration of advanced sensing, actuation, and control technologies will be crucial for realizing their full potential. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will likely play an increasingly important role in enhancing the autonomy and adaptability of soft robots. Future research should focus on addressing the challenges of scalability, energy efficiency, and long-term durability to facilitate the transition of soft robots from laboratory settings to real-world applications.In conclusion, soft robotics represents a promising frontier in robotics research, offering unique solutions to challenges faced by traditional rigid robots. By continuing to advance our understanding of soft robot design, modeling, and control, we can unlock the full potential of these versatile and adaptable systems, paving the way for innovative applications across various domains.", "References": [{"title": "A hybrid combining hard and soft robots", "authors": "Andrew D.
