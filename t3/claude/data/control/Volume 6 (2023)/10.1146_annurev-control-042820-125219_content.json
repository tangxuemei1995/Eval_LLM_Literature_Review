{"Literature Review": "The control of multicarrier energy systems has emerged as a critical area of research in recent years, driven by the need to address cost, efficiency, and emissions concerns in the energy sector. This literature review explores the development and application of advanced control techniques for multiple carrier energy systems, ranging from individual buildings to interconnected networks.Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in energy management and control, demonstrating substantial potential for energy and CO2 emissions reductions. Mancarella (2014) provided a comprehensive review of the concept of multi-energy systems, highlighting the benefits of integrating different energy carriers and the challenges associated with their optimal operation and control.The integration of multiple energy carriers, conversion devices, and energy storage systems has been shown to offer increased flexibility and enhanced potential for energy and CO2 reduction. Geidl et al. (2007) introduced the concept of energy hubs, which serve as interfaces between different energy infrastructures and load centers. This approach allows for the optimal conversion and storage of multiple energy carriers, facilitating more efficient energy management.Building energy control has been a focal point in the development of multicarrier energy systems. Shaikh et al. (2014) reviewed various intelligent control systems for energy and comfort management in buildings, emphasizing the importance of advanced control strategies in achieving energy efficiency and occupant comfort. The application of model predictive control (MPC) in building energy management has gained significant attention due to its ability to handle constraints and optimize performance over a prediction horizon. Afram and Janabi-Sharifi (2014) provided a comprehensive review of MPC techniques for HVAC systems, highlighting their potential for energy savings and improved thermal comfort.As research in this field has progressed, the focus has expanded to encompass interconnected energy systems at larger scales. Distributed control approaches have emerged as promising solutions for managing complex, large-scale energy networks. Wang et al. (2018) reviewed distributed optimization algorithms for smart grid operations, emphasizing their ability to handle decentralized decision-making and improve system resilience.Cooperative control strategies have also gained traction in the management of multicarrier energy systems. These approaches enable coordination between different subsystems and energy carriers to achieve global optimization objectives. Parisio et al. (2017) proposed a cooperative MPC framework for microgrids, demonstrating improved performance in terms of cost reduction and renewable energy utilization compared to non-cooperative approaches.The dynamic interactions between multicarrier systems occur over various timescales, ranging from minutes to seasons. This temporal diversity necessitates the development of control strategies capable of addressing both short-term operational decisions and long-term planning. Mohammadi et al. (2018) presented a comprehensive review of energy hub optimization models, discussing various temporal resolutions and their implications for system performance.The constrained nature of multicarrier energy system control problems has led to the widespread adoption of optimization-based approaches. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a particularly effective technique due to its ability to handle constraints, incorporate forecasts, and optimize system performance over a prediction horizon. Serale et al. (2018) provided an extensive review of MPC applications in building energy management, highlighting its potential for energy savings and improved comfort.Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have also been applied to the control of multicarrier energy systems. Vazquez-Canteli and Nagy (2019) reviewed reinforcement learning applications in demand response and energy management, showcasing the potential of these techniques to adapt to changing conditions and improve system performance over time.As the complexity of multicarrier energy systems continues to grow, there is an increasing need for integrated approaches that can address the challenges of coordination, optimization, and control across different scales and timelines. Molina-Solana et al. (2017) discussed the potential of big data techniques in smart energy management, highlighting opportunities for improved decision-making and system optimization.In conclusion, the control of multicarrier energy systems from buildings to networks represents a rapidly evolving field with significant potential for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. The integration of advanced control techniques, such as MPC, distributed control, and cooperative control, along with the incorporation of artificial intelligence and big data analytics, offers promising avenues for future research and development in this critical area.", "References": [{"title": "Energy systems integration: Defining and describing the value proposition", "authors": "Pierluigi Mancarella", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2014", "volumes": "68", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.025"}, {"title": "The vision of energy hubs", "authors": "Martin Geidl, Gaudenz Koeppel, Patrick Favre-Perrod, Bernd Klockl, Goran Andersson, Klaus Frohlich", "journal": "IEEE Power and Energy Magazine", "year": "2007", "volumes": "5", "first page": "24", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1109/MPAE.2007.273992"}, {"title": "Intelligent control systems for energy and comfort management in smart energy buildings", "authors": "Pervez Hameed Shaikh, Nursyarizal Bin Mohd Nor, Perumal Nallagownden, Irraivan Elamvazuthi, Taib Ibrahim", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2014", "volumes": "34", "first page": "409", "last page": "429", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2014.03.027"}, {"title": "Theory and applications of HVAC control systems – A review of model predictive control (MPC)", "authors": "Abdul Afram, Farrokh Janabi-Sharifi", "journal": "Building and Environment", "year": "2014", "volumes": "72", "first page": "343", "last page": "355", "DOI": "10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.016"}, {"title": "A Survey of Distributed Optimization and Control Algorithms for Electric Power Systems", "authors": "Zhiwei Wang, Fangxing Li, Zhuohui Ren, Di Shi, Xiaohu Zhang, Yanli Liu, Pei Zhang", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "6580", "last page": "6591", "DOI": "10.1109/TSG.2017.2720471"}, {"title": "A market-based microgrid optimal scheduling technique using the holonic energy management concept", "authors": "Alessandra Parisio, Evangelos Rikos, Luigi Glielmo", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Power Systems", "year": "2017", "volumes": "32", "first page": "3958", "last page": "3969", "DOI": "10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2656939"}, {"title": "Energy Hub: From a Model to a Concept – A Review", "authors": "Mohammad Mohammadi, Younes Noorollahi, Behnam Mohammadi-Ivatloo, Hossein Yousefi", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "80", "first page": "1512", "last page": "1527", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2017.07.030"}, {"title": "Model predictive control (MPC) for enhancing building and HVAC system energy efficiency: Problem formulation, applications and opportunities", "authors": "Gianluca Serale, Massimo Fiorentini, Alfonso Capozzoli, Daniele Bernardini, Alberto Bemporad", "journal": "Energies", "year": "2018", "volumes": "11", "first page": "631", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3390/en11030631"}, {"title": "Reinforcement learning for energy conservation and comfort in buildings", "authors": "Jose R.
