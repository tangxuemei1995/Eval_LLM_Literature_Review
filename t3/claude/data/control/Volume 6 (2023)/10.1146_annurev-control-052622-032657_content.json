{"Literature Review": "The transition of electric power systems from traditional fossil fuel-based generation to low-inertia systems dominated by renewable energy sources and power electronics has sparked significant research interest in recent years. This shift presents numerous challenges in terms of control, modeling, and system stability, necessitating a comprehensive review of existing literature and the development of novel approaches to ensure reliable and efficient operation of future power grids.One of the primary concerns in low-inertia power systems is the reduced system inertia due to the displacement of synchronous generators by inverter-based resources (IBRs). Kroposki et al. (2017) highlight that as the penetration of IBRs increases, the system's ability to resist frequency changes decreases, potentially leading to stability issues. This phenomenon has prompted researchers to investigate new control strategies for grid-connected power converters to mitigate these challenges.Grid-forming control has emerged as a promising solution to address the stability concerns in low-inertia systems. Milano et al. (2018) provide a comprehensive review of grid-forming control strategies, emphasizing their ability to establish and maintain grid voltage and frequency in the absence of synchronous generators. These control techniques aim to emulate the behavior of synchronous machines, providing virtual inertia and damping to the system.The modeling of low-inertia systems presents its own set of challenges. Traditional power system models often rely on assumptions that may no longer hold in systems with high IBR penetration. Markovic et al. (2019) discuss the limitations of conventional modeling approaches and propose new methodologies that accurately capture the dynamics of power electronic interfaces and their interactions with the grid.Frequency dynamics in low-inertia systems have been a subject of extensive research. Ulbig et al. (2014) analyze the impact of reduced inertia on frequency stability and propose methods for estimating the required amount of virtual inertia to maintain system stability. Their work underscores the importance of developing accurate models for frequency response in low-inertia grids.The control of grid-connected power converters plays a crucial role in the stability and performance of low-inertia systems. Rocabert et al. (2012) provide an overview of control strategies for grid-connected power converters, including grid-following and grid-forming approaches. They emphasize the need for advanced control techniques that can adapt to varying grid conditions and support system stability.System-level services, such as frequency regulation and voltage support, are essential for maintaining grid stability. Molina-Garcia et al. (2011) review various ancillary services and their implementation in power systems with high renewable energy penetration. They highlight the potential of IBRs to provide these services, but also note the challenges in coordinating multiple distributed resources.The concept of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) has gained traction as a means of aggregating and coordinating distributed energy resources. Pudjianto et al. (2007) discuss the potential of DVPPs in providing system-level services and enhancing the flexibility of low-inertia grids. This approach allows for the efficient integration of diverse energy resources while maintaining system stability.As the complexity of low-inertia power systems increases, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine power systems engineering with control theory and power electronics. Dörfler et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of a system-theoretic mindset in addressing the challenges of low-inertia grids. They argue that this approach can help bridge the gap between different research communities and provide a holistic understanding of system dynamics.The transition to low-inertia power systems also necessitates a reevaluation of classical power system concepts. Matevosyan et al. (2019) discuss how traditional notions of system inertia, stability, and control need to be revised in the context of high IBR penetration. They propose new frameworks for analyzing and designing control systems for low-inertia grids.In conclusion, the control of low-inertia power systems presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers and engineers. The literature reviewed here highlights the need for innovative control strategies, accurate modeling techniques, and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure the stable and efficient operation of future power grids. As the transition to renewable energy sources continues, ongoing research in this field will be crucial in shaping the power systems of tomorrow.", "References": [{"title": "Achieving a 100% Renewable Grid: Operating Electric Power Systems with Extremely High Levels of Variable Renewable Energy", "authors": "Benjamin Kroposki, Brian Johnson, Yingchen Zhang, Vahan Gevorgian, Paul Denholm, Bri-Mathias Hodge, Bryan Hannegan", "journal": "IEEE Power and Energy Magazine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "15", "first page": "61", "last page": "73", "DOI": "10.1109/MPE.2016.2637122"}, {"title": "Foundations and Challenges of Low-Inertia Systems", "authors": "Federico Milano, Florian Dörfler, Gabriela Hug, David J.
