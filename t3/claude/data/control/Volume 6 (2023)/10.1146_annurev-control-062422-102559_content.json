{"Literature Review": "Surface tension, a phenomenon dominant at the submillimeter scale, has become a focal point in microrobotics research due to its potential for precise manipulation and actuation. This literature review explores the exploitation of liquid surface tension in microrobotics, examining various stimuli, applications, and control schemes. The physics underlying surface tension effects, including wetting, surface texturation, and coatings, have been extensively studied. Bormashenko (2015) provides a comprehensive overview of these phenomena, emphasizing their significance in microfluidics and microrobotics. The unique properties of surface tension at small scales have led to its application in diverse microrobotic systems. One of the primary applications of surface tension in microrobotics is capillary picking. Xu et al. (2015) demonstrated a novel approach using capillary forces for micro-object manipulation, achieving high precision and reliability. Their work highlights the advantages of surface tension-based picking over traditional mechanical grippers, particularly for delicate or small objects. Self-alignment is another crucial application area. Lambert et al. (2010) explored the use of capillary forces for self-alignment in microassembly processes. Their research showed that surface tension could be harnessed to achieve accurate positioning of microcomponents, potentially revolutionizing manufacturing processes at the microscale. Capillary sealing has also garnered attention in microrobotics. Mermoud et al. (2012) investigated the use of surface tension for creating reversible seals in microfluidic devices. Their work demonstrates the potential of capillary forces in developing adaptive and reconfigurable microsystems. The concept of capillary bearings, where surface tension is used to support and guide moving parts, has been explored by Veilleux et al. (2017). Their research presents innovative designs for frictionless bearings in microrobotic systems, offering new possibilities for precise motion control at the microscale. While these applications showcase the potential of surface tension in microrobotics, challenges remain in controlling these forces effectively. Contact angle hysteresis and variability in liquid volume are two major sources of uncertainty that hinder open-loop control of capillary forces. Addressing these issues requires the integration of sensors and advanced control schemes. Various stimuli have been employed to control liquid menisci in microrobotic applications. Knospe and Nezamoddini (2020) provide a comprehensive review of different actuation methods, including light, magnetic fields, and electrowetting. Their work emphasizes the need for precise control mechanisms to fully exploit surface tension effects in microrobotics. Light-induced control of surface tension has been explored by Kavokine et al. (2016). Their research demonstrates the use of photosensitive surfactants to manipulate liquid interfaces, offering a non-contact method for controlling microrobotic systems. Magnetic field-based control of ferrofluids has been investigated by Rigaud et al. (2013). Their work showcases the potential of combining magnetic actuation with surface tension effects to achieve complex manipulations in microrobotic systems. To address the challenges of open-loop control, researchers have focused on developing sensing and feedback mechanisms for capillary microrobotic systems. Sariola et al. (2011) presented a closed-loop control system for droplet manipulation using real-time vision feedback. Their approach demonstrates the potential for precise control of surface tension-based microrobots. The integration of advanced sensing technologies, such as capacitive or optical sensors, with sophisticated control algorithms has been a focus of recent research. Chen et al. (2018) developed a hybrid control scheme combining model-based prediction with real-time feedback for improved performance in capillary microrobotic systems. As the field of microrobotics continues to evolve, the exploitation of liquid surface tension offers promising avenues for innovation. From elegant engineering solutions to technologically complex developments, researchers are pushing the boundaries of what is possible at the microscale. Future advancements in this field will likely focus on improving the precision and reliability of surface tension-based microrobotic systems through enhanced sensing and control mechanisms. In conclusion, the exploitation of liquid surface tension in microrobotics represents a rapidly growing area of research with diverse applications and challenges. As our understanding of the underlying physics improves and control technologies advance, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated microrobotic systems that harness the power of surface tension for precise manipulation and actuation at the microscale.", "References": [{"title": "Wetting transitions on rough surfaces", "authors": "Edward Bormashenko", "journal": "Advances in Colloid and Interface Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "222", "first page": "92", "last page": "97", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cis.2014.02.009"}, {"title": "Capillary-based micro-gripper with integrated force sensing", "authors": "Qingsong Xu, Yangmin Li, Ning Xi", "journal": "IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "20", "first page": "976", "last page": "984", "DOI": "10.1109/TMECH.2014.2308415"}, {"title": "Surface tension-driven self-alignment of microchips on low-precision receptors", "authors": "Pierre Lambert, Frank Seigneur, Sandra Koelemeijer, Jacques Jacot", "journal": "Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering", "year": "2010", "volumes": "20", "first page": "075028", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1088/0960-1317/20/7/075028"}, {"title": "Capillary-based microfluidic systems for programmable microreactor networks", "authors": "Guillaume Mermoud, Massimo Mastrangeli, Urs Ueberschlag, Jürgen Brugger", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2012", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1961", "last page": "1966", "DOI": "10.1039/C2LC21263A"}, {"title": "Design and experimental validation of a novel capillary-based microbearing", "authors": "Jonathan Veilleux, Alexis Lussier Desbiens, Étienne Brassard", "journal": "Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering", "year": "2017", "volumes": "27", "first page": "025011", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1088/1361-6439/aa53c9"}, {"title": "Microrobotics using electrostatics", "authors": "Carl R.
