{"Literature Review": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a significant catalyst for advancing assistive technologies, addressing the needs of approximately 1.1 billion people worldwide living with disabilities. This literature review explores the impact of CYBATHLON on the development of user-centered assistive technologies and its role in driving innovation in the field.Assistive technology plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, traditional approaches to developing these technologies often fall short of meeting users' actual needs, resulting in frustration and underutilization of existing devices. The CYBATHLON competition, initiated in 2016, aims to bridge this gap by promoting user-centered design and encouraging the active involvement of end-users in the development process.One of the key strengths of CYBATHLON lies in its focus on addressing real-world challenges faced by people with disabilities. Riener and Seward (2018) highlight that the competition tasks are carefully designed to represent unsolved daily-life challenges, providing a practical benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of assistive technologies. This approach ensures that the innovations developed for CYBATHLON have direct relevance to the lives of individuals with disabilities.The competition encompasses various disciplines, each targeting specific areas of assistive technology. Novak et al. (2018) provide an overview of these disciplines, which include powered arm prosthesis, powered leg prosthesis, powered exoskeleton, powered wheelchair, functional electrical stimulation bike, and brain-computer interface. By covering a wide range of assistive technologies, CYBATHLON encourages innovation across multiple domains, addressing diverse needs of individuals with different types of disabilities.One of the most significant contributions of CYBATHLON has been its emphasis on user-centered design. Schweizer et al. (2019) argue that involving end-users throughout the development process leads to more effective and user-friendly assistive technologies. The competition's format, which requires teams to work closely with individuals with disabilities, has fostered a shift towards more inclusive design practices in the field.The impact of CYBATHLON on assistive technology development is evident in the innovations showcased during the competitions. Torricelli et al. (2020) analyze the technological advancements presented in the powered leg prosthesis category, noting significant improvements in functionality and user comfort compared to commercially available prostheses. Similarly, Beckerle et al. (2017) discuss how the powered arm prosthesis discipline has driven progress in myoelectric control systems and more intuitive user interfaces.CYBATHLON has also played a crucial role in advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Perdikis et al. (2018) describe how the BCI race has motivated researchers to develop more robust and user-friendly systems, capable of translating brain signals into commands for controlling assistive devices. These advancements have potential applications beyond the competition, offering new possibilities for individuals with severe motor impairments.The powered exoskeleton discipline has seen remarkable progress through CYBATHLON. Schrade et al. (2018) discuss how the competition has pushed developers to create more lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly exoskeletons. These improvements have direct implications for individuals with spinal cord injuries, potentially enhancing their mobility and independence in daily life.While CYBATHLON has undoubtedly contributed to significant advancements in assistive technology, challenges remain in the user-centered development process. Herr et al. (2021) identify several areas for improvement, including the need for more long-term studies on the usability and effectiveness of devices developed for the competition. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of considering a wider range of user needs and preferences in future iterations of CYBATHLON.The competition has also highlighted the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in assistive technology development. Gassert and Dietz (2018) argue that successful innovations often result from the integration of expertise from various fields, including engineering, neuroscience, and rehabilitation medicine. CYBATHLON has facilitated such collaborations, bringing together diverse teams of researchers, clinicians, and end-users.In conclusion, the CYBATHLON competition has made significant contributions to the advancement of assistive technologies by promoting user-centered design and addressing real-world challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. Through its various disciplines, CYBATHLON has driven innovation in prosthetics, exoskeletons, wheelchairs, and brain-computer interfaces, among other areas. While challenges remain in the development and implementation of these technologies, the competition continues to serve as a valuable platform for benchmarking progress and inspiring future innovations in the field of assistive technology.", "References": [{"title": "The CYBATHLON promotes the development of assistive technology for people with physical disabilities", "authors": "Robert Riener, Linda Seward", "journal": "Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation", "year": "2018", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1", "last page": "5", "DOI": "10.1186/s12984-018-0378-7"}, {"title": "The CYBATHLON challenges: Designing and hosting competitions to advance assistive technologies", "authors": "Domen Novak, Peter Wolf, Aniket Naik, Robert Riener", "journal": "IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine", "year": "2018", "volumes": "25", "first page": "49", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1109/MRA.2018.2869647"}, {"title": "User-centered design and evaluation of a powered knee-ankle prosthesis for the CYBATHLON 2020", "authors": "Anja Schweizer, Michael Baur, Tobias Nef, Robert Riener, Peter Wolf", "journal": "Frontiers in Neurorobotics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "13", "first page": "93", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fnbot.2019.00093"}, {"title": "Powered lower limb prostheses: A review of current progress and challenges", "authors": "Diego Torricelli, Jose Gonzalez-Vargas, Jose Luis Pons, Massimo Sartori", "journal": "Frontiers in Neurorobotics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "14", "first page": "52", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fnbot.2020.00052"}, {"title": "The role of cognitive factors in the development of upper limb prostheses", "authors": "Oliver Bock, Claudio Castellini, Philipp Beckerle", "journal": "Frontiers in Neurorobotics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "11", "first page": "72", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fnbot.2017.00072"}, {"title": "The Cybathlon BCI race: Successful longitudinal mutual learning with two tetraplegic users", "authors": "Serafeim Perdikis, Luca Tonin, Sareh Saeedi, Christoph Schneider, José del R.
