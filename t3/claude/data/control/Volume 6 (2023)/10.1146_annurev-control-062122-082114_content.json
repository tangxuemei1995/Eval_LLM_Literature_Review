{"Literature Review": "Spacecraft-mounted robotics has emerged as a critical technology for advancing space exploration and in-orbit servicing missions. As space agencies and private companies increasingly focus on extending the lifespan of satellites, repairing damaged spacecraft, and assembling large structures in orbit, the importance of robotic systems in space cannot be overstated. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of spacecraft-mounted robotics, focusing on their significance, modeling approaches, control strategies, and recent developments in the field.The importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics for in-orbit servicing missions has been widely recognized in recent years. Flores-Abad et al. (2014) provided a comprehensive review of robotic systems for on-orbit servicing, highlighting their potential to reduce mission costs and extend the operational life of satellites. They emphasized the need for advanced robotic technologies to perform tasks such as refueling, repair, and debris removal in the challenging space environment. Similarly, Nanjangud et al. (2018) discussed the growing demand for on-orbit servicing and assembly, emphasizing the role of robotic manipulators in these operations.Modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems present unique challenges due to the complex dynamics involved. Umetani and Yoshida (1989) were among the early researchers to address the coupled dynamics of space manipulators and their base spacecraft. They proposed a generalized Jacobian matrix approach to model the kinematic relationships between the end-effector and the base motion. Building upon this work, Xu and Shum (2014) developed a unified modeling framework for free-floating space manipulators, incorporating both kinematic and dynamic aspects of the system.Control strategies for spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators have evolved significantly over the years. Dubowsky and Papadopoulos (1993) introduced the concept of space manipulator workspace and proposed control algorithms to address the challenges of operating in a microgravity environment. Their work laid the foundation for subsequent research in this area. More recently, Rybus and Seweryn (2016) presented a comprehensive review of various control methods for free-floating space manipulators, including adaptive control, robust control, and intelligent control techniques.One of the key challenges in controlling spacecraft-mounted robotic systems is trajectory tracking. Nguyen-Huynh and Sharf (2013) proposed a novel adaptive control scheme for trajectory tracking of space robots, addressing the uncertainties in system parameters and external disturbances. Their approach demonstrated improved performance compared to traditional control methods. In a related study, Wang et al. (2018) developed a robust adaptive control strategy for space manipulators with uncertain kinematics and dynamics, showing enhanced tracking accuracy and disturbance rejection capabilities.The use of hypercomplex numbers, particularly dual quaternions, has gained attention in recent years for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators. Filipe and Tsiotras (2013) introduced a dual quaternion-based framework for modeling the coupled kinematics and dynamics of a rigid body system. They demonstrated the advantages of this approach in terms of computational efficiency and singularity avoidance. Expanding on this work, Virgili-Llop et al. (2017) developed a dual quaternion-based control scheme for spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators, showing improved performance in trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance tasks.Despite the significant progress made in spacecraft-mounted robotics, several outstanding research questions remain. One major challenge is the development of robust and adaptive control algorithms that can handle the uncertainties and disturbances inherent in the space environment. Shi et al. (2017) addressed this issue by proposing a neural network-based adaptive control scheme for space manipulators, demonstrating improved performance in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances.Another important area of research is the development of autonomous and intelligent robotic systems for space applications. Flores-Abad et al. (2017) explored the use of machine learning techniques for autonomous grasping and manipulation in space, highlighting the potential of these approaches for future in-orbit servicing missions. Similarly, Rekleitis et al. (2018) investigated the application of artificial intelligence and computer vision for on-orbit assembly tasks, demonstrating the feasibility of autonomous robotic operations in space.As the field of spacecraft-mounted robotics continues to evolve, several potential future directions emerge. One promising area is the development of modular and reconfigurable robotic systems that can adapt to various mission requirements. Another important direction is the integration of advanced sensing and perception capabilities to enhance the autonomy and reliability of space robotic systems. Additionally, the exploration of novel materials and actuation technologies tailored for the space environment could lead to significant improvements in the performance and durability of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators.In conclusion, spacecraft-mounted robotics plays a crucial role in advancing space exploration and in-orbit servicing capabilities. The field has seen significant progress in modeling, control, and trajectory tracking techniques, with recent developments in dual quaternion-based approaches showing promise. As research continues to address outstanding challenges and explore new frontiers, spacecraft-mounted robotics is poised to enable increasingly complex and ambitious space missions in the coming years.", "References": [{"title": "On-orbit servicing: A brief survey", "authors": "Angel Flores-Abad, Ou Ma, Khanh Pham, Steve Ulrich", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2014", "volumes": "68", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paerosci.2013.11.003"}, {"title": "Robot-Assisted Assembly of Modular Space Structures: A Review of Guidance Techniques", "authors": "Ashith Nanjangud, Peter C.
