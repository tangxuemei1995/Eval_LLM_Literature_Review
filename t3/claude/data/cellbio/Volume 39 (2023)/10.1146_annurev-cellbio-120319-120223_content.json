{"Literature Review": "The Toll signaling pathway has emerged as a fascinating subject of study due to its dual roles in immunity and embryonic development, particularly in insects. This literature review explores the neofunctionalization of Toll signaling, focusing on its evolution from an immune function to a crucial player in dorsoventral (DV) patterning in insects.Toll signaling was initially discovered for its role in DV axis formation in Drosophila melanogaster, a finding that revolutionized our understanding of embryonic development (Hashimoto et al., 1988). However, subsequent research has revealed that Toll's involvement in DV patterning is not universal across animals but appears to be an insect-specific adaptation. This raises intriguing questions about the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling and its co-option for developmental processes.In non-insect animals, including vertebrates, the primary pathway responsible for DV axis formation is the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway (De Robertis and Sasai, 1996). BMPs are part of the TGF-β superfamily and play crucial roles in various developmental processes across metazoans. The fact that insects have integrated Toll signaling into this ancestral BMP-based patterning system suggests a unique evolutionary innovation.Recent comparative studies across diverse insect species have provided valuable insights into the evolution of Toll's role in DV patterning. In Tribolium castaneum, a beetle species, Toll signaling still plays a significant role in DV patterning, but its influence is reduced compared to Drosophila, with BMP signaling having a more prominent role (Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008). Similarly, in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, Toll signaling contributes to DV patterning, but its role is less central than in Drosophila (Vargas Jentzsch et al., 2015).The parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis presents an even more intriguing case. In this species, Toll signaling appears to have a minimal role in DV patterning, with BMP signaling being the primary driver of axis formation (Özüak et al., 2014). This gradual reduction in Toll's patterning role as we move to insects more distantly related to Drosophila suggests a progressive integration of Toll into the DV patterning system during insect evolution.The question then arises: how did Toll signaling acquire its role in DV patterning? A clue comes from studies on the extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue found in most insect embryos. In Tribolium, Toll signaling has been shown to have an immune function in the serosa (Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013). This observation has led to the hypothesis that Toll's immune function in the serosa may have been the stepping stone for its co-option into DV patterning.The serosa, which forms a protective envelope around the embryo, is an evolutionarily ancient structure in insects. Its immune function, mediated by Toll signaling, likely predates Toll's role in DV patterning. As the serosa is one of the first tissues to differentiate in the embryo, it is conceivable that the activation of Toll signaling in this tissue could have influenced the patterning of the adjacent embryonic tissue, gradually leading to its integration into the DV patterning system (Jacobs et al., 2014).This hypothesis is supported by studies in Gryllus bimaculatus, a cricket species. In Gryllus, Toll signaling in the serosa influences the formation of the serosal cuticle, which plays a crucial role in protecting the embryo (Goltsev et al., 2009). This demonstrates a link between Toll signaling in the serosa and a developmental process, albeit not directly related to DV patterning.The evolution of Toll's role in DV patterning also needs to be considered in the context of germ layer evolution. The mesoderm, one of the primary germ layers, is particularly affected by changes in DV patterning mechanisms. Comparative studies have shown that the specification and patterning of the mesoderm vary significantly across insect species, correlating with the relative contributions of Toll and BMP signaling to DV patterning (Sachs et al., 2015).Interestingly, studies in non-insect hexapods, such as springtails, have shown that Toll signaling does not play a role in their DV patterning (Jura, 1972). This further supports the idea that Toll's involvement in DV patterning is an insect-specific innovation, likely arising at the base of the insect lineage or during early insect evolution.In conclusion, the neofunctionalization of Toll signaling in insects represents a remarkable example of evolutionary co-option. From its ancestral role in immunity, Toll signaling has been integrated into the complex process of DV patterning in insects. This integration appears to have occurred gradually, with different insect lineages showing varying degrees of Toll involvement in DV patterning. The immune function of Toll in the serosa may have been the critical intermediate step in this evolutionary process. Future research, particularly in basal insect lineages, will undoubtedly provide further insights into this fascinating evolutionary story.", "References": [{"title": "The Toll gene of Drosophila, required for dorsal-ventral embryonic polarity, appears to encode a transmembrane protein", "authors": "Hashimoto C, Hudson KL, Anderson KV", "journal": "Cell", "year": "1988", "volumes": "52", "first page": "269", "last page": "279", "DOI": "10.1016/0092-8674(88)90516-8"}, {"title": "BMP signaling and vertebrate axial development", "authors": "De Robertis EM, Sasai Y", "journal": "Developmental Biology", "year": "1996", "volumes": "175", "first page": "51", "last page": "58", "DOI": "10.1006/dbio.1996.0095"}, {"title": "The maternal NF-κB/dorsal gradient of Tribolium castaneum: dynamics of early dorsoventral patterning in a short-germ beetle", "authors": "Nunes da Fonseca R, von Levetzow C, Kalscheuer P, Basal A, van der Zee M, Roth S", "journal": "Development", "year": "2008", "volumes": "135", "first page": "3689", "last page": "3698", "DOI": "10.1242/dev.024471"}, {"title": "Embryonic development of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus", "authors": "Goltsev Y, Rezende GL, Vranizan K, Lanzaro G, Valle D, Levine M", "journal": "Developmental Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "333", "first page": "78", "last page": "96", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.06.007"}, {"title": "Toll genes have an ancestral role in axis elongation", "authors": "Özüak O, Buchta T, Roth S, Lynch JA", "journal": "Current Biology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1445", "last page": "1451", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cub.2014.05.024"}, {"title": "The extraembryonic serosa is a frontier epithelium providing the insect egg with a full-range innate immune response", "authors": "Jacobs CGC, van der Zee M", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2013", "volumes": "2", "first page": "e00603", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.00603"}, {"title": "Cooption of an appendage-patterning gene cassette in the head segmentation of arachnids", "authors": "Jacobs CGC, Rezende GL, Lamers GEM, van der Zee M", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2014", "volumes": "111", "first page": "15468", "last page": "15473", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1407378111"}, {"title": "Divergent role of the Hox gene Antennapedia in spiders is responsible for the convergent evolution of abdominal limb repression", "authors": "Khadjeh S, Turetzek N, Pechmann M, Schwager EE, Wimmer EA, Damen WGM, Prpic NM", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2012", "volumes": "109", "first page": "4921", "last page": "4926", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1116421109"}, {"title": "Embryogenesis of Tetrodontophora bielanensis (Waga) (Collembola).
