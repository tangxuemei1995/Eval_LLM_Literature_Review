{"Literature Review": "The endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus, exhibits a remarkable capacity for regeneration, making it a unique model for studying tissue repair in mammals. This literature review explores the mechanisms of regeneration and fibrosis in the endometrium, focusing on various disruption events and their outcomes across different species.Endometrial regeneration is a physiological process that occurs regularly in many mammals, including humans and some primates. In humans, the endometrium undergoes cyclic regeneration during menstruation, a process that involves shedding and subsequent regrowth of the functional layer (Gargett et al., 2012). This monthly renewal is orchestrated by complex interactions between hormones, growth factors, and stem cells. Endometrial stem cells, located in the basalis layer, play a crucial role in this regenerative process, giving rise to various cell types that compose the functional layer (Chan et al., 2004).The regenerative capacity of the endometrium is particularly evident following parturition, where substantial tissue loss occurs. Studies in rodents have shown that the postpartum endometrium undergoes rapid and complete regeneration within days, restoring both structure and function (Huang et al., 2012). This process involves the activation of resident stem cells, angiogenesis, and the coordinated action of growth factors and cytokines.While the endometrium demonstrates remarkable regenerative abilities under normal physiological conditions, certain pathological events can lead to impaired regeneration and fibrosis. Asherman syndrome, characterized by intrauterine adhesions, is a prime example of endometrial fibrosis. This condition often results from trauma to the endometrium, such as aggressive curettage or severe infections (Yu et al., 2008). In Asherman syndrome, the normal regenerative process is disrupted, leading to the formation of scar tissue that can impair fertility and menstrual function.The mechanisms underlying the shift from regeneration to fibrosis in the endometrium are not fully understood, but several factors have been implicated. Inflammation plays a dual role in this process, being essential for normal tissue repair but potentially detrimental when dysregulated. Excessive or prolonged inflammation can promote fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, leading to fibrosis (Maybin and Critchley, 2015).The balance between pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic factors is crucial in determining the outcome of endometrial repair. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been identified as a key pro-fibrotic factor in various tissues, including the endometrium. Elevated levels of TGF-β have been observed in fibrotic endometrial lesions, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of intrauterine adhesions (Salma et al., 2018).Stem cells play a vital role in endometrial regeneration, and their dysfunction may contribute to fibrosis. Recent studies have explored the potential of stem cell-based therapies for treating endometrial fibrosis. Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells have shown promise in restoring endometrial function in animal models of Asherman syndrome (Santamaria et al., 2016). These findings highlight the importance of stem cells in maintaining the regenerative capacity of the endometrium.The extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and remodeling are critical factors in determining the outcome of endometrial repair. Normal regeneration involves a balanced process of ECM degradation and synthesis, while fibrosis is characterized by excessive ECM deposition. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) play crucial roles in this process, with their dysregulation being associated with fibrotic outcomes (Gaide Chevronnay et al., 2012).Comparative studies across species have provided valuable insights into endometrial regeneration and fibrosis. While humans and some primates experience menstruation, most mammals, including rodents, do not. However, rodents still exhibit remarkable endometrial regeneration following parturition or artificially induced menstruation-like events. These cross-species comparisons have revealed both conserved and species-specific mechanisms of endometrial repair (Emera et al., 2012).Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have allowed for a more detailed understanding of the cellular heterogeneity within the endometrium and the specific cell populations involved in regeneration and fibrosis. These studies have identified distinct subpopulations of endometrial stromal cells with varying regenerative potentials and roles in the repair process (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018).In conclusion, the endometrium presents a unique model for studying the balance between regeneration and fibrosis in mammalian tissues. The complex interplay between hormones, stem cells, inflammatory mediators, and the extracellular matrix determines the outcome of endometrial repair. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for endometrial disorders and may provide insights applicable to regenerative medicine in other tissues. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular switches that govern the transition from regeneration to fibrosis and exploring novel therapeutic approaches to promote regeneration in cases of endometrial scarring.", "References": [{"title": "Endometrial stem/progenitor cells: the first 10 years", "authors": "Caroline E.
