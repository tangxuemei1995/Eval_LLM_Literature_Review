{"Literature Review": "The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cellular growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. In eukaryotes, TOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes: TOR Complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR Complex 2 (TORC2). While TORC1 has been extensively studied, our understanding of TORC2 regulation and function has lagged behind. This literature review focuses on the current knowledge of TORC2 function and localization in yeast, primarily Saccharomyces cerevisiae.TORC2 is a large protein complex composed of several subunits, including the catalytic TOR2 kinase, Avo1, Avo2, Avo3, Bit61, and Lst8. The assembly and structural organization of TORC2 have been elucidated through various biochemical and structural studies. Gaubitz et al. (2015) provided insights into the molecular architecture of TORC2 using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a rhombohedral structure with two-fold symmetry.One of the distinguishing features of TORC2 is its predominant localization at the plasma membrane (PM). This localization is critical for its function in maintaining PM homeostasis. Berchtold and Walther (2009) demonstrated that TORC2 regulates the synthesis of sphingolipids, which are essential components of the PM. Furthermore, Niles et al. (2012) showed that TORC2 activity is required for proper actin cytoskeleton organization, which is intimately linked to PM dynamics.The regulation of TORC2 localization and activity is a complex process involving multiple factors. Phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), play a crucial role in recruiting TORC2 to the PM. Hatano et al. (2015) demonstrated that the PH domain of Avo1 binds to PIP2, anchoring TORC2 to the PM. This interaction is essential for TORC2 function, as mutations disrupting PIP2 binding lead to TORC2 mislocalization and impaired signaling.Recent studies have also implicated endosomes in TORC2 regulation. Rispal et al. (2015) showed that a pool of TORC2 localizes to endosomes, and this localization is important for its activation. The authors proposed a model where TORC2 cycles between the PM and endosomes, with endosomal localization facilitating its activation.TORC2 activity is regulated by various upstream signals, including nutrients, stress, and growth factors. However, unlike TORC1, TORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin, making its study more challenging. Zinzalla et al. (2011) identified ribosome association as a key activator of TORC2, linking protein synthesis to TORC2 signaling. This finding suggests that TORC2 may sense cellular growth rates through ribosome interaction.Phosphorylation plays a crucial role in regulating TORC2 function. Roelants et al. (2017) identified a negative feedback loop where TORC2 phosphorylates and activates Ypk1 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits TORC2. This mechanism helps maintain homeostatic control of TORC2 signaling.TORC2 exerts its effects through the phosphorylation of several downstream targets. One of the best-characterized substrates is the AGC kinase Ypk1/2. Muir et al. (2014) showed that TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Ypk1/2 regulates sphingolipid biosynthesis and actin organization. Additionally, TORC2 phosphorylates Slm1/2, proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and stress response.Recent studies have expanded our understanding of TORC2's role beyond PM homeostasis. Gaubitz et al. (2016) demonstrated that TORC2 regulates vacuole morphology and function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular compartmentalization. Moreover, Leskoske et al. (2018) uncovered a role for TORC2 in cell cycle progression, linking nutrient sensing to cell division.In conclusion, research on TORC2 in yeast has provided valuable insights into its assembly, localization, and function. The complex interplay between TORC2, the PM, and endosomes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Future studies will likely focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms of TORC2 activation and identifying novel substrates and functions. Understanding TORC2 regulation in yeast will continue to inform our knowledge of TOR signaling in higher eukaryotes, including humans, where dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in various diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Architecture of the human mTORC2 core complex", "authors": "Clemens Gaubitz, Taiana M.
