{"Literature Review": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a crucial role in protein synthesis by decoding messenger RNA (mRNA) codons into amino acids at the ribosome. Recent research has revealed that tRNA biology is far more complex than previously thought, with implications for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This literature review explores the current understanding of tRNA dysregulation in neurological disorders, focusing on tRNA gene expression, processing, modification, and the role of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs).tRNA gene expression in neurons has been shown to be tightly regulated and not functionally redundant, despite the presence of multiple genes for each amino acid and anticodon in the nuclear genome. Dittmar et al. (2006) demonstrated that tRNA gene expression varies across different tissues, suggesting tissue-specific regulation of tRNA pools. This finding has important implications for understanding how tRNA dysregulation can lead to neurological disorders.The balance between codon demand and tRNA availability is critical for proper protein synthesis. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional or underexpressed, it can result in an imbalance that affects cellular function. Gingold et al. (2014) reported that tRNA gene expression is dynamically regulated in response to cellular proliferation and differentiation, highlighting the importance of maintaining appropriate tRNA pools for cellular homeostasis.tRNA processing and modification are essential steps in tRNA maturation and function. Defects in these processes have been linked to various neurological disorders. For instance, Schaffer et al. (2014) identified mutations in the CLP1 gene, which is involved in tRNA splicing, as a cause of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. This finding underscores the importance of proper tRNA processing in neurodevelopment.Post-transcriptional modifications of tRNAs play a crucial role in their stability, structure, and function. Aberrant tRNA modifications have been implicated in several neurological diseases. Torres et al. (2014) demonstrated that mutations in the NSUN2 gene, which encodes a tRNA methyltransferase, cause intellectual disability and microcephaly. This study highlights the significance of tRNA modifications in neurodevelopment and cognitive function.Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are essential enzymes that attach amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Mutations in aaRS genes have been associated with various neurological disorders. Antonellis et al. (2003) identified mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene as a cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D, a peripheral neuropathy. This discovery led to the recognition that aaRS mutations can cause a spectrum of neurological disorders.Recessive mutations in several aaRS genes have been linked to syndromic disorders affecting multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. For example, Simons et al. (2015) reported that mutations in the VARS gene, encoding valyl-tRNA synthetase, cause a complex developmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy. These findings emphasize the critical role of aaRSs in neurodevelopment and brain function.Interestingly, dominant mutations in a subset of aaRS genes predominantly lead to peripheral neuropathies. Jordanova et al. (2006) identified dominant mutations in the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS) gene as a cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type C. The mechanism underlying the tissue-specific effects of these mutations remains an active area of research, with implications for understanding the sensitivity of neurons to tRNA dysregulation.The integrated stress response (ISR) has emerged as a key pathway linking tRNA biology to cellular stress and neurodegeneration. Ishimura et al. (2014) demonstrated that ribosome stalling due to tRNA deficiency activates the ISR, leading to neurodegeneration in a mouse model. This finding provides insight into how tRNA imbalances can trigger cellular stress responses and contribute to neurological disorders.Recent studies have also implicated tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in neurological diseases. Ivanov et al. (2014) showed that angiogenin, a ribonuclease involved in tRNA cleavage and tRF production, plays a role in stress response and neuroprotection. Dysregulation of angiogenin and tRF production has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases.In conclusion, the growing body of evidence highlights the critical role of tRNA biology in neurological health and disease. Dysregulation of tRNA gene expression, processing, modification, and aminoacylation can lead to a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The sensitivity of neurons to these changes remains an important area for future research, with potential implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting tRNA biology in neurological diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Tissue-specific differences in human transfer RNA expression", "authors": "Kelly A.
