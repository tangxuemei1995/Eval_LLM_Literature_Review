{"Literature Review": "RNA repair mechanisms have been a subject of intense research for over half a century, with the discovery of enzymes capable of modifying RNA 5' and 3' ends through phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and ligation. These enzymes play crucial roles in repairing site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone, a process that is essential for maintaining RNA integrity and function. The field of RNA repair has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the identification of numerous candidate RNA repair activities across all phylogenetic domains. However, our understanding of the biological pathways in which these activities operate remains limited.One of the most well-studied RNA repair pathways is tRNA splicing, which involves the removal of introns from precursor tRNAs and the subsequent ligation of the resulting exons. Abelson and colleagues first described this process in yeast, demonstrating that tRNA splicing requires multiple enzymatic steps, including endonucleolytic cleavage, end healing, and end sealing. The end healing step involves a polynucleotide kinase that phosphorylates the 5' end of the 3' exon and a phosphatase that removes the 2',3'-cyclic phosphate from the 3' end of the 5' exon. Subsequently, an RNA ligase joins the two exon halves to form the mature tRNA.Another important RNA repair pathway is tRNA restriction-repair, which has been extensively studied in bacteria and archaea. This process involves the cleavage of tRNAs by specific endonucleases in response to various stress conditions, followed by repair of the cleaved tRNAs to restore their function. For instance, in Escherichia coli, the PrrC endonuclease cleaves tRNA-Lys in response to bacteriophage T4 infection, while the RloC endonuclease targets multiple tRNAs under various stress conditions. The repair of these cleaved tRNAs is mediated by the Pnkp-Hen1 repair system, which consists of a polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (Pnkp) and an RNA methyltransferase (Hen1).The discovery of new RNA repair enzymes has been facilitated by advances in genomics and biochemical characterization techniques. For example, the identification of the bacterial RNA repair operon Pnkp-Hen1 led to the discovery of homologous systems in other organisms, including archaea and eukaryotes. These findings suggest that RNA repair mechanisms are more widespread and diverse than previously thought, with potential implications for understanding RNA metabolism and regulation across different species.One of the key challenges in the field of RNA repair is identifying the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage in vivo. While some RNA cleavage events are part of normal cellular processes, such as tRNA splicing, others may be induced by various stress conditions or pathogenic factors. For instance, viral infections have been shown to induce host RNA cleavage as part of the innate immune response, necessitating RNA repair mechanisms to maintain cellular function.The consequences of RNA repair can vary depending on the specific pathway and cellular context. In some cases, RNA repair results in the restoration of the original RNA sequence and structure, as seen in tRNA splicing. However, in other instances, RNA repair may lead to modifications of the RNA ends or even rearrangements of the broken RNA segments, potentially resulting in RNA recombination. These diverse outcomes highlight the complexity of RNA repair processes and their potential impact on gene expression and cellular function.Recent studies have also revealed the importance of RNA repair in maintaining genome stability and cellular homeostasis. For example, the human RNA repair enzyme RtcB has been shown to play a role in the unfolded protein response by repairing cleaved XBP1 mRNA, which is essential for activating the stress response pathway. Additionally, defects in RNA repair mechanisms have been implicated in various human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer, underscoring the clinical relevance of these processes.As our understanding of RNA repair mechanisms continues to grow, new questions and challenges emerge. One area of particular interest is the potential application of RNA repair enzymes in biotechnology and therapeutics. For instance, engineered RNA repair systems could be used to modify or correct disease-causing RNA mutations or to enhance the stability and efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics.In conclusion, the field of RNA repair has made significant strides in recent years, revealing a complex and diverse array of mechanisms that play crucial roles in maintaining RNA integrity and cellular function. While many questions remain regarding the triggers, targets, and consequences of RNA repair in vivo, ongoing research in this area promises to yield valuable insights into RNA biology and potentially lead to novel therapeutic approaches for RNA-related diseases.", "References": [{"title": "tRNA splicing in yeast and higher eukaryotes", "authors": "John Abelson, Christine R.
