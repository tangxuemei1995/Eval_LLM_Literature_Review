{"Literature Review": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process that plays crucial roles in development, homeostasis, and immune responses across various life forms. While traditionally associated with multicellular organisms, particularly animals, recent research has revealed that PCD is also prevalent in unicellular organisms such as bacteria and fungi. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of PCD in unicellular versus multicellular organisms, highlighting similarities, differences, and evolutionary implications.The concept of PCD in multicellular organisms, particularly in animals, has been extensively studied over the past few decades. The most well-characterized form of PCD in animals is apoptosis, a highly regulated process involving specific molecular pathways and morphological changes. Galluzzi et al. (2018) provided a comprehensive review of cell death mechanisms in animals, describing approximately 20 distinct pathways that have been partially characterized over the last 35 years. These pathways include not only apoptosis but also other forms of regulated cell death such as necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis.In contrast to the well-established understanding of PCD in animals, the existence and significance of PCD in unicellular organisms have been debated for many years. However, recent studies have provided compelling evidence for the presence of PCD-like mechanisms in various microorganisms. Carmona-Gutierrez et al. (2018) reviewed the current knowledge of cell death in yeast, highlighting several PCD pathways that share similarities with those observed in multicellular organisms. These include apoptosis-like, necrosis-like, and autophagic cell death mechanisms, suggesting a conservation of basic PCD principles across diverse life forms.The discovery of PCD-like mechanisms in bacteria has further expanded our understanding of cell death in unicellular organisms. Peeters and de Jonge (2018) described over 100 death mechanisms identified in bacteria in recent years, far surpassing the number of known pathways in mammals. These bacterial cell death mechanisms often serve specific functions, such as biofilm formation, virulence regulation, and defense against phages. The diversity and complexity of these mechanisms challenge the notion that PCD is a feature exclusive to multicellular organisms.One striking similarity between PCD in unicellular and multicellular organisms is the involvement of immune-related mechanisms. Kaczmarek et al. (2013) discussed how cell death pathways in animals are intricately linked to innate immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammation and pathogen defense. Interestingly, similar connections have been observed in microorganisms. For instance, Jorgensen et al. (2017) reported that certain bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, which can induce cell death, also play roles in bacterial immunity against phages.Despite these similarities, there are notable differences in the regulation and execution of PCD between unicellular and multicellular organisms. In multicellular organisms, PCD is often centrally controlled and serves the greater good of the organism as a whole. For example, during embryonic development, PCD is crucial for shaping tissues and organs. Fuchs and Steller (2011) reviewed the various roles of apoptosis in animal development, highlighting its importance in processes such as digit formation and neural tube closure.In contrast, PCD in unicellular organisms often appears to be more context-dependent and may serve different purposes. Bayles (2014) proposed that bacterial PCD could be viewed as an altruistic behavior that benefits the overall population rather than the individual cell. This perspective aligns with the concept of kin selection in evolutionary biology, where seemingly self-destructive behaviors can be favored if they provide advantages to genetically related individuals.The evolutionary origins of PCD have been a subject of intense research and debate. Koonin and Aravind (2002) conducted a comparative genomic analysis of PCD-related genes across various organisms, revealing that many components of eukaryotic apoptotic machinery have homologs in bacteria. This finding suggests that the basic molecular toolkit for PCD may have evolved in prokaryotes and was subsequently elaborated upon in eukaryotes.While significant progress has been made in understanding PCD in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, there are still many unanswered questions. Notably, as pointed out by Shrestha and Megeney (2012), cell death mechanisms remain largely unstudied in many human pathogenic microbes that pose significant public health burdens. Investigating PCD in these organisms could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies for combating infectious diseases.In conclusion, the study of PCD in unicellular and multicellular organisms has revealed both similarities and differences in the underlying mechanisms and functions. The discovery of diverse cell death pathways in microorganisms has challenged previous assumptions and highlighted the ancient origins of this fundamental biological process. Future research in this field promises to provide further insights into the evolution of PCD and its roles in various biological contexts, from single-cell survival strategies to complex developmental processes in multicellular organisms.", "References": [{"title": "Molecular mechanisms of cell death: recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death 2018", "authors": "Lorenzo Galluzzi, Ilio Vitale, Stuart A.
