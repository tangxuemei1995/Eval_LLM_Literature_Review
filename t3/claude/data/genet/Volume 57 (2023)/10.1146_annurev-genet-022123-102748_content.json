{"Literature Review": "Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, hosting an estimated 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. However, these complex ecosystems face unprecedented threats from global climate change and anthropogenic activities. In recent years, population genomics has emerged as a powerful tool to understand the evolutionary processes shaping coral reef taxa and their potential responses to environmental changes. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on coral reef population genomics and its implications for conservation in the face of global change.One of the key characteristics of many coral reef taxa is their extensive gene flow, facilitated by the dispersal of planktonic larvae in ocean currents. Selkoe et al. (2016) demonstrated that gene flow in reef fish can occur over thousands of kilometers, potentially connecting populations across entire ocean basins. This high connectivity has important implications for local adaptation and the spread of beneficial alleles across populations. However, Saenz-Agudelo et al. (2015) found that self-recruitment in some reef fish species can be higher than previously thought, highlighting the complexity of dispersal patterns in marine environments.The interplay between gene flow and selection is a central theme in coral reef population genomics. Despite high connectivity, many reef species show evidence of local adaptation to specific environmental conditions. For instance, Bay and Palumbi (2014) identified genomic regions associated with thermal tolerance in corals, suggesting that some populations may be better equipped to withstand rising ocean temperatures. Similarly, Gaither et al. (2018) found signatures of selection related to depth in several reef fish species, indicating adaptation to different light and pressure regimes.Weak genetic drift is another characteristic of many coral reef populations, due to their typically large effective population sizes. This can result in the maintenance of high genetic diversity, which is crucial for evolutionary potential in the face of environmental change. However, Matz et al. (2018) warned that the combination of weak genetic drift and strong gene flow might actually hinder local adaptation in some cases, as locally beneficial alleles can be swamped by gene flow from other populations.Hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary process in coral reef ecosystems. Richards and Hobbs (2015) documented widespread hybridization in Indo-Pacific reef fishes, suggesting that it may play a role in generating and maintaining biodiversity. In the context of climate change, hybridization could potentially introduce adaptive variation into threatened populations, although its long-term consequences remain poorly understood.The application of genomic tools to coral reef conservation is still in its early stages but shows great promise. Riginos et al. (2016) proposed using genomic data to identify and prioritize coral reef areas for protection based on their evolutionary distinctiveness and potential for adaptation. Additionally, genomic approaches can help in developing more accurate historical baselines, which are crucial for assessing the impacts of recent environmental changes on reef ecosystems.Despite these advances, significant knowledge gaps remain. One critical area for future research is understanding the limits of evolutionary potential in coral reef species. While some taxa may be able to adapt to changing conditions through standing genetic variation or new mutations, others may face genetic constraints that limit their adaptive capacity. Gajigan and Conaco (2017) emphasized the need for more studies on the genomic basis of key traits related to climate change resilience, such as thermal tolerance and calcification rates in corals.Another important research direction is the development of genomic resources for a wider range of coral reef taxa. Currently, genomic studies are biased towards a few well-studied species, particularly corals and some reef fishes. Expanding this scope to include other important groups, such as mollusks, crustaceans, and algae, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of reef ecosystem dynamics and evolution.Finally, there is an urgent need to build greater research capacity in countries where most reef diversity is concentrated. Many of these nations are in the Global South and face significant resource constraints for conducting advanced genomic research. International collaborations and capacity-building initiatives are essential to address this imbalance and ensure that conservation efforts are informed by locally relevant genomic data.In conclusion, population genomics offers powerful insights into the evolutionary processes shaping coral reef ecosystems and their potential responses to global change. As environmental pressures on reefs continue to intensify, integrating genomic approaches into conservation planning and management will be crucial for developing effective strategies to preserve these invaluable ecosystems for future generations.", "References": [{"title": "The genomics of adaptation to climate change in reef-building corals", "authors": "Rebecca A.
