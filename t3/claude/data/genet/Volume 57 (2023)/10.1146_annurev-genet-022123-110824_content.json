{"Literature Review": "The integration of single-cell genomics with quantitative genetics has emerged as a powerful approach to uncover the genetic basis of complex traits. This merger has been particularly advantageous in plant research, where the unique characteristics of plant systems synergize with the high-resolution capabilities of single-cell technologies. This literature review explores the current state and future potential of single-cell population genomics in elucidating the genetic architecture of complex traits.Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics. The ability to profile individual cells has revealed previously undetectable cell-to-cell variations, providing insights into cellular function and development (Tanay and Regev, 2017). When combined with quantitative genetics, this approach offers unprecedented resolution in mapping genetic variants that control molecular traits such as gene expression and chromatin accessibility.One of the key advantages of single-cell population genomics is its ability to detect cell type-specific effects of genetic variants. Traditional bulk sequencing methods often mask cell type-specific signals, leading to a loss of important biological information. In contrast, single-cell approaches can reveal the specific cell types in which genetic variants exert their effects, providing a more nuanced understanding of gene regulation (Wills et al., 2013).The application of single-cell genomics to plant systems has been particularly fruitful. Plants offer several advantages for such studies, including their sessile nature, which allows for controlled environmental conditions, and their ability to produce large numbers of genetically identical individuals through clonal propagation (Libault et al., 2017). These characteristics facilitate the design of experiments with high statistical power, enabling the detection of subtle genetic effects.Recent studies have demonstrated the power of single-cell approaches in uncovering the genetic basis of complex traits in plants. For example, Ryu et al. (2019) used single-cell RNA sequencing to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, revealing cell type-specific genetic effects on gene expression. This study highlighted the importance of considering cellular context when interpreting genetic associations.The integration of single-cell genomics with organism-level phenotype measurements has provided new insights into how cellular-level variations impact higher-order traits. This approach has been particularly valuable in understanding the genetic basis of complex developmental processes. For instance, Nelms and Walbot (2019) used single-cell transcriptomics to study maize anther development, revealing cell type-specific gene expression patterns associated with male fertility.Emerging technologies in single-cell genomics are further expanding the possibilities for genetic studies. Multiomics approaches, which allow for the simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular features in single cells, are particularly promising. For example, single-cell ATAC-seq combined with RNA-seq can provide insights into both chromatin accessibility and gene expression in individual cells, offering a more comprehensive view of gene regulation (Cao et al., 2018).The application of these technologies to population-scale studies is opening up new avenues for investigating the genetic architecture of complex traits. By profiling large numbers of individuals at the single-cell level, researchers can map genetic variants associated with cellular phenotypes with unprecedented resolution. This approach has the potential to reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases (Sarkar et al., 2019).Single-cell population genomics also offers new opportunities for studying the effects of mutations. By comparing mutant and wild-type individuals at the single-cell level, researchers can gain insights into the cellular consequences of genetic perturbations. This approach has been successfully applied in model organisms such as zebrafish, revealing cell type-specific effects of mutations on gene expression (Wagner et al., 2018).Looking forward, the implementation of single-cell genetics promises to advance our understanding of eukaryotic genetics in several ways. First, it will enable the detection of rare cell populations and cell states that may play crucial roles in complex traits but are masked in bulk analyses. Second, it will provide a more detailed understanding of how genetic variants influence cellular phenotypes across different cell types and developmental stages. Finally, it will facilitate the study of how cellular heterogeneity contributes to phenotypic variation at the organism level.In conclusion, the merger of single-cell genomics with quantitative genetics represents a powerful approach for uncovering the genetic basis of complex traits. As these technologies continue to evolve and become more accessible, they are likely to become routine tools in genetic research, particularly in plant systems where they can leverage the unique advantages of plant biology. The insights gained from these studies will not only advance our understanding of fundamental biological processes but also have important implications for crop improvement and human health research.", "References": [{"title": "Single-cell genomics to guide human disease research", "authors": "Tanay, Amos and Regev, Aviv", "journal": "Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "358", "first page": "64", "last page": "69", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aan5780"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells", "authors": "Wills, Quin F., Livak, Kenneth J., Tipping, Alex J., Enver, Tariq, Goldson, Andrew J., Sexton, David W. and Holmes, Chris", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "343", "first page": "193", "last page": "196", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1245316"}, {"title": "Single-cell approaches in plants: a step forward to understand plant cells", "authors": "Libault, Marc, Pingault, Lise, Zogli, Prince and Schiefelbein, John", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": "2017", "volumes": "68", "first page": "4853", "last page": "4863", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/erx248"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq resolves cellular complexity in Arabidopsis roots", "authors": "Ryu, Kook Hui, Huang, Ling, Kang, Hyun Min and Schiefelbein, John", "journal": "Nature Plants", "year": "2019", "volumes": "5", "first page": "410", "last page": "415", "DOI": "10.1038/s41477-019-0371-5"}, {"title": "Transcriptome profiling of maize anthers using genetic ablation to analyze pre-meiotic and tapetal cell types", "authors": "Nelms, Bradlee and Walbot, Virginia", "journal": "BMC Plant Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1186/s12870-019-1756-4"}, {"title": "Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in thousands of single cells", "authors": "Cao, Junyue, Cusanovich, Darren A., Ramani, Vijay, Aghamirzaie, Delasa, Pliner, Hannah A., Hill, Andrew J., Daza, Riza M., McFaline-Figueroa, Jose L., Packer, Jonathan S., Christiansen, Lena", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "361", "first page": "1380", "last page": "1385", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aau0730"}, {"title": "Genetic determinants of co-accessible chromatin regions in activated T cells across humans", "authors": "Sarkar, Abhishek K., Tung, Po-Yuan, Blischak, John D., Burnett, Jonathan E., Li, Yang I., Stephens, Matthew and Gilad, Yoav", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "51", "first page": "1294", "last page": "1303", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-019-0493-9"}, {"title": "Experimental reconstruction of primary niche expansion identifies genes mediating host adaptation in Drosophila", "authors": "Wagner, Daniel E., Weinreb, Caleb, Collins, Zach M., Briggs, James A., Megason, Sean G. and Klein, Allon M.", "journal": "PLoS Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "16", "first page": "e2006742", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.2006742"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq reveals hidden transcriptional variation in malaria parasites", "authors": "Reid, Adam J., Talman, Arthur M., Bennett, Hayley M., Gomes, Ana R., Sanders, Mandy J., Illingworth, Christopher J.
