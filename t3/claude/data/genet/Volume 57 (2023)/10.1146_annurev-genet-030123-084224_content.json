{"Literature Review": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system, leading to excessive inflammation in the absence of autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. Over the past two decades, significant advancements in our understanding of SAIDs have been made, largely due to breakthroughs in genetic research and molecular biology. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic landscape of SAIDs, focusing on monogenic, digenic, polygenic, and somatic mutations, as well as epigenetic factors contributing to disease pathogenesis.The field of SAIDs was revolutionized with the discovery of the MEFV gene as the cause of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in 1997 (Kastner et al., 1997). This landmark finding paved the way for the identification of numerous other monogenic SAIDs, with over 50 such disorders now recognized. Monogenic SAIDs are typically caused by mutations in single genes involved in innate immune pathways, leading to aberrant activation of inflammatory processes.One of the most well-studied pathways in SAIDs is the inflammasome pathway, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mutations in the NLRP3 gene are associated with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), a spectrum of disorders including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (Aksentijevich et al., 2007). These mutations result in constitutive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β).While monogenic SAIDs have been the focus of much research, recent studies have highlighted the importance of digenic and polygenic inheritance in autoinflammatory diseases. For instance, Rowczenio et al. (2017) described cases of SAID patients harboring pathogenic variants in two distinct genes, suggesting a digenic model of inheritance. This finding underscores the complexity of genetic interactions in SAIDs and challenges the traditional view of single-gene disorders.Polygenic SAIDs, involving multiple genetic loci, have also gained attention in recent years. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous susceptibility loci for complex autoinflammatory disorders such as Behçet's disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Kirino et al., 2013; Ombrello et al., 2015). These studies have revealed the intricate interplay between multiple genetic factors and environmental influences in shaping disease susceptibility and severity.Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as crucial regulators of innate immune responses and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SAIDs. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs can modulate gene expression and influence inflammatory processes. For example, altered DNA methylation patterns have been observed in FMF patients, potentially contributing to disease manifestation and severity (Kirectepe et al., 2011).Recent advances in genomic technologies have also uncovered the role of somatic mutations in SAIDs. Somatic NLRP3 mutations have been identified in a subset of patients with adult-onset autoinflammatory diseases, challenging the conventional understanding of these disorders as purely germline conditions (Nakagawa et al., 2015). This discovery has important implications for diagnosis and treatment, as it suggests that some SAIDs may arise from post-zygotic mutations and exhibit mosaicism.The genetic complexity of SAIDs extends beyond single-gene disorders to include gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions. For instance, the clinical manifestations of FMF can be influenced by modifier genes, such as SAA1, which affects amyloidosis risk in FMF patients (Ozen et al., 2017). Additionally, environmental factors like stress, diet, and infections can modulate disease expression in genetically susceptible individuals, highlighting the importance of considering both genetic and non-genetic factors in SAID pathogenesis.Understanding the genetic basis of SAIDs has had a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment strategies. Next-generation sequencing technologies, including whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, have revolutionized the diagnostic approach to SAIDs, enabling the identification of novel disease-causing genes and expanding the spectrum of known genetic variants (Karacan et al., 2019). This has led to more accurate and timely diagnoses, allowing for early intervention and personalized treatment approaches.The elucidation of genetic mechanisms underlying SAIDs has also paved the way for targeted therapies. The success of IL-1 inhibitors in treating CAPS and other IL-1-mediated autoinflammatory disorders exemplifies the power of translating genetic discoveries into effective treatments (Lachmann et al., 2009). As our understanding of the genetic landscape of SAIDs continues to grow, there is increasing potential for developing precision medicine approaches tailored to individual genetic profiles.In conclusion, the genetic basis of systemic autoinflammatory diseases is complex and multifaceted, encompassing monogenic, digenic, and polygenic inheritance patterns, as well as epigenetic and somatic mutations. Advances in genomic technologies and molecular biology have greatly expanded our understanding of these disorders, leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Future research in this field will likely focus on unraveling the intricate interactions between genetic and environmental factors, with the ultimate goal of developing more targeted and effective treatments for patients with SAIDs.", "References": [{"title": "Ancient missense mutations in a new member of the RoRet gene family are likely to cause familial Mediterranean fever", "authors": "Daniel L.
