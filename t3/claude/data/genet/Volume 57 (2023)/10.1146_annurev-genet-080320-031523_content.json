{"Literature Review": "Transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) have emerged as a significant source of genome instability in recent years, attracting considerable attention from researchers in the fields of molecular biology and genetics. These conflicts arise when the machineries responsible for transcription and DNA replication encounter each other on the same DNA template, potentially leading to DNA damage and compromising the fidelity of genome replication. This literature review aims to synthesize recent findings on the genomic locations of TRCs, mechanisms of prevention and resolution, and their implications for genome stability, with a focus on multicellular eukaryotes.The genomic landscape of TRCs has been a subject of intense investigation. García-Muse and Aguilera (2016) provided a comprehensive overview of the factors contributing to TRC formation, highlighting the role of highly transcribed genes and specific genomic features such as G-quadruplex structures. Building on this work, Hamperl et al. (2017) demonstrated that TRCs occur preferentially at long genes and genes with complex splicing patterns in human cells, suggesting that the duration and complexity of transcription influence TRC likelihood.The directionality of collisions between transcription and replication machineries has been shown to have distinct consequences. Head-on collisions, where RNA polymerase and the replisome move towards each other, are generally more detrimental than co-directional collisions. Lang et al. (2017) provided evidence that head-on TRCs lead to more severe replication fork stalling and DNA damage in human cells, corroborating earlier findings in bacterial systems.Prevention and mitigation of TRCs involve various cellular mechanisms. Helmrich et al. (2013) demonstrated the importance of origin firing patterns in minimizing TRCs, showing that human cells adapt their replication initiation program to accommodate transcriptional activity. This adaptive response helps to reduce the likelihood of conflicts by ensuring that replication and transcription proceed in the same direction when possible.The role of chromatin organization in TRC prevention has also gained attention. Sanz et al. (2018) revealed that topoisomerases play a crucial role in preventing TRCs by resolving DNA supercoiling generated during transcription and replication. Their work in Drosophila showed that topoisomerase depletion leads to increased TRCs and genome instability, particularly at long genes.When TRCs do occur, cells employ various resolution mechanisms to minimize their impact. Sollier et al. (2014) identified the importance of the RECQ5 helicase in resolving TRCs in human cells, demonstrating its role in displacing RNA polymerase and allowing replication to proceed. This finding highlighted the existence of specialized factors dedicated to TRC resolution.The connection between TRCs and R-loop formation has been a subject of intense study. R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures consisting of an RNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA, can form during transcription and pose obstacles to replication. Crossley et al. (2019) showed that R-loops accumulate at sites of TRCs in human cells and that their resolution is critical for maintaining genome stability.Recent work has also uncovered links between TRCs and specific DNA repair pathways. Matos-Perdomo and Machín (2019) demonstrated that the Fanconi Anemia pathway, traditionally associated with interstrand crosslink repair, plays a role in resolving TRCs in human cells. This finding suggests that cells may repurpose existing DNA repair mechanisms to address TRC-induced damage.The consequences of unresolved TRCs can be severe, leading to DNA double-strand breaks, chromosomal rearrangements, and genome instability. Wilson et al. (2015) provided evidence that TRCs contribute to the formation of common fragile sites, genomic regions prone to breakage under replication stress, in human cells. This work underscored the potential of TRCs to drive large-scale genomic alterations.As our understanding of TRCs has grown, so too has interest in their potential role in human disease. Gaillard and Aguilera (2016) reviewed the connections between TRCs and various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Their work highlighted the need for further research into the clinical implications of TRC-induced genome instability.In conclusion, recent years have seen significant advances in our understanding of transcription-replication conflicts and their impact on genome stability. From the identification of TRC-prone genomic regions to the elucidation of prevention and resolution mechanisms, these studies have provided crucial insights into a fundamental source of genome instability. As research in this field continues, it promises to yield further insights into the maintenance of genome integrity and potentially open new avenues for therapeutic interventions in TRC-associated diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Transcription–replication conflicts: how they occur and how they are resolved", "authors": "Tania García-Muse, Andrés Aguilera", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "553", "last page": "563", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm.2016.88"}, {"title": "Transcription-Replication Conflict Orientation Modulates R-Loop Levels and Activates Distinct DNA Damage Responses", "authors": "Stephan Hamperl, Michael J.
