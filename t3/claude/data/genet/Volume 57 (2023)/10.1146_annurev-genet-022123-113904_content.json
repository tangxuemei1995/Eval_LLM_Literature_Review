{"Literature Review": "The interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change represents a complex and pressing challenge for human health and ecological stability. This literature review explores the multifaceted relationship between these two phenomena, highlighting the anthropogenic drivers and potential consequences of their interaction.Antimicrobial resistance is a natural phenomenon that predates human use of antibiotics. However, the current AMR crisis is largely attributed to the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in healthcare, agriculture, and other industries. MacFadden et al. (2018) demonstrated a strong correlation between antibiotic consumption and the prevalence of resistant bacterial strains across different geographic regions. This overuse has led to the rapid evolution and spread of resistant pathogens, posing a significant threat to global public health.Concurrently, human activities have been driving unprecedented changes in the global environment. Climate change, habitat destruction, and pollution are altering ecosystems at an alarming rate. These environmental changes are not isolated from the AMR crisis but rather interact with it in complex ways. For instance, Rodríguez-Verdugo et al. (2020) found that increased temperatures associated with climate change can accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistance in certain bacterial species.The contamination of natural environments with antibiotics and other pharmaceutical compounds is a key factor in the spread of AMR. Larsson et al. (2018) reviewed the environmental dimensions of antibiotic resistance and highlighted how pollution from pharmaceutical manufacturing, hospitals, and agriculture contributes to the selection and dissemination of resistant bacteria in the environment. This contamination creates selective pressures that favor the survival and proliferation of resistant microorganisms.Climate change further complicates the AMR landscape by altering the distribution and behavior of pathogens. MacFadden et al. (2019) observed that increases in local temperature were associated with higher antibiotic resistance in common pathogens across the United States. This suggests that warming trends may exacerbate the AMR crisis by providing more favorable conditions for resistant bacteria to thrive and spread.The impact of environmental change on AMR is not limited to temperature effects. Changes in precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise can also influence the transmission of resistant pathogens. Semenza et al. (2017) discussed how climate change-induced alterations in water systems could affect the spread of waterborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria, potentially increasing human exposure to these pathogens.Moreover, the relationship between AMR and environmental change is bidirectional. While environmental changes can influence AMR, the widespread use of antibiotics also contributes to environmental degradation. Grenni et al. (2018) reviewed the ecological effects of antibiotics in the environment, noting their potential to disrupt microbial communities, alter biogeochemical cycles, and impact higher trophic levels in ecosystems.The global nature of both AMR and environmental change necessitates international cooperation and multidisciplinary approaches to address these challenges. Hernando-Amado et al. (2019) emphasized the importance of adopting a One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health in tackling AMR. This holistic perspective is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate both AMR and environmental change.Efforts to combat AMR in the context of global environmental change must address multiple fronts. Reducing antibiotic use and improving waste management in healthcare and agriculture are critical steps. Additionally, investing in clean water infrastructure and sanitation can help limit the spread of resistant pathogens, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where these issues are often most acute.Research and innovation play vital roles in addressing the AMR crisis. Developing new antibiotics, alternative therapies, and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for staying ahead of evolving resistance. However, as pointed out by Vikesland et al. (2017), there is also a need for improved environmental monitoring and risk assessment tools to better understand and predict the emergence and spread of resistance in different ecological contexts.In conclusion, the interplay between antimicrobial resistance and global environmental change represents a complex challenge that requires urgent attention and coordinated action. As both architects and potential casualties of these crises, humans must recognize their central role in driving these changes and take responsibility for mitigating their impacts. By adopting integrated approaches that address both AMR and environmental change simultaneously, we can work towards safeguarding human health and preserving ecological balance for future generations.", "References": [{"title": "Antibiotic resistance increases with local temperature", "authors": "Derek R.
