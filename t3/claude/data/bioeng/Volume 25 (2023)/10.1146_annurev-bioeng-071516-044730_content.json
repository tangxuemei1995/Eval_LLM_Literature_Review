{"Literature Review": "Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) has emerged as a powerful tool for non-invasive assessment of cellular metabolism in various biological contexts. This technique leverages the autofluorescence properties of two key metabolic cofactors, NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), to provide insights into cellular metabolic states. The development and application of OMI have significantly advanced our understanding of cellular metabolism in both health and disease.The foundation of OMI lies in the pioneering work of Chance and colleagues, who first observed the autofluorescence of NADH in living cells and tissues in the 1950s. Since then, numerous studies have explored the potential of NADH and FAD as intrinsic fluorophores for metabolic imaging. Skala et al. demonstrated the utility of OMI in cancer research, showing that the optical redox ratio (ORR), calculated as the ratio of FAD to NADH fluorescence intensities, could distinguish between normal and cancerous tissues in a breast cancer model.The advent of multiphoton microscopy has greatly enhanced the capabilities of OMI. Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy, in particular, has enabled deeper tissue penetration and reduced photodamage compared to traditional single-photon techniques. Walsh et al. utilized TPEF microscopy to investigate metabolic changes in stem cell differentiation, revealing distinct metabolic profiles associated with different stages of differentiation.One of the key advantages of OMI is its ability to provide real-time, label-free measurements of cellular metabolism. This aspect has been particularly valuable in studying dynamic metabolic processes. For instance, Stringari et al. employed OMI to track metabolic oscillations in live cells, uncovering previously unknown metabolic heterogeneity within cell populations.The optical redox ratio has been widely used as a metric for assessing overall metabolic state. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering additional parameters for a more comprehensive understanding of cellular metabolism. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of NADH has emerged as a powerful complementary technique. NADH FLIM can distinguish between free and protein-bound forms of NADH, providing insights into specific metabolic pathways. Yaseen et al. demonstrated the utility of NADH FLIM in studying brain metabolism, revealing distinct metabolic signatures associated with different neural cell types.While OMI has shown great promise, several challenges remain in the field. One major challenge is the interpretation of OMI data in the context of complex metabolic networks. To address this, researchers have begun integrating OMI with other metabolic analysis techniques. For example, Hou et al. combined OMI with metabolomics to provide a more comprehensive view of cellular metabolism in cancer cells.Another challenge lies in improving the spatial and temporal resolution of OMI. Recent advancements in microscopy techniques, such as light-sheet microscopy, have shown potential in addressing this issue. Chen et al. demonstrated the use of light-sheet microscopy for high-speed, three-dimensional metabolic imaging in live organisms.The quantification of OMI data has also been a focus of recent research. Machine learning approaches have been employed to extract more information from OMI datasets. Sharick et al. developed a convolutional neural network-based approach for automated analysis of OMI data, enabling rapid and objective assessment of metabolic states.As the field of OMI continues to evolve, new applications are being explored. For instance, OMI has shown promise in drug discovery and personalized medicine. Shah et al. used OMI to predict drug response in cancer cells, demonstrating its potential as a tool for personalized treatment selection.In conclusion, optical metabolic imaging has made significant strides in providing non-invasive, real-time insights into cellular metabolism. The integration of advanced microscopy techniques, complementary metabolic analysis methods, and sophisticated data analysis approaches has greatly enhanced the capabilities of OMI. As the field continues to mature, OMI is poised to play an increasingly important role in understanding dynamic metabolic processes in both basic research and clinical applications. Future developments in OMI are likely to focus on improving quantification, increasing spatial and temporal resolution, and expanding its application to a wider range of biological systems and disease states.", "References": [{"title": "Optical redox ratio differentiates breast cancer cell lines based on estrogen receptor status", "authors": "Melissa C.
