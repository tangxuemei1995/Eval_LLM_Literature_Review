{"Literature Review": "The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has made significant strides in developing innovative therapies for various diseases and injuries. However, the consideration of sex as a biological variable in this field remains limited, despite growing evidence of its importance in cellular function, therapy efficacy, and disease outcomes. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of sex differences in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach to personalized and precision medicine.Sex differences in cellular function and behavior have been well-documented across various biological systems. For instance, Deasy et al. (2007) demonstrated that muscle-derived stem cells from female mice exhibited superior regenerative capacity compared to those from male mice, suggesting intrinsic sex-based differences in stem cell function. Similarly, Tajiri et al. (2014) reported that female mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) showed enhanced neuroprotective effects in a stroke model compared to male MSCs, emphasizing the importance of considering donor sex in cell-based therapies.The impact of sex on therapy efficacy has been observed in various regenerative medicine applications. In a study by Matsumoto et al. (2013), female rats showed better functional recovery and axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury when treated with olfactory ensheathing cells, compared to male rats. This finding underscores the need to consider sex-specific responses when developing and evaluating regenerative therapies.The extracellular matrix (ECM), a crucial component of the tissue engineering triad, also exhibits sex-specific characteristics. Raz et al. (2012) reported differences in ECM composition and mechanical properties between male and female cardiac tissues, which could have implications for the design of tissue-engineered cardiac constructs. Furthermore, Reardon et al. (2015) demonstrated sex-specific differences in tendon ECM composition and mechanical properties, highlighting the importance of considering sex when developing tissue-engineered tendon replacements.Signaling molecules and growth factors, another key element of the tissue engineering triad, can also exhibit sex-specific effects. For example, Xiong et al. (2017) found that estrogen receptor signaling plays a crucial role in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, with sex-specific effects on bone regeneration. This finding emphasizes the need to consider sex-specific signaling pathways when designing regenerative therapies.The importance of sex as a biological variable extends beyond cellular and molecular levels to tissue and organ function. Gargett et al. (2014) reviewed sex differences in the regenerative capacity of various tissues and organs, including the liver, muscle, and brain, highlighting the need for sex-specific approaches in regenerative medicine. Additionally, Khramtsova et al. (2019) discussed the impact of sex chromosomes and sex hormones on tissue homeostasis and regeneration, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding sex differences in regenerative processes.Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, its adoption in research and clinical practice remains limited. Beery and Zucker (2011) conducted a comprehensive analysis of sex bias in research across various biological disciplines, revealing a significant underrepresentation of female subjects in many fields, including cell and tissue studies. This bias can lead to incomplete or inaccurate understanding of biological processes and potentially compromise the efficacy and safety of regenerative therapies.To address this issue, several initiatives have been launched to promote the consideration of sex as a biological variable in biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a policy in 2016 requiring researchers to account for sex as a biological variable in vertebrate animal and human studies (Clayton and Collins, 2014). Similarly, the European Commission has emphasized the importance of gender dimension in research and innovation through its Horizon 2020 program (European Commission, 2013).In conclusion, the integration of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is crucial for advancing personalized and precision medicine. By considering sex-specific differences in cells, matrices, and signals, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective and tailored therapies. However, achieving equity in biological sex within medicine requires a cultural shift in science and engineering research, with active engagement from researchers, clinicians, companies, policymakers, and funding agencies. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying sex differences in tissue regeneration and developing sex-specific strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative therapies.", "References": [{"title": "Sex matters: a robust female phenotype in muscle-derived stem cells", "authors": "Bridget M.
