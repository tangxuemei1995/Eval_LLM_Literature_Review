{"Literature Review": "Electroporation, a technique that uses electric fields to temporarily increase cell membrane permeability, has emerged as a powerful tool in various fields, including molecular biology, food science, and medicine. This literature review aims to explore recent advancements in electroporation technologies, focusing on their applications from bench to clinic.The fundamental principle of electroporation lies in the biophysical response of cell membranes to electric fields. When exposed to a sufficiently strong electric field, the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane undergoes a temporary reorganization, forming transient pores that allow the passage of molecules that would otherwise be impermeable. Kotnik et al. (2019) provided a comprehensive review of the biophysical mechanisms underlying electroporation, emphasizing the importance of pulse parameters such as amplitude, duration, and frequency in determining the extent and reversibility of membrane permeabilization.In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing nano- and microscale electroporation technologies for single-cell applications. Geng and Lu (2013) introduced a microfluidic device capable of precise single-cell electroporation, allowing for the controlled delivery of molecules into individual cells. This technology has shown promise in various applications, including gene editing and drug screening. Building on this concept, Xu et al. (2018) developed a high-throughput microfluidic platform for simultaneous electroporation of multiple single cells, significantly increasing the efficiency and scalability of the process.The field of gene therapy has greatly benefited from advancements in electroporation technologies. Rosazza et al. (2016) demonstrated the successful delivery of plasmid DNA into cells using electroporation, highlighting its potential as a non-viral gene delivery method. Their study also emphasized the importance of optimizing electroporation parameters to achieve high transfection efficiency while maintaining cell viability. In a related study, Shi et al. (2018) explored the use of electroporation for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, showing improved efficiency compared to traditional transfection methods.Electrochemotherapy, a cancer treatment modality that combines electroporation with chemotherapy, has gained significant attention in clinical settings. Campana et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of clinical trials using electrochemotherapy for various types of cancer, reporting promising results in terms of tumor response and patient outcomes. The authors highlighted the potential of this approach in treating tumors that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy.Another emerging application of electroporation in cancer treatment is irreversible electroporation (IRE), which uses high-voltage electric pulses to induce cell death without the need for additional drugs. Edd and Davalos (2016) provided an overview of the principles and clinical applications of IRE, emphasizing its potential for treating tumors in sensitive locations where thermal ablation techniques may be contraindicated.Recent developments in pulsed field ablation (PFA) have shown promise in cardiac electrophysiology. Reddy et al. (2019) conducted a first-in-human study using PFA for pulmonary vein isolation in patients with atrial fibrillation. The results demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach, potentially offering a new treatment option for cardiac arrhythmias.In the field of food science, electroporation has been explored as a non-thermal food preservation technique. Barba et al. (2015) reviewed the applications of pulsed electric fields in food processing, highlighting its potential for microbial inactivation and enhancing the extraction of bioactive compounds from plant materials.As electroporation technologies continue to advance, there is a growing interest in combining them with other techniques to enhance their effectiveness. For instance, Luengo et al. (2015) investigated the synergistic effects of combining ultrasound and electroporation for improving the extraction of phenolic compounds from olive oil waste. This approach demonstrated significant improvements in extraction yield compared to either technique alone.In conclusion, recent advancements in electroporation technologies have led to a wide range of applications across various fields. From single-cell manipulations to clinical cancer treatments and food processing, electroporation has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool. As research continues to optimize electroporation parameters and explore new applications, it is likely that we will see further innovations and clinical translations of this technology in the coming years.", "References": [{"title": "Electroporation-based technologies and treatments", "authors": "Tadej Kotnik, Lluis M.
