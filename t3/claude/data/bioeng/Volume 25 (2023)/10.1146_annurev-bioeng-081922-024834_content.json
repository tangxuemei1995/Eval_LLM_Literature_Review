{"Literature Review": "The field of health technology design has traditionally been dominated by a technocentric approach, focusing primarily on the technical aspects of medical devices. However, there is a growing recognition of the need to shift towards a more human-centered and equity-focused paradigm to address existing translational gaps and improve health equity. This literature review explores the rationale behind incorporating stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development, examines existing frameworks for human- and equity-centered approaches, and presents case studies that demonstrate the application of these approaches in medical device design.The need for a human-centered approach in health technology design stems from the recognition that successful adoption of innovations depends not only on technical excellence but also on understanding the needs of diverse stakeholders and the context of use. Lehoux et al. (2014) argue that considering the social, cultural, and economic factors that influence technology adoption is crucial for improving health outcomes. This perspective is further supported by Hostetter and Klein (2018), who emphasize the importance of addressing health equity in technology design to reduce disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.Stakeholder engagement has emerged as a critical component of human-centered design in healthcare. Concannon et al. (2012) propose a framework for stakeholder engagement that includes patients, providers, purchasers, payers, policymakers, and product makers. This comprehensive approach ensures that diverse perspectives are considered throughout the design process. Building on this, Greenhalgh et al. (2016) emphasize the importance of co-design and participatory approaches, where stakeholders are actively involved in the development process rather than being passive subjects of consultation.Contextual investigation is another crucial aspect of human-centered design in healthcare. Bazzano et al. (2017) highlight the importance of understanding the social, cultural, and environmental factors that influence technology use and adoption. Their study demonstrates how contextual factors can significantly impact the effectiveness of health interventions, underscoring the need for designers to consider these elements from the outset.Equity-centered approaches in health technology design have gained prominence in recent years, with a focus on addressing disparities and ensuring that innovations benefit all populations. Marmot et al. (2020) argue that health equity should be a central consideration in technology design, emphasizing the need to address social determinants of health and ensure that innovations do not exacerbate existing inequalities. This perspective is echoed by Peek et al. (2016), who propose a framework for equity-centered design that incorporates community engagement and cultural competence.Several frameworks have been developed to guide human- and equity-centered approaches in health technology design. The Human-Centered Design framework, as described by IDEO.org (2015), provides a structured approach to understanding user needs, generating ideas, and iterating on solutions. This framework has been adapted for healthcare settings by organizations such as the Center for Innovation in Global Health Technologies at Northwestern University.Another notable framework is the Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH) approach proposed by Silva et al. (2018). This framework emphasizes the importance of considering the broader societal impacts of health technologies, including their potential to address health inequities and contribute to sustainable healthcare systems.Case studies demonstrate the practical application of human- and equity-centered approaches in medical device design. For example, Aranda-Jan et al. (2016) describe the development of a low-cost, portable electrocardiogram device for use in low-resource settings. The project involved extensive stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation, resulting in a device that was not only technically sound but also culturally appropriate and feasible for use in the intended context.Another illustrative case study is presented by Sabet Sarvestani and Sienko (2018), who detail the design of a human-powered nebulizer for asthma treatment in low-resource settings. The project employed participatory design methods and extensive field testing to ensure that the device met the needs of users and was suitable for the challenging environments in which it would be used.In conclusion, the shift towards human- and equity-centered approaches in health technology design represents a significant advancement in the field of biomedical engineering. By incorporating meaningful stakeholder analysis, contextual investigation, and a focus on equity, designers can create technologies that are not only technically innovative but also socially responsible and effective in improving health outcomes across diverse populations. As the field continues to evolve, it is crucial for biomedical engineering education and practice to embrace these approaches, fostering a new generation of engineers equipped to address complex healthcare challenges in an inclusive and equitable manner.", "References": [{"title": "Understanding and improving the adoption of innovative medical technologies: A review of the current state of research", "authors": "Pascale Lehoux, Fiona A.
