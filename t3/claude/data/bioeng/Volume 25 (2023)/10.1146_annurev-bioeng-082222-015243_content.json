{"Literature Review": "The control of ice nucleation and recrystallization is a critical aspect of cryopreservation, with significant implications for the storage of biological materials at subzero temperatures. This literature review explores the current state of research on engineered compounds designed to mimic natural antifreeze mechanisms, focusing on their potential applications in biopreservation.Nature has provided inspiration for cryopreservation techniques through the study of freeze-avoidant and freeze-tolerant organisms. These organisms possess specialized proteins that enable them to survive in extreme cold conditions. Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are two classes of biomolecules that have been extensively studied for their ice-binding properties and ability to inhibit ice growth (Davies, 2014).The mechanisms by which AFPs and AFGPs function have been elucidated through various studies. These proteins adsorb to the surface of ice crystals, preventing further growth and recrystallization. This process, known as thermal hysteresis, results in a depression of the freezing point below the melting point of the solution (Voets, 2017). Understanding these natural mechanisms has led to the development of synthetic compounds that can replicate these effects.One significant area of research has focused on the design and synthesis of AFP mimics. Synthetic polymers have shown promise in replicating the ice-binding properties of natural AFPs. For example, Congdon et al. (2013) developed a series of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) based polymers that demonstrated potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity. These synthetic compounds offer advantages over natural AFPs, including easier production, lower cost, and the ability to fine-tune their properties.Another approach in engineering ice-controlling compounds involves the use of small molecules. Drori et al. (2016) identified a class of small molecules called zirconium acetate complexes that exhibit ice-shaping and thermal hysteresis activities similar to those of AFPs. These compounds represent a promising alternative to protein-based antifreeze agents, as they are more stable and easier to produce at scale.The development of ice-nucleating agents has also garnered attention in the field of cryopreservation. Controlled ice nucleation is crucial for reducing cellular damage during freezing processes. Wowk and Fahy (2002) demonstrated the effectiveness of synthetic ice nucleating agents in improving the vitrification of cryoprotectant solutions, which has implications for organ preservation.Recent advancements in materials science have led to the creation of ice-templated materials with unique properties. Deville et al. (2018) reviewed the use of ice-templating techniques to create porous materials with controlled architectures, which have potential applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. These materials demonstrate how understanding and controlling ice formation can lead to novel biomaterials with diverse applications.The synergy between engineered ice-controlling compounds and other cryopreservation techniques has opened up new possibilities in biopreservation. For instance, the combination of antifreeze compounds with vitrification protocols has shown promise in improving the preservation of complex biological systems. Fahy et al. (2019) reported on the successful use of ice-blocking agents in conjunction with vitrification techniques for the cryopreservation of rabbit kidneys, demonstrating the potential for long-term organ storage.Nanotechnology has also emerged as a powerful tool in the development of ice-controlling materials. Wang et al. (2020) reported on the use of nanoparticles functionalized with antifreeze proteins to enhance their ice recrystallization inhibition activity. This approach combines the benefits of nanomaterials with the specificity of biological molecules, potentially leading to more effective cryoprotectants.Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the field of engineered ice-controlling compounds. One major hurdle is the translation of laboratory findings to practical applications in biopreservation. Issues such as toxicity, scalability, and compatibility with existing cryopreservation protocols need to be addressed. Additionally, the mechanisms by which some synthetic compounds interact with ice are not fully understood, necessitating further research to optimize their design and application.In conclusion, the field of engineered compounds for controlling ice nucleation and recrystallization has made significant strides in recent years. Inspired by nature's antifreeze mechanisms, researchers have developed a range of synthetic materials and small molecules that show promise in cryopreservation applications. The synergy between these compounds and other advances in cryobiology offers exciting possibilities for improving the preservation of cells, tissues, and organs. As research in this area continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see further innovations in biopreservation techniques, potentially revolutionizing fields such as regenerative medicine and organ transplantation.", "References": [{"title": "New insights in antifreeze protein mechanism", "authors": "Peter L.
