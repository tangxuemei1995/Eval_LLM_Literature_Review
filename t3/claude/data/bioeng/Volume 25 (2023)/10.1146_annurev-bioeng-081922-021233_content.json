{"Literature Review": "The field of epitranscriptomics has emerged as a crucial area of study in recent years, particularly in the context of cardiovascular bioengineering. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of epitranscriptional regulation and its implications for cardiovascular health and disease.Epitranscriptomics refers to the study of chemical modifications of RNA molecules that occur post-transcriptionally. These modifications can significantly alter RNA function, stability, and interactions with other cellular components. The most common RNA modifications include methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. Among these, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been the most extensively studied modification in mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).Recent research has highlighted the importance of m6A modification in cardiovascular development and disease. For instance, Dorn et al. (2019) demonstrated that m6A methylation plays a crucial role in cardiac homeostasis and stress response. Their study revealed that deletion of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in cardiomyocytes led to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy in mice, emphasizing the significance of m6A modification in maintaining cardiac function.Another important epitranscriptomic modification is pseudouridylation, which involves the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine. Karijolich and Yu (2011) provided evidence that pseudouridylation can enhance mRNA stability and increase protein production. This modification has been implicated in various cellular processes, including stress response and stem cell differentiation, which are relevant to cardiovascular biology.The role of RNA editing, particularly adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, has also gained attention in cardiovascular research. Stellos et al. (2016) reported that A-to-I editing of cathepsin S mRNA by the ADAR1 enzyme promotes atherogenesis. This finding highlights the potential of targeting RNA editing mechanisms as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.Epitranscriptomic modifications have been shown to influence gene expression patterns in response to mechanical stress, a crucial factor in cardiovascular physiology. Mechanoresponsive genes play essential roles in vascular remodeling and adaptation to hemodynamic forces. Chen et al. (2017) demonstrated that m6A modification regulates the expression of mechanosensitive genes in endothelial cells, suggesting a link between epitranscriptomics and mechanotransduction in the cardiovascular system.The field of regenerative medicine has also benefited from insights into epitranscriptomic regulation. Batista et al. (2014) showed that m6A modification is crucial for stem cell differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming. This finding has implications for cardiac regeneration strategies, as it suggests that manipulating epitranscriptomic marks could potentially enhance the efficiency of generating functional cardiomyocytes from stem cells.Recent technological advancements have greatly facilitated the study of epitranscriptomics. High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as MeRIP-seq and m6A-seq, have enabled genome-wide mapping of RNA modifications. These tools have been instrumental in identifying novel targets of epitranscriptomic regulation in cardiovascular tissues. For instance, Mathiyalagan et al. (2019) used m6A-seq to profile the m6A landscape in human hearts, revealing dynamic changes in m6A patterns during heart failure progression.The potential applications of epitranscriptomics in biomedical engineering are vast. One promising area is the development of RNA-based therapeutics that leverage epitranscriptomic modifications to enhance stability and efficacy. Zhao et al. (2017) demonstrated that incorporating m6A modifications into synthetic mRNA could improve its translation efficiency and reduce immunogenicity, which could have significant implications for mRNA-based therapies in cardiovascular medicine.Moreover, epitranscriptomic marks could serve as novel biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases. Lin et al. (2020) reported that circulating RNA m6A levels were associated with the severity of coronary artery disease, suggesting the potential use of epitranscriptomic signatures in diagnostic and prognostic applications.As the field of epitranscriptomics continues to evolve, it presents both opportunities and challenges for cardiovascular bioengineering. The complex interplay between various RNA modifications and their effects on gene expression and cellular function necessitates interdisciplinary approaches. Biomedical engineers will play a crucial role in developing new tools and technologies to study and manipulate the epitranscriptome, as well as in translating these findings into clinical applications.In conclusion, epitranscriptional regulation has emerged as a critical factor in cardiovascular biology, with implications for development, homeostasis, and disease. As our understanding of the epitranscriptome grows, it will undoubtedly open new avenues for therapeutic interventions and diagnostic strategies in cardiovascular medicine. The integration of epitranscriptomics into cardiovascular bioengineering research promises to yield innovative approaches to address the challenges posed by cardiovascular diseases.", "References": [{"title": "The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 controls cardiac homeostasis and hypertrophy", "authors": "Gerald W.
