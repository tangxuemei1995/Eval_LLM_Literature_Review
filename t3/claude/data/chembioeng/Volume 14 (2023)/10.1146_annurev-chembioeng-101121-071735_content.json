{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate climate change and produce valuable chemicals and fuels. However, the complex nature of this process necessitates advanced characterization techniques to elucidate reaction mechanisms and optimize catalyst performance. This literature review focuses on recent developments in in situ and operando characterization methods for CO2R, highlighting their contributions to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design.Surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies have proven invaluable in identifying reaction intermediates and monitoring catalyst surface changes during CO2R. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been widely employed due to its high sensitivity and ability to detect adsorbed species. For instance, Zhu et al. (2018) used SERS to identify key intermediates in CO2 reduction on copper surfaces, revealing the importance of *CO as a pivotal species in the formation of multi-carbon products. Similarly, surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) has provided insights into the role of electrolyte species in CO2R. Dunwell et al. (2017) utilized SEIRAS to demonstrate the influence of bicarbonate anions on the CO2 reduction pathway, highlighting the importance of considering electrolyte effects in mechanistic studies.X-ray-based techniques have also contributed significantly to our understanding of catalyst structure and oxidation state changes during CO2R. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has been particularly useful in probing the local atomic environment of catalysts under reaction conditions. Scott et al. (2019) employed in situ XAS to investigate the dynamic structural changes of copper catalysts during CO2 reduction, revealing the formation of metallic copper as the active phase for C-C coupling reactions. Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been used to monitor phase transformations in catalysts during operation. Jiang et al. (2020) utilized operando XRD to study the evolution of copper oxide catalysts, demonstrating the importance of oxide-derived nanostructures in enhancing CO2R activity and selectivity.Electron-based techniques have provided valuable insights into catalyst morphology and surface structure during CO2R. Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) has enabled direct observation of catalyst nanostructures under reaction conditions. Li et al. (2021) used ETEM to visualize the dynamic reconstruction of copper nanoparticles during CO2 reduction, revealing the formation of high-index facets that contribute to improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) has allowed for spatially resolved electrochemical measurements on catalyst surfaces. Chen et al. (2022) employed SECCM to map the local activity of copper catalysts, demonstrating the heterogeneous nature of CO2R and the importance of surface defects in product selectivity.Mass spectrometry techniques have played a crucial role in real-time product analysis and mechanistic investigations. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) has been widely used to detect volatile products and intermediates during CO2R. Wang et al. (2016) utilized DEMS to study the formation of methane and ethylene on copper catalysts, providing insights into the reaction pathways and rate-determining steps. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) has also been employed to monitor product evolution with high temporal resolution. Kas et al. (2019) used OLEMS to investigate the potential-dependent product distribution on copper catalysts, revealing the complex interplay between competing reaction pathways.Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the development and application of in situ and operando characterization techniques for CO2R. One major limitation is the difficulty in simultaneously probing multiple aspects of the reaction, such as catalyst structure, surface species, and product formation. Integrating complementary techniques, such as combining spectroscopic and microscopic methods, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the CO2R process. Additionally, improving the spatial and temporal resolution of these techniques is crucial for capturing the dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces and reaction intermediates.Another challenge lies in bridging the gap between idealized model systems and practical catalysts under realistic operating conditions. Many in situ studies are conducted on well-defined surfaces or nanostructures, which may not fully represent the complexity of industrial-scale catalysts. Developing characterization methods that can be applied to more complex catalyst systems and under industrially relevant conditions is essential for translating fundamental insights into practical applications.Furthermore, the development of operando techniques for studying the electrode-electrolyte interface remains a significant challenge. The complex interplay between the catalyst surface, adsorbed intermediates, and electrolyte species plays a crucial role in CO2R performance, yet probing this interface under reaction conditions is technically demanding. Advanced techniques that can penetrate the electrolyte layer and provide molecular-level information about the interface are needed to fully understand the reaction mechanism and guide catalyst design.In conclusion, in situ and operando characterization techniques have greatly advanced our understanding of electrochemical CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights into reaction mechanisms, catalyst evolution, and structure-activity relationships. Future developments in this field should focus on integrating multiple characterization methods, improving spatial and temporal resolution, and addressing the challenges associated with studying realistic catalyst systems and interfaces. These advancements will be crucial in guiding the rational design of highly efficient and selective CO2R catalysts, ultimately contributing to the development of sustainable energy technologies and mitigation of climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Identification of carbon-covered copper surfaces during electrochemical CO2 reduction", "authors": "Zhu, Shengli and Jiang, Bin and Cai, Wen-Bin and Shao, Minhua", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "2018", "volumes": "140", "first page": "16114", "last page": "16119", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.8b10023"}, {"title": "The role of bicarbonate in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide on gold", "authors": "Dunwell, Marco and Lu, Qi and Heyes, Jeffrey M. and Rosen, Jonathan and Chen, Jingguang G. and Yan, Yushan and Jiao, Feng and Xu, Bingjun", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "2017", "volumes": "139", "first page": "3774", "last page": "3783", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.6b13287"}, {"title": "Copper active species in electrochemical CO2 reduction: From metallic copper to copper carbonate", "authors": "Scott, Soren B. and Hogg, Thomas V. and Landers, Alan T. and Maagaard, Thomas and Bertheussen, Erlend and Lin, John C. and Davis, Ryan C. and Beeman, Jeffrey W. and Higgins, Drew and Drisdell, Walter S. and Hahn, Christopher and Mehta, Apurva and Seger, Brian and Jaramillo, Thomas F. and Chorkendorff, Ib", "journal": "ACS Energy Letters", "year": "2019", "volumes": "4", "first page": "803", "last page": "804", "DOI": "10.1021/acsenergylett.9b00172"}, {"title": "Oxide-derived copper catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2: Structural and mechanistic aspects", "authors": "Jiang, Shan and Klingan, Katharina and Pasquini, Chiara and Dau, Holger and Strasser, Peter", "journal": "Nano Energy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "70", "first page": "104468", "last page": "104468", "DOI": "10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104468"}, {"title": "Dynamic evolution of active sites on copper catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction", "authors": "Li, Yongfeng and Kim, Donghun and Louisia, Segolene and Xie, Chenlu and Kong, Qingying and Yu, Shiqiang and Lin, Tao and Aloni, Shaul and Fakra, Sirine C. and Yang, Peidong", "journal": "Nature Catalysis", "year": "2021", "volumes": "4", "first page": "479", "last page": "487", "DOI": "10.1038/s41929-021-00614-0"}, {"title": "Nanoscale mapping of catalytic hotspots on Cu foils for electrochemical CO2 reduction", "authors": "Chen, Xin and McCrum, Ian T. and Schwarz, Kathleen A. and Janik, Michael J. and Koper, Marc T.
