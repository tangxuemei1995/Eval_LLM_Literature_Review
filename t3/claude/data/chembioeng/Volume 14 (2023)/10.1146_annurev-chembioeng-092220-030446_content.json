{"Literature Review": "The global energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation as the world moves towards a net-zero emission economy. International oil companies (IOCs) are at the forefront of this transition, leveraging their extensive scientific and engineering capabilities developed over decades in hydrocarbon supply chains. This literature review explores the role of IOCs in driving the rapid scale-up and transition to a net-zero emission economy, focusing on the production and utilization of energy carriers.The concept of energy carriers has gained prominence in recent years as a potential solution to overcome the limitations of fully electrified energy systems. Hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and other synthetic fuels produced with low- or zero-emission sources are emerging as viable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Staffell et al. (2019) provide a comprehensive overview of the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier, highlighting its versatility and ability to decarbonize various sectors of the economy.IOCs are well-positioned to lead the development and implementation of these energy carriers due to their extensive experience in large-scale energy production and distribution. Pickl (2019) argues that oil and gas companies have the financial resources, technical expertise, and global reach necessary to drive the energy transition. The author emphasizes the importance of IOCs' existing infrastructure and supply chains in facilitating the rapid deployment of new energy technologies.One of the key advantages of energy carriers is their ability to provide the energy and power densities required for long-distance transport and storage. Abe et al. (2019) discuss the potential of ammonia as an energy carrier, noting its high energy density and ease of storage and transport compared to hydrogen. Similarly, Olah et al. (2018) explore the benefits of methanol as a versatile energy carrier and chemical feedstock, highlighting its potential to contribute to a sustainable energy future.The role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in producing low-emission energy carriers is another area where IOCs can leverage their expertise. Bui et al. (2018) provide a comprehensive review of CCS technologies and their potential to mitigate climate change. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating CCS with hydrogen production from natural gas to achieve significant emissions reductions.The flexibility of energy carriers in terms of production methods is a crucial aspect of their potential. Renewable power, nuclear energy, and hydrogen derived from natural gas with CCS are all viable options for producing these carriers. Glenk and Reichelstein (2019) analyze the economics of producing hydrogen from renewable energy sources, demonstrating the potential for cost-competitive green hydrogen production in the near future.IOCs' involvement in the development of energy carriers extends beyond production to include transport and storage solutions. Teichmann et al. (2012) discuss the concept of a global renewable energy supply chain based on liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), highlighting the potential for IOCs to utilize their existing infrastructure for the transport and storage of these new energy vectors.The transition to a net-zero emission economy presents both challenges and opportunities for IOCs. Fattouh et al. (2019) examine the strategies adopted by oil and gas companies in response to the energy transition, noting that many are diversifying their portfolios to include low-carbon technologies and energy carriers.While the potential of energy carriers is significant, there are still technical and economic challenges to overcome. Hanley et al. (2018) provide a critical review of the barriers to hydrogen energy storage in the global energy system, emphasizing the need for continued research and development to improve efficiency and reduce costs.In conclusion, IOCs play a crucial role in driving the transition to a net-zero emission economy through their involvement in the development and deployment of energy carriers. Their scientific and engineering capabilities, coupled with their global reach and existing infrastructure, position them uniquely to overcome the challenges associated with this transition. As the world moves towards a more sustainable energy future, the expertise and resources of IOCs will be instrumental in achieving the rapid scale-up and optimization of clean energy solutions.", "References": [{"title": "The role of hydrogen and fuel cells in the global energy system", "authors": "Iain Staffell, Daniel Scamman, Anthony Velazquez Abad, Paul Balcombe, Paul E.
