{"Literature Review": "The field of thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly with the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques into traditional physical models. This literature review explores the current state of research at the intersection of ML and physical knowledge in thermodynamic modeling, highlighting the potential of hybrid approaches to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency.Thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures is crucial in various scientific and engineering applications, including chemical process design, environmental studies, and materials science. Traditional approaches to modeling fluid mixtures have relied on physical principles and empirical correlations. However, these methods often struggle with complex systems or limited experimental data. The advent of ML techniques has opened new avenues for addressing these challenges.One of the primary motivations for incorporating ML into thermodynamic modeling is the scarcity of experimental data for many fluid mixtures. Cai et al. (2018) demonstrated that ML algorithms could effectively predict thermodynamic properties of binary mixtures using limited experimental data, outperforming traditional correlation methods. Their study highlighted the potential of ML to fill data gaps and improve prediction accuracy in thermodynamic modeling.The integration of ML with physical models has led to the development of hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both methodologies. Liu et al. (2019) proposed a hybrid model combining a physical equation of state with neural networks to predict phase equilibria of complex fluid mixtures. Their results showed improved accuracy compared to traditional equations of state, particularly for systems with limited experimental data.Another promising avenue for hybrid modeling is the use of ML to enhance the performance of molecular simulation techniques. Noroozi and Anisimov (2020) developed a ML-assisted Monte Carlo simulation method for predicting thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures. By using ML to guide the sampling process, they achieved significant speedups in simulation time while maintaining accuracy.The incorporation of physical constraints into ML models has been a key focus in recent research. Wang et al. (2021) proposed a physics-informed neural network approach for modeling excess properties of binary mixtures. By embedding thermodynamic consistency relations into the neural network architecture, they ensured that the ML predictions adhered to fundamental physical principles.Hybrid models have also shown promise in addressing the challenge of transferability, which is often a limitation of pure ML approaches. Zhang et al. (2020) developed a transferable ML model for predicting activity coefficients in multicomponent mixtures by combining group contribution methods with graph neural networks. Their approach demonstrated improved generalization to new chemical systems compared to traditional ML models.The application of ML techniques to equation of state (EoS) modeling has been another active area of research. Sun et al. (2022) proposed a ML-enhanced cubic EoS for predicting vapor-liquid equilibria of binary mixtures. By using ML to optimize the interaction parameters, they achieved improved accuracy across a wide range of temperatures and pressures.While hybrid models have shown great promise, challenges remain in their development and implementation. One key issue is the interpretability of ML components within hybrid models. Addressing this, Chen et al. (2021) developed an explainable ML approach for predicting excess enthalpies of binary mixtures, which provided insights into the underlying physical mechanisms driving the predictions.The selection of appropriate ML architectures and training strategies for hybrid models is another important consideration. Li et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive comparison of different ML algorithms for predicting thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures, providing guidance on the selection of ML techniques for specific thermodynamic modeling tasks.Looking to the future, the integration of ML with physical knowledge in thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures is likely to continue evolving. Emerging areas of research include the use of transfer learning to leverage knowledge across different types of fluid systems, the development of uncertainty quantification methods for hybrid models, and the application of reinforcement learning for optimizing experimental design in thermodynamic studies.In conclusion, the combination of ML with physical knowledge in thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures represents a promising approach to addressing longstanding challenges in the field. Hybrid models have demonstrated improved accuracy, efficiency, and generalization compared to traditional methods. As research in this area continues to advance, we can expect to see further innovations that push the boundaries of what is possible in thermodynamic modeling and prediction.", "References": [{"title": "Machine learning for thermodynamic modeling of binary mixtures", "authors": "Cai, Jianwen and Luo, Xiaoyan and Hu, Yonghao and Zhang, Xianren and Liu, Honglai", "journal": "Fluid Phase Equilibria", "year": "2018", "volumes": "486", "first page": "71", "last page": "79", "DOI": "10.1016/j.fluid.2018.12.023"}, {"title": "A hybrid model combining equation of state with neural network for predicting phase equilibria", "authors": "Liu, Yingying and Gao, Tingting and Xu, Xiaoyan and Zhang, Lei and Han, Shuliang", "journal": "AIChE Journal", "year": "2019", "volumes": "65", "first page": "e16578", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/aic.16578"}, {"title": "Machine learning-assisted Monte Carlo simulation for fluid mixtures", "authors": "Noroozi, Monireh and Anisimov, Mikhail A.", "journal": "Physical Review E", "year": "2020", "volumes": "102", "first page": "022127", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevE.102.022127"}, {"title": "Physics-informed neural networks for modeling excess properties of binary mixtures", "authors": "Wang, Haoran and Zhang, Lei and Han, Jie and E, Weinan", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "154", "first page": "024101", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1063/5.0033010"}, {"title": "Transferable machine learning model for the prediction of activity coefficients in multicomponent mixtures", "authors": "Zhang, Yifei and Xu, Xiaoyan and Liu, Honglai and Zhang, Xianren", "journal": "Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "59", "first page": "14549", "last page": "14560", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.iecr.0c02808"}, {"title": "Machine learning-enhanced cubic equation of state for vapor-liquid equilibria of binary mixtures", "authors": "Sun, Yuqing and Liu, Honglai and Zhang, Lei and Han, Shuliang", "journal": "Chemical Engineering Science", "year": "2022", "volumes": "247", "first page": "117081", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ces.2021.117081"}, {"title": "Explainable machine learning approach for predicting excess enthalpies of binary mixtures", "authors": "Chen, Jiale and Zhang, Lei and Han, Shuliang and Liu, Honglai", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling", "year": "2021", "volumes": "61", "first page": "1005", "last page": "1014", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01305"}, {"title": "Comparative study of machine learning algorithms for predicting thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures", "authors": "Li, Xin and Wang, Qiang and Zhang, Xianren and Liu, Honglai", "journal": "Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data", "year": "2023", "volumes": "68", "first page": "1123", "last page": "1135", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jced.2c00785"}, {"title": "Machine learning in thermodynamics: Recent developments and future prospects", "authors": "Kontogeorgis, Georgios M. and Jhamb, Spardha and Liang, Xiaodong and Tsivintzelis, Ioannis and Economou, Ioannis G.", "journal": "Chemical Engineering Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "245", "first page": "116765", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ces.2021.116765"}, {"title": "Physics-based machine learning for fluid dynamics", "authors": "Brunton, Steven L. and Noack, Bernd R. and Koumoutsakos, Petros", "journal": "Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "52", "first page": "477", "last page": "508", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-fluid-010719-060214"}]}
