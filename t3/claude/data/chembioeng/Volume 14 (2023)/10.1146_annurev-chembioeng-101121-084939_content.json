{"Literature Review": "Active colloids represent a fascinating frontier in soft matter physics and materials science, offering unique opportunities to study nonequilibrium phenomena and create dynamic, adaptive materials. This review explores the current state of research on active colloids, focusing on their roles as models for nonequilibrium physics, novel materials with emergent properties, and potential building blocks for microscale machines.Active colloids are microscopic particles that convert energy from their environment into directed motion, breaking time-reversal symmetry and operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium. These systems have garnered significant attention due to their ability to mimic the behavior of living organisms and their potential applications in various fields, including drug delivery, environmental remediation, and microscale robotics.One of the primary propulsion mechanisms for active colloids involves chemical reactions. Bechinger et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive overview of chemically-driven active colloids, discussing how asymmetric catalytic reactions on particle surfaces can generate concentration gradients that drive motion through self-diffusiophoresis or self-electrophoresis. These chemical propulsion mechanisms have been extensively studied and optimized, with researchers exploring various catalytic materials and fuel combinations to achieve controlled motion in different environments (Wang et al., 2013).Magnetically actuated active colloids represent another important class of systems. Tierno et al. (2008) demonstrated the use of time-varying magnetic fields to propel colloidal particles near surfaces, exploiting the coupling between particle rotation and translation. This approach has since been extended to create more complex behaviors, including programmable assembly and disassembly of colloidal structures (Yan et al., 2012).Electric field-driven active colloids have also emerged as a promising area of research. Bricard et al. (2013) showed that applying alternating electric fields to conducting particles in a conducting fluid could induce Quincke rotation, leading to spontaneous motion and collective behaviors. This mechanism has been used to create large-scale, self-organized patterns and flows in colloidal suspensions (Geyer et al., 2019).The collective behavior of active colloids has become a central focus of research, as it provides insights into nonequilibrium statistical physics and emergent phenomena in living systems. Marchetti et al. (2013) provide a theoretical framework for understanding these collective behaviors, including the formation of dynamic clusters, phase separation, and large-scale coherent motion. Experimental studies have confirmed many of these predictions and revealed additional complexities, such as the emergence of topological defects in active nematic liquid crystals (Doostmohammadi et al., 2018).The unique properties of active colloids make them promising candidates for creating novel materials with adaptive and self-healing capabilities. Palacci et al. (2013) demonstrated the formation of 'living crystals' from light-activated colloidal particles, which could assemble, break apart, and re-form in response to environmental cues. This work highlights the potential for creating reconfigurable materials that can adapt to external stimuli and perform complex functions.The field of colloidal machines and microscale robotics has also benefited greatly from advances in active colloids. Wang and Pumera (2018) review recent progress in this area, discussing how engineered active particles can be used to create mobile microrobots capable of performing tasks such as cargo transport, environmental sensing, and targeted drug delivery. The integration of multiple functionalities into single particles or assemblies of particles represents a key challenge and opportunity for future research.As the field of active colloids continues to evolve, there are numerous opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute their expertise. The design and synthesis of new catalytic materials for chemical propulsion, the development of scalable fabrication methods for complex colloidal particles, and the creation of responsive environments for controlling collective behaviors are all areas where chemical engineering knowledge can have a significant impact.In conclusion, active colloids represent a rich and rapidly developing field at the intersection of soft matter physics, materials science, and engineering. As models for nonequilibrium physics, they provide valuable insights into the fundamental principles governing systems far from equilibrium. As materials, they offer the potential for creating adaptive and self-healing structures with unprecedented functionalities. And as building blocks for microscale machines, they pave the way for new generations of autonomous microrobots. The continued development of this field promises to yield exciting discoveries and applications in the coming years, with significant contributions expected from the chemical engineering community.", "References": [{"title": "Active particles in complex and crowded environments", "authors": "Clemens Bechinger, Roberto Di Leonardo, Hartmut Löwen, Charles Reichhardt, Giorgio Volpe, Giovanni Volpe", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "88", "first page": "045006", "last page": "045006", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.88.045006"}, {"title": "Catalytic Nanomotors: Autonomous Movement of Striped Nanorods", "authors": "Wei Wang, Wentao Duan, Suzanne Ahmed, Thomas E.
