{"Literature Review": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to pose significant challenges to global health, even in the era of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). While ART has dramatically improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH), it does not fully restore immune function or eliminate the persistent state of chronic inflammation observed in these individuals. This chronic immune activation and inflammation contribute to the persistence of latent HIV reservoirs and the development of various comorbidities, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches to address these issues. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of the gut microbiome in HIV pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target. The gut microbiome, comprising trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and overall health. Numerous studies have demonstrated that HIV infection leads to significant alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, a phenomenon known as dysbiosis. The impact of HIV-associated dysbiosis extends beyond the gut, influencing systemic immune function and inflammation. Microbial translocation, the passage of microbial products from the gut lumen into systemic circulation, is a key driver of chronic immune activation in HIV infection. This concept has been supported by subsequent studies showing elevated levels of microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the plasma of PLWH. While the association between gut dysbiosis and immune dysfunction in HIV has been well-established, the precise mechanisms linking these phenomena remain incompletely understood. Recent research has focused on the role of microbial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), in mediating the effects of the microbiome on host immunity and HIV persistence. SCFAs, primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. These metabolites have been shown to exert broad immunomodulatory effects, influencing both innate and adaptive immune responses. Butyrate enhances the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are critical for maintaining immune tolerance and suppressing excessive inflammation. In the context of HIV, SCFAs may play a dual role. On one hand, their anti-inflammatory properties could help mitigate chronic immune activation. On the other hand, by promoting Treg differentiation, SCFAs might inadvertently contribute to the persistence of latent HIV reservoirs, as Tregs have been shown to harbor latent virus. The impact of SCFAs on HIV persistence extends beyond their effects on Tregs. Recent studies have shown that SCFAs can directly modulate HIV transcription and latency. Butyrate, through its activity as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, can reactivate latent HIV in vitro. Bile acids, another important class of microbial metabolites, have also emerged as key regulators of immune function and inflammation. Primary BAs are synthesized in the liver and subsequently modified by gut bacteria to form secondary BAs. These metabolites act as signaling molecules through various nuclear receptors, including the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5). Activation of these receptors has been shown to modulate immune cell function and inflammatory responses. In the context of HIV infection, alterations in BA metabolism have been observed, potentially contributing to immune dysfunction and viral persistence. SIV infection in non-human primates leads to dysregulation of BA synthesis and transport, which was associated with increased microbial translocation and immune activation. Furthermore, BAs have been shown to influence HIV replication and latency. The interplay between the microbiome, SCFAs, BAs, and HIV persistence is complex and multifaceted. While these metabolites have the potential to modulate immune function and viral latency, their effects are context-dependent and can be both beneficial and detrimental. Understanding the intricate relationships between the microbiome, its metabolites, and HIV pathogenesis opens up new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Strategies aimed at modulating the gut microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation, have shown promise in preclinical studies and small clinical trials. Additionally, targeting specific metabolic pathways or receptors involved in SCFA and BA signaling could provide novel approaches to manipulate immune function and viral persistence in PLWH. In conclusion, the gut microbiome and its metabolites, particularly SCFAs and BAs, play crucial roles in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence. Elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies to improve immune function, reduce inflammation, and potentially contribute to HIV cure efforts. Future research should focus on unraveling the complex interplay between these factors and exploring their potential as targets for intervention in the management of HIV infection.", "References": [{"title": "Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with HIV disease progression and tryptophan catabolism", "authors": "Ivan Vujkovic-Cvijin, Richard M.
