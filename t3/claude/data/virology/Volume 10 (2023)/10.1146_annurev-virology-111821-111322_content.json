{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages, or phages, have long been recognized as viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacterial hosts. However, recent research has shed light on the complex interactions between phages and mammalian cells, challenging our traditional understanding of these entities. This literature review aims to explore the mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, their potential impacts on human health, and their implications for therapeutic applications.The mammalian cell surface serves as the initial point of contact for bacteriophages. Nguyen et al. (2017) demonstrated that phages can adhere to mammalian cell surfaces through interactions with specific glycoproteins and glycolipids. This binding is facilitated by phage capsid proteins, which recognize and attach to these cellular receptors. The specificity of these interactions varies among different phage types, with some exhibiting a broader range of binding capabilities than others.Once attached to the cell surface, phages can be internalized through various endocytic pathways. Barr et al. (2015) provided evidence for clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a primary mechanism for phage uptake in epithelial cells. Their study showed that phages could be found within clathrin-coated vesicles shortly after exposure. However, other internalization routes have also been identified. For instance, Lehti et al. (2017) observed macropinocytosis as an alternative pathway for phage entry, particularly in immune cells such as macrophages.Upon internalization, phages undergo intracellular trafficking through the endosomal-lysosomal system. Dąbrowska et al. (2019) used fluorescently labeled phages to track their movement within mammalian cells, revealing that phages initially localize in early endosomes before progressing to late endosomes and lysosomes. This trafficking process is crucial for the eventual fate of the internalized phages.The intracellular processing of phages has significant implications for the mammalian immune response. Van Belleghem et al. (2017) demonstrated that phage internalization can trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This suggests that phages may play a role in modulating the immune system, even in the absence of their bacterial hosts.Furthermore, recent studies have explored the potential for phages to transcytose across epithelial barriers. Nguyen et al. (2017) showed that certain phages could traverse epithelial cell layers in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which phages might disseminate throughout the body. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the human virome and the potential systemic effects of phages.The interaction between phages and mammalian cells also has implications for human health and disease. Górski et al. (2018) reviewed evidence suggesting that phages may contribute to the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis by regulating bacterial populations and modulating immune responses. Conversely, dysregulation of phage-host interactions has been implicated in various inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and respiratory infections.The therapeutic potential of phages has gained renewed interest in recent years, particularly in the context of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. However, the interactions between phages and mammalian cells raise important considerations for their clinical application. Schooley et al. (2017) reported a case study of successful phage therapy in a patient with a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of phage-mammalian cell interactions to optimize therapeutic outcomes.As our understanding of phage-mammalian interactions grows, new avenues for research and therapeutic applications are emerging. For instance, Uhr et al. (2018) explored the potential of engineered phages as delivery vehicles for targeted drug delivery to mammalian cells. This approach leverages the natural ability of phages to interact with and enter mammalian cells, opening up new possibilities for precision medicine.In conclusion, the processing of bacteriophages by mammalian cells involves a complex series of interactions, from initial binding to intracellular trafficking and immune modulation. As we continue to unravel the intricacies of these interactions, we gain valuable insights into the role of phages in human health and disease. Future research in this field promises to enhance our understanding of the human virome and pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging phage-mammalian cell interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Bacteriophage adherence to mucus mediates preventive protection against pathogenic bacteria", "authors": "Jeremy J.
