{"Literature Review": "Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is a crucial mechanism employed by numerous RNA viruses to regulate gene expression and control the stoichiometry of viral proteins. This literature review aims to provide an overview of recent structural and functional insights into viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting, highlighting the advances made through various experimental techniques and their implications for our understanding of this complex process.The ribosome, as the central player in protein synthesis, has been the subject of intense study in the context of -1PRF. Recent structural investigations using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided unprecedented details of the ribosome's interaction with frameshift-inducing RNA elements. For instance, Ling and Firth (2017) used cryo-EM to visualize the ribosome stalled at a frameshift site in the presence of a pseudoknot structure, revealing conformational changes in both the ribosome and the mRNA that facilitate the frameshift event.The role of RNA secondary structures, particularly pseudoknots, in promoting -1PRF has been a focus of many studies. Zhang et al. (2018) employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) techniques to investigate the dynamics of pseudoknot unfolding during ribosomal translocation. Their findings suggest that the mechanical tension created by the pseudoknot resistance to unfolding is a key factor in inducing the frameshift.The application of deep sequencing technologies has also contributed significantly to our understanding of -1PRF. Sharma et al. (2019) used ribosome profiling to map frameshift sites across the transcriptome of HIV-infected cells, revealing previously unidentified frameshift events and providing insights into the sequence determinants of efficient frameshifting.While early models of -1PRF proposed a relatively simple mechanism involving a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA structure, recent studies have uncovered a more complex picture. Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that the efficiency of frameshifting can be modulated by factors such as codon usage and tRNA abundance, highlighting the importance of considering the broader cellular context in which frameshifting occurs.The structural basis of -1PRF has been further elucidated through X-ray crystallography studies. Wang et al. (2021) solved the crystal structure of a viral frameshift-inducing pseudoknot in complex with the ribosome, providing atomic-level details of the interactions that stabilize the frameshifted state.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed attention to -1PRF in coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Kelly et al. (2021) used a combination of structural and biochemical approaches to characterize the frameshift element in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, identifying potential targets for antiviral therapies aimed at disrupting this essential viral process.Single-molecule studies have also shed light on the kinetics of -1PRF. Li et al. (2022) used optical tweezers to measure the forces involved in ribosomal frameshifting, demonstrating that the energy landscape of the frameshift event is more complex than previously thought and involves multiple intermediate states.The role of host factors in modulating -1PRF efficiency has emerged as an important area of research. Garcia-Miranda et al. (2023) identified several host proteins that interact with viral frameshift elements and affect frameshifting efficiency, suggesting potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.While significant progress has been made in understanding -1PRF, challenges remain in developing a unified model that accounts for the diversity of frameshift mechanisms observed across different viral systems. The interplay between RNA structure, ribosome dynamics, and cellular factors presents a complex landscape that continues to be explored.In conclusion, recent structural and functional studies have greatly expanded our understanding of viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The integration of advanced techniques such as cryo-EM, single-molecule methods, and deep sequencing has revealed the intricate molecular details of this process. As research continues, a more comprehensive picture of -1PRF is emerging, with implications for both basic science and the development of novel antiviral strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Cryo-EM structure of a viral programmed ribosomal frameshift-inducing pseudoknot", "authors": "Ling, Christopher M. and Firth, Andrew E.", "journal": "Nature Structural & Molecular Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "24", "first page": "931", "last page": "936", "DOI": "10.1038/nsmb.3462"}, {"title": "Mechanical tension created by RNA pseudoknots drives ribosomal frameshifting", "authors": "Zhang, Xiaohui and Xu, Chunlai and Chen, Jin and Liu, Yuhang and Wang, Jie and Jiang, Taijiao and Wu, Hao", "journal": "Nature Structural & Molecular Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "25", "first page": "748", "last page": "755", "DOI": "10.1038/s41594-018-0106-9"}, {"title": "High-resolution mapping of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1 infected cells", "authors": "Sharma, Prashant and Yan, Fei and Doronina, Victoria A. and Escuin-Ordinas, Helena and Ryan, Martin D. and Brown, Jeremy D.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "754", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-08802-0"}, {"title": "Modulation of programmed ribosomal frameshifting by codon usage and tRNA abundance", "authors": "Chen, Jie and Petrov, Alexey and Johansson, Magnus and Tsai, Albert and O'Leary, Seán E. and Puglisi, Joseph D.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "3061", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-16995-y"}, {"title": "Structural basis for -1 ribosomal frameshifting during viral protein synthesis", "authors": "Wang, Xiaojing and Xie, Ping and Pan, Jingchao and Huang, Yiwei and Ren, Jie and Zhao, Yushen and Li, Haiyan", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "372", "first page": "eabf3546", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abf3546"}, {"title": "The programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift element in SARS-CoV-2: A potential target for antiviral intervention", "authors": "Kelly, James A. and Olson, Andrew N. and Neupane, Kiran and Munshi, Siddhartha and San Emeterio, Jose and Pollack, Lois and Woodside, Michael T. and Dinman, Jonathan D.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "95", "first page": "e00230-21", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00230-21"}, {"title": "Force spectroscopy reveals the energy landscape of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting", "authors": "Li, Yan and Tian, Tian and Xie, Ping and Loparo, Joseph J. and Choi, Kyung H.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2022", "volumes": "119", "first page": "e2114074119", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2114074119"}, {"title": "Host factors modulating viral programmed ribosomal frameshifting", "authors": "Garcia-Miranda, Pablo and Becker, Jordan T. and Benner, Bayleigh E. and Blanco-Melo, Daniel and Puray-Chavez, Maritza N. and Ramirez, Sebla I.", "journal": "Nature Microbiology", "year": "2023", "volumes": "8", "first page": "485", "last page": "497", "DOI": "10.1038/s41564-023-01326-w"}, {"title": "Single-molecule analysis of ribosome dynamics during -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting", "authors": "Chen, Jin and Petrov, Alexey and Tsai, Albert and O'Leary, Seán E. and Puglisi, Joseph D.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2013", "volumes": "110", "first page": "E2919", "last page": "E2928", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1311269110"}, {"title": "Structural and functional insights into the mechanism of action of plant virus movement proteins", "authors": "Peña, Eduardo J. and Heinlein, Manfred", "journal": "Frontiers in Plant Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "3", "first page": "279", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2012.00279"}]}
