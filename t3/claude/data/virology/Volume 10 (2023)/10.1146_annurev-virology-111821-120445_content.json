{"Literature Review": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses represent a diverse group of pathogens that pose significant threats to human health. These viruses are characterized by their unique genomic structure, consisting of multiple RNA segments that are complementary to messenger RNA. This review focuses on the development of reverse genetic systems for these viruses, the creation of reporter strains, and their applications in advancing our understanding of viral biology and pathogenesis.The development of reverse genetic systems for segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses has been a crucial milestone in the field of virology. These systems allow researchers to manipulate viral genomes and study the functions of specific genes and proteins. One of the earliest successes in this area was achieved with influenza viruses. Neumann et al. (1999) reported the generation of infectious influenza A virus entirely from cloned cDNAs, paving the way for genetic manipulation of these important human pathogens. This breakthrough enabled researchers to investigate the roles of individual viral proteins and regulatory elements in virus replication and pathogenesis.Following the success with influenza viruses, similar approaches were applied to other segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses. For instance, Flick and Pettersson (2001) developed a reverse genetics system for Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus. This system allowed for the recovery of infectious virus from cDNA clones, facilitating the study of virus-host interactions and the development of attenuated vaccine candidates.The establishment of reverse genetic systems has also been crucial for studying arenaviruses, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Flatz et al. (2006) reported the generation of recombinant LCMV from cDNA, which enabled the investigation of viral determinants of pathogenesis and the development of novel vaccine strategies. This approach has since been extended to other medically important arenaviruses, including Lassa virus and Junin virus.One of the most significant applications of reverse genetic systems has been the development of reporter viruses. These engineered strains express fluorescent or bioluminescent proteins, allowing for real-time visualization of viral infection and spread. Manicassamy et al. (2010) generated a replication-competent influenza A virus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), which enabled the tracking of viral infection in vitro and in vivo. This reporter virus has been instrumental in studying influenza virus tropism and the dynamics of viral spread within host tissues.Similarly, Emonet et al. (2009) developed a tri-segmented LCMV expressing GFP, which allowed for the visualization of arenavirus infection in living cells and animals. This reporter virus has provided valuable insights into arenavirus biology, including the identification of cellular factors involved in virus entry and replication.The development of reporter strains has also been extended to bunyaviruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Bird et al. (2008) generated a recombinant RVFV expressing Renilla luciferase, which enabled high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds and the study of virus-host interactions. This approach has since been applied to other bunyaviruses, facilitating comparative studies of viral replication and pathogenesis across different species.Bioluminescent reporter viruses have proven particularly useful for in vivo imaging of viral infections. Karlsson et al. (2015) developed a recombinant influenza A virus expressing NanoLuc luciferase, which allowed for non-invasive monitoring of viral infection in living animals. This technology has provided new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza virus infection and the effectiveness of antiviral treatments.The use of reporter viruses has also contributed to our understanding of viral tropism and cell-to-cell spread. Fukuyama et al. (2015) used a fluorescent reporter influenza virus to demonstrate that the virus can spread through the respiratory tract via tunneling nanotubes, a previously unknown mechanism of viral dissemination. This finding has important implications for our understanding of influenza pathogenesis and the development of new antiviral strategies.Looking to the future, reporter viruses are likely to play an increasingly important role in the study of segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses. The development of multicolor reporter viruses, such as those described by Fukuyama et al. (2020) for influenza, will enable the simultaneous tracking of multiple viral strains or reassortants in co-infection studies. This approach could provide valuable insights into viral evolution and the emergence of new pandemic strains.Furthermore, the combination of reporter viruses with advanced imaging techniques, such as intravital microscopy and light sheet fluorescence microscopy, promises to reveal new details about virus-host interactions at the cellular and tissue levels. These approaches could shed light on the mechanisms of viral persistence, immune evasion, and tissue damage in various disease models.In conclusion, the development of reverse genetic systems and reporter strains for segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses has revolutionized our ability to study these important human pathogens. These tools have provided unprecedented insights into viral biology, pathogenesis, and host interactions. As technology continues to advance, reporter viruses will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the development of new antiviral therapies and vaccines, as well as in our fundamental understanding of virus-host dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Generation of influenza A viruses entirely from cloned cDNAs", "authors": "Gabriele Neumann, Takeshi Watanabe, Hiroshi Ito, Shinji Watanabe, Hideo Goto, Peng Gao, Mark Hughes, David R.
