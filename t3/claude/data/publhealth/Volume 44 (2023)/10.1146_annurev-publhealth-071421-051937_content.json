{"Literature Review": "Climate change poses a significant threat to global health and healthcare systems, acting as a threat multiplier that exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and creates new challenges. As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, there is a growing recognition of the need for sustainable and resilient healthcare systems that can adapt to these changes while minimizing their own environmental footprint. This literature review synthesizes current research on sustainable and resilient healthcare in the face of a changing climate, exploring adaptation strategies, barriers to implementation, and recommendations for future action.The health impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and complex. Watts et al. (2018) highlight the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and storms, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Indirect effects include changes in disease patterns, food and water insecurity, and forced migration. These impacts place significant strain on healthcare systems, which must adapt to meet changing needs while maintaining continuity of care.Healthcare facilities themselves are vulnerable to climate-related disruptions. Balbus et al. (2016) emphasize the importance of infrastructure resilience, noting that extreme weather events can damage or destroy healthcare facilities, disrupt power supplies, and compromise access to essential medical resources. This vulnerability underscores the need for climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure that can withstand and rapidly recover from such events.Adaptation strategies for healthcare systems encompass a range of approaches. Haines and Ebi (2019) discuss the importance of early warning systems and emergency preparedness plans to anticipate and respond to climate-related health emergencies. They also highlight the need for capacity building among healthcare professionals to address emerging health threats associated with climate change.Supply chain resilience is another critical aspect of sustainable healthcare. Dasaklis et al. (2019) examine the vulnerabilities of pharmaceutical and medical supply chains to climate-related disruptions and propose strategies for enhancing resilience, including diversification of suppliers, local production of essential items, and improved inventory management systems.While adaptation is crucial, the healthcare sector must also address its own contribution to climate change. Lenzen et al. (2020) estimate that the healthcare sector is responsible for 4.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This highlights the urgent need for mitigation strategies within the sector. Salas et al. (2020) propose a framework for decarbonizing healthcare, emphasizing energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, sustainable procurement practices, and waste reduction.Telemedicine and digital health technologies offer promising avenues for both adaptation and mitigation. Holmner et al. (2014) discuss how telemedicine can reduce the need for patient travel, thereby decreasing emissions while maintaining access to care. These technologies can also enhance resilience by enabling remote consultations during extreme weather events or disease outbreaks.Despite the clear need for action, numerous barriers impede the transition to sustainable and resilient healthcare systems. Walpole et al. (2019) identify financial constraints, lack of awareness and expertise, and competing priorities as key obstacles. They emphasize the need for policy interventions and financial incentives to overcome these barriers and accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices in healthcare.Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for addressing the complex challenges posed by climate change. Charlesworth et al. (2018) advocate for stronger partnerships between health professionals, climate scientists, urban planners, and policymakers to develop integrated solutions that enhance both health outcomes and climate resilience.Looking ahead, there is a growing consensus on the need for transformative change in healthcare systems to address climate change. Costello et al. (2009) argue for a fundamental shift in how healthcare is conceptualized and delivered, emphasizing prevention, community-based care, and sustainable practices as core principles.In conclusion, the transition to sustainable and resilient healthcare in the face of climate change requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses adaptation, mitigation, and system-wide transformation. While significant challenges remain, the growing body of research in this field provides a foundation for action. Future efforts should focus on overcoming implementation barriers, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and scaling up successful interventions to create healthcare systems that are not only resilient to climate impacts but also contribute to a healthier, more sustainable planet.", "References": [{"title": "The 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: shaping the health of nations for centuries to come", "authors": "Nick Watts, Markus Amann, Nigel Arnell, Sonja Ayeb-Karlsson, Kristine Belesova, Helen Berry, Timothy Bouley, Maxwell Boykoff, Peter Byass, Wenjia Cai", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2018", "volumes": "392", "first page": "2479", "last page": "2514", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32594-7"}, {"title": "The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment", "authors": "John Balbus, Allison Crimmins, Janet L.
