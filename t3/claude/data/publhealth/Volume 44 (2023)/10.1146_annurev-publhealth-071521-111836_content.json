{"Literature Review": "The quality of housing has emerged as a critical determinant of health and well-being, with far-reaching implications for social inequalities. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of housing quality on health outcomes and overall well-being, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations and the potential for interventions to mitigate these disparities.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the significance of housing conditions in shaping population health, as evidenced by their Housing and Health Guidelines (WHO, 2018). These guidelines emphasize the importance of interventions that protect occupants from extreme temperatures, injuries, and other environmental hazards. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the critical role of adequate ventilation in maintaining healthy indoor environments (Morawska et al., 2020).Numerous studies have demonstrated the link between poor housing quality and adverse health outcomes. For instance, Krieger and Higgins (2002) found that substandard housing conditions were associated with increased risks of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and infectious illnesses. Similarly, Thomson et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review of housing improvement interventions, concluding that targeted improvements in housing quality can lead to significant health benefits, particularly in terms of respiratory health and general well-being.The impact of housing quality on health is not evenly distributed across populations. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and low-income individuals often face disproportionate burdens of poor housing conditions, which exacerbate existing health disparities. Riva et al. (2014) examined housing conditions among Indigenous populations in Canada, finding that overcrowding and inadequate housing were associated with higher rates of respiratory infections and mental health issues. Similarly, Jacobs et al. (2009) highlighted the disproportionate exposure of low-income and minority communities to housing-related health hazards in the United States.Children and older adults are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of poor housing quality. A study by Howden-Chapman et al. (2007) demonstrated that improving home insulation resulted in significant reductions in respiratory symptoms and hospital admissions among children with asthma. For older adults, Curl et al. (2015) found that poor housing conditions were associated with increased risk of falls and functional limitations, emphasizing the importance of age-friendly housing designs.The role of public and subsidized housing in addressing health inequalities has gained renewed attention from researchers and policymakers. While these housing programs aim to provide affordable options for disadvantaged populations, concerns persist about the quality of such housing and its impact on residents' health. Digenis-Bury et al. (2008) compared health outcomes between public housing residents and other low-income individuals, finding higher rates of chronic diseases and mental health issues among public housing residents.Community-based interventions have shown promise in ameliorating some of the negative health impacts associated with poor housing quality. For example, Breysse et al. (2011) evaluated a green housing renovation program in low-income communities, demonstrating improvements in respiratory health and overall quality of life among residents. Such interventions highlight the potential for targeted housing improvements to address health disparities effectively.The relationship between housing quality and health extends beyond individual dwellings to encompass broader neighborhood characteristics. Mair et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review of neighborhood characteristics and depression, finding that poor-quality built environments were associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. This underscores the importance of considering housing quality within the context of overall neighborhood conditions.Improving housing quality not only benefits individual and population health but also contributes to broader societal goals. Gibson et al. (2011) explored the co-benefits of housing improvement interventions, noting that energy-efficient upgrades can simultaneously reduce carbon emissions and improve health outcomes. This aligns with growing interest in sustainable and healthy urban development strategies.In conclusion, the literature consistently demonstrates the profound impact of housing quality on health and well-being, with clear implications for social inequalities. While progress has been made in recognizing and addressing these issues, significant challenges remain, particularly for vulnerable populations. Future research and policy efforts should focus on developing and implementing evidence-based interventions to improve housing quality, with a particular emphasis on addressing the needs of disadvantaged communities. By doing so, we can work towards creating healthier, more equitable living environments for all.", "References": [{"title": "WHO Housing and health guidelines", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "World Health Organization", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "978-92-4-155037-6"}, {"title": "How can airborne transmission of COVID-19 indoors be minimised?", "authors": "Lidia Morawska, Julian W.
