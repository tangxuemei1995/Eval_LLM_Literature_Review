{"Literature Review": "Climate change is increasingly recognized as a significant driver of human mobility, with profound implications for global health. This literature review examines the complex interplay between climatic and environmental change, migration, and health outcomes, focusing on research published since 2018.The relationship between climate change and human mobility is multifaceted. While climate-related migration can serve as an adaptation strategy, it also presents numerous health challenges. Watts et al. (2021) emphasize that climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and creating new health risks for mobile populations. Their comprehensive analysis underscores the urgency of addressing the health impacts of climate-induced migration.One of the primary ways climate change influences migration is through extreme weather events and slow-onset environmental changes. Kelman et al. (2019) explore how sea-level rise, in particular, is driving migration in small island developing states. Their research highlights the complex decision-making processes involved in migration and the potential health consequences of both staying and relocating.Displacement due to sudden-onset disasters presents immediate health risks. Schwerdtle et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review of health outcomes among climate-displaced populations, finding increased risks of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and mental health disorders. They emphasize the need for targeted health interventions for displaced populations, particularly in low-resource settings.Planned relocation, often considered a last-resort adaptation strategy, also carries significant health implications. Dannenberg et al. (2019) examine case studies of planned relocations, noting both positive and negative health outcomes. While relocation can remove people from immediate environmental hazards, it can also disrupt social networks and livelihoods, potentially leading to psychosocial stress and reduced access to healthcare.Migration as an adaptive response to climate change can have varied health impacts. Cissé et al. (2022) investigate the health consequences of rural-to-urban migration in West Africa, finding that while migrants may escape certain environmental risks, they often face new health challenges in urban settings, including poor living conditions and limited access to health services.Interestingly, climate change is also altering the health risks in destination areas. McMichael et al. (2020) explore how climate change is reshaping disease ecologies in migrant-receiving regions, potentially exposing migrants to new health threats. This highlights the need for adaptive health systems that can respond to changing patterns of disease and population movement.The health of immobile populations – those unable or unwilling to migrate – is another crucial consideration. Ayeb-Karlsson et al. (2018) examine the concept of 'trapped populations' in the context of climate change, noting that these groups often face severe health risks due to their inability to escape deteriorating environmental conditions.Mental health emerges as a critical concern across various forms of climate-related mobility. Hayes et al. (2018) review the psychological impacts of both acute displacement and slow-onset migration, finding elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among affected populations. They argue for the integration of mental health services into climate adaptation and migration policies.While much of the literature focuses on negative health outcomes, some research identifies potential health benefits of climate-related mobility. Schwerdtle et al. (2021) explore how migration can improve access to healthcare and education, potentially leading to better long-term health outcomes for some migrants.The reviewed literature consistently calls for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health systems. Ebi et al. (2019) propose a framework for integrating climate change considerations into health policy and practice, emphasizing the need for adaptive and resilient healthcare infrastructure.In conclusion, the nexus of climate change, migration, and health presents complex challenges and some opportunities for global health. As climate change continues to reshape human mobility patterns, there is an urgent need for interdisciplinary research, adaptive policies, and resilient health systems to address the diverse health needs of mobile and immobile populations in a changing climate. Future research should focus on developing evidence-based interventions to mitigate health risks and maximize potential benefits associated with climate-related mobility.", "References": [{"title": "The 2020 report of The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: responding to converging crises", "authors": "Nick Watts, Markus Amann, Nigel Arnell, Sonja Ayeb-Karlsson, Jessica Beagley, Kristine Belesova, Maxwell Boykoff, Peter Byass, Wenjia Cai, Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2021", "volumes": "397", "first page": "129", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32290-X"}, {"title": "Climate change and small island developing states", "authors": "Ilan Kelman, Justyna Orlowska, Himani Upadhyay, Robert Stojanov, Christian Webersik, Andrea C.
