{"Literature Review": "Extreme heat events (EHEs) have emerged as a significant public health concern, with their frequency and severity increasing due to climate change. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding public health preparedness for EHEs, focusing on the development and implementation of heat action plans (HAPs) as a crucial component of disaster risk reduction.Climate change has been identified as a major driver of the increasing prevalence and intensity of EHEs. Watts et al. (2021) reported that between 2000 and 2018, heat-related mortality in people older than 65 years increased by 53.7%, with climate change responsible for approximately 37% of these deaths. This trend underscores the urgent need for enhanced public health preparedness to mitigate the impacts of extreme heat.Heat action plans have been widely recognized as effective tools for reducing heat-related morbidity and mortality. Hess et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive review of HAPs implemented across various administrative scales, finding that well-designed and executed plans can significantly reduce heat-related health risks. The authors emphasized the importance of tailoring HAPs to local contexts, considering factors such as demographics, urban infrastructure, and available resources.Primary prevention strategies, which are crucial in the pre-event phase, focus on long-term measures to reduce vulnerability to extreme heat. Urban planning and design play a vital role in this context. Heaviside et al. (2017) examined the potential of urban greening and cool roofs to mitigate the urban heat island effect, demonstrating that these interventions could reduce air temperatures by up to 3°C during heatwaves. Such measures not only improve thermal comfort but also contribute to reducing energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.Secondary prevention strategies are essential for early risk reduction during an EHE. Early warning systems (EWS) have been shown to be particularly effective in this regard. Lowe et al. (2016) evaluated the impact of heat-health warning systems in Europe, finding that they were associated with a reduction in excess mortality during heatwaves. The authors highlighted the importance of clear communication and targeted messaging to vulnerable populations for maximizing the effectiveness of these systems.Tertiary prevention strategies become crucial later in the event phase, focusing on minimizing harm to those already affected by extreme heat. Kravchenko et al. (2013) analyzed the effectiveness of cooling centers as a public health intervention during heatwaves. Their study found that access to air-conditioned environments significantly reduced heat-related mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.The development of climate-resilient health systems is fundamental to improving preparedness for EHEs. Ebi et al. (2018) proposed a framework for building health system resilience to climate change, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that address both immediate health impacts and long-term sustainability. The authors argued that investing in climate-resilient health infrastructure and workforce capacity is essential for effective heat preparedness.Adaptive management strategies, informed by after-action reports and post-event evaluations, are critical for continually improving heat preparedness efforts. Toloo et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review of heat warning system evaluation studies, finding that while many cities have implemented such systems, there is a lack of robust evidence on their effectiveness. The authors called for more rigorous evaluation methodologies to inform evidence-based policy-making in this area.The intersection of extreme heat and other environmental hazards presents additional challenges for public health preparedness. Reid et al. (2016) examined the compounding effects of extreme heat and air pollution, highlighting the need for integrated approaches to address these interrelated risks. Their findings underscore the importance of considering multiple environmental stressors in the development of comprehensive heat preparedness strategies.As climate change continues to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of EHEs, there is a growing recognition of the need for global cooperation and knowledge sharing in heat preparedness efforts. The Global Heat Health Information Network, as described by Jay et al. (2021), represents an important step towards fostering international collaboration and disseminating best practices in heat-health management.In conclusion, public health preparedness for extreme heat events requires a multifaceted approach encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies. The development and implementation of heat action plans, informed by local contexts and supported by climate-resilient health systems, are crucial for effective disaster risk reduction. Ongoing research, rigorous evaluation, and adaptive management will be essential for continually improving our capacity to protect public health in the face of increasing heat-related risks driven by climate change.", "References": [{"title": "The 2020 report of The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: responding to converging crises", "authors": "Nick Watts, Markus Amann, Nigel Arnell, Sonja Ayeb-Karlsson, Jessica Beagley, Kristine Belesova, Maxwell Boykoff, Peter Byass, Wenjia Cai, Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2021", "volumes": "397", "first page": "129", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32290-X"}, {"title": "Building Resilience to Climate Change: A Public Health Preparedness Guide", "authors": "Jeremy J.
