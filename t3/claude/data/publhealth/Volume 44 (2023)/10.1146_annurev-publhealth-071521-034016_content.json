{"Literature Review": "Mass incarceration in the United States has become a critical public health concern, with far-reaching implications for health equity and social justice. This literature review examines the complex interplay between public health and the prison system, focusing on the priorities that have emerged in the age of mass incarceration.The historical roots of mass incarceration in the United States can be traced back to the legacy of slavery, racial discrimination, and the criminalization of marginalized communities. Scholars have argued that the current system of mass incarceration serves as a form of social control, disproportionately affecting people of color and perpetuating systemic inequalities (Alexander, 2010). This perspective is supported by research demonstrating the racial disparities in arrest rates, sentencing, and incarceration (Nellis, 2016).The health consequences of mass incarceration are profound and multifaceted. Incarcerated individuals face a higher risk of chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and mental health disorders compared to the general population (Wildeman & Wang, 2017). The prison environment itself contributes to poor health outcomes, with overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, and limited access to healthcare exacerbating existing health conditions and fostering the spread of communicable diseases (Kinner & Young, 2018).One of the most pressing public health concerns in prisons is the high prevalence of mental health disorders. Studies have consistently shown that incarcerated individuals have significantly higher rates of mental illness compared to the general population (Fazel et al., 2016). Despite this, mental health services in prisons are often inadequate, leading to untreated or undertreated conditions that can worsen over time (Gonzalez & Connell, 2014).Substance use disorders represent another critical health issue in the prison population. The criminalization of drug use has contributed to the incarceration of many individuals with substance use disorders, yet prisons often lack comprehensive addiction treatment programs (Chandler et al., 2009). This gap in care not only affects the health of incarcerated individuals but also has implications for public health upon their release, as untreated substance use disorders can contribute to recidivism and community health problems.Infectious diseases, particularly HIV and hepatitis C, pose significant challenges in the prison setting. The close living quarters and high-risk behaviors associated with incarceration contribute to the spread of these diseases (Rich et al., 2013). While some progress has been made in providing testing and treatment for HIV in prisons, access to hepatitis C treatment remains limited in many correctional facilities (Spaulding et al., 2017).The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the public health vulnerabilities of the prison population. Prisons have become hotspots for virus transmission due to overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and limited ability to implement social distancing measures (Akiyama et al., 2020). This crisis has underscored the urgent need for decarceration strategies and improved health protocols in correctional facilities.Addressing the health needs of incarcerated individuals requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond the prison walls. Continuity of care upon release is crucial for maintaining health gains achieved during incarceration and reducing the risk of recidivism (Binswanger et al., 2011). However, many formerly incarcerated individuals face significant barriers to accessing healthcare and other essential services upon reentry into their communities.In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the need for decarceral solutions to address the public health challenges associated with mass incarceration. Alternatives to incarceration, such as community-based treatment programs for individuals with mental health or substance use disorders, have shown promise in reducing recidivism and improving health outcomes (Steadman et al., 2009).Public health researchers and practitioners have a crucial role to play in addressing the health inequities perpetuated by mass incarceration. This includes conducting research to better understand the health needs of incarcerated populations, developing and implementing evidence-based interventions within correctional settings, and advocating for policies that promote the health and dignity of incarcerated individuals.In conclusion, the intersection of public health and prisons in the age of mass incarceration presents complex challenges that require innovative and comprehensive solutions. By prioritizing the health needs of incarcerated individuals and working towards decarceral strategies, public health professionals can contribute to reducing health disparities and promoting social justice. Future research and interventions should focus on addressing the root causes of mass incarceration, improving healthcare delivery within prisons, and developing effective reentry programs to support the health and well-being of formerly incarcerated individuals.", "References": [{"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "The New Press", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in State Prisons", "authors": "Ashley Nellis", "journal": "The Sentencing Project", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Health Effects of Mass Incarceration in the United States", "authors": "Christopher Wildeman, Emily A.
