{"Literature Review": "Physical activity is a crucial component of public health, with well-established benefits for preventing non-communicable diseases and promoting overall well-being. However, the field of physical activity research and promotion has predominantly been shaped by perspectives from high-income countries (HICs), where physical activity is often viewed as a matter of individual choice. This literature review explores the concept of necessity-driven versus choice-based physical activity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of physical activity patterns and their determinants in these contexts. The necessity versus choice framework, as proposed by Adlakha et al. (2020), provides a valuable lens through which to examine physical activity in LMICs. This framework acknowledges that a significant portion of physical activity in these settings is driven by economic necessity rather than personal choice. For instance, active transportation, such as walking or cycling to work, is often the only affordable option for many individuals in LMICs (Salvo et al., 2018). The socioeconomic disparities between HICs and LMICs play a crucial role in shaping physical activity patterns. In HICs, leisure-time physical activity is more prevalent, while in LMICs, occupational and transport-related physical activity dominate (Hallal et al., 2012). This distinction is important because the health benefits associated with different types of physical activity may vary. For example, Holtermann et al. (2018) found that while leisure-time physical activity was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk, occupational physical activity showed no such benefit and, in some cases, was even associated with increased risk. The built environment in LMICs often differs significantly from that in HICs, influencing physical activity patterns. Rapid urbanization in many LMICs has led to environments that may not be conducive to safe and enjoyable physical activity. Oyeyemi et al. (2016) reported that factors such as poor infrastructure, lack of pedestrian facilities, and safety concerns can act as barriers to physical activity in these settings. However, it is important to note that despite these challenges, overall physical activity levels in many LMICs remain higher than in HICs due to necessity-driven activities (Guthold et al., 2018). The necessity versus choice framework also raises important ethical considerations in physical activity promotion. Traditional interventions that focus on individual behavior change may not be appropriate or effective in contexts where physical activity is driven by necessity. Instead, Pratt et al. (2015) argue for a systems approach that addresses the broader social, economic, and environmental determinants of physical activity in LMICs. Gender disparities in physical activity are particularly pronounced in many LMICs, with women often engaging in less physical activity than men (Mielke et al., 2018). This gender gap is often rooted in cultural norms, safety concerns, and unequal distribution of household responsibilities. Addressing these disparities requires gender-sensitive approaches that consider the unique barriers and facilitators of physical activity for women in LMIC contexts. The rapid economic development occurring in many LMICs presents both challenges and opportunities for physical activity promotion. As countries transition from low to middle-income status, there is often a shift towards more sedentary lifestyles, particularly in urban areas. Ng and Popkin (2012) documented this trend across several LMICs, highlighting the need for proactive measures to maintain and promote physical activity during economic transitions. Technology and digital interventions offer promising avenues for physical activity promotion in LMICs. However, as noted by Müller et al. (2016), these approaches must be tailored to local contexts, considering factors such as technology access, literacy levels, and cultural acceptability. Moreover, digital interventions should complement rather than replace efforts to improve the built environment and address socioeconomic determinants of physical activity. Policy interventions play a crucial role in shaping physical activity environments in LMICs. Successful examples include Colombia's Ciclovía program, which closes streets to motorized traffic on Sundays and holidays, promoting active recreation (Sarmiento et al., 2010). Such initiatives demonstrate the potential for innovative, context-specific policies to promote physical activity at the population level. In conclusion, the necessity versus choice framework provides a valuable perspective for understanding and promoting physical activity in LMICs. Future research and interventions should prioritize maintaining high levels of necessity-driven physical activity while simultaneously creating opportunities for safe and enjoyable leisure-time physical activity. This approach requires a multisectoral effort that addresses the broader social, economic, and environmental determinants of physical activity in LMIC contexts. By grounding physical activity promotion efforts in local realities, we can work towards more equitable and effective public health strategies that respect and respond to the unique needs of LMIC populations.", "References": [{"title": "Necessity versus choice: The role of built environments in shaping active living in low- and middle-income countries", "authors": "Deborah Salvo, Rodrigo S.
