{"Literature Review": "The US public health workforce has faced significant challenges over the past two decades, with the situation exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This literature review synthesizes the evidence regarding major challenges that preceded the pandemic and continue to persist, focusing on workforce enumeration, recruitment, and retention issues. Workforce Enumeration and Definition: One of the fundamental challenges in addressing public health workforce issues is the lack of a standardized method for enumerating and defining the workforce. Gebbie et al. (2000) highlighted this problem two decades ago, noting the absence of a comprehensive database of public health workers. This issue persists today, as evidenced by Beck et al. (2014), who found significant variations in how different states define and count their public health workforce. The lack of consistent data makes it difficult to assess workforce needs accurately and plan for future requirements. The challenge of enumeration is further complicated by the diverse nature of public health work. Tilson and Gebbie (2004) emphasized that public health encompasses a wide range of professions and skill sets, making it challenging to define the boundaries of the workforce. This diversity, while a strength in addressing complex health issues, poses difficulties in workforce planning and development. Recruitment Challenges: Recruiting qualified professionals into the public health sector has been an ongoing challenge. Yeager and Wisniewski (2017) identified several factors contributing to recruitment difficulties, including lower salaries compared to the private sector, limited career advancement opportunities, and a lack of awareness about public health careers among students and job seekers. The issue of competitive compensation was also highlighted by Leider et al. (2016), who found that public health workers often earn less than their counterparts in other healthcare sectors. This wage gap makes it challenging to attract top talent, particularly in specialized areas such as epidemiology and health informatics. Another significant recruitment challenge is the aging workforce and the need to attract younger professionals. Sellers et al. (2015) reported that a large proportion of the public health workforce is nearing retirement age, creating an urgent need to recruit and train the next generation of public health professionals. However, attracting younger workers has proven difficult due to factors such as limited job security and perceived lack of innovation in governmental agencies. Retention Issues: Retaining skilled public health workers is equally challenging. Yeager et al. (2016) found that job satisfaction and organizational support were key factors influencing retention in public health agencies. However, budget constraints and bureaucratic structures often limit agencies' ability to provide competitive benefits and create supportive work environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated retention issues. A study by Stone et al. (2021) revealed that many public health workers experienced burnout, mental health challenges, and increased job dissatisfaction during the pandemic, leading to higher turnover rates. This situation has created a vicious cycle where remaining staff face increased workloads, potentially leading to further burnout and attrition. Workforce Development and Training: Addressing the skills gap in the public health workforce is crucial for both recruitment and retention. Koo and Miner (2010) emphasized the need for ongoing professional development and training to keep the workforce current with evolving public health challenges. However, limited resources and time constraints often hinder comprehensive workforce development efforts. The rapid advancement of technology and data analytics in public health has created new skill requirements. Dixon et al. (2015) highlighted the growing need for workers with expertise in health informatics and data analysis, areas where many current public health workers lack formal training. This skills gap presents both a challenge and an opportunity for workforce development initiatives. Future Directions: As the field of public health receives temporary federal investments to rebuild its workforce, it is crucial to address these long-standing challenges strategically. Bogaert et al. (2019) proposed a systems thinking approach to workforce development, emphasizing the need for collaboration between academic institutions, health departments, and policymakers to create sustainable solutions. Innovative approaches to recruitment and retention are also needed. Yeager et al. (2020) suggested leveraging technology and social media to attract younger professionals and create more flexible work environments. Additionally, developing clear career pathways and leadership development programs could help improve retention rates and succession planning. Conclusion: The challenges facing the US public health workforce are complex and deeply rooted. Many issues identified over two decades ago, such as difficulties in workforce enumeration, recruitment, and retention, persist today. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted these challenges while also creating new ones. As the field receives temporary federal investments, it is crucial to address these issues systematically and strategically. By learning from past experiences and embracing innovative approaches, the public health sector can work towards building a robust, skilled, and resilient workforce capable of meeting current and future public health challenges.", "References": [{"title": "The public health workforce: An assessment of capabilities and skills", "authors": "Kristine M.
