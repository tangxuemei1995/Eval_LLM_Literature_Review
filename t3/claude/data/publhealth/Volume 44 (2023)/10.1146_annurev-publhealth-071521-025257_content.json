{"Literature Review": "Paid family and medical leave (PFML) policies have gained increasing attention in recent years as a means to support workers in balancing their professional responsibilities with personal and family health needs. This literature review examines the current state of research on the impacts of PFML on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes.The most extensively studied aspect of PFML is parental leave, particularly its effects on infant and child health. Numerous studies have demonstrated positive outcomes associated with parental leave policies. For instance, Rossin-Slater et al. (2013) found that the implementation of paid family leave in California led to increased breastfeeding rates and duration, which is associated with numerous health benefits for infants. Similarly, Bullinger (2019) reported that paid family leave policies were linked to reduced infant mortality rates, particularly among disadvantaged populations.The benefits of parental leave extend beyond infant health to encompass child development and long-term outcomes. Carneiro et al. (2015) conducted a study in Norway and found that extended paid maternity leave had positive effects on children's educational attainment and earnings in adulthood. These findings suggest that PFML policies can have far-reaching implications for human capital development and intergenerational mobility.Parental health is another area where PFML has shown positive impacts. Chatterji and Markowitz (2012) found that longer maternity leave was associated with decreased depressive symptoms and improved overall mental health among new mothers. Fathers also benefit from paternity leave, with Petts et al. (2020) reporting improved father-child relationships and increased paternal involvement in childcare when fathers took leave.While the evidence for parental leave is robust, research on other types of PFML, such as leave for caring for older children, adult family members, or elderly relatives, is more limited. However, emerging studies suggest similar positive outcomes. For example, Earle and Heymann (2011) found that employees with access to paid leave for family health needs reported better physical and mental health outcomes compared to those without such benefits.The impact of PFML on employers is a critical consideration in policy discussions. Contrary to concerns about potential negative effects on businesses, research generally indicates that PFML does not impose significant burdens on employers. Bartel et al. (2021) surveyed employers in New York following the implementation of a state-wide paid family leave program and found that the majority reported either positive or neutral effects on productivity, profitability, and employee morale.Moreover, PFML policies may offer benefits to employers in terms of employee retention and satisfaction. Appelbaum and Milkman (2011) studied California's paid family leave program and found that it improved employee retention, particularly among low-wage workers. This suggests that PFML could be a valuable tool for employers in reducing turnover costs and maintaining a stable workforce.However, it is important to note that the effects of PFML may vary depending on policy design. Factors such as wage replacement rates, duration of leave, and job protection provisions can influence the uptake and effectiveness of these policies. Bana et al. (2020) analyzed the impact of benefit levels on leave-taking behavior and found that higher wage replacement rates were associated with increased leave uptake, particularly among lower-income workers.While the overall evidence points to the benefits of PFML, there are still gaps in our understanding. More research is needed on the long-term effects of different types of leave beyond parental leave. Additionally, studies examining the optimal duration of leave and the impact of varying policy parameters would be valuable for informing policy design.The international context provides further insights into the potential impacts of PFML policies. Countries with more generous leave policies, such as those in Scandinavia, have demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of gender equality in the workplace and at home. For instance, Duvander and Johansson (2012) found that Sweden's parental leave policy, which includes incentives for fathers to take leave, has contributed to more equitable division of childcare responsibilities.In conclusion, the existing literature strongly supports the positive impacts of PFML on worker health, family well-being, and, to a lesser extent, employer outcomes. While more research is needed to fully understand the effects of different policy designs and types of leave, the evidence suggests that well-designed PFML policies can contribute to improved population health and social outcomes without imposing significant costs on employers. As policymakers continue to debate and implement PFML programs, ongoing research will be crucial in refining our understanding of these complex issues and informing evidence-based policy decisions.", "References": [{"title": "The effects of California's paid family leave program on mothers' leave-taking and subsequent labor market outcomes", "authors": "Maya Rossin-Slater, Christopher J.
