{"Literature Review": "Cancer remains a significant global health burden, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10 million deaths worldwide in 2020 (Sung et al., 2021). While genetic factors play a role in cancer development, a substantial proportion of cancer cases are attributable to modifiable risk factors. This literature review explores the current understanding of cancers attributable to modifiable risk factors and discusses the potential for prevention strategies.Tobacco smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of cancer worldwide. According to a comprehensive analysis by Islami et al. (2018), smoking accounted for 19% of all cancer cases in the United States in 2014. The causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer is well-established, but smoking also increases the risk of numerous other cancers, including those of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and bladder. Despite significant progress in tobacco control measures, smoking remains a major public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.Occupational exposures represent another important modifiable risk factor for cancer. Rushton et al. (2012) estimated that 5.3% of cancer deaths in Britain were attributable to occupational exposures. Asbestos, silica dust, diesel engine exhaust, and various chemical agents have been linked to increased cancer risk. While regulations have improved workplace safety in many countries, the long latency period between exposure and cancer development means that the full impact of historical exposures is still being observed.Infectious agents are responsible for approximately 15% of cancer cases globally, with significant variations across regions (de Martel et al., 2020). Human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Helicobacter pylori are among the most important infectious causes of cancer. Vaccination programs against HPV and hepatitis B have shown promise in reducing cancer incidence, but implementation remains suboptimal in many parts of the world.Air pollution, both outdoor and indoor, is an increasingly recognized risk factor for cancer. Cohen et al. (2017) estimated that ambient particulate matter pollution was responsible for 4.2 million deaths globally in 2015, with a significant proportion due to cancer. While efforts to reduce air pollution have been successful in some regions, rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries present ongoing challenges.Alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for several cancers, including those of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colorectum, and breast. A meta-analysis by Bagnardi et al. (2015) found a dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and cancer risk for most of these sites. Despite this knowledge, alcohol control policies vary widely across countries, and public awareness of the cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption remains low.Diet and obesity have emerged as critical modifiable risk factors for cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (2018) has identified strong evidence linking obesity to increased risk of 12 cancer types. Additionally, dietary factors such as high consumption of red and processed meat, low intake of fruits and vegetables, and high salt intake have been associated with increased cancer risk. However, implementing effective interventions to promote healthy diets and reduce obesity at the population level has proven challenging.While the identification of modifiable risk factors provides opportunities for cancer prevention, translating this knowledge into effective interventions remains a significant challenge. Successful examples of cancer control include the dramatic reductions in lung cancer incidence in countries with comprehensive tobacco control policies (Thun et al., 2012). Similarly, vaccination programs against HPV and hepatitis B have shown promise in reducing the incidence of cervical and liver cancers, respectively (Drolet et al., 2015).However, there have also been notable failures in cancer control efforts. For instance, despite strong evidence linking alcohol consumption to cancer risk, many countries have struggled to implement effective alcohol control policies due to cultural, economic, and political factors. Additionally, the obesity epidemic continues to worsen in many parts of the world, potentially offsetting gains made in other areas of cancer prevention.It is important to note that our understanding of the avoidable causes of cancer remains incomplete. Emerging risk factors, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the gut microbiome, require further investigation. Moreover, the complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors presents challenges in determining the true proportion of cancers attributable to modifiable risk factors.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in identifying modifiable risk factors for cancer, translating this knowledge into effective prevention strategies remains a critical challenge. Future efforts should focus on implementing evidence-based interventions, addressing disparities in cancer prevention, and continuing research to identify new avoidable causes of cancer. By doing so, we can work towards reducing the global burden of this devastating disease.", "References": [{"title": "Global cancer statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries", "authors": "Hyuna Sung, Jacques Ferlay, Rebecca L.
