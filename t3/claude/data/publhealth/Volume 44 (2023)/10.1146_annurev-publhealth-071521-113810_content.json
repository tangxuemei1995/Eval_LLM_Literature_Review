{"Literature Review": "Gentrification, a complex urban phenomenon characterized by the influx of affluent residents and businesses into previously low-income neighborhoods, has become a topic of increasing interest in public health research. This literature review explores the intersection of gentrification and health equity, examining the theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and policy implications of this emerging field of study. The concept of gentrification has evolved since its introduction by Ruth Glass in 1964, with researchers now recognizing it as a multifaceted process involving physical, economic, and social transformations of urban spaces (Lees et al., 2008). In recent years, public health scholars have begun to investigate the potential health impacts of gentrification, particularly on vulnerable populations. This growing body of research reflects a broader recognition of the social determinants of health and the role of neighborhood environments in shaping health outcomes (Marmot et al., 2008). One of the primary challenges in studying the health effects of gentrification is the complexity of the process itself. Gentrification can manifest differently across various contexts, making it difficult to develop standardized measures and compare results across studies. Hwang and Sampson (2014) proposed a multidimensional approach to measuring gentrification, incorporating both demographic and physical changes in neighborhoods. This method has since been adapted and refined by other researchers seeking to capture the nuances of gentrification processes. Despite methodological challenges, emerging evidence suggests that gentrification may have significant implications for health equity. Qualitative studies have provided valuable insights into the lived experiences of long-term residents in gentrifying neighborhoods. For instance, Fullilove and Wallace (2011) documented the psychological distress and social disruption experienced by displaced residents, highlighting the potential mental health consequences of gentrification. Quantitative research on the health effects of gentrification has yielded mixed results, reflecting the complexity of the issue and the diversity of methodological approaches. Some studies have found positive associations between gentrification and certain health outcomes. For example, Gibbons and Barton (2016) reported improvements in self-rated health among residents of gentrifying neighborhoods in New York City. However, these benefits were not equally distributed, with long-term residents experiencing less improvement compared to newcomers. Conversely, other studies have identified negative health consequences associated with gentrification. Izenberg et al. (2018) found that residents of gentrifying neighborhoods in California were more likely to report poor self-rated health and increased stress levels compared to those in non-gentrifying areas. These findings underscore the potential for gentrification to exacerbate health inequities, particularly among vulnerable populations. The mechanisms through which gentrification may impact health are diverse and interconnected. Displacement, a key concern in gentrification research, can lead to the loss of social networks, community resources, and access to healthcare services (Desmond, 2016). Additionally, the stress and uncertainty associated with neighborhood change may contribute to poor mental health outcomes among long-term residents (Lim et al., 2017). To address these challenges, researchers have called for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from urban planning, sociology, and public health. Cole et al. (2019) proposed a conceptual framework that considers gentrification as both a direct exposure and a part of broader neighborhood changes, emphasizing the need to examine multiple pathways through which gentrification may influence health outcomes. As the evidence base grows, policymakers and public health practitioners are increasingly seeking strategies to mitigate the negative health effects of gentrification and promote health equity in urban environments. Zuk et al. (2018) reviewed various policy approaches aimed at preventing displacement and preserving affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods. These strategies include rent control, inclusionary zoning, and community land trusts, among others. Evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions from a public health perspective remains a critical area for future research. Firth et al. (2020) proposed a framework for assessing the health equity impacts of urban regeneration projects, which could be adapted to evaluate anti-gentrification policies. Such evaluations would provide valuable insights into the potential of these interventions to promote health equity in the context of urban change. In conclusion, the study of gentrification and its implications for health equity represents a rapidly evolving field of research. While methodological challenges persist, emerging evidence suggests that gentrification processes may have significant impacts on population health and health disparities. Moving forward, interdisciplinary approaches, refined measurement techniques, and rigorous evaluations of policy interventions will be crucial in advancing our understanding of this complex issue and developing effective strategies to promote health equity in urban environments.", "References": [{"title": "Gentrification: A theoretical and empirical overview", "authors": "Loretta Lees, Tom Slater, Elvin Wyly", "journal": "The Gentrification Reader", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "36", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203940877"}, {"title": "Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health", "authors": "Michael Marmot, Sharon Friel, Ruth Bell, Tanja AJ Houweling, Sebastian Taylor", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2008", "volumes": "372", "first page": "1661", "last page": "1669", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61690-6"}, {"title": "Divergent pathways of gentrification: Racial inequality and the social order of renewal in Chicago neighborhoods", "authors": "Jackelyn Hwang, Robert J.
