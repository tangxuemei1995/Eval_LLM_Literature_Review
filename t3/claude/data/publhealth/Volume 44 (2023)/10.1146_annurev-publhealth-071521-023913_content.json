{"Literature Review": "Digital health technologies have emerged as promising tools to improve healthcare delivery, patient outcomes, and overall population health. However, the potential of these technologies to reduce health inequities remains largely unrealized. This literature review synthesizes current research on digital health equity, exploring the multilevel determinants that influence the adoption and effectiveness of digital health interventions across diverse populations. The concept of digital health equity is rooted in the broader framework of health equity, which aims to eliminate disparities in health outcomes among different population groups. As digital technologies increasingly permeate healthcare systems, it becomes crucial to ensure that these advancements do not exacerbate existing health inequities but rather contribute to their reduction (Crawford & Serhal, 2020). At the policy level, several studies have highlighted the importance of regulatory frameworks and government initiatives in promoting digital health equity. For instance, Weiss et al. (2018) examined how national eHealth policies in various countries addressed issues of equity and found significant variations in their approaches. The authors emphasized the need for explicit equity considerations in policy formulation to ensure that digital health initiatives benefit all population segments equally. System-level factors play a crucial role in determining digital health equity. Healthcare organizations' readiness to adopt and integrate digital health technologies can significantly impact their accessibility and effectiveness. A study by Khatri et al. (2019) explored the organizational barriers to implementing telehealth services in rural areas, identifying factors such as inadequate infrastructure, limited technical support, and resistance to change as key challenges. Community-level determinants of digital health equity encompass social and cultural factors that influence technology adoption and use. Greenhalgh et al. (2017) conducted an extensive ethnographic study on the implementation of a personal electronic health record system in diverse communities. Their findings underscored the importance of considering local contexts, community engagement, and cultural appropriateness in designing and deploying digital health interventions. At the individual level, factors such as digital literacy, socioeconomic status, and health literacy significantly impact digital health equity. A systematic review by Kontos et al. (2014) examined the relationship between various individual-level characteristics and eHealth use. The authors found that higher education, income, and health literacy were consistently associated with greater eHealth adoption and use, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to bridge these gaps. Intervention-level factors, including the design, usability, and cultural relevance of digital health tools, are critical in promoting equity. A study by Brewer et al. (2020) evaluated the effectiveness of a culturally tailored mobile health (mHealth) intervention for diabetes management among African American adults. The authors reported improved health outcomes and user engagement, emphasizing the importance of culturally appropriate design in digital health interventions. To address the multifaceted challenges of digital health equity, researchers have explored various intervention approaches. One promising strategy is the use of community health workers (CHWs) to facilitate digital health adoption. Perzynski et al. (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of CHWs in improving patient portal adoption among underserved populations, highlighting the potential of this approach in bridging the digital divide. Another innovative approach involves the development of inclusive design methodologies for digital health interventions. Valdez et al. (2018) proposed a framework for engaging diverse end-users in the design process, emphasizing the importance of participatory approaches in creating more equitable digital health solutions. Efforts to improve digital literacy and skills among underserved populations have also shown promise. A study by Jacobs et al. (2016) evaluated the impact of a digital literacy training program on eHealth use among older adults, reporting significant improvements in participants' ability to access and use online health information. As the field of digital health equity continues to evolve, several key areas require further attention. First, there is a need for more robust and standardized measures of digital health equity to facilitate comparative research and policy evaluation (Azzopardi-Muscat & Sørensen, 2019). Second, intersectional approaches that consider the complex interplay of multiple social determinants of health are crucial for developing more nuanced and effective interventions (Benda et al., 2020). In conclusion, achieving digital health equity requires a comprehensive, multilevel approach that addresses policy, system, community, individual, and intervention factors. By synthesizing current research and identifying promising interventions, this review provides a foundation for future efforts to leverage digital health technologies in reducing health disparities and promoting equitable health outcomes for all populations.", "References": [{"title": "Digital health equity and COVID-19: the innovation curve cannot reinforce the social gradient of health", "authors": "Alison Crawford, Eva Serhal", "journal": "Journal of Medical Internet Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "22", "first page": "e19361", "last page": "e19361", "DOI": "10.2196/19361"}, {"title": "How are health systems addressing health equity?
