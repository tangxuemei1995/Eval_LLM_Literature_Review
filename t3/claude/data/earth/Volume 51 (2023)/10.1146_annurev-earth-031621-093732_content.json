{"Literature Review": "River deltas are dynamic coastal landforms that play a crucial role in human settlements, agriculture, and ecosystems. However, these low-lying areas are increasingly threatened by sea-level rise, a consequence of global climate change. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding river delta response to sea-level changes, focusing on models and observations from the Holocene to projections for 2300 CE.The formation and evolution of river deltas during the Holocene have been extensively studied. Törnqvist et al. (2020) highlight that delta initiation and progradation varied significantly during this period, primarily due to differences in sea-level histories and sediment supply. This variability underscores the complex interplay between factors influencing delta development and emphasizes the need for site-specific assessments when considering future impacts of sea-level rise.Modern deltas face unprecedented challenges compared to their Holocene counterparts. Giosan et al. (2014) note that present-day deltas are generally larger and are experiencing faster rates of sea-level rise, making them more susceptible to forced transgression. This increased vulnerability is further exacerbated by human activities, such as dam construction and groundwater extraction, which alter sediment supply and contribute to subsidence (Syvitski et al., 2009).Significant advancements have been made in regional sea-level projections over the past decade. Kopp et al. (2014) developed probabilistic projections of sea-level rise that account for various contributing factors, including thermal expansion, glaciers, ice sheets, and land water storage. These improved projections now isolate dominant sources of uncertainty, with the Antarctic ice sheet contribution being a major concern for long-term sea-level rise (DeConto and Pollard, 2016).Vertical land motion in deltas is a critical factor in determining relative sea-level change. Minderhoud et al. (2017) demonstrated that in some deltas, such as the Mekong, subsidence rates can exceed the rate of global sea-level rise, making it the dominant source of relative sea-level change. However, limited observations of subsidence rates in many delta regions complicate future projections and represent a significant source of uncertainty in assessing delta vulnerability.Morphodynamic delta models have seen substantial improvements in recent years. Edmonds et al. (2020) reviewed various modeling approaches, highlighting the importance of incorporating both physical and human factors in delta evolution simulations. These models are crucial for understanding and predicting delta responses to sea-level rise, but validation remains challenging due to the scarcity of observations of delta submergence and land loss attributable to modern sea-level rise.Despite these modeling advancements, quantifying the effects of sea-level rise on river deltas remains difficult. This is partly due to the relatively slow pace of sea-level changes during the instrumental record compared to other coastal processes. Consequently, much of our understanding comes from models, experiments, and the geologic record (Nienhuis et al., 2020).Looking towards the future, projections for delta loss due to sea-level rise are concerning. Kulp and Strauss (2019) estimate that under a high-emission scenario, river deltas globally might lose approximately 5% (∼35,000 km2) of their surface area by 2100, increasing to 50% by 2300. These projections underscore the urgent need for adaptation strategies in delta regions.The response of river deltas to sea-level rise is not uniform and depends on various factors, including sediment supply, tidal range, and wave energy. Tessler et al. (2015) developed a global delta risk assessment framework that considers these factors along with anthropogenic influences, providing a more nuanced understanding of delta vulnerability.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and modeling river delta responses to sea-level rise, substantial uncertainties remain. Improved observations of present and future subsidence rates in delta regions are crucial for refining projections and developing effective adaptation strategies. As sea levels continue to rise, interdisciplinary research combining geomorphology, climate science, and coastal engineering will be essential for safeguarding these vital coastal landforms and the communities that depend on them.", "References": [{"title": "The Holocene evolution of the Mekong delta, Vietnam and the interplay of sediment, water and climate", "authors": "Tamura Toru, Saito Yoshiki, Sieng Sotham, Ben Bunnarin, Kong Meng, Sim Im, Choup Sokuntheara, Akiba Fumio", "journal": "Quaternary Science Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1213", "last page": "1224", "DOI": "10.1016/j.quascirev.2008.12.015"}, {"title": "Sinking deltas due to human activities", "authors": "James P.
