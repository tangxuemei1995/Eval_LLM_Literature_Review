{"Literature Review": "The field of hydrology has undergone significant transformations in recent decades, challenging long-held assumptions about the movement and storage of water in landscapes. This literature review explores the key surprises that have reshaped our understanding of hydrological processes at the hillslope and drainage basin scales, as highlighted in the research topic 'Instructive Surprises in the Hydrological Functioning of Landscapes.' One of the most striking revelations in modern hydrology is the composition of streamflow during storm events. Contrary to the traditional assumption that storm runoff primarily consists of recent precipitation, isotopic tracer studies have consistently shown that even at peak flow, streamwater is predominantly composed of pre-event water that has been stored in the landscape for extended periods. McDonnell et al. (2010) demonstrated that in many catchments, storm runoff can contain up to 80% of water that has resided in the subsurface for weeks, months, or even years. This finding has profound implications for our understanding of flood generation mechanisms and contaminant transport. The concept of 'two water worlds' has emerged as another paradigm-shifting discovery in ecohydrology. Klaus and McDonnell (2013) proposed that streamflow and vegetation water uptake often originate from distinct subsurface water storages. This challenges the assumption of a well-mixed subsurface reservoir and suggests that different seasons' precipitation may supply water to streams and trees. The implications of this phenomenon extend to our understanding of drought resilience, ecosystem functioning, and biogeochemical cycling. The dynamic nature of stream networks has also been revealed through recent research. Godsey and Kirchner (2014) demonstrated that stream networks expand and contract as landscapes wet and dry, a process known as stream network dynamics. This finding contradicts the static representation of stream networks in many hydrological models and has significant implications for water quality management and aquatic ecosystem health. Furthermore, the interaction between surface water and groundwater has been shown to be more complex than previously thought. Numerous studies, such as that by Covino and McGlynn (2007), have revealed that many stream reaches lose flow to underlying aquifers, a process known as streamflow losses. This bidirectional exchange between surface and subsurface waters has important consequences for water resource management and the transport of nutrients and contaminants. The role of landscape heterogeneity in controlling hydrological processes has gained increased recognition. Beven and Germann (2013) highlighted the importance of preferential flow paths, such as macropores and soil pipes, in rapidly transmitting water through the subsurface. This challenges the traditional view of uniform soil matrix flow and has significant implications for our understanding of runoff generation and solute transport. Advances in measurement techniques, particularly in isotope hydrology, have been instrumental in revealing these surprises. For instance, Kirchner (2019) demonstrated how high-frequency isotope sampling can provide unprecedented insights into catchment storage, mixing, and release processes. These new methods have allowed researchers to observe hydrological processes at temporal and spatial scales previously unattainable. The nonlinearity and nonstationarity of hydrological systems have also come to the forefront of research. Milly et al. (2008) argued that the assumption of stationarity in water resource management is no longer valid due to climate change and human modifications of the landscape. This realization has profound implications for water resource planning and flood risk assessment. The integration of ecohydrology with traditional hydrology has led to new insights into the role of vegetation in the water cycle. Tetzlaff et al. (2015) demonstrated how plants actively modify their environment to optimize water use, challenging the view of vegetation as passive participants in the hydrological cycle. Finally, the importance of subsurface topography in controlling water flow paths has been increasingly recognized. Freer et al. (2002) showed that bedrock topography can be more important than surface topography in determining subsurface flow patterns, challenging the use of surface topography alone in hydrological models. In conclusion, these instructive surprises have fundamentally altered our conceptualization of landscape hydrology. They have shifted our perspective from relatively static, homogeneous, linear, and stationary process representations to ones that are predominantly dynamic, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and nonstationary. This evolving understanding has significant implications for water resource management, flood prediction, and ecosystem conservation in a changing world.", "References": [{"title": "How old is streamwater?
