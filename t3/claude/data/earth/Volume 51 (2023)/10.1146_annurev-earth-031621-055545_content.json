{"Literature Review": "Giant impacts play a crucial role in the final stages of planet formation, shaping the composition, structure, and evolution of planetary bodies. These energetic collisions between protoplanets are believed to be responsible for many of the unique characteristics observed in our solar system and beyond. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of giant impacts and their significance in planetary science. The concept of giant impacts as a fundamental process in planet formation has gained widespread acceptance since the proposal of the Moon-forming impact hypothesis (Cameron and Ward, 1976). This seminal work suggested that a Mars-sized impactor collided with the proto-Earth, leading to the formation of the Moon. Since then, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of giant impacts and their diverse outcomes. One of the key aspects of giant impact research is the use of computer simulations to model these complex events. Canup and Asphaug (2001) conducted groundbreaking simulations that supported the Moon-forming impact hypothesis, demonstrating how a glancing blow from a Mars-sized impactor could produce a disk of debris that would eventually coalesce into the Moon. These simulations have been continually refined, with more recent studies by Ćuk and Stewart (2012) proposing alternative scenarios involving a faster-spinning Earth and a smaller impactor. The diversity of giant impact outcomes has been a focus of recent research. Asphaug (2010) reviewed the various possible results of planetary collisions, including merging, hit-and-run events, and mantle stripping. This work highlighted the importance of impact angle and velocity in determining the outcome of a collision. Building on this, Leinhardt and Stewart (2012) developed a comprehensive framework for predicting collision outcomes based on impact parameters, providing a valuable tool for interpreting observational data. The role of giant impacts in shaping planetary compositions has been extensively studied. Marcus et al. (2010) investigated how collisions affect the core-to-mantle ratio of planets, demonstrating that multiple impacts can lead to significant compositional changes. This work has implications for understanding the diverse compositions observed in exoplanetary systems. The thermal consequences of giant impacts have also been a subject of intense research. Nakajima and Stevenson (2015) explored how impacts can induce widespread melting and differentiation in planetary bodies, potentially explaining the formation of magma oceans and their influence on early planetary evolution. These findings have been crucial in understanding the early thermal history of terrestrial planets. Recent advancements in computational power have allowed for more sophisticated simulations of giant impacts. Hosono et al. (2019) utilized high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to investigate the detailed physics of planetary collisions, revealing new insights into the mixing and equilibration processes that occur during these events. These improved simulations have challenged some long-held assumptions about giant impacts and opened new avenues for research. The application of probability theory to giant impact scenarios has emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting planetary formation histories. Jackson et al. (2018) developed a statistical framework for evaluating different impact scenarios, demonstrating how multiple formation pathways can lead to similar final planetary configurations. This approach has been particularly valuable in studying exoplanetary systems where direct observational evidence of impact histories is limited. Laboratory experiments have played a crucial role in validating and informing computer simulations of giant impacts. Jutzi and Asphaug (2011) conducted impact experiments using analogue materials to study the behavior of rubble-pile asteroids during collisions, providing important constraints for numerical models. These experiments have been essential in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world physics. Despite significant progress, many open questions remain in the field of giant impact research. The formation of Mercury, with its anomalously large core, has been attributed to giant impacts, but the exact mechanism is still debated (Asphaug and Reufer, 2014). Similarly, the origin of Mars's crustal dichotomy and the formation of Pluto-Charon system continue to be active areas of research in the context of giant impacts. In conclusion, giant impacts have emerged as a critical process in our understanding of planet formation and evolution. The interplay between computer simulations, theoretical models, and observational data has driven significant advancements in the field. As computational capabilities continue to improve and new observational techniques are developed, our understanding of giant impacts and their role in shaping planetary systems is likely to deepen further. Future research directions may include more detailed studies of the long-term consequences of giant impacts on planetary evolution, the role of impacts in the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, and the application of machine learning techniques to interpret the complex data generated by impact simulations.", "References": [{"title": "Origin of the Moon in a giant impact near the end of the Earth's formation", "authors": "R.
