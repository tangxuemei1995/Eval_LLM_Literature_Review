{"Literature Review": "The InSight mission has revolutionized our understanding of Mars' interior structure and seismic activity, marking a significant milestone in planetary exploration. This literature review synthesizes the key findings and implications of Mars seismology research conducted between 2019 and 2022.The deployment of the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) on Mars has enabled the first comprehensive seismic study of another terrestrial planet. Lognonné et al. (2019) described the SEIS instrument's design and capabilities, highlighting its unprecedented sensitivity in detecting Martian seismic activity. The successful operation of SEIS has led to the detection of 1,319 seismic events, including approximately 90 teleseismic marsquakes with moment magnitudes (Mw) ranging from 2.5 to 4.7 (Banerdt et al., 2020).One of the most intriguing discoveries is the concentration of seismic activity in the Cerberus Fossae region. Giardini et al. (2020) analyzed the spatial distribution of marsquakes and concluded that this area exhibits active regional tectonics, potentially linked to ongoing geological processes. This finding challenges previous assumptions about Mars' tectonic quiescence and suggests that the planet may still be geologically active in certain regions.The detection of seismic waves generated by meteorite impacts has provided valuable insights into Mars' crustal structure and impact dynamics. Daubar et al. (2020) reported on the first seismically detected impacts on Mars, including at least six events with associated craters larger than 130 meters in diameter. These impact-generated seismic signals offer a unique opportunity to study both the Martian subsurface and the physics of hypervelocity impacts in a new planetary environment.The analysis of seismic data has led to groundbreaking revelations about Mars' interior structure. Khan et al. (2021) utilized direct and secondary body wave phase travel times, receiver functions, and surface wave analysis to construct the first comprehensive interior models of Mars. Their findings provide crucial information on crustal thickness, mantle structure, and core properties. Stähler et al. (2021) further refined these models, presenting evidence for a large, liquid core with a radius of approximately 1,830 km.The InSight mission has also enabled comparative seismology studies between Mars, Earth, and the Moon. Knapmeyer-Endrun et al. (2021) compared the seismic characteristics of these three bodies, highlighting similarities and differences in their seismic wave propagation and attenuation properties. This comparative approach has enhanced our understanding of planetary evolution and the factors influencing seismic activity on terrestrial bodies.In addition to deep interior studies, the InSight mission has provided valuable data on Mars' shallow subsurface structure. Lognonné et al. (2020) analyzed pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe to develop detailed subsurface models in the vicinity of the lander. These findings contribute to our understanding of Mars' near-surface geology and have implications for future exploration and potential human missions.The seismic data collected by InSight has also shed light on Mars' thermal structure. Plesa et al. (2022) used seismic observations to constrain the thickness of Mars' thermal lithosphere, providing insights into the planet's thermal evolution and current heat flow. This information is crucial for understanding Mars' geodynamics and the potential for past or present habitability.The success of the InSight mission in detecting and characterizing Martian seismic activity has opened new avenues for planetary seismology. Clinton et al. (2021) discussed the implications of these findings for future Mars missions and the potential for long-term seismic monitoring on other planetary bodies. The lessons learned from InSight are expected to inform the design and implementation of seismic experiments on future missions to the Moon, Venus, and other celestial bodies.In conclusion, the Mars seismology research conducted through the InSight mission has dramatically advanced our understanding of the Red Planet's interior structure, seismic activity, and geological processes. These findings not only provide crucial insights into Mars' formation and evolution but also contribute to the broader field of comparative planetology. As the analysis of InSight data continues and future missions build upon its success, our knowledge of Mars and other terrestrial planets is poised to expand even further, potentially reshaping our understanding of planetary formation and evolution in the solar system.", "References": [{"title": "SEIS: Insight's Seismic Experiment for Internal Structure of Mars", "authors": "Philippe Lognonné, William B.
