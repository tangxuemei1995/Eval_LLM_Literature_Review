{"Literature Review": "The role of terrestrial plants in shaping Earth's environment throughout deep time has been a subject of increasing interest in recent years. As primary producers and key players in biogeochemical cycles, plants have significantly influenced the planet's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and climate. This literature review explores the emerging field of quantitative reconstruction of extinct plant function and its integration into ecosystem and Earth system models to better understand vegetation-climate interactions in deep time.Traditionally, studies of paleo-vegetation and its impact on ancient climates have relied heavily on modern plant analogs to represent extinct ecosystems. However, this approach has limitations, as plant physiology has evolved considerably over time, and many ancient plant species have no clear modern counterparts. Recognizing these constraints, researchers have developed new methods to reconstruct paleo-plant function more accurately.One of the key advancements in this field is the application of plant functional traits and strategies to characterize extinct plants. Boyce and Zwieniecki (2019) proposed a framework for understanding the evolution of plant hydraulics, emphasizing the importance of considering extinct plant anatomy in the context of ecological and evolutionary theory. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how ancient plants may have responded to and influenced their environments.The late Paleozoic era, particularly the Carboniferous and Permian periods, has been a focus of many recent studies due to its unique vegetation and climate dynamics. Wilson et al. (2020) used a combination of fossil evidence and physiological modeling to reconstruct the function of arborescent lycopsids, dominant plants in Carboniferous tropical wetlands. Their findings suggested that these plants had significantly different water use strategies compared to modern trees, potentially altering hydrological cycles in ways not captured by modern analogs.Expanding on this work, Richey et al. (2021) integrated reconstructed plant hydraulic traits into a land surface model to simulate the impact of Carboniferous forests on climate. Their results indicated that the unique hydraulic properties of these ancient plants led to different patterns of evapotranspiration and surface energy balance compared to simulations using modern plant functional types.The application of these new approaches is not limited to tropical environments. McElwain et al. (2018) investigated the function of high-latitude plants during the Permian-Triassic transition, a period of significant climate change and mass extinction. By combining fossil evidence with ecophysiological modeling, they demonstrated that changes in plant function played a crucial role in amplifying climate warming during this period.As these methods for reconstructing extinct plant function have advanced, researchers have begun to incorporate them into state-of-the-art Earth system models. Lenton et al. (2018) used a trait-based approach to represent early land plants in an Earth system model, demonstrating the potential for significant climate impacts even from relatively simple vegetation. Their work highlighted the importance of considering the unique properties of ancient plants when modeling past climates.Building on these efforts, Franks and Beerling (2021) developed a more comprehensive representation of Paleozoic plant functional types for use in Earth system models. Their approach incorporated reconstructed traits related to photosynthesis, water use, and nutrient cycling, allowing for a more mechanistic representation of vegetation-climate feedbacks in deep time.The integration of reconstructed plant function into models has also shed new light on long-standing paleoclimatic puzzles. For example, Feulner (2017) used an Earth system model with reconstructed Carboniferous vegetation to investigate the causes of late Paleozoic glaciations. Their results suggested that changes in plant function and distribution played a more significant role in driving climate cooling than previously recognized.While these advancements have greatly improved our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time, challenges remain. Peppe et al. (2018) highlighted the need for better integration of paleobotanical data with climate proxy records to constrain model simulations and improve our understanding of plant-environment feedbacks over geological timescales.In conclusion, the development of quantitative methods for reconstructing extinct plant function, combined with their integration into ecosystem and Earth system models, represents a significant advance in our ability to understand vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. These approaches offer new insights into how plants have shaped Earth's environment throughout its history and provide a framework for exploring the potential impacts of future vegetation changes on climate. As this field continues to evolve, it promises to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between plants and climate, both in the past and in the face of ongoing global change.", "References": [{"title": "Evolution of plant hydraulics", "authors": "C.
