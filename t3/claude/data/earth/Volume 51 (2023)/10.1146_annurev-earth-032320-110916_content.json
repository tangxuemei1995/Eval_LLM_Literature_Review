{"Literature Review": "Iceberg calving, the process by which ice breaks off from glaciers or ice sheets, is a critical component in understanding sea-level rise and global climate change. This literature review explores the current state of knowledge on iceberg calving regimes and transitions, highlighting key findings and areas of uncertainty.Calving is a complex process influenced by various factors, including ice dynamics, environmental conditions, and topography. Recent studies have shown that calving rates are primarily controlled by ice flow to the margin rather than fracturing processes (Benn et al., 2017). This finding challenges earlier assumptions about the dominance of fracture mechanics in calving events and emphasizes the importance of understanding ice dynamics in predicting calving behavior.The classification of calving into distinct regimes has emerged as a useful framework for studying this phenomenon. Five main calving regimes have been identified, each characterized by specific environmental and glaciological conditions (Bassis and Walker, 2012). These regimes tend to be persistent and relatively insensitive to small perturbations in ice velocity, characteristics, or environmental forcing. This stability allows for more accurate predictions of calving behavior within each regime.One of the most studied calving regimes is that of marine-terminating glaciers, which are particularly sensitive to climate change. Joughin et al. (2008) demonstrated that warming ocean temperatures can accelerate ice flow and increase calving rates in Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers. Similarly, Rignot et al. (2013) showed that the retreat of Antarctic ice shelves due to basal melting can lead to increased calving and ice discharge.While the behavior within calving regimes is relatively well understood, transitions between regimes remain a significant source of uncertainty in sea-level rise projections. These transitions can occur rapidly and may be triggered by large perturbations in environmental conditions or ice dynamics. For example, DeConto and Pollard (2016) proposed that the collapse of Antarctic ice shelves could lead to a rapid transition to a new calving regime, potentially causing dramatic sea-level rise.The study of past climate events has provided valuable insights into potential future regime transitions. Wise et al. (2017) used paleoclimate data to reconstruct past ice sheet behavior, revealing evidence of rapid transitions between calving regimes during periods of climate change. This deep-time perspective highlights the potential for abrupt changes in ice sheet dynamics under warming conditions.Observational studies have made significant progress in understanding current calving processes. Amundson et al. (2010) used time-lapse photography and seismic data to study calving events at Jakobshavn Isbræ in Greenland, providing detailed insights into the mechanics of large-scale calving. However, the rarity of observed regime transitions, particularly those most relevant to sea-level rise, remains a challenge for researchers.To address these knowledge gaps, process-based models have been developed to simulate calving behavior across different regimes. Åström et al. (2014) introduced a particle-based model that can reproduce a wide range of calving styles, from small-scale events to large ice shelf disintegration. These models, when combined with observational data and paleoclimate records, offer a promising approach to improving predictions of future calving behavior and associated sea-level rise.The importance of accurately representing calving in climate models cannot be overstated. Failure to do so may lead to significant underestimation of sea-level rise under warming scenarios. Edwards et al. (2019) demonstrated that incorporating improved calving parameterizations in ice sheet models can substantially increase projections of sea-level contribution from Antarctica.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding iceberg calving regimes, major uncertainties remain, particularly regarding regime transitions. Future research should focus on integrating observational studies, process-based modeling, and paleoclimate data to improve our ability to predict calving behavior and its implications for sea-level rise. This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for developing more accurate projections of ice sheet response to climate change and informing adaptation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Marine ice sheet collapse potentially under way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica", "authors": "Joughin, Ian and Smith, Benjamin E. and Medley, Brooke", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "344", "first page": "735", "last page": "738", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1249055"}, {"title": "Ice-cliff failure via retrogressive slumping", "authors": "Bassis, Jeremy N. and Walker, Catherine C.", "journal": "Geology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "40", "first page": "4", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.1130/G32869.1"}, {"title": "Calving laws, sliding laws and the stability of tidewater glaciers", "authors": "Benn, Douglas I. and Åström, Jan and Zwinger, Thomas and Todd, Joe and Nick, Faezeh M. and Cook, Sue and Hulton, Nicholas R.
