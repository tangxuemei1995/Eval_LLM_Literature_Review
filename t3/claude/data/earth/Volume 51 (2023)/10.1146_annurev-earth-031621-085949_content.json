{"Literature Review": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool in geochemistry and paleoclimatology over the past two decades. This technique utilizes the temperature-dependent preference of heavy isotopes of carbon and oxygen to bond with each other in carbonate minerals, providing a robust method for reconstructing formation temperatures independent of the parent fluid composition. The development and application of this method have significantly advanced our understanding of Earth's climate history, crustal processes, and carbonate mineralization environments. The foundation of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry lies in the measurement of multiply-substituted isotopologues, particularly 13C18O16O2^2- in carbonate minerals. Eiler and Schauble (2004) first proposed the theoretical basis for this technique, demonstrating that the abundance of these isotopologues relative to their stochastic distribution is temperature-dependent. This discovery paved the way for subsequent analytical developments and calibrations. Ghosh et al. (2006) provided the first experimental calibration of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer, establishing a relationship between the Δ47 value and carbonate formation temperature. This groundbreaking work opened up new possibilities for paleoclimate reconstructions and diagenetic studies. Since then, numerous calibration studies have refined and extended the temperature range of the method. For instance, Bonifacie et al. (2017) developed a unified calibration applicable from 0 to 350°C, significantly expanding the utility of the technique for both low-temperature and high-temperature geological applications. The analytical precision of carbonate clumped isotope measurements has improved dramatically over the years. Advances in mass spectrometry techniques, such as those described by Dennis et al. (2011), have enabled measurements with precisions approaching 0.01‰ for Δ47. This level of precision translates to temperature uncertainties of 1-2°C for many geological applications, making the method competitive with traditional paleothermometers. While Δ47 measurements have been the primary focus of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, recent studies have explored the potential of other isotopologue systems. Fiebig et al. (2019) investigated the Δ48 signal in carbonates, which provides complementary temperature information and may offer insights into kinetic fractionation processes. Additionally, the development of laser spectroscopy techniques for measuring Δ638 in CO2 derived from carbonates, as demonstrated by Sakai et al. (2017), presents an alternative analytical approach that could potentially simplify and expedite clumped isotope analyses. The applications of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry have been diverse and impactful. In paleoclimatology, this method has provided new constraints on past climate conditions. For example, Henkes et al. (2018) used clumped isotope thermometry on fossil brachiopod shells to reconstruct sea surface temperatures during the end-Permian mass extinction, offering insights into the environmental conditions associated with this major biotic crisis. In the field of diagenesis and fluid-rock interactions, clumped isotope thermometry has proven invaluable for unraveling the thermal and fluid history of sedimentary basins. Lloyd et al. (2017) applied this technique to carbonate cements in sandstones, revealing complex diagenetic histories and fluid migration patterns that were previously difficult to constrain. The method has also found applications in tectonic and structural geology. For instance, Bergman et al. (2013) used clumped isotope thermometry to study the thermal evolution of fault zones, providing new insights into the mechanics of faulting and the thermal anomalies associated with earthquake processes. In the realm of biomineralization, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has shed light on the formation conditions of biogenic carbonates. Eagle et al. (2013) applied this technique to dinosaur eggshells, offering new perspectives on the body temperatures of extinct organisms and their reproductive strategies. Despite its many successes, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry faces ongoing challenges. One key area of research is understanding and mitigating the effects of solid-state reordering of C-O bonds at elevated temperatures over geological timescales. Stolper and Eiler (2015) provided a theoretical framework for this process, which has important implications for the interpretation of clumped isotope data from ancient and deeply buried carbonates. As the field continues to mature, new frontiers are emerging. The integration of clumped isotope data with other geochemical and geological information promises to provide more comprehensive reconstructions of past environments and geological processes. Furthermore, the application of this technique to extraterrestrial carbonates, such as those found in Martian meteorites, opens up exciting possibilities for understanding the climate history of other planets. In conclusion, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has revolutionized our ability to reconstruct past temperatures and fluid compositions in a wide range of geological settings. As analytical techniques continue to improve and new applications are explored, this method is poised to make even greater contributions to our understanding of Earth's climate system, crustal processes, and the environments in which carbonate minerals form.", "References": [{"title": "13C–18O bonds in carbonate minerals: A new kind of paleothermometer", "authors": "John M.
