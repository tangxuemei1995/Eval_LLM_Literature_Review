{"Literature Review": "Estella Atekwana's autobiographical notes provide a compelling narrative of her journey from a young girl in Cameroon to a pioneering geophysicist and academic leader. Her story intersects with several important themes in geosciences, including the development of biogeophysics, continental rift tectonics, diversity in academia, and the challenges faced by dual-career couples in scientific fields.Atekwana's contributions to the field of biogeophysics have been groundbreaking. Biogeophysics, an interdisciplinary field that combines geophysics with microbiology and geochemistry, has gained significant attention in recent years. Atekwana's work has been instrumental in establishing this subdiscipline within geophysics. For instance, Abdel Aal et al. (2004) demonstrated the use of induced polarization measurements to detect microbial activity in porous media, a technique that has since become fundamental in biogeophysics research. This study, co-authored by Atekwana, highlighted the potential of geophysical methods in understanding microbial processes in the subsurface.The field of biogeophysics has continued to evolve, with applications ranging from environmental remediation to the search for life on other planets. Atekwana's research has contributed significantly to this growth. In a review by Revil et al. (2012), the authors discuss the various geophysical signatures of microbial activity in porous media, citing several of Atekwana's works and emphasizing their importance in the field.Parallel to her work in biogeophysics, Atekwana has maintained an international research program in continental rift tectonics. Continental rifts are areas where the Earth's crust and lithosphere are being pulled apart, and they play a crucial role in understanding plate tectonics and the formation of new ocean basins. Atekwana's research in this area has contributed to our understanding of these complex geological processes. For example, Katumwehe et al. (2015) investigated the lithospheric structure beneath the Albertine and Rhino grabens in the Ugandan sector of the East African Rift System, providing insights into the rifting process and its implications for petroleum exploration.Atekwana's career path also highlights the challenges and opportunities for diversity in geosciences. As the first Black woman in many spaces, her experiences reflect broader issues of representation in STEM fields. Bernard and Cooperdock (2018) analyzed forty years of data on geoscience Ph.D. recipients in the United States and found that racial and ethnic minorities remain severely underrepresented in the field. Their study underscores the importance of role models like Atekwana in inspiring and mentoring the next generation of diverse geoscientists.The issue of diversity in geosciences extends beyond race and ethnicity. Marín-Spiotta et al. (2020) discuss the prevalence of sexual harassment in the geosciences and its impact on career trajectories, particularly for women and minorities. Atekwana's success in navigating these challenges while championing student success and diversity initiatives provides valuable insights for addressing these systemic issues.Atekwana's experience as part of a dual-career couple in academia is another significant aspect of her story. The challenges faced by dual-career couples in scientific fields have been well-documented. Woolstenhulme et al. (2015) surveyed over 3,000 scientists and found that dual-career couples often face significant compromises in their career choices, with women more likely to make sacrifices for their partner's career. Atekwana's success in this context provides an important example of how these challenges can be navigated.The emphasis on student success and mentorship in Atekwana's career aligns with growing recognition of the importance of these factors in scientific education and career development. Hernandez et al. (2018) found that mentorship experiences were crucial for the persistence of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields. Atekwana's commitment to mentoring students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, likely played a significant role in enhancing diversity in the geosciences.Atekwana's transition from research to administration as a dean is also noteworthy. This career trajectory reflects broader trends in academic leadership. Gonzales and Rincones (2012) explored the experiences of women of color in academic leadership positions, highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities they face. Atekwana's journey to becoming a dean provides valuable insights into these dynamics.In conclusion, Estella Atekwana's autobiographical notes offer a rich tapestry of experiences that intersect with many critical issues in geosciences and academia. Her pioneering work in biogeophysics and continental rift tectonics has significantly advanced these fields. Moreover, her journey as a Black woman in geosciences, her navigation of a dual-career academic path, and her commitment to diversity and student success provide important perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in scientific careers. Atekwana's story serves as an inspiration and a roadmap for future generations of diverse scientists, while also highlighting areas where further progress is needed in making geosciences and academia more inclusive and equitable.", "References": [{"title": "Induced polarization measurements on unconsolidated sediments from a site of active hydrocarbon biodegradation", "authors": "Gamal Z.
