{"Literature Review": "The study of fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes is a critical aspect of understanding earthquake mechanics and the energy partitioning that occurs during seismic events. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the subject, drawing from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies.Earthquakes are complex phenomena that involve the propagation of ruptures along geological faults. These faults typically consist of a meter-thick fault core surrounded by damage zones extending hundreds of meters (Chester et al., 1993). The energy released during an earthquake is partitioned into various forms, including radiated seismic waves and energy dissipated within the fault zone through fracture and frictional processes (Kanamori and Rivera, 2006).A key concept in earthquake mechanics is fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (Wb), which represents the energy dissipated during rupture propagation along a fault. This energy is crucial for understanding fault dynamic weakening and the processes that govern rupture propagation at different scales. Numerous studies have shown that fracture energy scales with fault slip, indicating a complex relationship between energy dissipation and the magnitude of an earthquake (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005).At the microscale, constant fracture energies play a role in the fracturing of individual grains within the fault zone. However, these material-dependent energies become negligible when considering the macroscale processes that govern rupture propagation on natural faults (Cocco and Tinti, 2008). This scale-dependent behavior highlights the importance of considering both micro- and macroscale processes when studying earthquake mechanics.The structure of fault zones has a significant impact on the energy dissipation during earthquakes. The presence of damage zones surrounding the fault core influences the distribution of stress and strain during rupture propagation (Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009). These damage zones can act as energy sinks, absorbing a portion of the released energy and potentially affecting the overall energy budget of an earthquake.Dynamic weakening mechanisms play a crucial role in earthquake propagation and energy dissipation. These mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, can lead to significant reductions in fault strength during slip, facilitating the propagation of large earthquakes (Di Toro et al., 2011). Understanding these weakening processes is essential for accurately estimating fracture energy and breakdown work in natural fault systems.Seismological studies have provided valuable insights into fracture energy estimates for large earthquakes. By analyzing seismic wave radiation and ground motion data, researchers have been able to constrain the energy budget of earthquakes and estimate the proportion of energy dissipated as fracture energy (Ide and Aochi, 2005). These studies have consistently shown that fracture energy increases with earthquake magnitude, supporting the idea that larger earthquakes involve more complex rupture processes and energy dissipation mechanisms.Numerical modeling has also played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of fracture energy and breakdown work. Simulations of earthquake ruptures have allowed researchers to explore the relationships between fault properties, rupture dynamics, and energy dissipation (Okubo et al., 2019). These models have helped to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale experiments and observations of natural earthquakes, providing insights into the scaling of fracture energy with fault slip.Geological studies of exhumed fault zones have provided direct evidence of the processes involved in energy dissipation during earthquakes. Observations of fault rock textures, mineralogy, and structural features have revealed the complex interplay between fracturing, frictional heating, and fluid-rock interactions that contribute to the overall fracture energy (Griffith et al., 2010). These studies have highlighted the importance of considering the entire fault zone, including the damage zone, when estimating energy dissipation during earthquakes.Laboratory experiments have been instrumental in quantifying the fracture energy associated with rock failure and frictional sliding. High-velocity friction experiments have revealed the importance of dynamic weakening mechanisms in controlling the energy dissipation during slip (Niemeijer et al., 2012). These experiments have also provided insights into the scaling of fracture energy with slip distance, supporting observations from natural earthquakes.Despite significant advances in our understanding of fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes, several challenges remain. The energy budget of an earthquake continues to be a subject of debate, with contributions from different disciplines required to unravel this complex issue. Future research should focus on integrating observations and models across different scales, from laboratory experiments to large-scale field studies, to develop a more comprehensive understanding of energy partitioning during earthquakes.In conclusion, the study of fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes has revealed the complex nature of energy dissipation in fault zones. The scaling of fracture energy with fault slip highlights the importance of considering macroscale processes in earthquake mechanics. As our understanding of fault zone structure, dynamic weakening mechanisms, and rupture dynamics continues to improve, we can expect further refinements in our estimates of fracture energy and its role in the overall energy budget of earthquakes.", "References": [{"title": "Fault zone architecture and permeability structure", "authors": "Chester, Frederick M. and Evans, James P. and Biegel, Ronald L.", "journal": "Geology", "year": "1993", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1025", "last page": "1028", "DOI": "10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<1025:FZAAPS>2.3.CO;2"}, {"title": "Energetics of large earthquakes and tsunamis", "authors": "Kanamori, Hiroo and Rivera, Luis", "journal": "Geophysical Journal International", "year": "2006", "volumes": "166", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02899.x"}, {"title": "Earthquake source scaling relationships from -1 to 5 ML using seismograms recorded at 2.5-km depth", "authors": "Abercrombie, Rachel E. and Rice, James R.", "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth", "year": "2005", "volumes": "110", "first page": "B12302", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1029/2005JB003960"}, {"title": "Scale dependence in the dynamics of earthquake propagation: Evidence from seismological and geological observations", "authors": "Cocco, Massimo and Tinti, Elisa", "journal": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "year": "2008", "volumes": "273", "first page": "123", "last page": "131", "DOI": "10.1016/j.epsl.2008.06.025"}, {"title": "The structure of fault zones and their influence on rock physical properties", "authors": "Mitchell, Thomas M. and Faulkner, Daniel R.", "journal": "Geological Society, London, Special Publications", "year": "2009", "volumes": "321", "first page": "67", "last page": "87", "DOI": "10.1144/SP321.4"}, {"title": "Natural and experimental evidence of melt lubrication of faults during earthquakes", "authors": "Di Toro, Giulio and Han, Raehee and Hirose, Takehiro and De Paola, Nicola and Nielsen, Stefan and Mizoguchi, Kazuo and Ferri, Fabio and Cocco, Massimo and Shimamoto, Toshihiko", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "471", "first page": "494", "last page": "498", "DOI": "10.1038/nature09838"}, {"title": "Fracture energy of earthquakes and its scaling", "authors": "Ide, Satoshi and Aochi, Hideo", "journal": "Geophysical Research Letters", "year": "2005", "volumes": "32", "first page": "L19302", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1029/2005GL023941"}, {"title": "Earthquake source parameters for dynamic rupture simulation", "authors": "Okubo, Kurama and Bhat, Harsha S. and Rougier, Esteban and Marty, Sylvie and Schubnel, Alexandre and Lei, Zhou and Knight, Earl E. and Klinger, Yann", "journal": "Pure and Applied Geophysics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "176", "first page": "3983", "last page": "3997", "DOI": "10.1007/s00024-019-02228-x"}, {"title": "Granular mechanics in the dynamic rupture of exhumed faults: Evidence for paleoseismic asperity formation", "authors": "Griffith, W.
