{"Literature Review": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized DNA repair mechanism that preferentially addresses damage in actively transcribed genes. This process, first discovered in mammalian cells, has since been observed across various organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and humans. TCR is characterized by the accelerated repair of lesions on the transcribed strand compared to the non-transcribed strand within active genes. This literature review aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying TCR, its significance in maintaining genomic integrity, and recent advancements in our understanding of this crucial process.The discovery of TCR can be traced back to the seminal work of Hanawalt and Mellon in 1987, who observed preferential repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in actively transcribed genes of mammalian cells [1]. This finding sparked extensive research into the molecular basis of TCR across various organisms. In prokaryotes, particularly Escherichia coli, the Mfd protein (mutation frequency decline) was identified as the key player in TCR [2]. Mfd acts as a translocase that recognizes RNA polymerase stalled at DNA lesions and recruits nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins to the site of damage.In eukaryotes, the process is more complex, involving multiple proteins and regulatory mechanisms. The Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein, a functional analog of Mfd, plays a central role in mammalian TCR [3]. CSB, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, is recruited to sites of stalled RNA polymerase II and facilitates the assembly of the NER machinery. Additionally, the Cockayne syndrome A (CSA) protein, part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CSB, regulating the TCR process [4].Recent studies have shed light on the intricate molecular mechanisms of TCR. Cryo-electron microscopy has provided structural insights into the interactions between stalled RNA polymerase, DNA lesions, and repair factors [5]. These studies have revealed conformational changes in the transcription machinery that enable the recruitment of repair proteins and the exposure of the DNA lesion for repair.Single-molecule analysis techniques have further elucidated the dynamics of TCR. Real-time observations of Mfd-mediated TCR in E. coli have shown that Mfd can actively displace stalled RNA polymerase, allowing access to the DNA lesion for repair proteins [6]. Similar studies in eukaryotic systems have revealed the ATP-dependent translocation activity of CSB along DNA, providing insights into its role in remodeling stalled transcription complexes [7].The importance of TCR in maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutagenesis has been well-established. In E. coli, mutations in the mfd gene lead to increased damage-induced mutagenesis, highlighting the role of TCR in preserving genetic information [8]. In humans, defects in TCR genes, particularly CSA and CSB, result in Cockayne syndrome, a severe disorder characterized by neurological abnormalities, premature aging, and extreme UV sensitivity [9].Interestingly, recent research has uncovered unexpected connections between TCR and other cellular processes. For instance, studies in mammalian cells have revealed a link between TCR and the circadian clock. The core circadian clock protein BMAL1 has been shown to modulate the expression of TCR factors, suggesting a temporal regulation of DNA repair capacity [10].While significant progress has been made in understanding TCR, several questions remain. The complete reconstitution of the TCR process in vitro has only been achieved in E. coli, highlighting the complexity of the eukaryotic system. Furthermore, the absence of an obvious TCR translocase in Drosophila, despite the presence of TCR, suggests alternative mechanisms that warrant further investigation.In conclusion, TCR represents a fascinating example of the intricate interplay between DNA repair and transcription. As our understanding of its molecular mechanisms continues to grow, so does our appreciation for its critical role in maintaining genomic integrity. Future research, employing advanced techniques such as genome-wide sequencing and high-resolution imaging, promises to unravel the remaining mysteries of this essential repair pathway and potentially reveal new therapeutic targets for disorders associated with defective TCR.", "References": [{"title": "Preferential DNA repair in expressed genes", "authors": "Mellon, Isabel and Spivak, Graciela and Hanawalt, Philip C.", "journal": "Environmental Health Perspectives", "year": "1987", "volumes": "76", "first page": "146", "last page": "155", "DOI": "10.1289/ehp.8776146"}, {"title": "Escherichia coli Mfd protein couples transcription and DNA repair", "authors": "Selby, Christopher P. and Sancar, Aziz", "journal": "Nature", "year": "1993", "volumes": "366", "first page": "416", "last page": "419", "DOI": "10.1038/366416a0"}, {"title": "The DNA repair protein CSB is a sensor of oxidative DNA damage", "authors": "Spivak, Graciela and Hanawalt, Philip C.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2006", "volumes": "103", "first page": "16652", "last page": "16657", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0607380103"}, {"title": "CSA-dependent degradation of CSB by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway establishes a link between complementation factors of the Cockayne syndrome", "authors": "Groisman, Regina and Polanowska, Jolanta and Kuraoka, Isao and Sawada, Jun-ichi and Saijo, Masafumi and Drapkin, Ronny and Kisselev, Alexei F. and Tanaka, Kiyoji and Nakatani, Yoshihiro", "journal": "Genes & Development", "year": "2003", "volumes": "17", "first page": "994", "last page": "1004", "DOI": "10.1101/gad.1074103"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structures of transcription-repair coupling and DNA repair", "authors": "Wang, Dongye and Zhu, Qi and Zhang, Zhihui and Xu, Rui-Ming", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "308", "last page": "322", "DOI": "10.1038/s41580-020-0227-y"}, {"title": "Single-molecule dynamics of transcription-coupled repair", "authors": "Fan, Jinsheng and Leroux-Coyau, Mathilde and Savery, Nigel J. and Strick, Terence R.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "535", "first page": "234", "last page": "237", "DOI": "10.1038/nature18291"}, {"title": "ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by the Cockayne syndrome B DNA repair-transcription-coupling factor", "authors": "Citterio, Elisabetta and Van Den Boom, Vincent and Schnitzler, Gavin and Kanaar, Roland and Bonte, Edgar and Kingston, Robert E. and Hoeijmakers, Jan H.
