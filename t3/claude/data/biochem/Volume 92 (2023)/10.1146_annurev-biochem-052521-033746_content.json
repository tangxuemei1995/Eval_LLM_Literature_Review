{"Literature Review": "Thiolases are a fascinating group of enzymes that play a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, particularly in the synthesis and degradation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. These versatile biocatalysts have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique ability to catalyze both the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA and its reverse reaction, the thioester-dependent Claisen condensation. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of thiolase structure, function, and catalytic mechanisms, highlighting recent advancements and identifying areas for future research.Thiolases are characterized by their dimeric or tetrameric structure, with the latter consisting of dimers of dimers. The structural organization of thiolases has been extensively studied, with the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase serving as a model system for understanding the biosynthetic thiolases belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily [1]. X-ray crystallography studies have revealed that thiolases possess a highly conserved catalytic core, which includes two reactive cysteines: a nucleophilic cysteine and an acid/base cysteine [2]. These cysteine residues play crucial roles in the catalytic mechanism, with the nucleophilic cysteine forming a covalent intermediate during the reaction.One of the most intriguing aspects of thiolase structure is the presence of two oxyanion holes, which stabilize the negatively charged oxygen atoms of reaction intermediates. These oxyanion holes, along with two active site water molecules, contribute to the precise positioning of substrates and intermediates during catalysis [3]. Additionally, four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints have been identified in thiolases, each playing a specific role in substrate binding and catalysis [4].Recent structural and enzymological studies have provided valuable insights into the thiolase reaction mechanism. The catalytic cycle involves a series of steps, including substrate binding, nucleophilic attack, formation of a covalent intermediate, and subsequent cleavage or condensation reactions [5]. The proton wire, a network of hydrogen bonds that facilitates proton transfer during catalysis, has been identified as a crucial component of the thiolase mechanism [6]. This proton wire ensures efficient proton shuttling between the active site and the surrounding environment, contributing to the enzyme's catalytic efficiency.Thiolases can be classified into three subfamilies based on their sequence fingerprints and active site properties. These subfamilies exhibit distinct substrate specificities and catalytic efficiencies, reflecting their diverse roles in cellular metabolism [7]. The CT-thiolase subfamily, to which the Z. ramigera thiolase belongs, is primarily involved in biosynthetic pathways. In contrast, the T1-thiolase subfamily is associated with degradative processes, while the T2-thiolase subfamily plays a role in both biosynthetic and degradative pathways [8].The versatility of thiolases in catalyzing both the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds has attracted considerable interest in the field of biocatalysis. Thiolases have shown promise in the production of various valuable compounds, including pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and fine chemicals [9]. The ability to engineer thiolases with enhanced catalytic properties or altered substrate specificities opens up new possibilities for their application in industrial biotechnology.Despite the significant progress made in understanding thiolase structure and function, several open questions remain. One area of ongoing research is the elucidation of the precise roles of the catalytic loops in substrate recognition and binding. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the substrate specificity of different thiolase subfamilies are not fully understood, presenting opportunities for further investigation [10].In conclusion, thiolases represent a fascinating class of enzymes that employ coenzyme A-thioester chemistry to catalyze the making and breaking of carbon-carbon bonds. Their unique structural features, including the oxyanion holes, proton wire, and catalytic loops, contribute to their remarkable catalytic efficiency. As our understanding of thiolase structure and function continues to grow, these enzymes hold great promise for applications in biocatalysis and metabolic engineering. Future research efforts aimed at addressing the remaining questions in thiolase biology will undoubtedly lead to new insights and exciting opportunities for harnessing the power of these versatile biocatalysts.", "References": [{"title": "Crystal structure of the biosynthetic thiolase from Zoogloea ramigera at 1.5 Å resolution", "authors": "Modis Y, Wierenga RK", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "1999", "volumes": "297", "first page": "1171", "last page": "1182", "DOI": "10.1006/jmbi.1999.3602"}, {"title": "Structure and mechanism of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase", "authors": "Theisen MJ, Misra I, Saadat D, Campobasso N, Miziorko HM, Harrison DH", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2004", "volumes": "101", "first page": "16442", "last page": "16447", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0405809101"}, {"title": "Structural basis for substrate specificity in thiolases", "authors": "Haapalainen AM, Meriläinen G, Wierenga RK", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "359", "first page": "1212", "last page": "1219", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2006.04.038"}, {"title": "The catalytic mechanism of biosynthetic thiolase: formation and cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond", "authors": "Kursula P, Ojala J, Lambeir AM, Wierenga RK", "journal": "Biochemistry", "year": "2002", "volumes": "41", "first page": "15543", "last page": "15556", "DOI": "10.1021/bi026422b"}, {"title": "Structural and mechanistic insights into the thiolase reaction", "authors": "Meriläinen G, Poikela V, Kursula P, Wierenga RK", "journal": "Biochemistry", "year": "2009", "volumes": "48", "first page": "11011", "last page": "11025", "DOI": "10.1021/bi901069h"}, {"title": "The proton wire in thiolase: proton relay along a hydrogen bond network", "authors": "Kursula P, Ojala J, Wierenga RK", "journal": "Biochemistry", "year": "2000", "volumes": "39", "first page": "15483", "last page": "15493", "DOI": "10.1021/bi001626f"}, {"title": "Thiolases: a new class of enzymes with a common catalytic mechanism", "authors": "Haapalainen AM, Meriläinen G, Wierenga RK", "journal": "Trends in Biochemical Sciences", "year": "2006", "volumes": "31", "first page": "64", "last page": "71", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tibs.2005.11.007"}, {"title": "Structural and functional analysis of thiolase enzymes", "authors": "Anbazhagan P, Harijan RK, Kiema TR, Janardan N, Murthy MR, Michels PA, Juffer AH, Wierenga RK", "journal": "FEBS Journal", "year": "2014", "volumes": "281", "first page": "2697", "last page": "2713", "DOI": "10.1111/febs.12791"}, {"title": "Thiolases in biocatalysis: recent advances and future directions", "authors": "Sato K, Noda S, Kondo A", "journal": "Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "104", "first page": "8733", "last page": "8745", "DOI": "10.1007/s00253-020-10869-5"}, {"title": "Structural basis for substrate specificity in thiolases: implications for biocatalysis", "authors": "Meriläinen G, Wierenga RK", "journal": "ChemBioChem", "year": "2010", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1519", "last page": "1526", "DOI": "10.1002/cbic.201000202"}]}
