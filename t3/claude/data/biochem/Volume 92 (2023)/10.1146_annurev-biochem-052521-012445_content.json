{"Literature Review": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, playing a pivotal role in transcript maturation, stability, and function. This complex process involves the coordinated action of multiple protein factors that cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription through protein dephosphorylation. Recent advances in structural biology and biochemical reconstitution have provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying this essential process.At the core of 3′-end processing is the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans, or cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast. These large multiprotein complexes orchestrate the various enzymatic activities required for proper 3′-end formation. Shi et al. (2009) demonstrated that CPSF recognizes the highly conserved AAUAAA polyadenylation signal in the pre-mRNA, which is crucial for precise cleavage site selection. This recognition is mediated by the CPSF30 subunit, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy studies conducted by Sun et al. (2018).The endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA is a key step in 3′-end processing. Mandel et al. (2006) identified CPSF73 as the endonuclease responsible for this cleavage, providing a major breakthrough in understanding the catalytic core of the 3′-end processing machinery. Subsequent structural studies by Clerici et al. (2018) elucidated the mechanism by which CPSF73 cleaves the pre-mRNA, revealing a zinc-dependent active site that coordinates the cleavage reaction.Following cleavage, the addition of a poly(A) tail is catalyzed by poly(A) polymerase (PAP). The length of this tail is tightly regulated to ensure uniform tail lengths across transcripts upon nuclear export. Eckmann et al. (2011) showed that the nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1) plays a crucial role in controlling poly(A) tail length by stimulating PAP activity and promoting the release of the polyadenylated mRNA once the tail reaches a specific length.The coupling of 3′-end processing to transcription termination is another critical aspect of this process. Proudfoot (2011) reviewed the extensive evidence supporting the 'torpedo' model of transcription termination, where cleavage of the nascent RNA triggers the recruitment of the 5′-3′ exonuclease Xrn2/Rat1, which then degrades the downstream RNA and dislodges RNA polymerase II. This model highlights the intricate relationship between 3′-end processing and transcription regulation.Recent studies have also shed light on the regulation of alternative polyadenylation (APA), a mechanism that allows genes to produce multiple mRNA isoforms with different 3′ ends. Tian and Manley (2017) reviewed the widespread occurrence of APA and its impact on gene expression, emphasizing its role in various biological processes and disease states. The selection of alternative polyadenylation sites can significantly influence mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency, adding another layer of complexity to gene regulation.The importance of 3′-end processing in development and disease has become increasingly apparent. Mayr and Bartel (2009) demonstrated that cancer cells often express mRNAs with shortened 3′ UTRs due to alternative polyadenylation, leading to increased protein production of oncogenes. This finding underscores the potential therapeutic implications of targeting 3′-end processing machinery in cancer treatment.Despite significant progress in understanding 3′-end processing, many questions remain unanswered. For instance, the precise mechanisms by which different regulatory factors modulate cleavage site selection and poly(A) tail length in response to cellular signals are not fully understood. Additionally, the role of RNA secondary structure in 3′-end processing and how it influences the accessibility of cis-acting elements to the processing machinery requires further investigation.In conclusion, the 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a highly sophisticated and regulated process that plays a crucial role in gene expression. Recent structural and biochemical studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, but many aspects remain to be elucidated. Future research in this field will undoubtedly continue to reveal the intricate details of 3′-end processing and its impact on cellular function, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with aberrant mRNA processing.", "References": [{"title": "Molecular architecture of the human pre-mRNA 3′ processing complex", "authors": "Yadong Sun, Yixiao Zhang, Keith Hamilton, James L.
