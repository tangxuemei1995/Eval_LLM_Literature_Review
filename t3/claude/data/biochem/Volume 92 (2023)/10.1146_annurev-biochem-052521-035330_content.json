{"Literature Review": "The field of RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), has experienced a significant surge in research interest over the past decade. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the proteins involved in writing, reading, and erasing these modifications, with a focus on m6A, the most abundant internal mRNA modification.The discovery of m6A writers, the proteins responsible for depositing this modification, has been crucial in understanding the dynamics of RNA modifications. The methyltransferase complex METTL3-METTL14 was identified as the primary m6A writer [1]. This heterodimeric complex works in conjunction with other proteins, including WTAP, which acts as a regulatory subunit [2]. Subsequent studies have revealed additional components of the writer complex, such as VIRMA and RBM15/15B, which contribute to the specificity and efficiency of m6A deposition [3].The identification of m6A erasers, enzymes capable of removing the modification, has challenged the initial perception of m6A as a static mark. FTO was the first m6A demethylase to be discovered, followed by ALKBH5 [4]. These findings have led to a more dynamic view of the epitranscriptome, where m6A levels can be fine-tuned through the balanced activities of writers and erasers. Recent studies have also suggested that these demethylases may have broader substrate specificities, potentially affecting other RNA modifications [5].The function of m6A is largely mediated through reader proteins, which recognize and bind to modified transcripts. The YTH domain family, including YTHDF1-3 and YTHDC1-2, was initially identified as the primary class of m6A readers [6]. These proteins have been implicated in various aspects of mRNA metabolism, including splicing, export, stability, and translation. For instance, YTHDF2 has been shown to promote mRNA decay, while YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 are thought to enhance translation [7].However, our understanding of reader protein functions has evolved significantly. Recent studies have challenged the distinct roles initially attributed to different YTHDF proteins, suggesting a more complex and potentially redundant system [8]. Additionally, non-YTH domain proteins, such as IGF2BP1-3 and HNRNPA2B1, have been identified as m6A readers, expanding the repertoire of proteins that can interpret this modification [9].The development of transcriptome-wide mapping techniques has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of m6A distribution and dynamics. Methods such as MeRIP-seq and miCLIP have revealed that m6A is enriched near stop codons and in 3' UTRs, and often occurs within a DRACH (D = A, G, or U; R = A or G; H = A, C, or U) consensus motif [10]. These tools have also facilitated the study of m6A in various biological contexts, including development, stem cell differentiation, and disease progression.While m6A has been the primary focus of epitranscriptomics research, other RNA modifications are gaining attention. For example, N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and pseudouridine (Ψ) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in mRNA. The writers, readers, and erasers for these modifications are being actively investigated, revealing a complex interplay between different types of RNA modifications.Despite significant progress, many questions remain unanswered in the field of RNA modifications. The precise mechanisms by which reader proteins mediate the effects of m6A are still not fully understood. Additionally, the potential crosstalk between different RNA modifications and how they collectively contribute to gene regulation requires further investigation. The role of RNA modifications in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer and neurological disorders, is an active area of research with potential therapeutic implications.In conclusion, the study of mRNA modifications, particularly m6A, has revealed a new layer of gene regulation that adds complexity to our understanding of RNA biology. The proteins involved in writing, reading, and erasing these modifications play crucial roles in shaping the epitranscriptome and influencing various aspects of RNA metabolism. As the field continues to evolve, integrating findings from different RNA modifications and exploring their functions in diverse biological contexts will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of epitranscriptomic regulation.", "References": [{"title": "METTL3-METTL14 complex is a novel RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase", "authors": "Ping Liu, Boxuan Simen Zhao, Chuan He", "journal": "Nature Chemical Biology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "10", "first page": "93", "last page": "95", "DOI": "10.1038/nchembio.1432"}, {"title": "WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase", "authors": "Jianzhao Liu, Yanan Yue, Dali Han, Xiao Wang, Ye Fu, Liang Zhang, Guifang Jia, Miao Yu, Zhike Lu, Xin Deng, Qing Dai, Weizhong Chen, Chuan He", "journal": "Cell Research", "year": "2014", "volumes": "24", "first page": "177", "last page": "189", "DOI": "10.1038/cr.2014.3"}, {"title": "RBM15 and RBM15B are regulators of the METTL3 complex and m6A levels in mRNA", "authors": "Phillip J.
