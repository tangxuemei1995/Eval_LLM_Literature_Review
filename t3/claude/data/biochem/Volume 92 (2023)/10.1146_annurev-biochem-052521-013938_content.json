{"Literature Review": "The field of genome editing has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with the emergence of DNA-editing enzymes as powerful tools for precise genetic modifications. This review focuses on the design and application of these enzymes as base editors, highlighting their potential to revolutionize genetic research and therapeutic interventions.Base editors, derived from various DNA-editing enzymes, have gained significant attention due to their ability to introduce targeted point mutations and modulate gene expression without causing double-strand breaks. These tools have been developed by repurposing and engineering existing enzymes, including deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases, to achieve programmable DNA modifications at specific genomic loci.One of the most widely studied classes of base editors are cytosine base editors (CBEs), which utilize cytidine deaminases to convert C•G base pairs to T•A. Komor et al. (2016) pioneered the development of CBEs by fusing a cytidine deaminase to a catalytically impaired Cas9 nickase. This groundbreaking work demonstrated the feasibility of precise base editing without inducing double-strand breaks, opening up new possibilities for gene therapy and functional genomics studies.Building upon this foundation, researchers have made significant strides in improving the efficiency and specificity of CBEs. Nishida et al. (2016) reported the development of Target-AID, a fusion of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) with Cas9 nickase, which exhibited enhanced editing efficiency in yeast and mammalian cells. Furthermore, Gehrke et al. (2018) engineered an evolved version of the human APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase, resulting in a highly efficient and specific base editor with reduced off-target effects.Adenine base editors (ABEs) represent another important class of base editors, capable of converting A•T base pairs to G•C. Gaudelli et al. (2017) made a significant breakthrough by evolving a tRNA adenosine deaminase to accept DNA as a substrate, creating the first ABE. This development expanded the repertoire of possible base transitions, enabling researchers to address a broader range of genetic mutations.The application of base editors has extended beyond simple nucleotide substitutions. Methyltransferases have been repurposed to achieve targeted DNA methylation, a crucial epigenetic modification. Lei et al. (2017) developed a programmable DNA methyltransferase by fusing the catalytic domain of the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A with a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9). This tool enabled precise manipulation of DNA methylation patterns, providing valuable insights into gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms.Conversely, DNA demethylases have been engineered to achieve targeted demethylation. Xu et al. (2016) created a fusion protein combining the catalytic domain of TET1 (ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1) with dCas9, allowing for site-specific DNA demethylation. This approach has proven valuable for studying the functional consequences of DNA methylation and its role in gene expression regulation.Glycosylases, enzymes involved in DNA repair, have also been repurposed as base editors. Kwon et al. (2017) developed a glycosylase base editor by fusing the DNA glycosylase NEIL3 with Cas9 nickase, enabling the targeted conversion of 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine to unmodified cytosine. This tool has provided new insights into the dynamics of DNA demethylation and the functional roles of oxidized cytosine derivatives.The engineering efforts behind these base editors showcase the remarkable plasticity of enzymes and the power of directed evolution. Researchers have employed various strategies to optimize base editor performance, including rational design, structure-guided engineering, and high-throughput screening. For instance, Koblan et al. (2018) used phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) to evolve an ABE with substantially improved editing efficiency and expanded targeting scope.As the field of base editing continues to advance, researchers are addressing challenges such as improving editing precision, reducing off-target effects, and expanding the range of targetable sequences. Chen et al. (2019) developed a novel base editor architecture using a Cas9 fusion with both cytidine and adenine deaminases, enabling simultaneous C-to-T and A-to-G edits within a single target site.The applications of base editors span a wide range of fields, from basic research to potential therapeutic interventions. In agriculture, base editors have been used to introduce precise genetic modifications in crops, as demonstrated by Zong et al. (2017) in their successful application of base editing in rice and wheat. In the medical field, base editors show promise for correcting disease-causing point mutations. For example, Villiger et al. (2018) used an ABE to correct a mutation associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in human cells.In conclusion, the design and application of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors represent a significant advancement in genome engineering technology. The collective engineering efforts to repurpose and refine these enzymes have resulted in powerful tools for precise genetic modifications. As research in this field continues to progress, base editors are poised to play an increasingly important role in understanding gene function, developing improved crops, and potentially treating genetic disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage", "authors": "Alexis C.
