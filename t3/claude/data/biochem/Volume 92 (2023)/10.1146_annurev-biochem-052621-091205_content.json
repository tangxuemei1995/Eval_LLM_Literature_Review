{"Literature Review": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a ubiquitous environmental stressor that poses significant threats to cellular integrity and genomic stability. The primary mechanism by which UV light damages DNA is through the formation of bulky lesions, predominantly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs). These lesions, if left unrepaired, can lead to mutations, cell death, and various pathological conditions, including cancer. To counteract this threat, cells have evolved sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms, with nucleotide excision repair (NER) being the primary pathway for removing UV-induced DNA damage. NER is a versatile repair system that can recognize and remove a wide variety of DNA lesions, including those induced by UV radiation. This pathway is divided into two distinct subpathways: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). While both subpathways converge on a common repair mechanism, they differ in their initial damage recognition steps. GG-NER, as its name suggests, operates throughout the genome and is responsible for detecting and repairing lesions in non-transcribed regions and the non-transcribed strand of active genes. The key players in GG-NER damage recognition are the XPC-RAD23B complex and the UV-DDB complex, which consists of DDB1 and DDB2 (XPE) proteins. These complexes scan the genome for helix-distorting lesions and initiate the repair process by recruiting other NER factors. TC-NER, on the other hand, is specifically dedicated to repairing lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. This subpathway is initiated when RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls upon encountering a DNA lesion during transcription. The stalled RNAPII serves as a damage sensor and triggers the recruitment of TC-NER-specific factors, including Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA, and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA). CSB, a member of the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, plays a crucial role in TC-NER initiation. Upon RNAPII stalling, CSB is rapidly recruited to the damage site and facilitates the assembly of other repair factors. Recent studies have shown that CSB undergoes a conformational change upon binding to stalled RNAPII, which is essential for its function in TC-NER. CSA, a WD40 repeat protein, forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with DDB1 and Cul4A. This complex is recruited to the damage site in a CSB-dependent manner and is involved in the ubiquitination of various TC-NER factors, including CSB itself. The ubiquitination of CSB by the CSA complex has been shown to regulate its stability and function in TC-NER. UVSSA is a more recently identified player in TC-NER. It acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the interaction between CSA and RNAPII. UVSSA also recruits the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7, which counteracts the CSA-mediated ubiquitination of CSB, thereby fine-tuning the TC-NER process. The interplay between these TC-NER factors and their regulation through post-translational modifications, particularly ubiquitination, highlights the complexity of this repair pathway. Recent studies have revealed that the ubiquitination of RNAPII itself plays a crucial role in determining the fate of the stalled polymerase, either promoting its degradation or facilitating repair and transcription restart. Following the initial recognition steps, both GG-NER and TC-NER converge on a common repair mechanism. This involves the recruitment of the TFIIH complex, which unwinds the DNA around the lesion, followed by the incision of the damaged strand by XPG and XPF-ERCC1 endonucleases. The resulting gap is then filled by DNA polymerases and sealed by DNA ligase. UV-induced DNA damage not only triggers repair mechanisms but also elicits a broader transcriptional response. This response involves the activation of various signaling cascades, including the p53 pathway, which regulates cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair gene expression. Additionally, the ATR-Chk1 pathway is activated in response to UV-induced replication stress, further contributing to the cellular response to DNA damage. Recent studies have also revealed a phenomenon known as the 'transcription-priority repair' model, where TC-NER preferentially repairs lesions in highly transcribed genes. This prioritization ensures the rapid restoration of essential cellular functions and highlights the intricate relationship between transcription and DNA repair. Defects in NER components can lead to severe genetic disorders, most notably xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). XP is characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light and a high predisposition to skin cancer, primarily due to mutations in GG-NER factors. CS, on the other hand, is caused by mutations in TC-NER genes (CSA or CSB) and is characterized by developmental abnormalities, neurodegeneration, and premature aging, in addition to UV sensitivity. The study of these diseases has provided valuable insights into the importance of NER in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. Moreover, it has highlighted the complex interplay between DNA repair, transcription, and cellular metabolism, opening new avenues for research in the field of genome maintenance and disease prevention. In conclusion, the intricate mechanisms of TC-NER and its coordination with transcription represent a fascinating area of research in molecular biology. As our understanding of these processes continues to grow, so does the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting DNA repair pathways in various diseases, including cancer and aging-related disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Nucleotide excision repair: from E. coli to man", "authors": "Orlando D.
