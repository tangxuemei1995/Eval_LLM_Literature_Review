{"Literature Review": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) is a crucial enzyme in the global carbon cycle, responsible for the fixation of atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. This literature review explores the function, evolution, and engineering efforts related to rubisco, with a focus on understanding its limitations and potential for improvement.Rubisco's function in carbon fixation is central to photosynthesis and, by extension, to life on Earth. The enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) with CO2, forming two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) [1]. This reaction is the primary entry point of inorganic carbon into the biosphere, making rubisco the most abundant protein on Earth. Despite its importance, rubisco is notoriously inefficient, with a low turnover rate and a tendency to catalyze a competing oxygenation reaction that leads to photorespiration [2].The evolution of rubisco has been a subject of intense study. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that rubisco exists in several forms across different organisms, with Form I being the most common in plants and cyanobacteria [3]. The enzyme's structure consists of eight large subunits and eight small subunits in plants, while some prokaryotes have simpler forms. Evolutionary studies suggest that rubisco originated in methanogenic archaea and diversified as it was transferred to other organisms through endosymbiotic events [4].One of the most intriguing aspects of rubisco's evolution is its apparent lack of improvement over time. This phenomenon has been termed the 'rubisco paradox' [5]. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this paradox, including trade-offs between catalytic rate and CO2 specificity, and adaptation to specific environmental conditions. For instance, rubisco from C4 plants typically has a higher catalytic rate but lower CO2 specificity compared to C3 plants, reflecting their different carbon concentrating mechanisms [6].The structure-function relationship of rubisco has been extensively studied to understand its catalytic mechanism and limitations. Crystal structures have revealed the active site architecture and the conformational changes that occur during catalysis [7]. These studies have shown that the enzyme undergoes significant conformational changes during catalysis, which may contribute to its slow turnover rate. Additionally, the large subunit contains a flexible loop that acts as a lid over the active site, influencing substrate binding and product release [8].Given rubisco's central role in carbon fixation and its limitations, there have been numerous attempts to engineer the enzyme for improved performance. These efforts have employed various strategies, including directed evolution, rational design, and hybrid approaches. One notable success was the engineering of cyanobacterial rubisco to function in plants, resulting in improved carbon fixation rates [9]. However, many attempts to improve rubisco have faced challenges due to the complexity of its catalytic mechanism and its interactions with other cellular components.Recent advances in synthetic biology and genome editing techniques have opened new avenues for rubisco engineering. CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been used to modify rubisco genes in plants, allowing for more precise and efficient modifications [10]. Additionally, the development of in vitro directed evolution systems has enabled the rapid screening of large libraries of rubisco variants.In conclusion, rubisco remains a critical target for improving photosynthetic efficiency and, by extension, crop yields and carbon sequestration. While its evolutionary history and complex catalytic mechanism present challenges, ongoing research in structural biology, enzyme engineering, and synthetic biology offer promising approaches to overcome these limitations. Future work in this field will likely focus on integrating rubisco improvements with other photosynthetic enhancements and adapting engineered variants to diverse environmental conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Structure and function of rubisco", "authors": "Robert J.
