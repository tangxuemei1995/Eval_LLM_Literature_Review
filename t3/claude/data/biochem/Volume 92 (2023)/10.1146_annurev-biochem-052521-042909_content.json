{"Literature Review": "Muscle contraction is a fundamental biological process essential for movement and cardiac function. The structural biochemistry underlying this process has been a subject of intense research for decades, with recent advancements in high-resolution imaging techniques providing unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms involved.The sliding filament theory, first proposed by Huxley and Hanson in 1954, remains the cornerstone of our understanding of muscle contraction. This theory posits that muscle contraction occurs through the sliding of thin actin filaments past thick myosin filaments, driven by the cyclic interaction of myosin heads with actin. Recent structural studies have significantly refined our understanding of this process at the molecular level.The thin filament, composed primarily of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and troponin, plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have revealed the detailed structure of F-actin, showing how actin monomers assemble into a double-stranded helical filament. Murakami et al. (2010) provided a near-atomic resolution structure of F-actin, elucidating the precise interactions between actin subunits and the conformational changes associated with ATP hydrolysis.Tropomyosin, which wraps around the actin filament, acts as a gatekeeper for myosin binding. Von der Ecken et al. (2015) used cryo-EM to determine the structure of F-actin decorated with tropomyosin, revealing how tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites on actin in the absence of calcium. This structural insight has been crucial in understanding the regulatory role of tropomyosin in muscle contraction.The troponin complex, consisting of troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T, is the calcium sensor of the thin filament. Takeda et al. (2003) determined the crystal structure of the core domain of human cardiac troponin, providing insights into how calcium binding to troponin C leads to conformational changes that ultimately allow myosin binding to actin. More recently, Yamada et al. (2020) used cryo-EM to visualize the entire thin filament, including the troponin complex, in different calcium-bound states, further elucidating the calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction.The thick filament, composed primarily of myosin, has also been the subject of intense structural investigation. Myosin II, the primary motor protein in muscle, consists of two heavy chains and four light chains. The globular head of myosin, containing the motor domain, is responsible for force generation through its interaction with actin. Houdusse et al. (2016) provided a comprehensive review of myosin structures, highlighting how different conformational states of myosin correspond to different stages of the ATPase cycle and force generation.The mechanism of force generation through actin-myosin interactions has been further clarified by recent structural studies. Mentes et al. (2018) used cryo-EM to determine the structure of the actomyosin complex in different nucleotide states, providing a structural basis for the power stroke mechanism. These studies have revealed how conformational changes in the myosin motor domain, coupled with ATP hydrolysis, drive the sliding of actin filaments.Calcium regulation of muscle contraction involves not only the thin filament proteins but also membrane-associated proteins such as the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The DHPR, located in the T-tubule membrane, acts as a voltage sensor and triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the RyR. Wu et al. (2016) determined the structure of the skeletal muscle RyR1 using cryo-EM, providing insights into the mechanism of calcium release. More recently, Zhao et al. (2019) elucidated the structure of DHPR, shedding light on its voltage-sensing mechanism and its interaction with RyR.The advent of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has allowed researchers to visualize the three-dimensional organization of muscle proteins in their native cellular context. Burbaum et al. (2021) used cryo-ET to study the arrangement of myosin filaments in intact muscle fibers, revealing new details about the super-relaxed state of myosin and its implications for muscle regulation.These structural insights have significant implications for understanding muscle diseases, particularly cardiomyopathies. Many mutations associated with cardiomyopathies affect proteins involved in muscle contraction. For example, Spudich et al. (2016) reviewed how mutations in myosin can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, linking structural alterations to functional consequences.In conclusion, recent advances in structural biology, particularly cryo-EM and cryo-ET, have revolutionized our understanding of muscle contraction at the molecular level. These techniques have provided unprecedented details of the structures of key muscle proteins and their interactions, offering new insights into the mechanisms of force generation and regulation. As we continue to refine our structural understanding of muscle contraction, we can expect further breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of muscle-related diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Near-atomic resolution of actin filaments", "authors": "Keiichi Murakami, Takuo Yasunaga, Toshiro Noguchi, Yuichiro Gomibuchi, Kien X.
