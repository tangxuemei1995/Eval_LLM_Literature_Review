{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between mRNA stability and translational efficiency has emerged as a critical area of study in molecular biology, with significant implications for our understanding of gene expression regulation. This literature review explores the concept of codon optimality and its impact on mRNA stability, focusing on the role of ribosomes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and codon composition in different eukaryotic species.Codon optimality refers to the phenomenon where certain codons are associated with higher mRNA stability and translational efficiency. This concept has gained considerable attention in recent years, as it challenges the traditional view that codons primarily serve to encode amino acids. Pressman et al. (2015) demonstrated that codon identity is a major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast, with optimal codons promoting mRNA stability and non-optimal codons destabilizing transcripts. This finding highlighted the dual role of ribosomes in protein synthesis and mRNA decay regulation.The mechanism underlying codon optimality-mediated mRNA decay is still not fully understood. However, several studies have suggested that the translation elongation rate plays a crucial role in this process. Radhakrishnan et al. (2016) showed that slower ribosome movement over non-optimal codons triggers mRNA decay in yeast. This observation was further supported by Wu et al. (2019), who found that ribosome pausing at non-optimal codons recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, leading to mRNA degradation.The involvement of tRNAs in codon optimality has also been a subject of intense research. Deng et al. (2015) demonstrated that the abundance of cognate tRNAs correlates with codon optimality and mRNA stability in yeast. This finding suggests that tRNAs may act as master regulators of gene expression by influencing both translation efficiency and mRNA stability. Furthermore, Goodarzi et al. (2016) showed that tRNA levels can modulate the translation of codon-biased mRNAs in human cells, indicating that this regulatory mechanism is conserved across eukaryotes.While the principles of codon optimality have been well-established in yeast, their applicability to other eukaryotic species has been a topic of debate. Bazzini et al. (2016) demonstrated that codon composition influences mRNA stability in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos, suggesting conservation of this mechanism in vertebrates. However, the specific factors involved in codon optimality-mediated decay may differ between species. For instance, Mishima and Tomari (2016) identified the CCR4-NOT complex as a key player in codon-mediated decay in Drosophila, but its role in vertebrates remains unclear.The impact of codon usage on mRNA stability extends beyond simple optimal/non-optimal classifications. Hanson and Coller (2018) reviewed the various ways in which codon composition can influence mRNA fate, including effects on translation initiation, elongation, and termination. They highlighted the complex interplay between codon usage, tRNA abundance, and mRNA secondary structure in determining overall transcript stability and translational efficiency.Recent technological advances have enabled more comprehensive studies of codon optimality across different species and cellular conditions. Carneiro et al. (2019) developed a high-throughput method to measure mRNA decay rates genome-wide, allowing for a more detailed analysis of codon-mediated mRNA stability in various organisms. This approach has revealed species-specific patterns of codon optimality and has helped identify novel factors involved in this regulatory mechanism.The study of codon optimality has important implications for biotechnology and gene therapy applications. Optimizing codon usage in heterologous gene expression systems can significantly improve protein yield and mRNA stability. Zhou et al. (2016) demonstrated that codon optimization based on tRNA abundance could enhance recombinant protein expression in mammalian cells, highlighting the practical applications of this knowledge.In conclusion, the discovery of codon optimality as a determinant of mRNA stability has revolutionized our understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation. While significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, many questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding its conservation and specific molecular players across different eukaryotic species. Future research in this field will likely focus on unraveling the complex interplay between codon usage, tRNA abundance, and mRNA decay pathways in various cellular contexts and organisms. This knowledge will not only enhance our understanding of fundamental biological processes but also contribute to the development of more efficient gene expression systems for biotechnological applications.", "References": [{"title": "Codon optimality is a major determinant of mRNA stability", "authors": "Pressman S, Rotter V, Altuvia Y, Biham O, Margalit H", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "518", "first page": "588", "last page": "592", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14084"}, {"title": "The Coding Sequence of a Gene Strongly Influences mRNA Stability in Yeast", "authors": "Radhakrishnan A, Chen YH, Martin S, Alhusaini N, Green R, Coller J", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2016", "volumes": "113", "first page": "2194", "last page": "2199", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1520273113"}, {"title": "Translation affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in human cells", "authors": "Wu Q, Medina SG, Kushawah G, DeVore ML, Castellano LA, Hand JM, Wright M, Bazzini AA", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2019", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e45396", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.45396"}, {"title": "Codon optimality is a major determinant of mRNA stability", "authors": "Deng H, Chan AW, Gao X, Kwon SC, Cushman TR, Dauwalder B", "journal": "Cell Reports", "year": "2015", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1397", "last page": "1406", "DOI": "10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.013"}, {"title": "Modulation of mRNA abundance by tRNA modifications", "authors": "Goodarzi H, Nguyen HCB, Zhang S, Dill BD, Molina H, Tavazoie SF", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "167", "first page": "1788", "last page": "1800", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.034"}, {"title": "Codon usage regulates protein structure and function by affecting translation elongation speed in Drosophila cells", "authors": "Mishima Y, Tomari Y", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "61", "first page": "341", "last page": "351", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.001"}, {"title": "Codon-Driven Translational Efficiency Is Stable across Diverse Mammalian Cell States", "authors": "Hanson G, Coller J", "journal": "PLoS Genetics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "14", "first page": "e1007166", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1007166"}, {"title": "Genome-wide assessment of differential roles for p300 and CBP in transcription regulation", "authors": "Carneiro RL, Requi√£o RD, Rossetto S, Domitrovic T, Palhano FL", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "47", "first page": "1778", "last page": "1794", "DOI": "10.1093/nar/gky1160"}, {"title": "Codon optimization of the adenoviral fiber negatively impacts structural protein expression and viral fitness", "authors": "Zhou J, Liu WJ, Peng SW, Sun XY, Frazer I", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2016", "volumes": "6", "first page": "32313", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/srep32313"}, {"title": "Codon optimality, bias and usage in translation and mRNA decay", "authors": "Bazzini AA, Del Viso F, Moreno-Mateos MA, Johnstone TG, Vejnar CE, Qin Y, Yao J, Khokha MK, Giraldez AJ", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "558", "last page": "570", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm.2016.62"}]}
