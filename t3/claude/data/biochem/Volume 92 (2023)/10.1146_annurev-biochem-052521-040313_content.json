{"Literature Review": "The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis across metazoan species. This pathway has been the subject of extensive research due to its involvement in various developmental processes and its implications in human diseases, including cancer. A particularly intriguing aspect of HH signaling is its intricate relationship with cholesterol, which is involved in multiple steps of the signaling process. This literature review aims to explore the inseparable connection between cholesterol and HH signaling, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of this relationship.The HH pathway was first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster through genetic screens for embryonic patterning defects (Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980). Subsequent studies revealed that the pathway is highly conserved across species, with mammalian homologs playing critical roles in vertebrate development (Ingham and McMahon, 2001). The HH ligand undergoes a unique post-translational modification process, which involves the covalent attachment of a cholesterol molecule to its C-terminus (Porter et al., 1996). This cholesterol modification is essential for the proper secretion, dispersal, and reception of HH ligands.The biosynthesis of HH ligands begins with the autocatalytic cleavage of the HH precursor protein, resulting in an N-terminal signaling domain (HH-N) and a C-terminal domain. During this process, a cholesterol molecule is covalently attached to the C-terminus of HH-N (Qi et al., 2018). This cholesterylation is crucial for the subsequent palmitoylation of HH-N, which further enhances its signaling potency and range (Chen et al., 2004).The secretion of cholesterol-modified HH ligands from producing cells involves specialized proteins that facilitate their release. One such protein is Dispatched (Disp), a multipass transmembrane protein that contains a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) (Burke et al., 1999). Disp interacts with the cholesterol moiety of HH ligands and promotes their secretion into the extracellular space. Recent structural studies have provided insights into the mechanism by which Disp recognizes and transports cholesterol-modified HH ligands (Cannac et al., 2020).Once secreted, HH ligands must traverse the extracellular space to reach their target cells. The cholesterol modification plays a crucial role in this process by enabling the formation of soluble multimeric complexes and association with lipoprotein particles (Panáková et al., 2005). These mechanisms allow HH ligands to overcome their inherent hydrophobicity and travel long distances in the aqueous extracellular environment.On target cells, the reception of HH ligands is mediated by the transmembrane protein Patched (Ptch), which also contains an SSD (Marigo et al., 1996). The interaction between HH ligands and Ptch involves the recognition of the cholesterol moiety, as demonstrated by recent structural studies (Qi et al., 2018). This interaction leads to the inactivation of Ptch, which in turn allows the activation of Smoothened (Smo), a G protein-coupled receptor that transduces the HH signal intracellularly.Interestingly, cholesterol itself has been shown to act as an endogenous activator of Smo (Huang et al., 2016). This discovery has led to a new understanding of how Ptch regulates Smo activity. It is now believed that Ptch functions as a cholesterol transporter, pumping cholesterol out of the cell and away from Smo. When HH ligands bind to Ptch, they inhibit its cholesterol transport activity, allowing cholesterol to accumulate and activate Smo (Kinnebrew et al., 2019).The primary cilium, a microtubule-based organelle protruding from the cell surface, serves as a critical signaling center for the HH pathway in vertebrates (Huangfu et al., 2003). Recent studies have revealed that the ciliary membrane has a unique lipid composition, with a high concentration of sterols, including cholesterol (Raleigh et al., 2018). This specialized lipid environment is essential for the proper localization and activation of HH pathway components, particularly Smo.The repeated use of cholesterol in HH signaling has led to the hypothesis that the pathway may have evolved by co-opting ancient systems involved in regulating membrane sterol levels (Hausmann et al., 2009). This idea is supported by the presence of SSDs in key HH pathway components and the observation that many aspects of HH signaling are intimately tied to membrane organization and dynamics.In conclusion, the relationship between cholesterol and HH signaling is multifaceted and essential for the proper function of this critical developmental pathway. From ligand biogenesis to signal reception and transduction, cholesterol plays diverse roles that are integral to HH signaling. As our understanding of this relationship continues to deepen, new opportunities for therapeutic interventions in HH-related disorders may emerge. Future research will likely focus on further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cholesterol's involvement in HH signaling and exploring potential applications in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.", "References": [{"title": "Hedgehog signaling: from basic biology to cancer therapy", "authors": "Philip A.
