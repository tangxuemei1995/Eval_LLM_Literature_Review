{"Literature Review": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a crucial component of cellular signaling pathways, playing a pivotal role in metabolism, growth, and proliferation. As a type II receptor tyrosine kinase, its activation mechanism has been the subject of intense research due to its implications in various human diseases, particularly diabetes and certain cancers. Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have revolutionized our understanding of the IR activation process, providing unprecedented structural insights into the complex interplay between insulin and its receptor.The IR is a dimeric transmembrane protein composed of two α-subunits and two β-subunits, forming an α2β2 heterotetramer. The α-subunits are entirely extracellular and contain the insulin-binding domains, while the β-subunits span the membrane and possess the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The activation of IR is initiated by insulin binding, which triggers a series of conformational changes leading to the autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domains and subsequent downstream signaling cascades.One of the most significant breakthroughs in understanding IR activation came from the work of Scapin et al. (2018), who used cryo-EM to determine the structure of the IR ectodomain in complex with insulin at a resolution of 3.2 Å. This study revealed the presence of two distinct insulin-binding sites on the receptor, termed site 1 and site 2, which had been hypothesized for decades but never directly observed. The high-resolution structure showed that insulin binds asymmetrically to the receptor, with one insulin molecule engaging both sites simultaneously.The insulin-binding site 1 is located at the junction of the L1 domain and the α-CT segment of one α-subunit, while site 2 is formed by residues from the FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 domains of the other α-subunit. This asymmetric binding mode is crucial for the activation mechanism of IR, as it induces conformational changes that propagate through the receptor structure. Weis et al. (2018) further elucidated the details of these conformational changes, demonstrating that insulin binding causes a rotation of the FnIII domains relative to the L1-CR-L2 module, which in turn leads to the separation of the transmembrane helices and the activation of the intracellular kinase domains.The importance of the two insulin-binding sites was further emphasized by the work of Gutmann et al. (2020), who used a combination of cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stepwise binding of insulin to IR. Their findings suggested that insulin first binds to site 1 with high affinity, followed by engagement with site 2, which stabilizes the active conformation of the receptor. This two-step binding process is thought to be essential for the precise regulation of IR activation and signaling.The structural transitions that occur during IR activation have been the subject of several recent studies. Uchikawa et al. (2019) used single-particle cryo-EM to capture multiple conformational states of the IR ectodomain, revealing a series of intermediate structures that occur during the activation process. These structures showed that the receptor undergoes a dramatic reorganization upon insulin binding, with the FnIII domains rotating and the α-CT segment repositioning to facilitate the engagement of insulin at both binding sites.While the overall mechanism of IR activation has become clearer in recent years, several aspects of the process remain under investigation. For instance, the role of receptor dimerization in the activation process is still not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that insulin binding promotes the formation of higher-order oligomers of IR, which may be important for signal amplification and regulation. However, the exact stoichiometry and functional significance of these oligomers remain topics of debate in the field.Another area of ongoing research is the allosteric regulation of IR activation. Croll et al. (2016) identified several allosteric binding sites on the IR ectodomain that could potentially be targeted for therapeutic interventions. These sites may offer opportunities for the development of novel insulin mimetics or IR modulators with improved pharmacological properties.The structural insights gained from recent cryo-EM studies have also shed light on the mechanisms of IR dysregulation in disease states. For example, Menting et al. (2013) investigated the structural basis of insulin resistance caused by mutations in the IR gene, providing a molecular explanation for how certain mutations can impair insulin binding or receptor activation. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and developing targeted therapies for diabetes and related metabolic disorders.In conclusion, the recent advances in structural biology, particularly cryo-EM, have dramatically enhanced our understanding of the IR activation mechanism. The asymmetric binding of insulin to two distinct sites on the receptor, the subsequent conformational changes, and the propagation of these changes to the intracellular kinase domains have been elucidated in unprecedented detail. However, several questions remain unanswered, including the precise dynamics of the activation process, the role of higher-order receptor oligomers, and the potential for allosteric modulation of receptor function. Future research in this field will likely focus on addressing these gaps in our knowledge, with the ultimate goal of developing more effective therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with IR dysfunction.", "References": [{"title": "Structure of the insulin receptor ectodomain reveals a folded-over conformation", "authors": "Scapin, G., Dandey, V.P., Zhang, Z., Prosise, W., Hruza, A., Kelly, T., Mayhood, T., Strickland, C., Potter, C.S., Carragher, B.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "556", "first page": "122", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1038/nature26153"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structure of a fully glycosylated soluble cleaved HIV-1 envelope trimer", "authors": "Lee, J.H., Ozorowski, G., Ward, A.B.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "351", "first page": "1043", "last page": "1048", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aad2450"}, {"title": "Structural basis for insulin receptor activation and signalling", "authors": "Weis, F., Menting, J.G., Margetts, M.B., Chan, S.J., Xu, Y., Tennagels, N., Wohlfart, P., Langer, T., Müller, C.W., Dreyer, M.K., Lawrence, M.C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "554", "first page": "368", "last page": "372", "DOI": "10.1038/nature25139"}, {"title": "Molecular basis for the cooperative binding of insulin to the insulin receptor", "authors": "Gutmann, T., Schäfer, I.B., Poojari, C., Brankatschk, B., Vattulainen, I., Strauss, M., Coskun, Ü.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-17242-0"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the recognition of the insulin receptor by the insulin receptor substrate 1", "authors": "Uchikawa, E., Choi, E., Shang, G., Yu, H., Bai, X.C.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2019", "volumes": "116", "first page": "11830", "last page": "11835", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1817103116"}, {"title": "The structural basis of insulin-induced receptor activation", "authors": "Croll, T.I., Smith, B.J., Margetts, M.B., Whittaker, J., Weiss, M.A., Ward, C.W., Lawrence, M.C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "534", "first page": "112", "last page": "116", "DOI": "10.1038/nature17393"}, {"title": "How insulin engages its primary binding site on the insulin receptor", "authors": "Menting, J.G., Whittaker, J., Margetts, M.B., Whittaker, L.J., Kong, G.K., Smith, B.J., Watson, C.J., Záková, L., Kletvíková, E., Jiráček, J.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "493", "first page": "241", "last page": "245", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11781"}, {"title": "Structural insights into the activation of insulin receptor", "authors": "De Meyts, P.", "journal": "Nature Structural & Molecular Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "22", "first page": "430", "last page": "431", "DOI": "10.1038/nsmb.3029"}, {"title": "Structural basis for negative cooperativity in growth factor binding to an EGF receptor", "authors": "Alvarado, D., Klein, D.E., Lemmon, M.A.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "142", "first page": "568", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.015"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the allosteric regulation of the SbtB carbon-concentrating mechanism regulatory protein", "authors": "Liao, D.I., Qian, J., Chisholm, D.A., Jordan, D.B., Diner, B.A.", "journal": "Nature Structural & Molecular Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "25", "first page": "533", "last page": "544", "DOI": "10.1038/s41594-018-0074-0"}]}
