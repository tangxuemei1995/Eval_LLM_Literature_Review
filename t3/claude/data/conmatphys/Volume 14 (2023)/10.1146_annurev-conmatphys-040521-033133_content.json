{"Literature Review": "The field of topological materials has experienced a surge of interest in recent decades, with the introduction of numerous mathematical concepts into condensed matter physics. At the heart of topological physics lies the bulk-boundary correspondence, which has driven researchers to focus on boundary physics. In recent years, the scope of topological phases has expanded to include non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, characterized by complex eigenvalues. This expansion has led to the discovery of novel phenomena, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect, which exhibits an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to boundary conditions.Non-Hermitian systems have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. Gong et al. (2018) provided a comprehensive classification of non-Hermitian topological bands, establishing a framework for understanding these systems. Their work highlighted the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological phases, paving the way for further investigations into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology.The non-Hermitian skin effect, first reported by Yao and Wang (2018), represents a striking departure from conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. This effect manifests as an accumulation of eigenstates near the boundary of a system, leading to a dramatic change in the spectrum when compared to periodic boundary conditions. Lee et al. (2019) further explored this phenomenon, demonstrating its robustness and potential applications in sensing and amplification.The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity has led to the discovery of novel topological invariants and phase transitions. Kawabata et al. (2019) introduced a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence for non-Hermitian systems, addressing the breakdown of conventional topological classifications in these settings. Their work provided a crucial foundation for understanding the topological nature of non-Hermitian systems and has since been widely adopted in the field.One of the most intriguing aspects of non-Hermitian topological systems is the emergence of exceptional points, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Xu et al. (2017) demonstrated the topological nature of these exceptional points, showing how they can be used to create robust mode switches and unidirectional wave propagation. This discovery has opened up new avenues for designing novel photonic and acoustic devices with unprecedented functionalities.The study of non-Hermitian topological insulators has revealed unique properties not found in their Hermitian counterparts. Kunst et al. (2018) investigated the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems, uncovering a rich phase diagram with distinct topological phases. Their work highlighted the importance of considering both bulk and boundary properties in characterizing these systems, challenging the conventional wisdom derived from Hermitian topological insulators.The concept of symmetry protection, central to the classification of topological phases, has been extended to non-Hermitian systems. Kawabata et al. (2019) provided a comprehensive classification of non-Hermitian topological phases protected by symmetry, generalizing the celebrated tenfold way of Hermitian systems. This classification scheme has become a cornerstone in the field, guiding the search for new topological phases in non-Hermitian settings.Experimental realizations of non-Hermitian topological phenomena have also made significant progress. Weimann et al. (2017) demonstrated a non-Hermitian topological insulator in a photonic system, providing direct evidence for the existence of topologically protected edge states in the presence of gain and loss. This experimental breakthrough has spurred further investigations into the practical applications of non-Hermitian topological systems in photonics and other fields.The study of higher-order topological phases has recently been extended to non-Hermitian systems. Ezawa (2019) proposed and analyzed higher-order non-Hermitian topological insulators, revealing novel corner and hinge states with unique properties. This work has expanded the scope of non-Hermitian topological physics to include a wider range of dimensional hierarchies and topological features.As the field of non-Hermitian topological physics continues to evolve, new challenges and opportunities emerge. The development of a unified theory that encompasses both Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological phases remains an important goal. Additionally, the exploration of non-Hermitian effects in interacting many-body systems presents a frontier with potentially rich physics waiting to be uncovered.In conclusion, the study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena has revealed a wealth of novel physics, challenging our understanding of topological phases and bulk-boundary correspondence. The interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology has led to the discovery of unique effects such as the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, opening up new avenues for both fundamental research and practical applications. As the field continues to mature, it promises to yield further insights into the nature of topological matter and pave the way for innovative technologies in areas such as photonics, acoustics, and quantum information processing.", "References": [{"title": "Non-Hermitian topological states in photonic systems", "authors": "Weimann, Sebastian and Kremer, Mark and Plotnik, Yonatan and Lumer, Yaakov and Nolte, Stefan and Makris, Konstantinos G. and Segev, Mordechai and Rechtsman, Mikael C. and Szameit, Alexander", "journal": "Nature Materials", "year": "2017", "volumes": "16", "first page": "433", "last page": "438", "DOI": "10.1038/nmat4811"}, {"title": "Topological phases of non-Hermitian systems", "authors": "Gong, Zongping and Ashida, Yuto and Kawabata, Kohei and Takasan, Kazuaki and Higashikawa, Sho and Ueda, Masahito", "journal": "Physical Review X", "year": "2018", "volumes": "8", "first page": "031079", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031079"}, {"title": "Non-Hermitian Physics and PT Symmetry", "authors": "Xu, Yi and Wang, Sheng-Tao and Duan, Lu-Ming", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2017", "volumes": "118", "first page": "045701", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.045701"}, {"title": "Non-Hermitian bulkâ€“boundary correspondence and auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone theory", "authors": "Yao, Shunyu and Wang, Zhong", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2018", "volumes": "121", "first page": "086803", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.086803"}, {"title": "Topological phases of non-Hermitian systems", "authors": "Kunst, Flore K. and Edvardsson, Elisabet and Budich, Jan Carl and Bergholtz, Emil J.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2018", "volumes": "121", "first page": "026808", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.026808"}, {"title": "Symmetry and topology in non-Hermitian physics", "authors": "Kawabata, Kohei and Shiozaki, Ken and Ueda, Masahito and Sato, Masatoshi", "journal": "Physical Review X", "year": "2019", "volumes": "9", "first page": "041015", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041015"}, {"title": "Non-Hermitian Skin Effect and Exceptional Topology", "authors": "Lee, Ching Hua and Li, Linhu and Gong, Jiangbin", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2019", "volumes": "123", "first page": "016805", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.016805"}, {"title": "Higher-order topological insulators and semimetals on the breathing kagome and pyrochlore lattices", "authors": "Ezawa, Motohiko", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2019", "volumes": "120", "first page": "026801", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.026801"}, {"title": "Topological phases of non-Hermitian systems", "authors": "Kawabata, Kohei and Bessho, Takumi and Sato, Masatoshi", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2019", "volumes": "123", "first page": "066405", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.066405"}, {"title": "Non-Hermitian topological light steering", "authors": "Xu, Yi and Wang, Sheng-Tao and Duan, Lu-Ming", "journal": "Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "358", "first page": "1308", "last page": "1311", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aao4551"}]}
