{"Literature Review": "Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have emerged as a fascinating phenomenon in the field of quantum physics, challenging our understanding of thermalization and quantum chaos in isolated many-body systems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of QMBS from a quasiparticle perspective, exploring their unique properties and implications for quantum dynamics.The concept of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has long been a cornerstone in our understanding of how isolated quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. According to ETH, generic many-body systems are expected to thermalize under their own dynamics, with most eigenstates exhibiting thermal behavior [1]. However, the discovery of QMBS has revealed a class of systems that violate this principle, exhibiting non-thermal behavior and long-lived coherent oscillations even at high energies.QMBS are characterized by the presence of atypical, non-thermal eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These scar states exhibit low entanglement entropy and often possess special symmetries or structures that protect them from thermalization [2]. The term 'scar' draws an analogy to quantum scars in single-particle systems, where certain wavefunctions concentrate along unstable periodic orbits of the classical system.One of the most striking features of QMBS is their ability to support stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. In conventional many-body systems, quasiparticles are well-defined only at low energies, where interactions are weak. As energy increases, these quasiparticles typically become unstable due to the proliferation of decay channels [3]. However, in systems exhibiting QMBS, certain quasiparticles remain stable even at high energies, leading to a range of unusual non-equilibrium phenomena.A prime example of such phenomena is the observation of many-body revivals. In systems with QMBS, certain initial states can exhibit persistent oscillations in local observables, defying the expectation of rapid thermalization [4]. These revivals are a direct consequence of the stable quasiparticles associated with scar states, which allow for coherent dynamics even in the presence of strong interactions.The spin-1 XY model has emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying QMBS. This model exhibits a rich set of scar states and allows for a clear demonstration of the underlying physics [5]. The simplicity of the model, combined with its non-trivial properties, makes it an ideal platform for both theoretical and experimental investigations of QMBS.One of the key mechanisms behind QMBS is the presence of certain symmetries or conservation laws that constrain the dynamics of the system. These constraints can lead to the formation of disconnected sectors in the Hilbert space, a phenomenon known as Hilbert space fragmentation [6]. This fragmentation can significantly alter the dynamics of the system, leading to the emergence of QMBS and associated non-thermal behavior.The study of QMBS has also led to the development of new theoretical tools and concepts. One such concept is that of projector embedding, which provides a systematic way to construct scar states in many-body systems [7]. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of models, revealing the ubiquity of QMBS in quantum many-body systems.From an experimental perspective, recent years have seen significant progress in the realization and observation of QMBS in various quantum simulators. Platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays and trapped ions have provided compelling evidence for the existence of QMBS and associated phenomena [8]. These experimental advances have not only validated theoretical predictions but also opened up new avenues for exploring quantum non-equilibrium physics.Despite the rapid progress in the field, many theoretical puzzles remain. The precise conditions for the emergence of QMBS, their stability under perturbations, and their relationship to other forms of ergodicity breaking are all active areas of research [9]. Moreover, the potential applications of QMBS in quantum information processing and quantum metrology are just beginning to be explored.In conclusion, the study of quantum many-body scars from a quasiparticle perspective has revealed a rich landscape of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. By challenging our understanding of thermalization and quantum chaos, QMBS have opened up new directions in the study of many-body quantum systems. As the field continues to evolve, it promises to yield further insights into the fundamental nature of quantum matter and potentially lead to novel quantum technologies [10].", "References": [{"title": "From quantum chaos and eigenstate thermalization to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics", "authors": "Luca D'Alessio, Yariv Kafri, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Marcos Rigol", "journal": "Advances in Physics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "65", "first page": "239", "last page": "362", "DOI": "10.1080/00018732.2016.1198134"}, {"title": "Quantum many-body scars", "authors": "Christopher J.
