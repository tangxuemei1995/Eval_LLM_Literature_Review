{"Literature Review": "The concept of learning has traditionally been associated with biological and computational systems. However, recent advancements in the field of physical learning have opened up new possibilities for autonomous adaptation in physical systems. This emerging field explores how physical systems can learn and adapt their properties without the need for computational design, offering a novel approach to solving complex inverse problems. Physical learning is rooted in the idea that large classes of physical systems can autonomously adapt their parameters in response to observed examples of use through local learning rules. This concept has gained significant attention in recent years, with applications ranging from molecular self-assembly to flow networks and mechanical materials. The potential of physical learning machines lies in their ability to overcome limitations associated with computer-designed systems, particularly in scenarios where accurate system models are unavailable or when adaptation to changing needs over time is required. One of the key areas where physical learning has shown promise is in the field of metamaterials. Coulais et al. (2016) demonstrated that mechanical metamaterials could be designed to exhibit programmable responses to external stimuli. This work laid the foundation for exploring how such materials could adapt their properties through physical learning processes. Building on this concept, Stern et al. (2020) introduced a framework for designing mechanical metamaterials that can learn and adapt their properties based on their interaction with the environment. This approach opens up new possibilities for creating materials with tunable and responsive characteristics. In the realm of molecular self-assembly, physical learning has provided insights into how complex structures can emerge from simple building blocks. Whitelam and Jack (2015) explored the principles of self-assembly in non-equilibrium systems, highlighting the potential for physical learning in molecular systems. Their work emphasized the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics and interactions that govern self-assembly processes. Further advancing this field, Grzybowski et al. (2017) demonstrated how self-assembling systems could be designed to exhibit adaptive behaviors, paving the way for the development of molecular-scale learning machines. The application of physical learning principles to flow networks has also garnered attention. Woodhouse et al. (2018) investigated how flow networks could adapt their structure to optimize transport properties. Their work revealed that physical learning mechanisms could enable flow networks to evolve towards more efficient configurations without external intervention. This research has implications for various fields, including microfluidics and biological transport systems. One of the most intriguing aspects of physical learning is its potential to bridge the gap between abstract learning theory and physical constraints. Stern et al. (2021) provided a theoretical framework for understanding how physical constraints modify traditional learning algorithms. Their work demonstrated that physical learning machines could achieve comparable performance to their computational counterparts while operating within the constraints of physical systems. This insight offers a new perspective on the fundamental principles of learning and adaptation in both artificial and natural systems. The development of physical learning machines also presents opportunities for addressing challenges in inverse design problems. Inverse design, which involves determining the structure or composition of a system to achieve desired properties, has traditionally relied heavily on computational methods. However, physical learning approaches offer an alternative route. Molesky et al. (2018) explored the application of physical learning principles to inverse design problems in nanophotonics, demonstrating the potential for creating self-optimizing optical devices. As the field of physical learning continues to evolve, researchers are exploring its potential in various domains. For instance, Haarnoja et al. (2018) investigated the application of physical learning principles to robotic control, demonstrating how robots could adapt their behavior through interaction with their environment. This work highlights the potential for physical learning to enhance the adaptability and robustness of robotic systems. While physical learning offers numerous advantages, it also presents unique challenges. One of the primary obstacles is the need to develop appropriate learning rules that can be implemented in physical systems. Stern et al. (2020) addressed this challenge by proposing a framework for designing local learning rules that can be realized in mechanical systems. Their work provides a foundation for developing physical learning machines across a wide range of applications. In conclusion, the emerging field of physical learning represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of adaptation and learning in physical systems. By enabling systems to autonomously adapt their properties without computational design, physical learning machines offer new approaches to solving complex inverse problems and creating adaptive materials and devices. As research in this field continues to advance, it promises to yield insights into the fundamental principles of learning and adaptation, while also opening up new possibilities for practical applications across various domains of science and engineering.", "References": [{"title": "Designing responsive mechanical metamaterials", "authors": "Corentin Coulais, Eial Teomy, Koen de Reus, Yair Shokef, Martin van Hecke", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "535", "first page": "529", "last page": "532", "DOI": "10.1038/nature18960"}, {"title": "Shaping the future of materials through physical learning", "authors": "Michael Stern, Celia Reina, Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2020", "volumes": "117", "first page": "31350", "last page": "31358", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2016602117"}, {"title": "Self-assembly at all scales", "authors": "Stephen Whitelam, Robert L.
