{"Literature Review": "Superconductivity, a phenomenon characterized by zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism, has been a subject of intense research since its discovery in 1911. The interplay between superconductivity and symmetry has emerged as a crucial area of study, particularly in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This literature review focuses on the effects of local inversion-symmetry breaking on superconductivity and its implications for unconventional and topological superconducting states.Inversion symmetry, along with time-reversal symmetry, plays a fundamental role in determining the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The breaking of inversion symmetry, either globally or locally, can lead to profound modifications in the superconducting state. Noncentrosymmetric superconductors, which lack global inversion symmetry, have been extensively studied for their unique properties and potential for hosting topological superconductivity [1].Recent attention has shifted towards materials exhibiting local, rather than global, inversion-symmetry breaking. These locally noncentrosymmetric crystals present a fascinating arena for exploring novel superconducting phenomena that are not typically expected in centrosymmetric materials [2]. The concept of local inversion-symmetry breaking has been realized in various material systems, including artificial heterostructures, layered materials, and bulk crystals with complex unit cells [3].One of the key consequences of local inversion-symmetry breaking is its impact on the normal state electronic structure. The absence of local inversion symmetry can lead to the emergence of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling, which lifts spin degeneracy and results in spin-split bands [4]. This spin-orbit coupling can have significant implications for the superconducting state, including the mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing components [5].The classification of superconducting order parameters in locally noncentrosymmetric materials becomes more complex compared to their globally centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric counterparts. The local symmetry breaking allows for the coexistence of different pairing symmetries within the same material, leading to rich and diverse superconducting phases [6]. This complexity opens up new possibilities for realizing unconventional superconducting states with unique properties.One of the most intriguing aspects of superconductivity in locally noncentrosymmetric materials is the potential for hosting topological superconducting phases. Topological superconductors are characterized by a bulk superconducting gap and gapless surface states, which can host Majorana fermions [7]. These exotic quasiparticles have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in quantum computing and their fundamental importance in understanding topological phases of matter [8].The interplay between local inversion-symmetry breaking and superconductivity can lead to a variety of unusual phenomena. For instance, the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling can result in a helical spin texture of the Cooper pairs, which can give rise to magnetoelectric effects and novel responses to external magnetic fields [9]. Additionally, the mixing of singlet and triplet pairing components can lead to unconventional gap structures and novel quasiparticle excitations [10].Experimental observations have begun to confirm some of the theoretical predictions regarding superconductivity in locally noncentrosymmetric materials. For example, evidence of mixed-parity pairing and unusual magnetic properties has been reported in certain layered superconductors. However, many aspects of this field remain to be explored, and further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed to fully understand the rich physics of these systems.In conclusion, the study of superconductivity in materials with local inversion-symmetry breaking represents a frontier in condensed matter physics. This field offers exciting opportunities for discovering new superconducting phases, including topological superconductors, and for exploring the fundamental interplay between symmetry and superconductivity. As research in this area progresses, it is likely to yield important insights into the nature of unconventional superconductivity and may lead to the development of novel materials with technological applications in areas such as quantum computing and spintronics.", "References": [{"title": "Superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials", "authors": "Manfred Sigrist, D.
