{"Literature Review": "The field of fermiology has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, expanding beyond the classical understanding of Fermi surface geometry to encompass the quantum wave function geometry over the Fermi surface. This evolution has been largely driven by the discovery and study of topological metals, which are characterized by Fermi surfaces with robustly nontrivial Berry phases. The concept of Berry phase, first introduced by Michael Berry in 1984, has become a cornerstone in understanding the topological properties of materials. Topological metals have garnered considerable attention due to their unique electronic properties and potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics. These materials exhibit a range of fascinating phenomena, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect and chiral anomaly, which are directly related to their nontrivial topology. The study of topological metals has been greatly facilitated by the use of magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations in transport and thermodynamic quantities, a technique that has proven invaluable in probing the Fermi surface properties of these materials. Quantum oscillations, such as the de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas effects, have long been used to study the Fermi surface geometry of metals. However, in topological metals, these oscillations can reveal much more than just the shape and size of the Fermi surface. A holistic analysis of the oscillatory waveform can provide insights into various aspects of the topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. The phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, and temperature-dependent frequency of these oscillations encode different information about the Fermi surface topology. The interpretation of quantum oscillation data in topological metals is not straightforward and depends on several factors. The orientation of the applied magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes can significantly affect the observed oscillations. Additionally, the symmetry class of the topological metal plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the observed effects. For instance, in Dirac and Weyl semimetals, the symmetry protection of the band-touching points leads to unique quantum oscillation signatures. Another important consideration in the study of topological metals is the separation of Fermi surface pockets in quasimomentum space. Two scenarios of particular interest are: (1) nearly overlapping spin-split pockets due to weak spin-orbit coupling, and (2) pockets that touch at an isolated point, which can be either a topological band-touching point or a saddle point in the energy-momentum dispersion. In the case of nearly overlapping spin-split pockets, a pseudospin degree of freedom emerges, which can lead to interesting phenomena such as weak antilocalization and unconventional quantum oscillations. The interplay between the pseudospin and the Berry phase can result in complex quantum interference effects that are unique to topological metals. When Fermi surface pockets touch at an isolated point, magnetic breakdown can occur, leading to quantum tunneling between the pockets. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in conventional metals, but in topological metals, it takes on new aspects due to the non-abelian Berry connection of the Fermi surface. The interplay between magnetic breakdown and the Berry phase can lead to novel quantum oscillation patterns that provide valuable information about the topological nature of the material. The study of Dirac and Weyl semimetals has been particularly fruitful in advancing our understanding of topological metals. These materials host massless Dirac or Weyl fermions as low-energy excitations and exhibit a range of exotic transport phenomena. The quantum oscillations in these materials can reveal the chirality of the Weyl nodes and provide direct evidence of their topological nature. As the field of topofermiology continues to evolve, new directions for research are emerging. One promising avenue is the study of interaction-induced Fermi liquid instabilities in topological metals. The interplay between electron-electron interactions and nontrivial band topology can lead to novel correlated states of matter, such as topological superconductors and fractional topological insulators. Another area of growing interest is the study of two-dimensional electron liquids in topological materials. These systems, which can be realized at the surfaces or interfaces of topological insulators or in atomically thin materials, offer a unique platform for exploring the interplay between reduced dimensionality and topological effects. In conclusion, the modern scope of fermiology, with its focus on topological metals, has opened up new avenues for understanding the fundamental properties of quantum materials. The holistic analysis of quantum oscillations, combined with a deep understanding of the Berry phase and its manifestations, provides a powerful toolset for probing the intricate physics of these fascinating systems. As the field continues to advance, it promises to yield new insights into the nature of topological matter and pave the way for novel technological applications.", "References": [{"title": "Geometric phase effects in quantum mechanics", "authors": "Michael Berry", "journal": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences", "year": "1984", "volumes": "392", "first page": "45", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1098/rspa.1984.0023"}, {"title": "Topological semimetals and Fermi-arc surface states", "authors": "Binghai Yan, Claudia Felser", "journal": "Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "8", "first page": "337", "last page": "354", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031016-025458"}, {"title": "Quantum oscillations in Dirac and Weyl semimetals", "authors": "Pallab Goswami, Sumanta Tewari, Sudip Chakravarty", "journal": "Physical Review B", "year": "2015", "volumes": "92", "first page": "075145", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.92.075145"}, {"title": "Angular dependence of quantum oscillations in Dirac and Weyl semimetals", "authors": "Yuki Fuseya, Masao Ogata, Hidetoshi Fukuyama", "journal": "Journal of the Physical Society of Japan", "year": "2015", "volumes": "84", "first page": "012001", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7566/JPSJ.84.012001"}, {"title": "Topological semimetals and topological insulators in rare earth and actinide compounds", "authors": "Maia G.
