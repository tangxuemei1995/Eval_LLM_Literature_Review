{"Literature Review": "Odd viscosity and odd elasticity are emerging concepts in continuum mechanics that challenge our traditional understanding of material properties. These phenomena represent a paradigm shift in how we perceive the response of materials to external forces, particularly in non-equilibrium systems. This literature review aims to explore the current state of knowledge regarding odd viscosity and odd elasticity, their manifestations in various systems, and the underlying microscopic mechanisms.Odd viscosity, first introduced by Avron et al. (1998), is a dissipationless transport coefficient that arises in two-dimensional fluids lacking time-reversal symmetry. Unlike conventional viscosity, which relates to energy dissipation, odd viscosity leads to a transverse response in fluids. This peculiar property has been observed in diverse systems, ranging from quantum Hall fluids to classical active matter.In quantum Hall fluids, odd viscosity emerges as a consequence of broken time-reversal symmetry due to strong magnetic fields. Haldane (2009) demonstrated that odd viscosity in these systems is directly related to the Hall viscosity, which plays a crucial role in the transport properties of two-dimensional electron gases. This connection between odd viscosity and quantum Hall physics has sparked interest in exploring its implications for topological states of matter.The concept of odd viscosity has also found applications in classical systems, particularly in active matter. Banerjee et al. (2017) showed that collections of self-rotating particles, such as bacterial suspensions or driven colloids, can exhibit odd viscosity. This discovery has opened up new avenues for understanding and controlling the collective behavior of active systems, with potential applications in soft robotics and self-assembled materials.Odd elasticity, a more recent concept introduced by Scheibner et al. (2020), extends the idea of odd transport coefficients to solid materials. Unlike conventional elasticity, which describes how materials store energy under deformation, odd elasticity leads to non-conservative forces and work extraction during cyclic deformations. This phenomenon challenges our fundamental understanding of material response and has profound implications for the design of metamaterials with novel functionalities.One of the most intriguing aspects of odd elasticity is its potential to modify the dynamics of topological defects in solids. Braverman et al. (2021) demonstrated that odd elasticity can lead to anomalous motion of dislocations, the fundamental carriers of plastic deformation in crystalline materials. This finding suggests new possibilities for controlling material properties through the manipulation of topological defects.The rich phenomenology of odd viscosity and odd elasticity extends to the realm of wave propagation. Souslov et al. (2019) showed that materials with odd viscosity can support topologically protected edge waves, analogous to those found in quantum Hall systems. Similarly, Scheibner et al. (2020) predicted the existence of unidirectional elastic waves in materials with odd elasticity. These discoveries open up exciting possibilities for designing novel acoustic and mechanical metamaterials with topological properties.The microscopic origins of odd viscosity and odd elasticity are diverse and system-dependent. In quantum systems, these phenomena often arise from Berry curvature effects in momentum space. For classical active matter, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry through self-propulsion or external driving forces is typically responsible. Understanding these microscopic mechanisms is crucial for designing and controlling materials with odd transport properties.Recent experimental realizations have begun to validate theoretical predictions and provide new insights into odd viscosity and odd elasticity. Soni et al. (2019) demonstrated odd viscosity in a macroscopic system of spinning magnetic particles, while Tan et al. (2021) observed signatures of odd elasticity in an active solid composed of self-rotating gears. These experimental advances pave the way for future applications and further theoretical developments.The study of odd viscosity and odd elasticity is not limited to condensed matter systems. Astrophysical plasmas in the presence of strong magnetic fields can also exhibit odd viscosity, as shown by Lingam and Morrison (2014). This finding has implications for our understanding of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in stellar and planetary interiors.As research in this field progresses, new questions and challenges emerge. The interplay between odd transport coefficients and other material properties, such as nonlinearity and disorder, remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the potential applications of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in fields such as energy harvesting, sensing, and adaptive materials are yet to be fully realized.In conclusion, odd viscosity and odd elasticity represent exciting frontiers in continuum mechanics and materials science. These phenomena challenge our conventional understanding of material response and offer new possibilities for designing materials with unprecedented properties. As research in this field continues to evolve, we can expect further theoretical insights, experimental realizations, and potential applications across a wide range of disciplines, from condensed matter physics to active matter and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Odd Viscosity in Two-Dimensional Incompressible Fluids", "authors": "J.
