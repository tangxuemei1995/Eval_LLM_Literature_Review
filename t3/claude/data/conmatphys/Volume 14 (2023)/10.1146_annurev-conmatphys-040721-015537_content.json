{"Literature Review": "Floquet engineering has emerged as a powerful tool in quantum physics, allowing researchers to create novel states of matter through periodic driving of quantum systems. This approach, rooted in Floquet theory, provides a framework for obtaining effective static Hamiltonians that describe the time-averaged behavior of periodically driven systems. While much of the early work in this field focused on closed quantum systems, there is growing recognition of the importance of considering open quantum systems, where dissipation and environmental interactions play a crucial role.The study of Floquet states in open quantum systems lies at the intersection of several important areas of physics, including nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. This interdisciplinary nature has led to a surge of interest in recent years, as researchers seek to understand the interplay between periodic driving and dissipation in quantum systems.One of the fundamental challenges in this field is the development of appropriate theoretical frameworks to describe open Floquet systems. Kohler et al. (2018) provided a comprehensive review of various approaches, including Floquet-Markov master equations and Floquet-Lindblad equations. These formalisms extend the concept of Floquet states to open systems by incorporating dissipative effects into the periodic time evolution.The application of quantum master equations to Floquet systems has been particularly fruitful. Dai et al. (2016) demonstrated how these equations can be used to study the dynamics of driven-dissipative quantum systems, revealing novel phenomena such as synchronization and dynamical phase transitions. Their work highlighted the importance of considering both coherent and incoherent processes in open Floquet systems.An important question in the field is whether the concepts of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be applied to Floquet states in open systems. Shirai et al. (2015) investigated this problem, showing that under certain conditions, driven-dissipative systems can exhibit steady states that resemble thermal equilibrium. However, they also found instances where the steady state deviates significantly from equilibrium, emphasizing the rich and complex behavior of these systems.The interplay between periodic driving and dissipation can lead to unexpected effects. For example, Gelbwaser-Klimovsky et al. (2015) demonstrated that periodic driving can be used to enhance or suppress dissipation in quantum systems, opening up new possibilities for controlling quantum states through engineered environments. This work has important implications for quantum technologies, where maintaining coherence in the presence of environmental noise is a major challenge.Recent experimental advances have played a crucial role in driving the field forward. Jörg et al. (2017) reported on the observation of Floquet states in a driven-dissipative quantum system using superconducting circuits. Their work provided direct evidence for the applicability of Floquet theory to open quantum systems and demonstrated the potential for using periodic driving to engineer quantum states in the presence of dissipation.The study of topological phenomena in open Floquet systems has also gained significant attention. Rudner et al. (2020) reviewed recent progress in this area, discussing how periodic driving can be used to create topological phases that have no static counterpart. They highlighted the importance of considering dissipation in these systems, as it can both stabilize and destroy topological features.One of the most intriguing aspects of open Floquet systems is their potential for realizing non-equilibrium phases of matter. Oka and Kitamura (2019) provided an overview of recent theoretical and experimental progress in this direction, discussing how periodic driving can be used to create exotic states such as time crystals and Floquet topological insulators in the presence of dissipation.The question of thermalization in open Floquet systems remains an active area of research. While closed Floquet systems often exhibit heating to infinite temperature due to the absorption of energy from the drive, dissipation can lead to more complex behavior. Lazarides et al. (2014) investigated this problem, showing that open Floquet systems can exhibit a rich variety of steady states, ranging from those resembling thermal equilibrium to highly non-thermal distributions.Looking forward, the study of Floquet states in open quantum systems promises to yield new insights into fundamental questions of nonequilibrium statistical physics. As experimental techniques continue to advance, allowing for greater control over both driving and dissipation, we can expect to see new discoveries that challenge our understanding of quantum systems far from equilibrium. The interplay between periodic driving, dissipation, and quantum coherence offers a rich playground for exploring novel physical phenomena and developing new quantum technologies.", "References": [{"title": "Driven open quantum systems: from Floquet theory to applications", "authors": "Sigmund Kohler, Jürgen Lehmann, Peter Hänggi", "journal": "Physics Reports", "year": "2018", "volumes": "745", "first page": "1", "last page": "59", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physrep.2018.03.001"}, {"title": "Floquet engineering of quantum systems", "authors": "Takashi Oka, Sota Kitamura", "journal": "Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "387", "last page": "408", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031218-013423"}, {"title": "Periodically driven quantum systems: Effective hamiltonians and engineered gauge fields", "authors": "Nathan Goldman, Jan Dalibard", "journal": "Physical Review X", "year": "2014", "volumes": "4", "first page": "031027", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevX.4.031027"}, {"title": "Floquet topological insulators for sound", "authors": "Romain Fleury, Alexander B.
