{"Literature Review": "Active colloids have emerged as a fascinating field of study in soft matter physics, offering insights into self-propelled motion at the microscale. These particles, capable of converting chemical energy from their surroundings into directed motion, have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in various fields, including targeted drug delivery, environmental remediation, and microfluidics. This literature review aims to explore the current state of research in modeling active colloids, focusing on the progression from simple active Brownian particle models to more complex representations incorporating hydrodynamic and chemical fields.The study of active colloids often begins with the fundamental model of active Brownian particles (ABPs). This approach, as described by Bechinger et al. (2016), considers the particles as self-propelled entities subject to random Brownian motion and deterministic forces. The ABP model has proven invaluable in understanding the basic principles of active matter, such as motility-induced phase separation and collective behavior. However, as pointed out by Zöttl and Stark (2016), this simplified model does not account for the hydrodynamic interactions that play a crucial role in the behavior of active colloids in real fluids.To address this limitation, researchers have developed more sophisticated models that incorporate hydrodynamic effects. One such approach is the squirmer model, originally proposed by Lighthill and later refined by Blake. As discussed by Lauga and Powers (2009), the squirmer model represents a microswimmer as a spherical particle with a prescribed surface velocity, allowing for a more accurate representation of the fluid flow generated by the active colloid. This model has been extensively used to study the hydrodynamic interactions between multiple swimmers and their behavior near surfaces.The explicit modeling of self-generated fluid flow and the full hydrodynamic-chemical coupling represents a significant advancement in the field. Michelin and Lauga (2014) demonstrated that the interplay between chemical gradients and fluid flow can lead to complex behaviors, such as autonomous navigation and chemotaxis. Their work highlighted the importance of considering both hydrodynamic and phoretic effects in understanding the motion of active colloids.Recent years have seen an increased focus on studying active colloids in more realistic and complex environments. For instance, Bechinger et al. (2016) reviewed various experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate the behavior of active particles in crowded systems, mimicking biological environments. These studies have revealed intriguing phenomena, such as enhanced diffusion and unique clustering behaviors, which are not observed in passive systems.The concept of microrheology in active baths has also gained traction. As explored by Patteson et al. (2016), the presence of active particles can significantly alter the rheological properties of a fluid. This has implications for understanding the mechanical properties of biological fluids and designing novel smart materials with tunable properties.An exciting development in the field is the concept of active colloidal engines. Palacci et al. (2013) demonstrated the possibility of harnessing the energy of active colloids to perform useful work at the microscale. This opens up new avenues for the design of miniature machines and motors powered by chemical energy.The application of machine learning techniques to the study of active colloids represents a cutting-edge approach in the field. Muiños-Landin et al. (2018) showed how reinforcement learning algorithms could be used to optimize the navigation strategies of active colloids in complex environments. This interdisciplinary approach combines the physics of active matter with advanced computational techniques, potentially leading to more efficient and adaptive microswimmers.Finally, recent studies have begun to explore the effects of colloid and fluid inertia on the behavior of active particles. While most models assume the low Reynolds number regime, where inertial effects are negligible, Löwen (2020) highlighted the importance of considering inertia in certain scenarios, particularly for larger active colloids or in non-Newtonian fluids.In conclusion, the modeling of active colloids has evolved significantly from simple ABP models to sophisticated representations that account for complex hydrodynamic and chemical interactions. This progression has enabled researchers to tackle increasingly complex problems, from understanding fundamental principles of self-propulsion to designing adaptive microswimmers for specific applications. As the field continues to advance, we can expect further integration of multidisciplinary approaches, combining physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science to unlock the full potential of active colloidal systems.", "References": [{"title": "Active particles in complex and crowded environments", "authors": "Clemens Bechinger, Roberto Di Leonardo, Hartmut Löwen, Charles Reichhardt, Giorgio Volpe, Giovanni Volpe", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "88", "first page": "045006", "last page": "045006", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.88.045006"}, {"title": "Hydrodynamics of soft active matter", "authors": "M.
