{"Literature Review": "The field of photocatalysis has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to address global energy and environmental challenges. Photocatalytic materials offer a promising avenue for solar-to-chemical energy conversion, particularly in applications such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. The advent of data-driven approaches, coupled with the Materials Genome Initiative, has revolutionized the discovery and development of novel photocatalytic materials.Traditional methods of materials discovery have been largely based on intuition, trial-and-error, and incremental improvements. However, these approaches are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. The emergence of high-throughput computational and experimental techniques, along with the development of extensive materials databases, has paved the way for more efficient and systematic materials discovery processes (Kim et al., 2017).One of the key challenges in photocatalyst development is the identification of materials that exhibit both high efficiency and stability under operational conditions. Computational screening methods have played a crucial role in accelerating the discovery of potential photocatalytic materials. For instance, Wu et al. (2019) employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen over 1,000 perovskite oxides for their photocatalytic water-splitting properties. Their study identified several promising candidates with suitable band gaps and band edge positions for efficient water splitting.Machine learning techniques have also been increasingly applied to predict and optimize photocatalytic properties. Singh et al. (2018) developed a machine learning model to predict the band gaps of inorganic compounds, which is a critical parameter for photocatalytic performance. Their model, trained on a large dataset of experimentally measured band gaps, demonstrated high accuracy in predicting band gaps for new materials, thus enabling rapid screening of potential photocatalysts.While computational methods have greatly accelerated the initial stages of materials discovery, experimental validation remains crucial. High-throughput experimental techniques have been developed to rapidly synthesize and characterize large libraries of materials. For example, Yan et al. (2020) employed a combinatorial synthesis approach to explore the compositional space of mixed-metal oxides for CO2 reduction. Their method allowed for the rapid screening of over 1,000 unique compositions, leading to the discovery of several highly active photocatalysts.One of the most critical aspects of photocatalyst development is ensuring the stability and durability of materials under operational conditions. Aqueous stability, in particular, is a significant concern for many photocatalytic applications. Recent advancements in computational methods have enabled more accurate predictions of material stability in aqueous environments. Singh et al. (2020) developed a machine learning model to predict the aqueous stability of inorganic materials based on their composition and crystal structure. This model has proven valuable in identifying stable photocatalysts for water-splitting applications.Experimental techniques for assessing photocatalyst stability have also evolved. In situ and operando characterization methods now allow researchers to observe changes in material structure and composition during photocatalytic reactions. For instance, Zhang et al. (2021) used in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the structural evolution of cobalt oxide catalysts during water oxidation, providing insights into degradation mechanisms and guiding the development of more stable materials.The integration of computational predictions and experimental validation has led to the discovery of several promising photocatalysts in recent years. For example, Liu et al. (2018) used a combination of DFT calculations and experimental screening to identify a new class of bismuth-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. These materials demonstrated both high activity and stability under visible light irradiation.Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the field of data-driven photocatalyst discovery. One major issue is the lack of standardization in experimental protocols and data reporting, which can hinder the development of accurate predictive models. Efforts are underway to establish community-wide standards for data collection and sharing in materials science (Jain et al., 2016).Another challenge is the development of multi-scale models that can bridge the gap between atomic-scale simulations and macroscopic device performance. Such models are essential for predicting the real-world performance of photocatalytic materials and guiding their integration into practical devices.Looking ahead, the continued development of data-driven approaches promises to further accelerate the discovery of robust and efficient photocatalysts. The integration of artificial intelligence and robotics in materials synthesis and characterization is expected to enable fully autonomous discovery pipelines. Additionally, the application of advanced data analytics to large-scale experimental datasets may reveal previously unknown structure-property relationships, leading to new design principles for photocatalytic materials.In conclusion, data-driven approaches have significantly accelerated the discovery of robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion. The synergy between computational screening, machine learning predictions, and high-throughput experimental techniques has led to the identification of numerous promising photocatalysts. As these methods continue to evolve and mature, they are expected to play an increasingly important role in addressing global energy and environmental challenges through the development of efficient and stable photocatalytic materials.", "References": [{"title": "Machine Learning Bandgaps of Double Perovskites", "authors": "Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi, Jacqueline M.
