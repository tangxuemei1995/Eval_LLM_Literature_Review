{"Literature Review": "The field of immunometabolism has emerged as a crucial area of research over the past decade, providing significant insights into the intricate relationship between immune responses and metabolic processes. This literature review aims to explore the recent advancements in systems immunology approaches to metabolism, highlighting the complex interplay between immunity and metabolism, and discussing the technological developments that enable a more comprehensive understanding of this relationship.Immunometabolism, as an interdisciplinary field, has revolutionized our understanding of how metabolic processes influence immune cell function and vice versa. Traditional approaches to studying immunometabolism, such as bulk metabolic profiling and analysis of metabolic regulator expression, have laid the foundation for appreciating the physiological complexity of immunometabolic regulation in vivo (O'Neill et al., 2016). These methods have revealed that immune cells undergo significant metabolic reprogramming during activation, differentiation, and effector function, which is essential for mounting an effective immune response.Recent studies have demonstrated that different immune cell subsets exhibit distinct metabolic profiles, which are closely linked to their functional states. For instance, Pearce et al. (2013) showed that T cell activation is accompanied by a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This metabolic switch is crucial for supporting rapid proliferation and effector function of T cells. Similarly, macrophages undergo metabolic reprogramming during polarization, with M1 macrophages relying heavily on glycolysis and M2 macrophages utilizing oxidative phosphorylation (Van den Bossche et al., 2017).The advent of single-cell technologies has further advanced our understanding of immunometabolism by revealing the heterogeneity of metabolic states within immune cell populations. Artyomov and Van den Bossche (2020) reviewed how single-cell metabolomics and transcriptomics have uncovered previously unappreciated metabolic diversity among immune cells, highlighting the importance of studying immunometabolism at the single-cell level.As the field of immunometabolism has progressed, there has been a growing recognition of the need for systems-level approaches to capture the full complexity of immunometabolic regulation in vivo. This has led to the development and application of next-generation technologies for metabolic profiling and analysis. One such approach is spatially resolved metabolic imaging, which allows for the visualization of metabolic processes within tissues and organs with high spatial resolution (Rath et al., 2021). This technique has provided valuable insights into the metabolic heterogeneity of immune cells within different tissue microenvironments and how this influences their function.Computational algorithms for multi-modal data integration have also emerged as powerful tools for connecting metabolism and immunity at the systems level. These approaches enable the integration of diverse data types, such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of immunometabolic regulation. For example, Jha et al. (2015) used a systems biology approach to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data, revealing novel metabolic pathways involved in macrophage activation.The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to immunometabolism research has further enhanced our ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Shen et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of machine learning algorithms to predict metabolic states of immune cells based on their transcriptomic profiles, highlighting the potential of these approaches for understanding immunometabolic regulation.Recent studies have also emphasized the importance of considering the broader physiological context when studying immunometabolism. Buck et al. (2017) reviewed how systemic metabolic changes, such as those occurring during obesity or caloric restriction, can profoundly impact immune cell function. This underscores the need for integrative approaches that consider both local and systemic metabolic influences on immunity.The development of in situ metabolomics techniques has provided new opportunities to study immunometabolism in intact tissues. Thiele et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of imaging mass spectrometry to map metabolic landscapes in lymphoid tissues, revealing spatial patterns of metabolite distribution that correlate with immune cell function and organization.As the field of immunometabolism continues to evolve, there is a growing emphasis on translating basic research findings into clinical applications. Patel and Powell (2017) discussed the potential of targeting immunometabolic pathways for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.In conclusion, systems immunology approaches to metabolism have significantly advanced our understanding of the complex interplay between immune responses and metabolic processes. The integration of next-generation technologies, such as spatially resolved metabolic imaging and computational algorithms for multi-modal data integration, promises to provide even more comprehensive insights into immunometabolic regulation. As the field continues to progress, these approaches will likely play a crucial role in unraveling the full complexity of immunometabolism and translating this knowledge into novel therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "A guide to immunometabolism for immunologists", "authors": "Luke A.
