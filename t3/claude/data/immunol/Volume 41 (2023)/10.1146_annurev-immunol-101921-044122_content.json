{"Literature Review": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in the fight against cancer, with T cells and natural killer (NK) cells playing crucial roles in tumor immunity. This literature review explores the synergistic potential of engaging both T cells and NK cells in cancer immunotherapies, highlighting recent advancements and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.T cells and NK cells have complementary functions in the immune response against cancer. T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are known for their ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells expressing specific antigens. NK cells, on the other hand, provide rapid, innate-like responses against transformed cells without the need for prior sensitization. The combination of these two cell types in cancer immunotherapy offers a powerful approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity.Recent studies have shed light on the intricate interplay between T cells and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment. Böttcher et al. (2018) demonstrated that NK cells play a crucial role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors, which in turn enhances the induction of CD8+ T cell responses. This finding highlights the importance of NK cells in initiating and amplifying adaptive immune responses against cancer. Furthermore, Fehniger et al. (2017) showed that IL-2 secreted by activated T cells can stimulate NK cell activation and proliferation, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces anti-tumor immunity.One area of particular interest in cancer immunotherapy is the targeting of immune evasion mechanisms. The NKG2D receptor, expressed on both NK cells and certain T cell subsets, has emerged as a promising target. Cheng et al. (2019) reported that tumor cells often downregulate or shed NKG2D ligands, such as MICA and MICB, to evade immune recognition. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring or enhancing NKG2D-mediated immune activation have shown promise in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials.Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance their anti-tumor activity. The CD161-CLEC2D axis, for instance, has been identified as a potential checkpoint in both T cell and NK cell responses. Mathewson et al. (2021) demonstrated that blocking CD161 signaling could enhance the cytotoxic activity of both cell types against various tumor models. Similarly, the TIGIT-CD155 interaction has been shown to suppress both T cell and NK cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. Zhang et al. (2020) reported that dual blockade of TIGIT on both cell types resulted in superior anti-tumor responses compared to targeting either population alone.Another shared inhibitory receptor-ligand system of interest is the NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E axis. André et al. (2018) showed that monalizumab, an anti-NKG2A antibody, could enhance both NK cell and CD8+ T cell responses against HLA-E-expressing tumors. This approach has shown promising results in early-phase clinical trials, particularly in combination with other immunotherapies.Cytokines play a crucial role in modulating the function of both T cells and NK cells within the tumor microenvironment. IL-15, for example, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to stimulate both cell types. Conlon et al. (2015) reported that recombinant IL-15 administration could expand and activate both NK cells and CD8+ T cells in cancer patients, leading to objective responses in some cases. Conversely, inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-β have been shown to suppress both T cell and NK cell functions. Mariathasan et al. (2018) demonstrated that blocking TGF-β signaling could enhance the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade by promoting T cell and NK cell infiltration and activation within tumors.Emerging therapeutic strategies are focusing on harnessing the synergistic potential of T cells and NK cells. Bi-specific and tri-specific engager antibodies that simultaneously target tumor antigens and activating receptors on both cell types have shown promise in preclinical studies. Gauthier et al. (2019) developed a tri-specific killer engager (TriKE) that could activate both NK cells and T cells against CD33-expressing acute myeloid leukemia cells, demonstrating enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to bi-specific approaches.In conclusion, the design of cancer immunotherapies that engage both T cells and NK cells represents a promising avenue for enhancing anti-tumor immunity. By targeting shared inhibitory and activating pathways, leveraging cytokine signaling, and developing novel multi-specific engagers, researchers are uncovering new opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. As our understanding of the complex interplay between these two cell types continues to grow, so too does the potential for developing more effective and durable cancer treatments.", "References": [{"title": "NK Cells Stimulate Recruitment of cDC1 into the Tumor Microenvironment Promoting Cancer Immune Control", "authors": "Julia P.
