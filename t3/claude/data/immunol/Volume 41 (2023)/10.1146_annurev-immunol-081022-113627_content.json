{"Literature Review": "The field of immunology has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, particularly in our understanding of myeloid cells and their diverse roles in tissue homeostasis and disease. This literature review focuses on the origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, with a particular emphasis on granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived monocytes and neutrophils.Myeloid cells, including granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, constitute a substantial portion of leukocytes within tissues. These cells play crucial roles in innate immunity, tissue homeostasis, and the orchestration of adaptive immune responses. Recent studies have shed light on the developmental origins, maturation processes, and tissue-specific specializations of these cells, revealing a complex landscape of myeloid cell heterogeneity.The concept of myeloid cell heterogeneity has been significantly advanced by the application of cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry. For instance, Villani et al. (2017) utilized these techniques to identify previously unrecognized subsets of human dendritic cells and monocytes, highlighting the complexity of myeloid cell populations. This study underscored the importance of unbiased approaches in uncovering the true extent of myeloid cell diversity.The developmental origin of tissue myeloid cells has been a subject of intense investigation. Fate-mapping studies in mice have provided valuable insights into the ontogeny of these cells. Ginhoux et al. (2010) demonstrated that microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system, originate from yolk sac progenitors and are maintained throughout life by self-renewal. This finding challenged the long-held belief that all tissue macrophages are derived from circulating monocytes.Further research has revealed that many tissue-resident macrophages are established prenatally and can persist into adulthood through local proliferation. Hashimoto et al. (2013) showed that alveolar macrophages are derived from fetal monocytes and maintain themselves independently of bone marrow input under steady-state conditions. These studies have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of macrophage ontogeny and maintenance.While the developmental origins of tissue-resident macrophages have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to the contributions of GMP-derived cells to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity. GMPs give rise to both granulocytes and monocytes, which can further differentiate into tissue-specific macrophages under certain conditions. Yona et al. (2013) demonstrated that Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes, derived from GMPs, can give rise to tissue-resident macrophages in certain contexts, such as during inflammation or in the absence of tissue-resident macrophages.The plasticity of monocytes and their ability to adapt to tissue-specific niches have been increasingly recognized. Gosselin et al. (2014) showed that tissue-specific factors can dramatically alter the enhancer landscape of macrophages, leading to unique transcriptional profiles and functional specializations. This finding highlights the importance of the local microenvironment in shaping myeloid cell phenotypes and functions.Neutrophils, another major population of GMP-derived cells, have also been shown to exhibit considerable heterogeneity. Traditionally viewed as short-lived, terminally differentiated cells, neutrophils are now recognized as a diverse population with varying phenotypes and functions. Silvestre-Roig et al. (2019) reviewed the emerging concept of neutrophil heterogeneity, discussing subsets with distinct roles in inflammation, cancer, and tissue repair.The impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function has been increasingly appreciated. Lavin et al. (2014) demonstrated that tissue-specific signals can rapidly reprogram the enhancer landscape of macrophages, leading to unique gene expression profiles. This tissue-specific reprogramming is crucial for the functional adaptation of myeloid cells to their local environment.During inflammation and disease, the heterogeneity of myeloid cells becomes even more pronounced. Mildner et al. (2013) showed that distinct monocyte subsets are recruited to sites of inflammation in a context-dependent manner, contributing to the diversity of inflammatory myeloid cells. Furthermore, the plasticity of these cells allows for rapid adaptation to changing environmental cues, as demonstrated by the reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages in response to immunotherapy (Guerriero et al., 2017).In conclusion, our understanding of tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity has evolved significantly in recent years. The contributions of GMP-derived cells, particularly monocytes and neutrophils, to this heterogeneity are increasingly recognized. The impact of tissue-specific factors on myeloid cell phenotype and function underscores the importance of considering the local microenvironment when studying these cells. As we continue to unravel the complexity of myeloid cell heterogeneity, new opportunities for therapeutic interventions targeting specific myeloid subsets in various diseases may emerge.", "References": [{"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors", "authors": "Alexandra-Chlo√© Villani, Rahul Satija, Gary Reynolds, Siranush Sarkizova, Karthik Shekhar, James Fletcher, Morgane Griesbeck, Andrew Butler, Shiwei Zheng, Suzan Lazo", "journal": "Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "356", "first page": "eaah4573", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aah4573"}, {"title": "Fate mapping analysis reveals that adult microglia derive from primitive macrophages", "authors": "Florent Ginhoux, Melanie Greter, Marylene Leboeuf, Sayan Nandi, Peter See, Solen Gokhan, Mark F.
