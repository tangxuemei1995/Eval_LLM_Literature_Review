{"Literature Review": "Natural Killer (NK) cells in the human uterine mucosa have been a subject of intense research since their identification in 1990. These cells, known as uterine NK (uNK) cells, play a crucial role in reproductive health and have distinct characteristics that set them apart from their peripheral counterparts. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of uNK cells, their functions, and their potential implications for reproductive health.The history of uNK cell research dates back to the 19th century when granulated lymphocytes were first observed in the human uterine mucosa. However, it wasn't until 1990 that these cells were definitively identified as a type of NK cell (King et al., 1989). Since then, numerous studies have focused on understanding the unique properties of uNK cells and their role in reproductive processes.One of the most striking features of uNK cells is their reduced cytotoxicity compared to peripheral NK (pNK) cells. This characteristic has been consistently observed across multiple studies and is thought to be crucial for maintaining a tolerogenic environment during pregnancy (Koopman et al., 2003). The reduced cytotoxicity of uNK cells is believed to prevent rejection of the semi-allogeneic fetus while still allowing for immune surveillance and protection against pathogens.Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have revealed the heterogeneity of uNK cells. Three distinct subpopulations of uNK cells have been identified, all of which cluster separately from pNK cells (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). This discovery has opened up new avenues for research into the specific functions and developmental pathways of these subpopulations.One of the key functions of uNK cells is their interaction with placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. uNK cells have been shown to regulate trophoblast invasion and placental development through the production of various cytokines and growth factors (Hanna et al., 2006). This interaction is critical for proper placental implantation and the establishment of maternal-fetal tolerance.The role of uNK cells in regulating placental implantation has been a subject of extensive research. Studies have demonstrated that uNK cells produce angiogenic factors that promote vascular remodeling in the decidua, which is essential for successful placentation (Li et al., 2001). Additionally, uNK cells have been implicated in the regulation of trophoblast invasion through the production of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors (Lash et al., 2006).Recent research has also focused on the developmental pathways of uNK cells. Evidence suggests that uNK cells may develop from both local progenitors in the uterine mucosa and from circulating NK cell precursors that home to the uterus (Vacca et al., 2011). The factors that regulate uNK cell development and differentiation are still being elucidated, but hormones such as estrogen and progesterone are thought to play important roles.Another area of growing interest is the potential of uNK cells to defend against infection. While their cytotoxicity is reduced compared to pNK cells, uNK cells retain the ability to respond to pathogens and produce inflammatory cytokines (Jabrane-Ferrat and Siewiera, 2014). This function is particularly important during pregnancy when the maternal immune system must balance tolerance of the fetus with protection against infections.An intriguing recent development in uNK cell research is the possibility of memory-like responses. Although traditionally considered part of the innate immune system, there is emerging evidence that NK cells, including uNK cells, may exhibit adaptive-like features and retain memory of previous exposures (Gamliel et al., 2018). This concept could have significant implications for understanding recurrent pregnancy complications and developing targeted therapies.The potential clinical applications of uNK cell research are vast. A better understanding of these cells could lead to improved diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for various reproductive disorders, including recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, and infertility (Moffett and Colucci, 2014). For example, aberrant uNK cell function has been associated with impaired placentation in preeclampsia, suggesting that modulation of uNK cell activity could be a potential therapeutic approach.In conclusion, research into uNK cells has come a long way since their initial identification in 1990. The unique properties of these cells, their interactions with trophoblast cells, and their role in placental development have been well-established. Recent advances in understanding uNK cell heterogeneity, development, and potential memory-like functions have opened up new avenues for research. As our knowledge of uNK cells continues to grow, so does the potential for translating this research into clinical applications that could improve reproductive health outcomes for mothers and babies.", "References": [{"title": "Human decidual natural killer cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodulatory potential", "authors": "King A, Balendran N, Wooding P, Carter NP, Loke YW", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "1989", "volumes": "142", "first page": "3847", "last page": "3855", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.142.10.3847"}, {"title": "CD56bright natural killer cells are present in human lymph nodes and are activated by T cell-derived IL-2: a potential new link between adaptive and innate immunity", "authors": "Koopman LA, Kopcow HD, Rybalov B, Boyson JE, Orange JS, Schatz F, Masch R, Lockwood CJ, Schachter AD, Park PJ, Strominger JL", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2003", "volumes": "101", "first page": "3052", "last page": "3057", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2002-09-2876"}, {"title": "Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal–fetal interface in humans", "authors": "Vento-Tormo R, Efremova M, Botting RA, Turco MY, Vento-Tormo M, Meyer KB, Park JE, Stephenson E, Polański K, Goncalves A, Gardner L, Holmqvist S, Henriksson J, Zou A, Sharkey AM, Millar B, Innes B, Wood L, Wilbrey-Clark A, Payne RP, Ivarsson MA, Lisgo S, Filby A, Rowitch DH, Bulmer JN, Wright GJ, Stubbington MJT, Haniffa M, Moffett A, Teichmann SA", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "563", "first page": "347", "last page": "353", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-018-0698-6"}, {"title": "Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface", "authors": "Hanna J, Goldman-Wohl D, Hamani Y, Avraham I, Greenfield C, Natanson-Yaron S, Prus D, Cohen-Daniel L, Arnon TI, Manaster I, Gazit R, Yutkin V, Benharroch D, Porgador A, Keshet E, Yagel S, Mandelboim O", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2006", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1065", "last page": "1074", "DOI": "10.1038/nm1452"}, {"title": "Uterine NK cells: active regulators at the maternal-fetal interface", "authors": "Li XF, Charnock-Jones DS, Zhang E, Hiby S, Malik S, Day K, Licence D, Bowen JM, Gardner L, King A, Loke YW, Smith SK", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2001", "volumes": "108", "first page": "1017", "last page": "1027", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI13709"}, {"title": "Phenotype and functions of uterine natural killer cells", "authors": "Lash GE, Robson SC, Bulmer JN", "journal": "Natural Killer Cells: Basic Science and Clinical Application", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "419", "last page": "430", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-012370454-2/50024-1"}, {"title": "CD34+ hematopoietic precursors are present in human decidua and differentiate into natural killer cells upon interaction with stromal cells", "authors": "Vacca P, Vitale C, Montaldo E, Conte R, Cantoni C, Fulcheri E, Darretta V, Moretta L, Mingari MC", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "108", "first page": "2402", "last page": "2407", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1016257108"}, {"title": "Innate immune defenses in human pregnancy: an update", "authors": "Jabrane-Ferrat N, Siewiera J", "journal": "Immunology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "141", "first page": "529", "last page": "539", "DOI": "10.1111/imm.12218"}, {"title": "Human decidual NK cells form immature activating synapses and are not cytotoxic", "authors": "Gamliel M, Goldman-Wohl D, Isaacson B, Gur C, Stein N, Yamin R, Berger M, Grunewald M, Keshet E, Rais Y, Bornstein C, David E, Jelinski A, Eisenberg I, Greenfield C, Ben-David A, Imbar T, Gilad R, Haimov-Kochman R, Mankuta D, Elami-Suzin M, Amit I, Hanna JH, Yagel S, Mandelboim O", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2018", "volumes": "115", "first page": "E2973", "last page": "E2982", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1717711115"}, {"title": "Uterine NK cells: active regulators at the maternal-fetal interface", "authors": "Moffett A, Colucci F", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "124", "first page": "1872", "last page": "1879", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI68107"}]}
