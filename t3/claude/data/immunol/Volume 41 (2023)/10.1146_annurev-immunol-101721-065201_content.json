{"Literature Review": "The field of immunology has greatly benefited from studies conducted in both mice and humans, particularly in understanding the genetic basis of immunity to infectious diseases. However, there has been a longstanding debate about the relevance and translatability of findings between these two species. This literature review aims to reconcile mouse and human immunology through the lens of genetics, focusing on the insights gained from studying inborn errors of immunity and their impact on susceptibility to infectious diseases. Historically, mouse models have been instrumental in elucidating fundamental immunological mechanisms. Takahashi et al. (2017) demonstrated the power of reverse genetics in mice, where specific genes can be manipulated to study their function in immunity. This approach has led to numerous discoveries, including the identification of key components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, as pointed out by Mestas and Hughes (2004), there are significant differences between mouse and human immune systems, which can lead to discrepancies in research findings. On the other hand, human studies have provided invaluable insights into naturally occurring mutations that affect immunity. The work of Casanova and Abel (2007) on human inborn errors of immunity has revealed the critical roles of specific genes in defending against particular pathogens. These studies have often yielded surprising results, sometimes contradicting findings from mouse models. The apparent discrepancies between mouse and human studies have led some researchers to question the relevance of mouse models in human immunology. However, Seok et al. (2013) argued that these differences might be overstated, and that a more nuanced approach is needed to interpret results across species. They proposed that the key lies in understanding the genetic basis of immune responses in both mice and humans. One of the main challenges in reconciling mouse and human immunology is the different experimental approaches used. While mouse studies often employ controlled infections and genetically identical animals, human studies are typically observational and involve genetically diverse populations. Nguyen et al. (2015) highlighted the importance of considering these methodological differences when comparing results between species. Despite these challenges, recent advances in genetic technologies have provided new opportunities to bridge the gap between mouse and human immunology. The development of humanized mouse models, as described by Rongvaux et al. (2014), allows for the study of human immune responses in a controlled mouse environment. These models have proven particularly useful in studying human-specific pathogens and immune responses that are not well-replicated in conventional mouse models. Furthermore, the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans has allowed for the identification of genetic variants associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases. Tian et al. (2017) demonstrated how these findings could be validated and further explored in mouse models, providing a powerful approach to understanding the genetic basis of immune responses across species. The field of systems immunology has also contributed significantly to reconciling mouse and human immunology. Brodin and Davis (2017) showed how integrating data from multiple levels of biological organization can provide a more comprehensive understanding of immune responses in both species. This approach has revealed conserved pathways and mechanisms that may not be apparent when focusing on individual genes or molecules. While genetic studies have provided valuable insights, it is important to recognize their limitations. Quintana-Murci (2019) emphasized the need for caution in interpreting results from reverse genetics studies, particularly when extrapolating findings from mice to humans. Forward genetics approaches, which start with a phenotype and work backwards to identify the underlying genetic cause, may provide more robust and translatable results. In conclusion, reconciling mouse and human immunology requires a careful and nuanced approach that considers the strengths and limitations of each model system. By focusing on genetically robust studies and integrating findings from both species, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of immunity to infection. As our understanding of the genetic basis of immune responses continues to grow, we can expect further convergence between mouse and human immunology, ultimately leading to improved strategies for preventing and treating infectious diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Of mice and not men: differences between mouse and human immunology", "authors": "Jordi Mestas, Christopher C.
