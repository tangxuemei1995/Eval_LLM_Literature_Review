{"Literature Review": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) has emerged as a crucial component of the innate immune system, complementing the well-established pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition. This review explores the current understanding of ETI, its mechanisms, and its significance in host defense against pathogens across various organisms.The innate immune system has long been known to rely on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect conserved PAMPs to initiate immune responses. However, this strategy alone is insufficient to combat the diverse array of pathogens that constantly evolve to evade detection. ETI addresses this limitation by focusing on the detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, or effectors, which are essential for pathogen survival and proliferation within the host.ETI was first described in plants as a mechanism to recognize pathogen effectors and trigger robust immune responses. Jones and Dangl (2006) proposed the 'zigzag model' of plant immunity, which integrates PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and ETI. This model highlights how pathogens evolve effectors to suppress PTI, and plants, in turn, develop resistance (R) proteins to recognize these effectors and activate ETI.The concept of ETI has since been extended to animal systems, revealing its importance across diverse phyla. Vance et al. (2009) reviewed the parallels between plant and animal innate immunity, emphasizing the conservation of ETI-like mechanisms. They proposed that many immune responses previously classified under other categories might actually represent forms of ETI.One of the key features of ETI is its ability to detect pathogen effectors indirectly. This 'guard hypothesis,' first proposed in plant immunity, suggests that host proteins monitor the integrity of cellular targets of pathogen effectors. When these targets are manipulated by effectors, the guard proteins detect the alterations and trigger immune responses. Dangl and Jones (2001) elaborated on this concept, explaining how it allows hosts to detect a wide range of effectors without the need for direct recognition.In animal systems, several examples of ETI-like mechanisms have been identified. Stuart et al. (2013) described how the caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome pathway in mice responds to cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is likely delivered by bacterial secretion systems. This mechanism represents a form of ETI, as it detects the activity of bacterial virulence factors rather than the LPS itself.Another example of ETI in animals is the detection of pathogen-induced host protein modifications. Orth et al. (2000) demonstrated that the Yersinia effector YopJ acetylates host kinases to inhibit immune signaling. Subsequent studies have shown that hosts have evolved mechanisms to detect such modifications and trigger immune responses.The importance of ETI in host defense is underscored by its ability to induce stronger and more sustained immune responses compared to PAMP recognition alone. Tsuda and Katagiri (2010) showed that in plants, ETI leads to more robust and prolonged activation of immune signaling pathways than PTI. Similar observations have been made in animal systems, suggesting that ETI may be crucial for mounting effective immune responses against virulent pathogens.ETI also plays a role in the evolution of host-pathogen interactions. As pathogens evolve new effectors to suppress host immunity, hosts develop new mechanisms to detect these effectors. This ongoing arms race drives the diversification of both effectors and host recognition systems. Dodds and Rathjen (2010) reviewed this co-evolutionary process in plant-pathogen interactions, highlighting its importance in shaping immune systems across species.Despite the growing recognition of ETI's importance, many aspects of its mechanisms and regulation remain to be elucidated. Spoel and Dong (2012) discussed the complex signaling networks involved in ETI, emphasizing the need for further research to understand how these pathways are integrated with other immune responses.In conclusion, ETI represents a sophisticated strategy for pathogen detection that complements PAMP-based recognition. Its ability to indirectly sense diverse and rapidly evolving effectors makes it a crucial component of innate immunity across various organisms. As research in this field progresses, it is likely that many more examples of ETI will be discovered, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and immune system evolution.", "References": [{"title": "The plant immune system", "authors": "Jones, Jonathan D.
