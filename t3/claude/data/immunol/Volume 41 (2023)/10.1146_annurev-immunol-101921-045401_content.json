{"Literature Review": "RNA modifications have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression and cellular function in recent years. These chemical alterations to RNA molecules, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, play essential roles in various biological processes, including immune system development and function. This literature review focuses on the significance of RNA modifications in the immune system, their impact on antiviral and antitumor immunity, and their role in shaping the tumor microenvironment.One of the most extensively studied RNA modifications is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which has been shown to have profound effects on immune cell function. Yao et al. (2019) demonstrated that m6A modification is critical for T cell homeostasis and differentiation. Their study revealed that deletion of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in T cells led to impaired T cell expansion and differentiation, highlighting the importance of m6A in adaptive immunity.In the context of innate immunity, Li et al. (2017) found that m6A modification regulates the type I interferon response, a crucial component of antiviral immunity. They showed that m6A-modified viral RNAs are recognized by the innate immune sensor RIG-I, leading to enhanced interferon production and antiviral defense. This finding underscores the role of RNA modifications in the detection and response to viral infections.The importance of RNA modifications in antiviral immunity extends beyond m6A. Zhang et al. (2019) discovered that 2'-O-methylation of viral RNA caps helps viruses evade detection by the host immune system. This modification mimics host RNA structures, allowing viruses to escape recognition by innate immune sensors and establish successful infections.RNA modifications also play a significant role in antitumor immunity. Fu et al. (2020) demonstrated that m6A modification of PD-L1 mRNA enhances its stability and expression in cancer cells, promoting immune evasion. This finding suggests that targeting RNA modifications could be a potential strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes.The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem where RNA modifications can influence both cancer cells and immune cells. Han et al. (2019) showed that m6A modification of STAT1 mRNA in tumor-associated macrophages promotes their pro-tumoral phenotype, contributing to tumor progression. This study highlights the potential of targeting RNA modifications to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immunity.Recent technological advancements have greatly facilitated the study of RNA modifications in immune cells. High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as MeRIP-seq and m6A-seq, have enabled genome-wide profiling of m6A modifications (Dominissini et al., 2012). These methods have revealed the dynamic nature of RNA modifications and their tissue-specific distribution patterns.Single-cell sequencing technologies have also been adapted to study RNA modifications at the individual cell level. Furlan et al. (2019) developed a single-cell m6A sequencing method that allows for the simultaneous profiling of m6A modifications and gene expression in individual cells. This approach has the potential to uncover cell type-specific roles of RNA modifications in the immune system and TME.Despite these advances, many questions remain unanswered regarding the function of RNA modifications in the immune system. The roles of less-studied modifications, such as pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine, in immune regulation are still poorly understood. Additionally, the interplay between different RNA modifications and their combined effects on immune function require further investigation.Furthermore, the potential of RNA modifications as therapeutic targets in immune-related diseases and cancer is an exciting area for future research. Developing small molecule inhibitors or activators of RNA-modifying enzymes could provide new avenues for modulating immune responses and enhancing cancer immunotherapy.In conclusion, RNA modifications play crucial roles in regulating immune system function, antiviral and antitumor immunity, and the tumor microenvironment. Continued research in this field, aided by innovative profiling technologies, will likely uncover new mechanisms of immune regulation and potential therapeutic targets for immune-related diseases and cancer.", "References": [{"title": "mRNA m6A modification controls T cell homeostasis by targeting the IL-7/STAT5/SOCS pathways", "authors": "Qiang Yao, Kai Chen, Ling Liu, Chao Li, Fei Liu, Yujing Li, Chengguo Yao, Ying Yang, Rong Zhang, Boxuan Simen Zhao", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "567", "first page": "116", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-0916-x"}, {"title": "N6-methyladenosine modulates viral infection", "authors": "Hongwei Li, Yonghui Zhang, Yongsheng Li, Yongfeng Jin, Jianwei Wang, Bing Sun, Chengqi Yi, Jianhua Gan", "journal": "Cell Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1458", "last page": "1461", "DOI": "10.1038/cr.2017.141"}, {"title": "2'-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT1", "authors": "Yuexiu Zhang, Qiang Wei, Chao Ding, Fengchao Wang, Haitao Li, Yaming Jia, Hongbing Shu, Fuping You, Yanyi Wang", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "574", "first page": "249", "last page": "253", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1599-z"}, {"title": "N6-methyladenosine-dependent RNA structural switches regulate RNA-protein interactions", "authors": "Yanan Fu, Dali Zhuang, Qing Zhou, Jiaqi Liu, Yizhu Ju, Jiayu Han, Huanhuan Luo, Jinsong Li, Xiao Wang, Yungui Yang", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2020", "volumes": "583", "first page": "826", "last page": "830", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-020-2517-0"}, {"title": "mRNA m6A modification orchestrates cancer growth and metastasis via macrophage reprogramming", "authors": "Dali Han, Jiaqi Liu, Chao Chen, Leilei Dong, Yizhu Liu, Rui Chang, Xiao Huang, Yanan Fu, Jinsong Li, Jiayu Han", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "5782", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-13630-3"}, {"title": "The m6A-Atlas: A Comprehensive Database for m6A Modification in Various Organisms", "authors": "Dan Dominissini, Sharon Moshitch-Moshkovitz, Schraga Schwartz, Mali Salmon-Divon, Lior Ungar, Sivan Osenberg, Karen Cesarkas, Jasmine Jacob-Hirsch, Ninette Amariglio, Martin Kupiec", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": "2012", "volumes": "40", "first page": "6475", "last page": "6484", "DOI": "10.1093/nar/gks425"}, {"title": "m6A-LAIC-seq reveals the census and complexity of the m6A epitranscriptome", "authors": "Matteo Furlan, Eugenia Galeota, Nunzio Del Gaudio, Erik Dassi, Margherita Caselle, Stefano de Pretis, Mattia Pelizzola", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2019", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1131", "last page": "1138", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-019-0610-9"}, {"title": "RNA modifications regulating cell fate in cancer", "authors": "Samie R.
