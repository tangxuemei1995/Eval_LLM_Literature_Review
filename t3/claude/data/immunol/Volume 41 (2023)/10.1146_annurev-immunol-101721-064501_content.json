{"Literature Review": "The aging process is accompanied by significant changes in the immune system, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence. This review focuses on the dramatic remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging, with particular emphasis on the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets and their contribution to tissue deterioration.One of the most prominent features of immunosenescence is the reduction of the naive T cell pool. This decline is primarily attributed to thymic involution, a process that begins in early adulthood and results in a progressive decrease in thymic output of naive T cells (Nikolich-Žugich, 2018). As a consequence, the proportion of memory-like T cells increases, leading to a shift in the overall T cell repertoire.The accumulation of memory-like T cells in older individuals is characterized by the acquisition of a terminally differentiated phenotype. These cells exhibit reduced expression of costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, and gain properties associated with cellular senescence (Callender et al., 2018). The loss of CD28 expression is particularly significant, as it impairs T cell activation and proliferation, contributing to the overall decline in immune function observed in the elderly.Among the age-associated T cell subsets that accumulate during aging, extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer (NK) properties have garnered significant attention. These cells, often referred to as NK-like T cells, express NK cell receptors and exhibit enhanced cytotoxic activity (Pereira & Akbar, 2016). The accumulation of NK-like T cells in aged individuals may contribute to increased tissue damage and inflammation, as their potent cytotoxic activity can lead to collateral damage of healthy cells.Another important subset of age-associated T cells is the exhausted T cell population. These cells are characterized by altered cytokine production and reduced proliferative capacity (Wherry & Kurachi, 2015). The accumulation of exhausted T cells during aging may impair the ability of the immune system to mount effective responses against pathogens and tumors, contributing to the increased susceptibility to infections and cancer observed in older individuals.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) also undergo significant changes during aging. While Tregs typically play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity, age-associated Tregs have been shown to gain proinflammatory features (Garg et al., 2014). This shift in Treg function may contribute to the low-grade chronic inflammation observed in aged individuals, a phenomenon known as inflammaging.A common feature among these age-associated T cell subsets is their altered migratory behavior. These cells lose their lymph node homing capacity and preferentially migrate to nonlymphoid tissues (Thome et al., 2014). This redistribution of T cells can have significant consequences for tissue homeostasis and function. The accumulation of proinflammatory and cytotoxic T cells in nonlymphoid tissues may contribute to tissue deterioration and exacerbate age-related pathologies.The impact of these age-associated T cell subsets on tissue deterioration is multifaceted. Extremely cytotoxic NK-like T cells can directly damage tissue through their potent cytolytic activity. Exhausted T cells, while less functionally active, may still contribute to tissue inflammation through the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Age-associated Tregs with proinflammatory properties can further amplify the inflammatory milieu within tissues.The accumulation of these T cell subsets in nonlymphoid tissues also contributes to the phenomenon of inflammaging. Inflammaging is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state that is associated with various age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer (Franceschi et al., 2018). The presence of proinflammatory T cell subsets in tissues can perpetuate this inflammatory state, creating a vicious cycle of tissue damage and inflammation.Understanding the mechanisms underlying the accumulation and functional alterations of these age-associated T cell subsets is crucial for developing interventions to mitigate their detrimental effects. Several factors have been implicated in driving these changes, including chronic antigenic stimulation, oxidative stress, and cellular senescence (Goronzy & Weyand, 2017). Targeting these underlying mechanisms may offer opportunities to modulate the age-associated T cell compartment and improve immune function in the elderly.In conclusion, the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets during aging represents a significant aspect of immunosenescence. These subsets, including NK-like cytotoxic T cells, exhausted T cells, and proinflammatory Tregs, contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging through their altered functional properties and preferential migration to nonlymphoid tissues. Further research into the mechanisms driving these changes and their impact on age-related diseases is essential for developing strategies to promote healthy aging and maintain immune function in older individuals.", "References": [{"title": "The twilight of immunity: emerging concepts in aging of the immune system", "authors": "Janko Nikolich-Žugich", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "10", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1038/s41590-017-0006-x"}, {"title": "CD28−CD8+ T cells are significantly associated with all-cause mortality in elderly humans", "authors": "Laura A.
