{"Literature Review": "The complement system, a crucial component of innate immunity, has emerged as a key player in various neurological processes, including neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. This literature review aims to explore the multifaceted roles of complement in the brain, with a particular focus on its implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).Complement proteins, traditionally known for their role in immune defense, have been found to be expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. The discovery of complement's involvement in synaptic pruning during neurodevelopment has revolutionized our understanding of its functions beyond immunity. Schafer et al. (2012) demonstrated that complement proteins C1q and C3 tag synapses for elimination by microglia during postnatal development, a process crucial for refining neural circuits.Building on this finding, Stevens et al. (2007) showed that C1q deficiency leads to enhanced synaptic connectivity and epileptogenesis, highlighting the importance of complement-mediated synaptic pruning in maintaining normal brain function. These studies underscore the dual nature of complement in the CNS: while it is essential for proper neurodevelopment, its dysregulation can contribute to pathological conditions.In the context of neuroinflammation, complement activation has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Hong et al. (2016) provided evidence that early synapse loss in AD models is mediated by complement and microglia. They found that inhibition of C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade, reduced the number of phagocytic microglia and rescued synapses in AD mouse models, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.Complement's role in neuroinflammation extends beyond synaptic pruning. Alawieh et al. (2018) demonstrated that complement activation contributes to secondary neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits following traumatic brain injury. Their study showed that targeted inhibition of the complement cascade using CR2-Crry, a complement inhibitor, reduced neuroinflammation and improved cognitive outcomes in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.While complement activation can exacerbate neuroinflammation, it also plays a neuroprotective role under certain circumstances. Benard et al. (2008) showed that C3a, a complement activation product, protects against NMDA-induced neuronal cell death in vitro and reduces infarct volume in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. This highlights the complex nature of complement in the CNS and the need for careful consideration when developing complement-targeted therapies.The role of complement in adult neural plasticity has also gained attention. Perez-Alcazar et al. (2014) demonstrated that C1q is involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult visual cortex. They found that C1q knockout mice showed impaired ocular dominance plasticity, suggesting that complement proteins continue to play a role in synaptic remodeling beyond development.Recent advances in multi-omic technologies have provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complement's functions in the brain. Sekar et al. (2016) used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify complement component 4 (C4) as a risk factor for schizophrenia. They found that increased C4A expression leads to excessive synaptic pruning, potentially explaining the reduced synaptic density observed in schizophrenia patients.The growing understanding of complement's diverse roles in the CNS has led to increased interest in developing complement-targeted therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. Lansita et al. (2017) reported the development of ANX005, a humanized anti-C1q antibody, which showed promise in reducing neuroinflammation and synaptic loss in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases.However, the development of complement-targeted therapies for CNS disorders presents unique challenges. As highlighted by Morgan and Harris (2015), the blood-brain barrier poses a significant obstacle for drug delivery, and systemic complement inhibition may increase susceptibility to infections. Therefore, strategies for targeted delivery of complement inhibitors to the CNS are needed to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.In conclusion, the complement system plays diverse and sometimes contradictory roles in the brain, contributing to neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. While complement activation can exacerbate neurodegenerative processes, it is also essential for normal brain development and function. The challenge for future research lies in developing precision therapeutics that can modulate specific complement pathways in the CNS while preserving its beneficial functions. As our understanding of complement's roles in the brain continues to evolve, it holds promise for the development of novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders.", "References": [{"title": "The complement system: an unexpected role in synaptic pruning during development and disease", "authors": "Beth Stevens, Nicola J.
