{"Literature Review": "The practice of public discounting has long been a subject of debate in economics and public policy. This literature review examines the current state of public discounting systems in Western countries and explores the potential for improvement through risk-adjusted discount rates. Traditionally, most Western countries have employed a single discount rate for evaluating public investments and policies. This approach, while straightforward, has been increasingly criticized for its inability to account for the differential cost of risk across various projects and investments. As noted by Arrow and Lind, risk markets consistently demonstrate surprisingly large prices of risk, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach to discounting may be inadequate. The use of a single discount rate has significant implications for capital allocation and welfare. Boardman et al. argue that the current discounting guidelines lead to a misallocation of capital, resulting in substantial welfare costs. This misallocation occurs because projects with different risk profiles are evaluated using the same discount rate, potentially leading to the selection of suboptimal investments. The asset pricing literature provides a strong foundation for risk-adjusting discount rates in public investment evaluation. Cochrane demonstrates that asset pricing models can be applied to public investments, offering a more nuanced approach to discounting that accounts for project-specific risks. Building on this work, Weitzman proposes that discount rates should be adjusted based on the correlation between project returns and overall economic growth. A key insight from the literature is that project-specific discount rates should be increasing in the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This approach recognizes the insurance benefit of projects that provide greater returns in low-income states. As Barro notes, such projects can act as a hedge against economic downturns, providing valuable social insurance. The implementation of risk-adjusted discount rates in public policy evaluation has been explored in various contexts. For instance, Stern argues for the use of lower discount rates in climate change mitigation projects, reflecting the long-term and potentially catastrophic nature of climate risks. Similarly, Nordhaus proposes a climate-specific discount rate that accounts for the unique characteristics of climate change investments. While the theoretical justification for risk-adjusted discount rates is strong, practical implementation remains a challenge. Drupp et al. survey expert opinions on social discounting and find a wide range of views on appropriate discount rates and methodologies. This highlights the need for clear guidelines and methodologies for estimating project-specific discount rates. One promising approach is the estimation of income elasticities for project net benefits. As suggested by Gollier, this method requires evaluators to estimate an additional parameter – the income elasticity – on top of what is already required in the current approach. While this adds some complexity to the evaluation process, it provides a more accurate assessment of project value and risk. The potential welfare benefits of reforming public discounting systems are substantial. Emmerling et al. demonstrate that adopting risk-adjusted discount rates can lead to significant improvements in the allocation of public resources and overall social welfare. This is particularly relevant in areas such as infrastructure investment, environmental policy, and long-term research and development projects. In conclusion, the literature strongly supports a move towards risk-adjusted discount rates in public investment evaluation. This approach, grounded in asset pricing theory and supported by empirical evidence, offers a more nuanced and accurate method for assessing the value of public investments. While challenges remain in implementation, the potential benefits in terms of improved capital allocation and increased social welfare make this an important area for further research and policy development.", "References": [{"title": "Discounting and risk adjustment", "authors": "Christian Gollier", "journal": "Annual Review of Resource Economics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "6", "first page": "195", "last page": "214", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012516"}, {"title": "Uncertainty and the evaluation of public investment decisions", "authors": "Kenneth J.
