{"Literature Review": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative reference rates has been a significant development in global financial markets. This literature review examines the rise and fall of LIBOR, the emergence of new benchmarks, and the implications of this transition for financial markets and institutions.LIBOR, established in the 1980s, became the primary benchmark for short-term interest rates globally. Duffie and Stein (2015) highlight that LIBOR's widespread adoption was due to its perceived reliability and its role in facilitating risk management across various financial instruments. However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed significant flaws in the LIBOR system.The LIBOR scandal, uncovered in 2012, revealed widespread manipulation of the benchmark by panel banks. Abrantes-Metz and Sokol (2012) provide a comprehensive analysis of the scandal, detailing how banks colluded to influence LIBOR rates for their own benefit. This manipulation undermined the credibility of LIBOR and sparked a global effort to reform benchmark rates.In response to the LIBOR scandal, regulators worldwide initiated efforts to transition to more robust and transparent benchmarks. Schrimpf and Sushko (2019) discuss the development of risk-free rates (RFRs) as alternatives to LIBOR, highlighting the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States, the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) in the UK, and the Euro Short-Term Rate (â‚¬STR) in the Eurozone.The transition to RFRs presents both opportunities and challenges. Duffie and Krishnamurthy (2016) argue that the adoption of transaction-based benchmarks like SOFR can enhance market efficiency and reduce manipulation risks. However, they also note that the transition may lead to significant operational and legal challenges for financial institutions.One key debate in the post-LIBOR era concerns the merits of risk-free rates versus credit-sensitive rates. Hou and Skeie (2014) examine the theoretical foundations of benchmark rates, suggesting that credit-sensitive rates may better reflect banks' funding costs. However, proponents of RFRs argue that these rates are more robust and less susceptible to manipulation.The adoption of SOFR as the primary benchmark in the US has not been without controversy. Duffie and Stein (2015) discuss the potential limitations of SOFR, including its lack of a term structure and its potential divergence from bank funding costs during periods of market stress. These concerns have led to the development of alternative credit-sensitive benchmarks such as Ameribor and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY).The transition to new benchmarks has significant implications for derivative markets. Karouzakis et al. (2021) analyze the impact of the LIBOR transition on interest rate derivatives, finding that the shift to RFRs may lead to changes in market liquidity and pricing dynamics. They emphasize the need for market participants to adapt their risk management strategies in light of these changes.The global nature of financial markets necessitates international coordination in benchmark reform. Duffie et al. (2013) discuss the challenges of coordinating benchmark transitions across jurisdictions, highlighting the potential for market fragmentation if different regions adopt incompatible benchmarks.As the post-LIBOR era unfolds, questions remain about the optimal structure of benchmark regimes. Some scholars, such as Duffie and Stein (2015), argue for a multi-rate approach that combines RFRs with credit-sensitive benchmarks to meet diverse market needs. Others advocate for a single-benchmark regime centered on RFRs to promote market consistency and reduce complexity.In conclusion, the transition from LIBOR to new benchmarks represents a significant shift in global financial markets. While progress has been made in developing more robust and transparent benchmarks, challenges remain in terms of market adoption, risk management, and international coordination. Further research is needed to assess the long-term implications of different benchmark regimes and to guide policymakers in creating a stable and efficient post-LIBOR financial system.", "References": [{"title": "Reforming LIBOR and Other Financial Market Benchmarks", "authors": "Darrell Duffie, Jeremy C.
