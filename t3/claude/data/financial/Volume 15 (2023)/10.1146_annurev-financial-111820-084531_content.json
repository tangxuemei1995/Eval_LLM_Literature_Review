{"Literature Review": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a critical parameter in evaluating public investments and policies, particularly those with long-term impacts such as climate change mitigation. This literature review examines the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and ongoing debates surrounding the SDR, with a focus on its implications for government decision-making and intergenerational equity.The concept of discounting future costs and benefits is rooted in the time value of money and opportunity costs. However, when applied to public projects, especially those with multi-generational impacts, the choice of discount rate becomes ethically and economically complex. Stern (2007) famously used a near-zero pure rate of time preference in his influential report on climate change economics, sparking intense debate about the appropriate SDR for long-term environmental policies.One key strand of literature focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of the SDR. Ramsey (1928) provided the seminal framework for optimal growth models, which forms the basis for many SDR calculations. The Ramsey equation relates the SDR to the pure rate of time preference, the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, and the growth rate of per capita consumption. Subsequent work by Arrow et al. (2014) has expanded on this framework, incorporating uncertainty and risk considerations.The choice of SDR has significant practical implications for policy evaluation. Boardman et al. (2018) demonstrate how different discount rates can dramatically alter the net present value of long-term projects, potentially leading to vastly different policy recommendations. This is particularly relevant for climate change policies, where costs are often immediate while benefits accrue over centuries.A contentious issue in the literature is whether a declining discount rate (DDR) should be used for long-term projects. Gollier and Weitzman (2010) argue that uncertainty about future economic growth justifies the use of a DDR, as it places more weight on worse-case scenarios in the distant future. This approach has been adopted by some governments, including the UK, but remains controversial.The treatment of risk in SDR calculations is another area of active research. While some argue for a risk-free rate based on government bonds, others advocate for risk-adjusted rates that reflect the systematic risk of public projects. Baumstark and Gollier (2014) propose a model that incorporates both macroeconomic and project-specific risks into the SDR framework.Intergenerational equity concerns are central to many SDR debates. Nordhaus (2007) argues for a higher discount rate based on observed market rates and intergenerational neutrality, while others like Stern advocate for lower rates to give more weight to future generations' welfare. This philosophical divide underscores the ethical dimensions of SDR selection.Recent literature has also explored the legal and institutional aspects of SDR determination. Sunstein (2014) examines how different government agencies approach discount rate selection and argues for more consistency in practice. The disconnect between financial economics principles and common government practices in SDR selection, as noted by Burgess and Zerbe (2011), remains a significant challenge.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new relevance to SDR discussions, as governments evaluate large-scale interventions with both immediate and long-term impacts. Gollier (2020) argues that the pandemic highlights the need for robust SDR frameworks that can account for rare, high-impact events.In conclusion, while there is broad agreement on the importance of the SDR in public policy evaluation, significant debates persist regarding its theoretical foundations, practical application, and ethical implications. As governments grapple with long-term challenges like climate change, the need for principled, consistent approaches to SDR selection becomes increasingly urgent. Future research directions may include refining methods for incorporating uncertainty and risk, developing more robust frameworks for addressing intergenerational equity, and bridging the gap between economic theory and government practice in SDR determination.", "References": [{"title": "The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review", "authors": "Nicholas Stern", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511817434"}, {"title": "A Mathematical Theory of Saving", "authors": "Frank P.
