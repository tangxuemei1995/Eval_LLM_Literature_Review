{"Literature Review": "The landscape of initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with 2021 witnessing a remarkable surge in activity followed by a sharp decline in 2022. This literature review aims to explore the recent developments in IPOs and SPACs, examining the factors contributing to these trends and their implications for the financial markets.The IPO market has historically been characterized by cyclical patterns, with periods of high activity followed by lulls. Gao, Ritter, and Zhu (2013) documented a decline in IPO activity in the United States from 2001 to 2012, attributing this trend to changes in the business environment that made it more advantageous for small companies to sell out to larger organizations rather than remain independent. However, recent years have seen a resurgence in IPO activity, particularly in 2021, which saw a record number of listings.One of the key drivers of this IPO boom has been the rise of 'unicorns' – private companies valued at $1 billion or more. Brown and Kapadia (2007) noted that the increasing prevalence of these high-value private companies has been partly fueled by investments from mutual funds, which have sought to gain exposure to high-growth opportunities before they go public. This trend has led to a shift in the traditional venture capital ecosystem, with companies staying private for longer periods and achieving higher valuations before considering public listings.The surge in IPO activity has also been accompanied by changes in listing mechanisms. While traditional IPOs remain common, alternative methods such as direct listings and SPAC mergers have gained popularity. Klausner, Ohlrogge, and Ruan (2022) analyzed the rise of SPACs, highlighting their appeal to companies seeking a faster and potentially less costly route to public markets. However, they also noted concerns about the alignment of interests between SPAC sponsors and investors, as well as the potential for dilution of shareholder value.Direct listings have emerged as another alternative to traditional IPOs, allowing companies to list their shares without raising new capital. Horton (2019) examined the advantages of direct listings, including reduced underwriting fees and the absence of lock-up periods for existing shareholders. However, he also noted potential drawbacks, such as increased volatility and the lack of a price stabilization mechanism typically provided by underwriters in traditional IPOs.The governance structures of newly public companies have also evolved, with an increasing number of firms adopting dual-class share structures. Bebchuk and Kastiel (2017) discussed the implications of these structures, which typically grant founders and early investors disproportionate voting rights. While proponents argue that such structures allow visionary leaders to pursue long-term strategies without short-term market pressures, critics contend that they can entrench management and reduce accountability to shareholders.Regulatory changes have also played a role in shaping the IPO landscape. The JOBS Act of 2012 introduced provisions such as confidential filing, which allows companies to submit draft registration statements for SEC review without public disclosure. Dambra, Field, and Gustafson (2015) found that this provision has encouraged more companies to pursue IPOs, particularly in industries with high proprietary costs of disclosure.Despite the recent boom in public listings, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) remain a significant exit strategy for venture-backed companies. Gao, Ritter, and Zhu (2013) noted that the economies of scope and scale in many industries often make it more profitable for small, innovative companies to sell out to larger firms rather than operate independently.The dramatic decline in IPO and SPAC activity in 2022 following the 2021 boom highlights the volatile nature of these markets. Factors contributing to this decline include rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about overvaluation in certain sectors. Ritter (2022) analyzed the performance of IPOs and SPACs during this period, finding that many companies that went public during the boom subsequently underperformed the broader market.In conclusion, the recent developments in IPOs and SPACs reflect broader changes in the financial markets and corporate landscape. While new listing mechanisms and regulatory changes have provided companies with more options for going public, challenges remain in terms of valuation, governance, and long-term performance. As the market continues to evolve, further research will be needed to understand the implications of these trends for investors, companies, and regulators alike.", "References": [{"title": "Where Have All the IPOs Gone?", "authors": "Xiaohui Gao, Jay R.
