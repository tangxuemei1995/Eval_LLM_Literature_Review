{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is a critical element in evaluating long-term public projects and policies, particularly those with intergenerational consequences. This literature review explores the complexities surrounding the determination of the appropriate SDR, focusing on the impact of missing participants, missing markets, borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy.The traditional approach to determining the SDR has been to use market interest rates as a proxy for society's time preference. However, this approach has been challenged by numerous scholars who argue that market rates may not accurately reflect the preferences of all members of society, particularly when considering long-term, intergenerational projects.One of the primary concerns in this debate is the issue of missing participants. As highlighted by Arrow et al. (2013), market interest rates only reflect the preferences of current market participants, potentially excluding the interests of future generations and those currently unable to participate in financial markets due to borrowing constraints. This exclusion can lead to a misalignment between market rates and the true social discount rate.The problem of borrowing constraints has been extensively studied in the literature. Hubbard and Judd (1986) demonstrated that the presence of liquidity constraints can significantly affect individuals' consumption and saving decisions, potentially leading to higher personal discount rates than those observed in market interest rates. This finding suggests that the use of market rates as the SDR may underestimate the true social cost of delayed consumption for constrained individuals.Intergenerational transfers and altruism also play a crucial role in the determination of the appropriate SDR. Barro (1974) proposed the concept of intergenerational altruism, suggesting that current generations may derive utility from the well-being of future generations. This altruistic behavior could justify the use of a lower SDR for long-term projects that benefit future generations. However, the extent of such altruism and its implications for the SDR remain subjects of ongoing debate.The desire for legacy, as discussed by Andreoni (1990) in the context of charitable giving, provides another argument for a lower SDR. Individuals may derive utility from the act of giving itself, including leaving a positive legacy for future generations. This 'warm glow' effect could lead to a preference for investments in long-term projects that benefit future generations, even if such investments yield lower financial returns than alternative short-term options.The concept of missing markets is also crucial in this discussion. Weitzman (1998) argued that the far future should be discounted at the lowest possible rate due to uncertainty about future economic conditions and the absence of markets for long-term risks. This perspective challenges the use of observable market rates for discounting very long-term projects.Despite these arguments for a lower SDR, some scholars maintain that market interest rates should still play a significant role in determining the SDR. Nordhaus (2007) argued that using a low discount rate for climate change mitigation could lead to excessive current sacrifices and potentially reduce overall welfare. He emphasized the importance of considering opportunity costs and the potential for economic growth in determining the appropriate SDR.An interesting perspective on this debate is provided by Cropper and Laibson (1999), who introduced the concept of hyperbolic discounting into the discussion of the SDR. They argued that individuals' time preferences are not constant but decline over time, which could justify the use of a declining discount rate for long-term projects.The literature also highlights the importance of considering distributional effects when determining the SDR. Dasgupta (2008) argued that the SDR should reflect not only efficiency considerations but also equity concerns, particularly in the context of climate change policies that have differential impacts across regions and generations.In conclusion, while market interest rates provide a useful starting point for determining the SDR, the literature suggests that a more nuanced approach is necessary. Factors such as missing participants, borrowing constraints, intergenerational altruism, the desire for legacy, and missing markets all point towards the potential need for a lower SDR, particularly for long-term, intergenerational projects. However, the exact determination of the appropriate SDR remains a complex and contentious issue, requiring careful consideration of both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence.", "References": [{"title": "Some Basic Economics of Extreme Climate Change", "authors": "Martin L.
