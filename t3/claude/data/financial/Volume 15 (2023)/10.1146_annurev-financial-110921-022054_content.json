{"Literature Review": "The issue of unfunded public pension obligations has become a critical concern for state and local governments in the United States, representing their largest liability. This literature review examines recent trends in state and local pension funds, focusing on the discrepancy between reported and market-based valuations, the impact of discount rates, and the increasing reliance on risky investments.The magnitude of unfunded pension liabilities has been a subject of extensive research. Novy-Marx and Rauh (2011) estimated that the market value of unfunded pension promises for state and local plans exceeded $3 trillion in 2009, significantly higher than the reported values. More recent studies have shown that this gap has continued to widen. For instance, Aubry and Wandrei (2020) found that the aggregate funded ratio for state and local plans was 72.8% in 2019, based on reported actuarial values.The discrepancy between reported and market-based valuations is largely attributed to the use of different discount rates. Pension funds typically use discount rates based on expected investment returns, which are significantly higher than risk-free rates. Andonov et al. (2017) demonstrated that public plans in the United States use higher discount rates compared to their counterparts in other countries, leading to an underestimation of liabilities. This practice has been criticized by many researchers, including Brown and Wilcox (2009), who argued that pension liabilities should be discounted using rates that reflect their risk characteristics, typically lower than the expected return on assets.The choice of discount rate not only affects the valuation of existing liabilities but also impacts the calculation of yearly pension costs for newly accruing liabilities. Biggs (2019) showed that using market-based discount rates would significantly increase the normal cost of pensions, potentially doubling or tripling the reported figures in some cases. This underestimation of costs has contributed to the persistent underfunding of many public pension plans.In response to funding pressures and low interest rates, public pension funds have increasingly turned to riskier investments in search of higher returns. Aubry and Crawford (2019) documented a significant shift in asset allocation over the past two decades, with public plans reducing their holdings of fixed-income securities and increasing their exposure to equities and alternative investments. This trend has been particularly pronounced in the case of alternative investments, such as private equity, hedge funds, and real estate.The growing allocation to alternative investments has been a subject of debate in the literature. While some studies, such as Andonov et al. (2018), have found that certain alternative investments, particularly private equity, have outperformed public markets, others have raised concerns about the associated risks and costs. Phalippou (2020) argued that the reported outperformance of private equity might be overstated due to issues with performance measurement and fee structures.The increased reliance on risky assets has also led to greater volatility in investment returns and funding ratios. Munnell et al. (2018) showed that the funded status of public plans is highly sensitive to market fluctuations, with significant declines observed during economic downturns. This volatility can create challenges for government budgeting and may lead to increased contributions during periods of fiscal stress.The underfunding of public pensions has broader implications for state and local governments. Hochberg and Rauh (2013) found evidence of a crowding-out effect, where increased pension contributions lead to reduced spending on other government services. Moreover, Shoag (2013) demonstrated that pension funding status affects government borrowing costs, with poorly funded plans facing higher interest rates on their debt.Recent years have seen various reform efforts aimed at addressing the pension funding challenge. Munnell et al. (2020) documented a range of measures implemented by state and local governments, including benefit reductions for new hires, increased employee contributions, and changes to cost-of-living adjustments. However, the effectiveness of these reforms has been limited by legal protections for accrued benefits and political constraints.In conclusion, the literature reveals a complex and challenging landscape for state and local pension funds. The persistent gap between reported and market-based valuations, coupled with the increasing allocation to risky assets, underscores the need for greater transparency and risk management in public pension systems. As governments continue to grapple with these issues, further research is needed to evaluate the long-term impacts of recent reforms and to develop sustainable funding strategies that balance the interests of public employees, taxpayers, and future generations.", "References": [{"title": "Public Pension Promises: How Big Are They and What Are They Worth?", "authors": "Robert Novy-Marx, Joshua D.
