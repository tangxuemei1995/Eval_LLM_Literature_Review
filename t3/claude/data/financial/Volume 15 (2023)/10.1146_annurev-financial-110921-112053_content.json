{"Literature Review": "The field of macro-finance has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with a growing emphasis on incorporating nonlinear dynamics into models to better capture the complexities of financial markets and their interactions with the broader economy. This literature review focuses on the development and implications of macro-finance models featuring nonlinear dynamics, particularly those incorporating funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions.Funding liquidity constraints have emerged as a crucial component in macro-finance models with nonlinear dynamics. Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) introduced a continuous-time macroeconomic model with financial frictions, demonstrating how the economy can enter a highly volatile state when financial constraints bind. Their model showcases how small shocks can lead to large, persistent effects due to nonlinear amplification mechanisms. Similarly, He and Krishnamurthy (2013) developed a model where intermediary capital plays a critical role in asset pricing, showing how constraints on intermediary capital can lead to nonlinear dynamics in risk premia and asset prices.Market liquidity frictions have also been incorporated into macro-finance models to capture important nonlinear effects. Adrian and Boyarchenko (2012) presented a model where market liquidity is endogenously determined by the capital of financial intermediaries, leading to nonlinear dynamics in asset prices and macroeconomic variables. Their work highlights how liquidity spirals can amplify initial shocks and lead to persistent effects on the real economy. Gertler and Kiyotaki (2015) further expanded on this concept by developing a model of banking that incorporates both liquidity and solvency risks, demonstrating how these factors can interact to produce nonlinear dynamics in credit provision and economic activity.Bank run frictions represent another important source of nonlinearity in macro-finance models. Diamond and Dybvig (1983) laid the groundwork for this literature with their seminal model of bank runs, which has since been incorporated into more comprehensive macro-finance frameworks. For instance, Gertler et al. (2020) developed a model that integrates bank runs into a macroeconomic framework, showing how the possibility of runs can lead to nonlinear dynamics in bank lending and economic activity. Their work demonstrates how the threat of runs can amplify the effects of negative shocks and lead to sudden stops in credit provision.The empirical evidence supporting the importance of nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models has been growing. Hubrich and Tetlow (2015) used a regime-switching VAR model to show that financial stress has nonlinear effects on the macroeconomy, with particularly strong impacts during periods of high financial stress. Their findings underscore the importance of incorporating nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models to accurately capture the relationship between financial markets and the real economy.Despite the progress made in developing macro-finance models with nonlinear dynamics, several challenges remain. One significant challenge is the computational complexity associated with solving these models. Traditional linearization techniques often fail to capture important nonlinear effects, necessitating the use of more sophisticated solution methods. Fernández-Villaverde and Levintal (2018) provided a comprehensive overview of various solution techniques for nonlinear DSGE models, including perturbation methods, projection methods, and hybrid approaches. Their work highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy in different solution methods.Another challenge lies in the empirical estimation and validation of these models. The presence of nonlinear dynamics often leads to non-Gaussian distributions and time-varying volatility, which can complicate traditional estimation techniques. Herbst and Schorfheide (2015) developed novel Bayesian estimation methods for nonlinear DSGE models, addressing some of these challenges and providing a framework for bringing these models to the data.The importance of nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models is further underscored by the limitations of linear approximations. As highlighted in the abstract, local linearization approximations often omit important nonlinear dynamics and can yield biased impulse responses. This observation is consistent with the findings of Lindé and Trabandt (2018), who demonstrated that linear approximations can lead to significant errors in policy analysis, particularly during periods of economic stress.In conclusion, the development of macro-finance models featuring nonlinear dynamics represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the complex interactions between financial markets and the macroeconomy. These models, incorporating funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions, have provided valuable insights into the amplification mechanisms that can lead to severe economic downturns. While challenges remain in terms of computational complexity and empirical estimation, the growing body of literature in this field suggests that nonlinear dynamics will continue to play a crucial role in macro-finance modeling and policy analysis in the years to come.", "References": [{"title": "A macroeconomic model with a financial sector", "authors": "Markus K.
