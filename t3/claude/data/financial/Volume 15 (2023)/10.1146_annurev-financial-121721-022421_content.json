{"Literature Review": "The social discount rate is a critical component in evaluating the long-term impacts of government policies and projects. This concept has been the subject of extensive legal scrutiny and philosophical debate, particularly concerning its application to intergenerational issues and non-monetary impacts. This literature review aims to explore the legal and philosophical underpinnings of the social discount rate, its implications for policy-making, and the ongoing debates surrounding its use.Legal Perspectives on the Social Discount Rate:The legal landscape surrounding the social discount rate has evolved significantly over the years. Courts have generally accepted the principle of discounting at a non-zero rate for both monetary and non-monetary impacts. In a landmark case, Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA (1991), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals emphasized the importance of discounting future benefits and costs in regulatory analysis, setting a precedent for subsequent legal decisions (Revesz, 1999). This ruling underscored the need for transparent justification in selecting discount rates based on established scientific principles.Further legal developments have reinforced the importance of discounting in policy evaluation. In Ohio v. Department of the Interior (1989), the court upheld the use of discounting in natural resource damage assessments, acknowledging its relevance in capturing the time value of money and opportunity costs (Viscusi, 2007). These legal precedents have contributed to the widespread acceptance of discounting in benefit-cost analysis across various policy domains.Philosophical Debates and Ethical Considerations:The philosophical discourse surrounding the social discount rate is multifaceted and raises profound ethical questions. One central debate concerns whether non-monetary impacts, such as environmental damages or human health effects, should be discounted at the same rate as monetary impacts. Broome (1994) argues that discounting non-monetary impacts may lead to ethically questionable outcomes, particularly when considering long-term environmental consequences.Another key philosophical issue is the choice between using the opportunity cost of capital or the social rate of time preference as the basis for the discount rate. Stern (2007) advocates for a low discount rate based on ethical considerations, arguing that the welfare of future generations should be weighted equally to that of the present generation. In contrast, Nordhaus (2007) contends that market-based discount rates better reflect societal preferences and economic realities.The time frame for setting the discount rate is another contentious issue. Weitzman (1998) proposes a declining discount rate over time, arguing that uncertainty about future economic conditions justifies lower rates for long-term impacts. This approach has gained traction in some policy circles, with the UK government adopting a declining discount rate schedule for long-term projects (HM Treasury, 2003).Intergenerational Equity and Discounting:The application of discounting to intergenerational issues raises particularly challenging ethical questions. Parfit (1984) highlights the potential for discounting to lead to what he terms 'the repugnant conclusion,' where the interests of future generations are systematically undervalued. This concern has led some scholars to propose alternative approaches to intergenerational decision-making, such as the 'sustainable discounting' framework proposed by Heal (1998).The question of whose preferences should have standing in determining the social discount rate is also contentious. Arrow et al. (1996) argue that the preferences of the current generation should be respected, while others contend that future generations' interests should be given equal weight. This debate intersects with broader discussions about intergenerational justice and the ethical obligations of present generations to future ones.Dynamic inconsistencies arising from preferential discount rates pose another challenge in intergenerational contexts. Strotz (1955) first identified this issue, noting that individuals' time preferences may lead to inconsistent choices over time. In the context of social discounting, this raises questions about the stability and coherence of long-term policy decisions.Practical Implications and Policy Considerations:The choice of social discount rate has significant practical implications for policy-making and project evaluation. Boardman et al. (2018) demonstrate how different discount rates can dramatically alter the outcomes of benefit-cost analyses, particularly for projects with long-term impacts. This underscores the importance of careful consideration and transparent justification in selecting discount rates for policy evaluation.Recent developments in behavioral economics have also influenced discussions about social discounting. Laibson (1997) introduced the concept of hyperbolic discounting, which suggests that individuals discount the near future more steeply than the distant future. This insight has implications for how we think about social preferences over time and may inform more nuanced approaches to discounting in policy analysis.Conclusion:The social discount rate remains a complex and contentious issue in both legal and philosophical domains. While legal precedents have established the general acceptability of discounting in policy evaluation, philosophical debates continue to challenge our understanding of intergenerational equity and the valuation of non-monetary impacts. As policy-makers grapple with long-term challenges such as climate change and sustainable development, the need for thoughtful and ethically grounded approaches to social discounting becomes increasingly apparent. Future research should continue to explore innovative methods for incorporating intergenerational concerns and uncertainty into discounting frameworks, with the ultimate goal of promoting more equitable and sustainable policy decisions.", "References": [{"title": "Discounting and Intergenerational Equity", "authors": "Kenneth J.
