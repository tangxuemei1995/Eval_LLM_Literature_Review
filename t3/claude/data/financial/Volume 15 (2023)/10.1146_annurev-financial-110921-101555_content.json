{"Literature Review": "Climate change poses significant risks to the global financial system, necessitating the development of robust stress testing methodologies to assess and manage these risks effectively. This literature review explores the current state of climate stress testing in the financial sector, highlighting key challenges and areas for future research.Climate stress testing has emerged as a critical tool for regulators and financial institutions to evaluate the potential impacts of climate-related risks on financial stability. Battiston et al. (2017) emphasize the importance of considering both physical and transition risks in climate stress scenarios. Physical risks refer to the direct impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events and sea-level rise, while transition risks arise from the shift towards a low-carbon economy.One of the primary challenges in designing effective climate stress tests is the development of appropriate scenarios. Allen et al. (2020) highlight the need for scenarios that capture a wide range of potential climate outcomes and policy responses. They argue that many transition risks should be viewed as dynamic policy choices rather than fixed pathways, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding future climate policies and technological developments.The incorporation of feedback loops between climate change and the economy is another crucial aspect of scenario design. Dafermos et al. (2018) demonstrate the importance of considering these feedbacks, as climate-related events can have cascading effects on economic activity, which in turn can exacerbate climate risks. Their research suggests that ignoring these feedback loops may lead to an underestimation of the potential impacts of climate change on the financial system.Compound risk scenarios, where climate risks co-occur with other financial or economic risks, represent an area that requires further exploration. Roncoroni et al. (2021) argue that such scenarios are particularly relevant given the interconnected nature of global financial systems and the potential for climate risks to amplify existing vulnerabilities.The process of mapping climate stress scenarios to financial firm outcomes is a critical step in stress testing. Klusak et al. (2021) provide evidence on the effects of climate-related risks on sovereign credit ratings, which can have significant implications for financial institutions' risk exposures. Their findings underscore the need for stress tests to incorporate a range of potential impacts across different asset classes and sectors.However, several challenges remain in translating climate scenarios into meaningful short-term impacts on credit risks. Giglio et al. (2021) point out that the long-term nature of climate change can make it difficult to assess its effects on typical bank loan maturities, which are often much shorter. They suggest that more research is needed to identify plausible channels through which climate risks can materialize in the near term.The incorporation of bank lending responses to climate risks is another area that requires further attention. Degryse et al. (2021) find evidence that banks are already adjusting their lending practices in response to climate risks, but the full extent and implications of these adjustments remain unclear. Understanding these responses is crucial for accurately assessing the potential impacts of climate change on financial stability.The adequacy of climate risk pricing in financial markets is a topic of ongoing debate. Hong et al. (2019) provide evidence that some climate risks may be underpriced in certain markets, suggesting that current asset valuations may not fully reflect the potential impacts of climate change. This highlights the need for stress tests to consider scenarios where market prices rapidly adjust to reflect previously underappreciated climate risks.Understanding how market participants form climate risk expectations is crucial for assessing potential threats to financial stability. Krueger et al. (2020) survey institutional investors and find significant heterogeneity in their perceptions and responses to climate risks. This diversity of views could lead to market volatility as climate-related events unfold, underscoring the importance of incorporating expectation formation processes into stress testing frameworks.Finally, the use of market-based climate stress tests has been proposed as a complement to existing regulatory stress testing frameworks. Battiston et al. (2021) argue that such tests, which can be conducted using publicly available data, offer advantages in terms of transparency and comparability across institutions. However, they also note that market-based tests may have limitations in capturing certain types of risks and firm-specific vulnerabilities.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in developing climate stress testing methodologies, numerous challenges and areas for future research remain. Addressing these issues will be crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of climate stress tests and improving the financial sector's resilience to climate-related risks.", "References": [{"title": "A climate stress-test of the financial system", "authors": "Stefano Battiston, Antoine Mandel, Irene Monasterolo, Franziska Schütze, Gabriele Visentin", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "year": "2017", "volumes": "7", "first page": "283", "last page": "288", "DOI": "10.1038/nclimate3255"}, {"title": "Climate-Related Financial Risks and Their Transmission Channels", "authors": "Tobias Adrian, Patrick Bolton, Alissa M.
