{"Literature Review": "The social discount rate is a critical parameter in public policy decision-making, influencing the evaluation of long-term projects and investments. This literature review examines the ongoing debate surrounding the appropriate methodology for determining the social discount rate, with a particular focus on the insights and limitations of financial economics in this context.Financial economics has long provided valuable frameworks for private sector decision-making, and many scholars argue that these principles should be equally applicable to public sector investments. Gollier and Weitzman (2010) propose that the social discount rate should reflect both the opportunity cost of capital and society's time preference, emphasizing the importance of risk-adjusted returns. This approach aligns with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) widely used in corporate finance, as discussed by Lintner (1965).However, governments often diverge from these principles, instead using their borrowing rate as the primary basis for discounting. Boardman et al. (2006) argue that this practice fails to account for the full social opportunity cost of capital and may lead to suboptimal resource allocation. The use of the government borrowing rate as a proxy for the social discount rate has been criticized for potentially underestimating the true cost of public investments, as highlighted by Arrow and Lind (1970).Proponents of status quo discounting practices often cite the government's ability to pool risks across a large portfolio of projects and its capacity to spread risk across taxpayers. However, Lucas (2014) contends that this argument ignores the market price of risk and may lead to excessive government investment in risky projects. Furthermore, Baumstark and Gollier (2014) demonstrate that the government's borrowing rate does not necessarily reflect the social opportunity cost of capital, especially when considering intergenerational effects.The fair value approach, rooted in financial economics principles, has gained traction as an alternative methodology for risk adjustment in public sector decision-making. Merton (1973) laid the groundwork for this approach, which advocates for the use of market prices to value assets and liabilities. Applying this concept to government investments, Boardman and Vining (2010) argue that the fair value approach provides a more accurate representation of the true economic costs and benefits of public projects.However, the application of financial economics principles to public sector decision-making is not without challenges. One significant limitation emerges when considering investments with very long time horizons, such as climate change mitigation policies. Stern (2007) highlights the ethical considerations and uncertainties involved in discounting over extended periods, arguing for a lower social discount rate to account for intergenerational equity.The uncertainty surrounding long-term cash flows and discount rates further complicates the use of present value calculations for evaluating policies with distant impacts. Weitzman (1998) demonstrates that uncertainty about future discount rates leads to a declining term structure of discount rates, challenging the use of a constant rate over long periods. This finding has important implications for the evaluation of climate policies and other long-term investments.Gollier and Weitzman (2010) propose a declining discount rate schedule to address these concerns, but acknowledge that this approach does not fully resolve the challenges of long-term decision-making. As noted by Dasgupta (2008), the limitations of financial economics become increasingly apparent when dealing with intergenerational issues and deep uncertainty.For policies with shorter time horizons, which constitute the majority of government investments, the adoption of standard financial economics approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare. Boardman et al. (2010) argue that incorporating risk-adjusted discount rates and market-based valuation methods would lead to more efficient allocation of public resources and better-informed policy decisions.In conclusion, while financial economics offers valuable insights into the determination of the social discount rate, its application is not without limitations, particularly for very long-term decisions. The ongoing debate highlights the need for a nuanced approach that considers both financial principles and broader societal concerns. For most government investments with shorter time horizons, the adoption of risk-adjusted discount rates and fair value accounting principles could enhance decision-making and improve social outcomes. However, for policies with intergenerational impacts, alternative decision criteria may be necessary to complement or replace traditional present value calculations.", "References": [{"title": "Declining Discount Rates", "authors": "Christian Gollier, Martin L.
