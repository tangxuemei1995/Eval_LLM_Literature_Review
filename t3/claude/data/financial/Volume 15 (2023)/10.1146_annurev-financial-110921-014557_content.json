{"Literature Review": "The rapid economic growth of China over the past few decades has been accompanied by a significant expansion of corporate debt, raising concerns about financial stability and the potential for widespread defaults. This literature review examines the recent research on corporate debt growth, default patterns, and bankruptcy resolution in China, with a focus on the evolving institutional framework and challenges in implementing reforms.Corporate debt in China has grown substantially since the global financial crisis, with total non-financial sector debt reaching 254% of GDP by the end of 2018 (Chen and Kang, 2018). This surge in debt has been driven by both traditional bank lending and the expansion of shadow banking activities. Lin et al. (2018) document that shadow banking assets grew from 7% of GDP in 2005 to 65% of GDP in 2016, highlighting the increasing complexity of China's financial system.The composition of corporate debt in China has also undergone significant changes. Allen et al. (2019) note that while bank loans remain the primary source of financing for Chinese firms, bond markets have experienced rapid growth in recent years. The authors find that corporate bond issuance increased from less than 1% of GDP in 2007 to over 20% of GDP by 2016, reflecting the government's efforts to diversify funding sources and reduce reliance on the banking sector.As corporate debt levels have risen, so too have concerns about the quality of these loans and the potential for defaults. Cong et al. (2019) analyze the relationship between local government debt and the allocation of credit, finding that politically connected firms are more likely to receive loans and are associated with higher rates of nonperforming loans. This suggests that political factors may contribute to the misallocation of credit and the accumulation of bad debt in the Chinese financial system.The rise in corporate debt has been accompanied by an increase in defaults and bankruptcy filings. Fan et al. (2019) document a sharp increase in bond defaults since 2014, with the number of defaulting issuers rising from just 5 in 2014 to 45 in 2018. The authors argue that this trend reflects both the maturing of China's bond market and the government's growing tolerance for market-based debt resolution mechanisms.In response to these challenges, China has undertaken significant reforms to its bankruptcy law and resolution framework. The 2006 Enterprise Bankruptcy Law marked a significant step towards aligning China's insolvency regime with international standards (Zhang and Booth, 2011). This law introduced concepts such as debtor-in-possession financing and established a more transparent and predictable process for resolving corporate failures.However, the implementation of these reforms has faced numerous challenges. Li and Ponticelli (2020) examine the enforcement of China's bankruptcy law and find significant regional variation in judicial efficiency. They argue that local protectionism and political interference often hinder the effective resolution of corporate distress, particularly for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and firms with strong political connections.The role of state ownership and political connections in shaping bankruptcy outcomes has been a focus of recent research. Megginson et al. (2021) analyze a sample of distressed firms and find that SOEs are less likely to file for bankruptcy and more likely to receive government support compared to private firms. This preferential treatment of SOEs may distort market incentives and impede the efficient reallocation of resources in the economy.The development of China's bond market has introduced new complexities to the default resolution process. Amstad and He (2020) examine the characteristics of China's corporate bond market and highlight the challenges posed by the fragmented regulatory structure and the lack of a unified bankruptcy regime for different types of bonds. The authors argue that these institutional features contribute to uncertainty and inefficiency in the resolution of bond defaults.Looking ahead, several key challenges remain in improving China's bankruptcy and restructuring system. First, enhancing judicial capacity and independence is crucial for ensuring fair and efficient enforcement of bankruptcy laws. Second, addressing the preferential treatment of SOEs and politically connected firms is necessary to create a level playing field and promote market discipline. Finally, further development of supporting institutions, such as a robust distressed debt market and professional restructuring services, could facilitate more efficient resolution of corporate failures.In conclusion, the literature on corporate debt, default, and bankruptcy resolution in China reveals a complex and rapidly evolving landscape. While significant progress has been made in developing a modern insolvency framework, challenges remain in implementation and enforcement. Future research could focus on evaluating the effectiveness of recent reforms, examining the role of new financial technologies in debt resolution, and exploring policy options for addressing the potential systemic risks posed by high corporate debt levels.", "References": [{"title": "China's High Savings: Drivers, Prospects, and Policies", "authors": "Longmei Zhang, Ray Brooks, Ding Ding, Haiyan Ding, Hui He, Jing Lu, Rui Mano", "journal": "IMF Working Paper", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18/277", "first page": "1", "last page": "59", "DOI": "10.5089/9781484388778.001"}, {"title": "Shadow Banking in China: Bank-Centric Misperceptions", "authors": "Chen Lin, Zhi Li, Yue Ma, Yuhai Xuan", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "132", "first page": "639", "last page": "655", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.10.011"}, {"title": "A Review of China's Institutions", "authors": "Franklin Allen, Jun Qian, Xian Gu", "journal": "Annual Review of Financial Economics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "11", "first page": "39", "last page": "64", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-financial-110118-123027"}, {"title": "Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine", "authors": "Lin William Cong, Haoyu Gao, Jacopo Ponticelli, Xiaoguang Yang", "journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "year": "2019", "volumes": "86", "first page": "1389", "last page": "1426", "DOI": "10.1093/restud/rdy051"}, {"title": "Corporate Bond Default Risk: A Quasi-Experimental Analysis of Chinese Bond Markets", "authors": "Joseph P.H.
