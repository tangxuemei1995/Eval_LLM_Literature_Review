{"Literature Review": "The concept of fiscal capacity, which refers to a government's ability to generate revenue and manage its debt, has been a central topic in public finance and macroeconomics for decades. However, recent developments in asset pricing theory have shed new light on this important issue, challenging traditional views and offering fresh insights into the constraints and opportunities faced by governments in managing their fiscal affairs.Traditionally, fiscal capacity has been assessed primarily through the lens of debt sustainability, focusing on the relationship between interest rates and economic growth rates. The seminal work of Blanchard (2019) argued that when the interest rate on government debt is lower than the growth rate of the economy, governments can sustain higher levels of debt without facing fiscal crises. This perspective has been influential in shaping policy discussions, particularly in advanced economies experiencing prolonged periods of low interest rates.However, the application of modern asset pricing tools to fiscal policy analysis has revealed important limitations in this conventional approach. Bohn (1995) was among the first to highlight the importance of considering risk when evaluating fiscal sustainability, arguing that the covariance between tax revenues and government spending plays a crucial role in determining a government's ability to service its debt.Building on this insight, Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrated that properly accounting for aggregate risk substantially reduces estimates of fiscal capacity. Their work shows that in an environment with uncertain economic growth, the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate is not a sufficient statistic for fiscal capacity, as previously believed. This finding has significant implications for fiscal policy, suggesting that governments may have less room for maneuver than previously thought, even in low-interest-rate environments.The asset pricing perspective also highlights an important tension in government debt management. To borrow at the risk-free rate when aggregate growth is risky, governments would need to ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk. However, Farhi and Werning (2017) show that governments in advanced economies tend to do the opposite, providing insurance to taxpayers against aggregate risk through various fiscal and monetary policies. This observation helps explain why government bond yields often fall during economic crises, a phenomenon that is difficult to reconcile with traditional models of fiscal capacity.The recognition of these risk-related constraints has spurred research into alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity. One strand of literature, exemplified by the work of Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012), focuses on the 'convenience yield' of government debt â€“ the non-pecuniary benefits that investors derive from holding safe and liquid government securities. By enhancing the safety and liquidity features of their debt, governments may be able to sustain higher debt levels at lower costs.Another approach, explored by Debortoli et al. (2017), examines the role of debt maturity in fiscal capacity. They argue that by issuing long-term debt, governments can reduce rollover risk and increase their fiscal space. However, Greenwood et al. (2015) caution that the optimal debt maturity structure depends on the correlation between bond returns and fiscal conditions, highlighting the importance of a risk-management approach to debt issuance.The asset pricing perspective has also revitalized interest in state-contingent debt instruments as a means of enhancing fiscal capacity. Barro (1995) proposed GDP-linked bonds as a way for governments to share risk with bondholders, potentially allowing for higher sustainable debt levels. While the practical implementation of such instruments has been limited, recent work by Beetsma and Mavromatis (2014) suggests that they could play a valuable role in fiscal stabilization, particularly for countries facing high economic volatility.Furthermore, the literature has begun to explore the implications of the asset pricing approach for fiscal rules and institutional design. Leeper and Leith (2016) argue that fiscal rules should be designed with explicit consideration of risk and uncertainty, moving beyond simple debt-to-GDP targets to incorporate measures of fiscal risk.In conclusion, the application of asset pricing theory to fiscal capacity analysis has significantly enriched our understanding of the constraints and opportunities facing governments in managing their fiscal affairs. By highlighting the crucial role of risk and uncertainty, this approach calls for a more nuanced evaluation of fiscal sustainability and suggests new avenues for enhancing fiscal capacity. As governments around the world grapple with high debt levels and uncertain economic prospects, these insights from the asset pricing literature are likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping fiscal policy debates and decisions in the years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Public Debt and Low Interest Rates", "authors": "Olivier Blanchard", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2019", "volumes": "109", "first page": "1197", "last page": "1229", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.109.4.1197"}, {"title": "The Sustainability of Budget Deficits in a Stochastic Economy", "authors": "Henning Bohn", "journal": "Journal of Money, Credit and Banking", "year": "1995", "volumes": "27", "first page": "257", "last page": "271", "DOI": "10.2307/2077862"}, {"title": "Safe Asset Scarcity and Aggregate Demand", "authors": "Ricardo J.
