{"Literature Review": "Sovereign debt has been a topic of intense academic and policy interest for decades, particularly given its crucial role in global financial markets and its potential to trigger economic crises. The canonical model of sovereign debt, while providing valuable insights, has been increasingly challenged by empirical observations that it struggles to explain. This literature review aims to explore these challenges and the resulting puzzles that have emerged in the field of sovereign debt research.The foundation of sovereign debt theory was laid by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), who developed a model of sovereign borrowing with the possibility of default. This seminal work has been the basis for much of the subsequent research in the field. However, as Aguiar and Amador (2014) point out, the basic model fails to capture many real-world phenomena observed in sovereign debt markets.One of the most prominent puzzles in sovereign debt literature is the 'debt intolerance' phenomenon identified by Reinhart et al. (2003). They observed that some countries seem to experience debt crises at much lower debt-to-GDP ratios than others, a fact not easily explained by standard economic fundamentals. This observation challenges the notion of a universal debt threshold beyond which countries become vulnerable to default.Another significant puzzle relates to the pricing of sovereign debt. Theoretical models typically predict that interest rates should rise smoothly as debt levels increase, reflecting the gradually increasing risk of default. However, empirical studies such as Bi and Traum (2012) have shown that interest rates often remain low until they suddenly spike, a phenomenon known as 'sudden stops'. This discontinuity in pricing behavior is not well-captured by standard models.The 'debt dilution' problem, highlighted by Hatchondo et al. (2016), presents another challenge. This refers to the fact that when a sovereign issues new debt, it reduces the value of existing debt by increasing the overall probability of default. Standard models struggle to explain why sovereigns don't take steps to mitigate this problem, such as issuing only long-term debt or including seniority clauses.Tomz and Wright (2013) bring attention to the puzzle of why sovereigns repay their debts at all, given the limited enforcement mechanisms in international finance. The reputational costs of default predicted by theory seem insufficient to explain the rarity of strategic defaults, especially among democracies.The 'serial default' puzzle, identified by Reinhart and Rogoff (2004), questions why some countries repeatedly default on their debt, despite the supposedly high costs of doing so. This pattern suggests that either the costs of default are lower than typically assumed, or that there are benefits to default not captured in standard models.Regarding debt issuance, Broner et al. (2013) highlight the puzzle of why sovereigns predominantly issue debt in foreign currency, despite the additional risks this entails. This 'original sin' phenomenon is particularly prevalent in emerging markets and runs counter to the predictions of many theoretical models.The process of debt restructuring following default also presents several puzzles. Cruces and Trebesch (2013) document wide variation in the haircuts imposed during sovereign debt restructurings, ranging from 5% to 97%. Standard models struggle to explain this heterogeneity and its determinants.Asonuma and Trebesch (2016) identify the puzzle of 'preemptive' versus 'post-default' restructurings. Some countries choose to restructure their debt before missing any payments, while others allow a formal default to occur first. The factors driving this choice and its implications are not well understood within the existing theoretical framework.Finally, there is the puzzle of collective action in debt restructuring. Despite the potential for holdout creditors to derail negotiations, most restructurings are completed relatively quickly. The mechanisms facilitating this coordination, particularly in the absence of formal bankruptcy procedures for sovereigns, remain incompletely understood.These puzzles collectively highlight the complexity of sovereign debt dynamics and the limitations of current theoretical frameworks. They underscore the need for more nuanced models that can better capture the multifaceted nature of sovereign debt issuance, pricing, and default. Future research directions may include incorporating political economy considerations, exploring the role of international institutions, and developing more sophisticated models of creditor behavior and coordination. By addressing these puzzles, researchers can enhance our understanding of sovereign debt markets and contribute to more effective policy responses to sovereign debt crises.", "References": [{"title": "A Theory of Debt Maturity: The Long and Short of Debt Overhang", "authors": "Douglas W.
