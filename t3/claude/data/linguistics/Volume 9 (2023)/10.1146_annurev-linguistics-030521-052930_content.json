{"Literature Review": "The field of Language Policy and Planning (LPP) has long been intertwined with the concept of the modern nation-state, particularly in postcolonial contexts such as Africa. However, recent scholarship has begun to question the adequacy of this framework in addressing the complex linguistic landscapes of postcolonial societies. This literature review explores the limitations of the nation-state paradigm in LPP and advocates for a more nuanced, historically-informed approach that incorporates Southern epistemologies.The colonial legacy of LPP has significantly shaped how African multilingualism is perceived and managed. Makoni and Pennycook (2007) argue that the very concept of language as a discrete, countable entity is a colonial invention that has been imposed on African linguistic realities. This perspective has led to the framing of African multilingualism as a problem to be solved rather than a resource to be leveraged. Blommaert (2008) further elaborates on this point, demonstrating how colonial language ideologies continue to influence contemporary language policies in Africa.The notion of the 'developing nation' has been particularly problematic in LPP discourse. As Ricento (2000) points out, early LPP frameworks were often based on a teleological view of national development that assumed Western models of statehood and language use as the ultimate goal. This methodological nationalism, as described by Wimmer and Glick Schiller (2002), has led to policies that often fail to account for the unique historical and social contexts of African nations.The case of Sudan provides a compelling example of the complexities involved in postcolonial language policy. Abdelhay et al. (2011) examine how language policies in Sudan have been shaped by colonial legacies and postcolonial nation-building efforts. They argue that the emphasis on Arabic as the national language has often come at the expense of indigenous languages, reflecting broader issues of power and identity in the country.Recent scholarship has called for a more critical examination of the relationship between language, citizenship, and the state in Africa. Stroud (2001) introduces the concept of 'linguistic citizenship' as an alternative to traditional notions of language rights, emphasizing the need to consider language as a social practice rather than a fixed system. This approach aligns with Makoni and Pennycook's (2007) call for a 'disinvention' of languages, which involves critically examining and deconstructing colonial language ideologies.The limitations of the nation-state model in LPP become particularly evident when considering transnational language practices. Vigouroux and Mufwene (2008) highlight how migration and globalization have created linguistic realities that transcend national boundaries, challenging traditional approaches to language policy. Similarly, Canagarajah (2013) argues for a translingual approach that recognizes the fluid and dynamic nature of language use in multilingual contexts.In response to these challenges, scholars have begun to advocate for more locally-grounded approaches to LPP. Hornberger and Johnson (2007) propose an ethnographic approach to language policy, emphasizing the importance of understanding how policies are interpreted and implemented at the local level. This aligns with Makoni and Pennycook's (2007) call for a 'linguistics of contact' that focuses on the ways in which languages interact and evolve in specific social contexts.The incorporation of Southern epistemologies into LPP research represents a promising direction for the field. Ndhlovu (2015) argues for the need to decolonize sociolinguistics by incorporating African philosophical perspectives. This approach challenges the dominance of Western theoretical frameworks and opens up new ways of understanding language and society in African contexts.In conclusion, the limitations of the nation-state model in addressing postcolonial language issues have become increasingly apparent. A more nuanced approach that recognizes the colonial history of LPP, challenges methodological nationalism, and incorporates Southern perspectives is needed. By adopting a historically and locally embedded understanding of language, researchers and policymakers can develop more effective and equitable language policies that reflect the complex realities of postcolonial societies.", "References": [{"title": "Disinventing and Reconstituting Languages", "authors": "Sinfree Makoni, Alastair Pennycook", "journal": "Multilingual Matters", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "41", "DOI": "10.21832/9781853599255-003"}, {"title": "Language Policy and Political Issues in Education", "authors": "James W.
