{"Literature Review": "Verb classification has long been a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), providing essential information for various downstream applications such as semantic role labeling, machine translation, and information extraction. In recent years, the advent of large pretrained language models has revolutionized the field of NLP, raising questions about the continued relevance of traditional linguistic resources. This literature review examines the current state of verb classification across languages, the role of human-designed lexical resources, and the potential for integrating these resources with modern neural architectures.The development of verb classification systems has a rich history in computational linguistics. Levin's (1993) seminal work on English verb classes laid the foundation for many subsequent studies. Building on this, researchers have attempted to create similar resources for other languages. For instance, Kipper et al. (2008) developed VerbNet, a comprehensive lexicon of English verbs organized into hierarchical classes. This resource has proven valuable for numerous NLP tasks and has inspired similar efforts in other languages.However, creating such resources for multiple languages is a time-consuming and expensive process. Scarton et al. (2014) proposed a method for automatically inducing verb classes in Portuguese using machine translation and existing English resources. Their approach demonstrated the potential for leveraging cross-lingual information to expedite the creation of verb lexicons in new languages. Similarly, Sun et al. (2010) developed a framework for Chinese verb classification by combining both manual annotation and automatic methods, highlighting the benefits of a hybrid approach.The emergence of large pretrained language models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Brown et al., 2020), has led to significant improvements in various NLP tasks, including those traditionally reliant on verb classification information. These models can capture complex linguistic patterns from vast amounts of raw text data without explicit supervision. As a result, some researchers have questioned the need for manually crafted linguistic resources in the age of neural networks.Probing studies, however, have revealed limitations in the linguistic knowledge captured by these models. Tenney et al. (2019) found that while BERT performs well on many NLP tasks, it struggles with more fine-grained linguistic distinctions, including certain aspects of verb semantics. This suggests that there may still be a role for human-designed lexical resources in complementing the knowledge acquired by neural models.Recent work has explored the potential of augmenting pretrained language models with external knowledge. Peters et al. (2019) demonstrated that injecting information from WordNet into BERT improved performance on word sense disambiguation tasks. While this study focused on general lexical knowledge, it opens up possibilities for incorporating verb-specific information into neural architectures.In the multilingual context, Ponti et al. (2019) investigated the transfer of verb class knowledge across languages using multilingual word embeddings. Their findings suggest that verb classes exhibit some degree of cross-lingual consistency, which could be exploited to improve verb classification in low-resource languages.Given the challenges of creating comprehensive verb lexicons for multiple languages, some researchers have explored crowdsourcing as an alternative. Majewska et al. (2018) conducted a study on crowdsourcing verb classification, finding that non-expert native speakers could provide valuable insights into verb behavior. This approach offers a potential middle ground between expensive expert annotation and fully automated methods.The integration of human expertise with machine learning techniques remains an active area of research. Wang et al. (2020) proposed a framework for incorporating linguistic constraints derived from VerbNet into neural semantic role labeling models, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability. This hybrid approach suggests that human-designed resources can still play a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of neural models.As the field of NLP continues to evolve, the question of how best to leverage human expertise in verb classification across languages remains open. While large pretrained models have shown impressive capabilities, the nuanced understanding of verb semantics provided by human-designed resources may still offer valuable complementary information. Future research directions may include developing more efficient methods for creating multilingual verb lexicons, exploring novel ways to inject verb class knowledge into neural architectures, and investigating the potential of cross-lingual transfer for verb classification in low-resource languages.In conclusion, while the advent of large neural models has transformed the landscape of NLP, the role of human expertise in verb classification across languages remains significant. By combining the strengths of traditional linguistic resources with the power of modern machine learning techniques, researchers can continue to push the boundaries of multilingual NLP and develop more sophisticated systems for understanding and processing human language.", "References": [{"title": "English Verb Classes and Alternations: A Preliminary Investigation", "authors": "Beth Levin", "journal": "University of Chicago Press", "year": "1993", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Large-scale discovery of inference rules for question answering", "authors": "Karin Kipper, Anna Korhonen, Neville Ryant, Martha Palmer", "journal": "Natural Language Engineering", "year": "2008", "volumes": "14", "first page": "15", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.1017/S1351324906004724"}, {"title": "Automatic Construction of a Verb Lexicon for Portuguese", "authors": "Carolina Scarton, Magali Sanches Duran, Sandra Maria Aluísio", "journal": "Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Computational Processing of the Portuguese Language", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "282", "last page": "293", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-09761-9_29"}, {"title": "Verb classification using syntactic and semantic bootstrapping", "authors": "Lin Sun, Anna Korhonen, Yuval Krymolowski", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "1041", "last page": "1050", "DOI": "10.3115/1613715.1613848"}, {"title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding", "authors": "Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies", "year": "2019", "volumes": "1", "first page": "4171", "last page": "4186", "DOI": "10.18653/v1/N19-1423"}, {"title": "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners", "authors": "Tom B.
