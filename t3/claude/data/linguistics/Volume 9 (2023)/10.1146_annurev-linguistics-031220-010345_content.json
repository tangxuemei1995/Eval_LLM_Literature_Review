{"Literature Review": "The field of (psycho)linguistics has seen a growing emphasis on robust statistical methods for data analysis in recent years. This literature review explores some of the best practices in statistical analysis, focusing on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, as well as the ongoing debate between hypothesis testing and estimation approaches.One of the primary concerns in the field has been the misuse and overreliance on p-values and statistical significance. Wasserstein and Lazar (2016) highlighted the limitations of p-values and called for a more nuanced approach to statistical inference. This sentiment has been echoed by many researchers, including Amrhein, Greenland, and McShane (2019), who argued for abandoning statistical significance altogether in favor of more comprehensive reporting of results.In response to these concerns, there has been a shift towards alternative approaches, such as Bayesian methods. Kruschke and Liddell (2018) provided a comprehensive overview of Bayesian data analysis, emphasizing its advantages in terms of intuitive interpretation and flexibility. They argued that Bayesian methods allow for a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty in parameter estimates, which is particularly valuable in linguistic research where complex hierarchical structures are common.Linear mixed models have become increasingly popular in (psycho)linguistic research due to their ability to account for both fixed and random effects. Baayen, Davidson, and Bates (2008) demonstrated the advantages of mixed models over traditional ANOVA approaches, particularly in handling unbalanced designs and complex error structures common in linguistic data.The debate between hypothesis testing and estimation approaches has been a central theme in recent methodological discussions. While hypothesis testing using Bayes factors has gained traction (Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey, & Iverson, 2009), many researchers advocate for a focus on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. McElreath (2020) argued that estimation approaches provide more informative results and better align with scientific goals of understanding and prediction.Visualization of data has been recognized as a crucial step in the analysis process. Wickham (2016) emphasized the importance of exploratory data analysis and provided tools for effective data visualization. This approach allows researchers to identify patterns and potential issues in their data before conducting formal analyses.Simulation studies have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding experimental design and model behavior. Green and MacLeod (2016) demonstrated how simulations can be used to assess the power and sensitivity of experimental designs before data collection. Similarly, Gelman and Hill (2006) advocated for the use of simulations to validate model assumptions and understand the implications of model choices.The importance of not overstating evidence has been a recurring theme in the literature. Morey and Rouder (2011) cautioned against overconfidence in statistical results and emphasized the need for careful interpretation of Bayes factors. This aligns with the broader movement towards more transparent and reproducible research practices in linguistics and other fields (Nosek et al., 2015).Uncertainty quantification has gained prominence as a more informative alternative to traditional hypothesis testing. Kruschke (2018) proposed the use of highest density intervals and region of practical equivalence (ROPE) as a way to make decisions about parameter values while explicitly acknowledging uncertainty.In conclusion, the literature suggests a move towards more nuanced and comprehensive approaches to statistical analysis in (psycho)linguistics. Best practices include the use of mixed models, careful consideration of Bayesian methods, emphasis on visualization and simulation, and a focus on estimation and uncertainty quantification rather than binary decision-making based on p-values. As the field continues to evolve, researchers are encouraged to adopt these practices to improve the reliability and interpretability of their findings.", "References": [{"title": "The ASA Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose", "authors": "Ronald L.
