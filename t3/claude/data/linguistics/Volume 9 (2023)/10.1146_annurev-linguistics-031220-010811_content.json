{"Literature Review": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework has emerged as a prominent approach in the field of pragmatics, offering a novel perspective on how meaning is conveyed and interpreted in language. This framework integrates insights from various disciplines, including formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science, to provide a comprehensive understanding of linguistic communication.At its core, the RSA framework is built on the premise that language use is inherently probabilistic and that communication involves a complex interplay between speakers and listeners. This approach has gained significant traction in recent years, as it offers a more nuanced and flexible account of pragmatic phenomena compared to traditional rule-based models.One of the key strengths of the RSA framework is its ability to model the gradience of informativeness in communication. Unlike binary approaches that categorize utterances as either informative or not, RSA allows for a continuous spectrum of informativeness. This aligns more closely with real-world language use, where speakers often choose between multiple options with varying degrees of specificity or relevance. For instance, Goodman and Frank (2016) demonstrated how RSA can account for scalar implicatures, showing that listeners interpret 'some' as implying 'not all' based on the relative informativeness of these alternatives.Another crucial aspect of the RSA framework is its emphasis on context-dependent alternatives. Traditional pragmatic theories often rely on fixed sets of alternatives, but RSA recognizes that the relevant alternatives can vary depending on the specific context of the utterance. This flexibility allows the model to capture the dynamic nature of communication more accurately. Bergen et al. (2016) illustrated this by modeling how listeners interpret ambiguous pronouns based on the contextually relevant set of potential referents.The incorporation of subjective prior beliefs, or world knowledge, is another significant feature of the RSA framework. By explicitly modeling the background knowledge and expectations that interlocutors bring to a conversation, RSA can account for how this information influences both production and interpretation. Qing and Franke (2015) demonstrated how this aspect of RSA can explain the interpretation of gradable adjectives, showing that listeners' prior beliefs about typical sizes influence their interpretation of terms like 'tall' or 'short'.One of the most compelling aspects of the RSA framework is its integrated account of language production and comprehension. By modeling both speakers and listeners as rational agents who reason about each other's mental states, RSA provides a unified explanation for how utterances are chosen and interpreted. This bidirectional reasoning captures the collaborative nature of communication and has been successfully applied to various phenomena, including politeness (Yoon et al., 2016) and indirect requests (Kao et al., 2014).The RSA framework has also proven valuable in explaining pragmatic development in children. Frank and Goodman (2014) used RSA to model how children learn to interpret scalar implicatures, showing that the framework can account for the gradual emergence of adult-like pragmatic reasoning. This application of RSA to developmental questions highlights its potential for bridging theoretical and empirical approaches to language acquisition.Despite its successes, the RSA framework faces several challenges. One significant issue is scalability. While RSA has been successfully applied to a wide range of specific pragmatic phenomena, scaling up the model to handle more complex, naturalistic language use remains a challenge. Addressing this limitation will be crucial for expanding the framework's applicability to real-world communication scenarios.Another area of ongoing debate is how to incorporate the boundedness of human cognition into the RSA framework. The current model assumes that speakers and listeners are capable of complex recursive reasoning, which may not always align with cognitive reality. Scontras et al. (2018) proposed modifications to the standard RSA model to account for processing limitations, but further work is needed to fully address this issue.The incremental and compositional nature of language processing presents another challenge for the RSA framework. While RSA has primarily been applied to the interpretation of complete utterances, real-time language processing involves incremental updating of beliefs and expectations. Integrating insights from psycholinguistics on incremental processing with the RSA framework remains an important area for future research.In conclusion, the Rational Speech Act framework has significantly advanced our understanding of pragmatics by providing a flexible, context-sensitive, and computationally explicit account of language use. Its ability to model the probabilistic nature of communication, the gradience of informativeness, and the role of prior beliefs has led to successful applications across a wide range of pragmatic phenomena. As research in this area continues, addressing challenges related to scalability, cognitive boundedness, and incremental processing will be crucial for further refining and expanding the framework's explanatory power.", "References": [{"title": "Pragmatic language interpretation as probabilistic inference", "authors": "Noah D.
