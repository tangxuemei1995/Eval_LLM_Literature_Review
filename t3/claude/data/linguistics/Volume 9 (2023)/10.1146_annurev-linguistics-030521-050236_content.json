{"Literature Review": "Heritage languages represent a unique and complex phenomenon in the field of linguistics and language acquisition. These languages, acquired as first or early languages in bilingual or multilingual contexts, often face challenges in maintenance and development due to sociopolitical factors and reduced exposure. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of heritage languages, their acquisition, loss, and potential for regaining.The concept of heritage languages has gained significant attention in recent years, with researchers investigating various aspects of their acquisition, maintenance, and structural properties. Montrul (2016) provides a comprehensive overview of heritage language speakers, defining them as individuals who have been exposed to a minority language from birth but have become dominant in the majority language of their society. This definition highlights the unique linguistic profile of heritage speakers, distinguishing them from both native speakers and second language learners.One of the key areas of research in heritage languages is the structural differences observed between heritage speakers and monolingual native speakers. Polinsky and Kagan (2007) conducted a seminal study examining the grammatical competence of heritage speakers across various languages. Their findings revealed that heritage speakers often exhibit divergent patterns in morphology, syntax, and phonology compared to baseline grammars. These differences are attributed to the complex interplay between input quantity and quality during language acquisition.The age factor plays a crucial role in heritage language development. Montrul (2008) investigated the effects of age on heritage language acquisition, comparing it to first and second language acquisition. The study found that heritage speakers often show similarities to both native speakers and second language learners, depending on the linguistic domain and age of reduced input. This research underscores the importance of considering age-related factors when studying heritage language development.Another significant aspect of heritage languages is the phenomenon of language attrition. Schmid (2011) explored the process of first language attrition in bilingual contexts, focusing on how the dominant language influences the heritage language over time. The study revealed that various linguistic features, including vocabulary, morphosyntax, and phonology, can be affected by attrition, leading to changes in the heritage speaker's linguistic competence.Despite the challenges faced by heritage speakers, recent research has shown promising results in language reactivation and relearning. Au et al. (2002) conducted a study on heritage speakers of Spanish who had limited exposure to the language during childhood. The researchers found that these individuals showed advantages in phonological perception and production when relearning Spanish as adults, compared to novice learners. This suggests that early language exposure leaves lasting traces in the brain, which can be reactivated later in life.The cognitive aspects of heritage language bilingualism have also been a subject of interest. Bialystok et al. (2012) investigated the potential cognitive advantages of bilingualism in heritage speakers. Their research indicated that heritage speakers may benefit from enhanced executive function and metalinguistic awareness, similar to other types of bilinguals. These findings highlight the potential cognitive benefits of maintaining a heritage language.The societal implications of heritage languages have been explored by Cummins (2005), who emphasized the importance of supporting heritage language development in educational settings. The study argued that promoting heritage languages not only benefits individual speakers but also contributes to linguistic diversity and cultural preservation within societies.Recent research has also focused on the role of input in heritage language acquisition. Unsworth (2016) examined the quantity and quality of input received by heritage speakers and its impact on language development. The study found that both factors significantly influence heritage language proficiency, emphasizing the need for rich and varied language exposure in maintaining heritage languages.The relationship between heritage languages and identity has been another area of investigation. He (2010) explored the connection between heritage language proficiency and ethnic identity among Chinese heritage speakers in the United States. The study revealed a complex relationship between language skills, cultural practices, and identity formation, highlighting the multifaceted nature of heritage language experiences.In conclusion, the field of heritage languages presents a rich and diverse area of study, encompassing aspects of language acquisition, loss, and potential reactivation. The unique linguistic profiles of heritage speakers offer valuable insights into the nature of bilingualism, language development, and the effects of sociopolitical factors on language maintenance. As research in this field continues to evolve, it promises to contribute significantly to our understanding of language acquisition, bilingualism, and the cognitive sciences, while also informing educational practices and language policies that support linguistic diversity and cultural heritage.", "References": [{"title": "Heritage language speakers: Processes and consequences", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "36", "first page": "45", "last page": "62", "DOI": "10.1017/S0267190515000021"}, {"title": "Heritage languages: In the 'wild' and in the classroom", "authors": "Maria Polinsky, Olga Kagan", "journal": "Language and Linguistics Compass", "year": "2007", "volumes": "1", "first page": "368", "last page": "395", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00022.x"}, {"title": "Overhearing a language during childhood", "authors": "Terry Kit-fong Au, Leah M.
