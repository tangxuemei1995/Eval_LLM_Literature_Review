{"Literature Review": "Opacity in phonology has been a subject of intense debate and research for decades, serving as a crucial testing ground for competing theoretical frameworks. This literature review aims to explore the concept of opacity, its typological manifestations, and its theoretical implications, with a particular focus on the tension between serial and parallel approaches to phonological analysis.Opacity in phonology refers to situations where phonological processes interact in ways that obscure their surface manifestations. Kiparsky (1973) provided a formal definition of opacity, stating that a process P is opaque if there are surface representations that either undergo P but do not meet its structural description, or meet its structural description but do not undergo P. This definition has been widely adopted and has shaped much of the subsequent research on opacity.The typology of opaque processes has been extensively studied. McCarthy (1999) identified two main types of opacity: counterfeeding and counterbleeding. Counterfeeding opacity occurs when one process fails to create the environment for another process that could have applied, while counterbleeding opacity arises when one process obscures the environment that triggered another process. These distinctions have proven crucial in understanding the nature of opacity and its challenges for phonological theory.The theoretical treatment of opacity has been a major point of contention between different approaches to phonology. The rule-based framework, as exemplified by Chomsky and Halle's (1968) Sound Pattern of English (SPE), naturally accommodates opacity through rule ordering. In this approach, opaque interactions are explained by the sequential application of rules, where the output of one rule serves as the input to the next.However, the advent of Optimality Theory (OT) by Prince and Smolensky (1993) posed significant challenges to the analysis of opacity. OT's parallel evaluation of constraints on surface forms struggles to account for processes that are not surface-true. This difficulty has led to numerous proposals within OT to handle opacity, including Sympathy Theory (McCarthy, 1999) and Candidate Chains (McCarthy, 2007). These approaches attempt to incorporate some form of derivational history into the constraint evaluation process, but they have been criticized for their complexity and lack of restrictiveness.The opacity problem in OT has also sparked a resurgence of interest in serial approaches to phonology. Harmonic Serialism (HS), a variant of OT that allows for serial derivations, has gained prominence as a potential solution to opacity issues. As discussed by McCarthy (2000), HS combines the constraint-based nature of OT with a step-wise derivational process, potentially offering a middle ground between classic OT and rule-based phonology.Ito and Mester (2003) have argued that some types of opacity, particularly those involving prosodic structure, are more naturally accounted for in output-oriented frameworks like OT. They propose that apparent opacity in these cases often results from the interaction of independently motivated constraints, rather than from true derivational opacity.The debate over opacity has also led to a reconsideration of the nature of phonological generalizations. Bermúdez-Otero (2003) argues that many cases of apparent opacity can be reanalyzed as the result of paradigm uniformity effects or other synchronic pressures, rather than as relics of historical sound changes. This perspective challenges the traditional view of opacity and suggests that some opaque patterns may be more directly connected to surface forms than previously thought.Recent work by Baković (2011) has further refined our understanding of opacity by distinguishing between genuine opacity and pseudo-opacity. Genuine opacity involves true intermediate representations, while pseudo-opacity can be explained through surface-based generalizations. This distinction has important implications for theoretical approaches to opacity and highlights the need for careful empirical investigation of opaque patterns.The ongoing debate over opacity has also led to a broader reassessment of the goals and methods of phonological theory. Hale and Reiss (2008) argue for a more cognitively grounded approach to phonology, suggesting that some apparent cases of opacity may reflect the interaction of different cognitive systems rather than purely phonological processes.In conclusion, the study of opacity in phonology continues to be a rich and contentious area of research. While the serial approach of rule-based phonology offers a straightforward account of many opaque processes, the constraint-based parallel evaluation of classic OT struggles with certain types of opacity. The development of hybrid approaches like Harmonic Serialism and the reexamination of the nature of phonological generalizations suggest that a full understanding of opacity may require a more nuanced view of the relationship between underlying and surface forms. As research in this area progresses, it is likely that our understanding of opacity will continue to evolve, potentially leading to new insights into the nature of phonological computation and its relationship to other aspects of language and cognition.", "References": [{"title": "Opacity and ordering", "authors": "Paul Kiparsky", "journal": "Language", "year": "1973", "volumes": "49", "first page": "71", "last page": "114", "DOI": "10.2307/412514"}, {"title": "Faithfulness and identity in Prosodic Morphology", "authors": "John J.
