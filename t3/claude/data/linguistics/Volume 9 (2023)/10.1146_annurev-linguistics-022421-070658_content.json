{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of raising out of finite clauses, also known as hyperraising, has emerged as a significant challenge to classical syntactic theory and commonly assumed locality constraints on movement. This literature review examines the current state of research on hyperraising, focusing on three types of Minimalist analyses that have been proposed to account for this phenomenon.Traditionally, syntactic theory has posited that raising is permissible only from infinitival clauses, not finite ones. This constraint appeared to hold for languages like English, where sentences such as 'John seems to be happy' are grammatical, while 'John seems that is happy' are not. However, crosslinguistic investigations have revealed that many languages do, in fact, allow raising out of finite clauses, necessitating a reevaluation of our understanding of movement constraints.One approach to explaining hyperraising is the defectiveness/nonphase analysis. Proponents of this view, such as Ferreira (2000) and Nunes (2008), argue that certain finite clauses lack some property that typically defines finiteness, rendering them 'defective' and thus permeable to raising. This analysis ties a clause's ability to launch hyperraising to independently observable properties, which is a significant strength. However, as pointed out by Carstens and Diercks (2013), these analyses often struggle to derive the former from the latter in a principled way, leaving some explanatory gaps.Another prominent approach is the deactivation analysis, as proposed by Carstens (2011) and further developed by Halpert (2019). This analysis suggests that the features that typically block raising out of finite clauses can be deactivated under certain conditions, allowing hyperraising to occur. While this approach has seen empirical successes in accounting for hyperraising in various languages, it faces challenges in explaining why hyperraising is not possible in languages like English. As Zyman (2018) notes, the mechanisms proposed in deactivation analyses do not straightforwardly rule out hyperraising in English, requiring additional stipulations.The third major approach is the phase-edge analysis, advocated by researchers such as Zyman (2018) and Branan (2018). This analysis proposes that hyperraising is possible when the subject can move to the edge of the embedded clause phase, from where it can be extracted. While this approach has had success in accounting for hyperraising in languages like Mongolian and Zulu, it faces both empirical and conceptual challenges. For instance, Fong (2019) points out that some languages allow hyperraising without evidence of intermediate movement to the phase edge, challenging a key prediction of this analysis.Despite these challenges, the phase-edge analysis has spurred important theoretical developments. Branan and Erlewine (2020) propose a solution to some of the empirical problems faced by this approach, suggesting that certain probe-goal relations can span phase boundaries under specific conditions. This refinement allows the phase-edge analysis to account for a broader range of hyperraising phenomena while maintaining its core insights.An important consideration in evaluating these analyses is their implications for learnability. As noted by Wurmbrand (2019), any theory of hyperraising must explain how children acquire the specific conditions under which it is permitted in their language. The defectiveness/nonphase analysis potentially offers an advantage here, as it links hyperraising to other observable properties of the language. However, the precise nature of this link and how it is acquired remains an open question.It's worth noting that these approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some researchers, such as Diercks (2012), have proposed hybrid analyses that incorporate elements from multiple approaches. Such integrative efforts may prove fruitful in developing a more comprehensive understanding of hyperraising phenomena.As research on hyperraising continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly clear that crosslinguistic variation plays a crucial role in our understanding of syntactic movement. The study of hyperraising has not only challenged our assumptions about locality constraints but has also provided valuable insights into the nature of finiteness, phase theory, and the fundamental structure-building operation Merge.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding hyperraising, each of the current analytical approaches faces challenges. Further research is needed to refine these analyses, address their shortcomings, and potentially develop new approaches. As we continue to investigate hyperraising across a wider range of languages, we move closer to a more comprehensive theory of syntactic movement, contributing to our broader understanding of universal grammar and linguistic variation.", "References": [{"title": "Hyperraising and locality: A crosslinguistic perspective", "authors": "Carstens, Vicki and Diercks, Michael", "journal": "Linguistic Inquiry", "year": "2013", "volumes": "44", "first page": "168", "last page": "222", "DOI": "10.1162/LING_a_00126"}, {"title": "Hyperraising and the mechanics of case", "authors": "Halpert, Claire", "journal": "Natural Language & Linguistic Theory", "year": "2019", "volumes": "37", "first page": "1015", "last page": "1052", "DOI": "10.1007/s11049-018-9435-y"}, {"title": "On the locality of movement: A case study of Mongolian hyperraising", "authors": "Zyman, Erik", "journal": "Glossa: A Journal of General Linguistics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.5334/gjgl.494"}, {"title": "Probing the nature of the Final-over-Final Condition: The perspective from adpositions", "authors": "Branan, Kenyon and Erlewine, Michael Yoshitaka", "journal": "Natural Language & Linguistic Theory", "year": "2020", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1", "last page": "43", "DOI": "10.1007/s11049-020-09464-0"}, {"title": "Hyperraising and beyond: On transparency", "authors": "Wurmbrand, Susi", "journal": "Glossa: A Journal of General Linguistics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "4", "first page": "1", "last page": "48", "DOI": "10.5334/gjgl.897"}]}
