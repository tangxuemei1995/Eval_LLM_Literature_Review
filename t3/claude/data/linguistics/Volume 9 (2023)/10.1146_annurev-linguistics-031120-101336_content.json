{"Literature Review": "The actuation problem in linguistics, which seeks to explain why and how linguistic changes occur in specific languages at particular times and places, has been a subject of intense scholarly debate and investigation. This review focuses on the actuation of sound change, examining it from both individual and population perspectives.At the individual level, the actuation of linguistic change is fundamentally rooted in idiolectal differences. These differences arise from the unique linguistic experiences and personal characteristics of each speaker-listener. Bybee (2002) argues that the frequency of exposure to specific linguistic patterns plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's mental representations of language. This frequency effect can lead to divergent analyses of the same linguistic input across different speakers.The cognitive processing style of individuals also contributes significantly to idiolectal variation. Yu (2013) demonstrates that individuals with different cognitive styles, such as those with varying degrees of autistic-like traits, process and represent speech sounds differently. This variation in cognitive processing can potentially lead to novel linguistic innovations at the individual level.Furthermore, the physical and perceptual characteristics of speakers can influence their production and perception of speech sounds. Ohala (1993) proposes that many sound changes originate from misperceptions of speech, which can be influenced by factors such as the speaker's vocal tract anatomy or the listener's auditory capabilities. These individual differences in production and perception can serve as the seeds for potential sound changes.Social factors also play a crucial role in the actuation of linguistic change. Labov (2001) emphasizes the importance of social networks and community structure in the spread of linguistic innovations. He argues that certain individuals, often those with weak ties to multiple social groups, are more likely to introduce and propagate linguistic changes.Moving from the individual to the population level, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovations depend on complex interactions between speakers with unique idiolects. Trudgill (2008) proposes that linguistic accommodation in face-to-face interactions is a key mechanism for the spread of linguistic features. This accommodation process can lead to the gradual diffusion of innovations throughout a speech community.However, the successful propagation of a linguistic change is not guaranteed. As pointed out by Weinreich et al. (1968), the actuation of a change requires not only the presence of linguistic variation but also social and cultural conditions that favor its spread. This observation highlights the stochastic nature of language change propagation.The role of ideology and social meaning in the propagation of linguistic change has been emphasized by recent sociolinguistic research. Eckert (2008) argues that speakers may adopt linguistic innovations as resources for constructing social identities and expressing ideological stances. This perspective suggests that the successful propagation of a change may depend on its potential for social meaning-making.Given the complexity of factors involved in the actuation and propagation of linguistic change, computational modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating these processes. Agent-based models, in particular, offer a promising approach to simulating the interactions between individual speakers and the emergence of population-level patterns. Baxter et al. (2009) demonstrate how agent-based models can be used to explore the effects of social network structure on language change.Despite these advances, a comprehensive model of linguistic change actuation at the individual level remains elusive. The challenge lies in integrating the diverse factors that contribute to idiolectal variation and innovation, including cognitive, perceptual, social, and ideological influences. Future research in this area may benefit from interdisciplinary approaches that combine insights from linguistics, cognitive science, and social psychology.In conclusion, the actuation problem in linguistics continues to present significant challenges to researchers. While progress has been made in understanding the roles of individual differences, social factors, and stochastic processes in linguistic change, many questions remain unanswered. The development of more sophisticated computational models and the integration of insights from multiple disciplines offer promising avenues for future research on the actuation of linguistic change.", "References": [{"title": "Frequency of use and the organization of language", "authors": "Joan L.
