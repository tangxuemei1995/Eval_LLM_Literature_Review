{"Literature Review": "The assessment of second language (L2) speaking proficiency has become increasingly important in our globalized world, where effective communication across linguistic boundaries is crucial for academic, professional, and social success. This literature review aims to explore the current state of research on assessing L2 speaking proficiency, focusing on the construct of speaking proficiency, factors influencing assessment, and challenges in the field.The construct of speaking proficiency is multifaceted and complex, encompassing various components that contribute to effective oral communication. Bachman and Palmer (1996) proposed a model of communicative language ability that includes both organizational competence (grammatical and textual knowledge) and pragmatic competence (illocutionary and sociolinguistic knowledge). This model has been influential in shaping our understanding of speaking proficiency and its assessment. Building on this foundation, Fulcher (2003) emphasized the importance of including strategic competence in the construct of speaking proficiency, highlighting the ability of speakers to use communication strategies to overcome linguistic limitations.In recent years, researchers have increasingly recognized the interactive nature of speaking and its implications for assessment. McNamara and Roever (2006) argued that traditional approaches to speaking assessment often fail to capture the collaborative and co-constructed nature of spoken interaction. This has led to a growing interest in assessing interactional competence, which involves the ability to manage turn-taking, negotiate meaning, and adapt to different interlocutors and contexts (Galaczi & Taylor, 2018).The assessment of speaking proficiency is inherently challenging due to its ephemeral nature and the multiple factors that can influence performance. One significant concern is the potential for construct-irrelevant variance, which refers to factors that affect test scores but are not part of the intended construct being measured. Lumley and O'Sullivan (2005) investigated the impact of task characteristics on speaking test performance and found that factors such as task complexity and familiarity can significantly influence test-takers' output.Rater variability is another crucial factor that can affect the validity and reliability of speaking assessments. Brown (2012) conducted a comprehensive review of rater effects in language assessment and identified various sources of rater bias, including severity/leniency, central tendency, and halo effects. To mitigate these issues, researchers have explored the use of rater training programs and statistical methods for detecting and adjusting for rater effects (Davis, 2016).The role of the interlocutor in speaking tests has also received considerable attention in recent years. Brooks (2009) found that interlocutor behavior, such as the amount of support provided and the level of engagement, can significantly impact test-takers' performance. This has led to calls for more standardized interlocutor training and the development of guidelines for interlocutor behavior in speaking tests (Nakatsuhara, 2013).Advances in technology have opened up new possibilities for speaking assessment, particularly in the realm of automated scoring. Xi (2010) provided an overview of automated scoring systems for speaking tests and discussed their potential benefits, such as increased efficiency and consistency. However, challenges remain in developing systems that can accurately assess the full range of speaking skills, particularly those related to interaction and pragmatic competence.The assessment of L2 speaking proficiency in diverse contexts presents additional challenges. Gu (2014) examined the assessment of English speaking proficiency in China and highlighted the tensions between global assessment practices and local educational and cultural norms. This underscores the need for culturally sensitive approaches to speaking assessment that take into account the specific needs and contexts of different L2 learners.Looking to the future, several areas of research hold promise for advancing the field of L2 speaking assessment. One such area is the integration of corpus linguistics and conversation analysis techniques to inform the development of more authentic and interactive speaking tasks (Galaczi & Taylor, 2018). Additionally, there is growing interest in exploring the potential of dynamic assessment approaches, which focus on learners' potential for development rather than just their current proficiency level (Poehner, 2008).In conclusion, the assessment of L2 speaking proficiency remains a complex and challenging endeavor. While significant progress has been made in understanding the construct of speaking proficiency and developing more valid and reliable assessment methods, there is still much work to be done. Future research should continue to explore innovative approaches to speaking assessment that can capture the dynamic and interactive nature of spoken communication while minimizing construct-irrelevant variance. As our understanding of speaking proficiency evolves, so too must our assessment practices to ensure that they accurately reflect the diverse ways in which language learners use spoken language in real-world contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Language Testing in Practice: Designing and Developing Useful Language Tests", "authors": "Lyle F.
