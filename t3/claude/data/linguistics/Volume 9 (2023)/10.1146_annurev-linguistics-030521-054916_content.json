{"Literature Review": "The sociolinguistic landscape of North Africa, particularly Morocco, has undergone significant transformations over the past two decades (2001-2021). This period has been marked by complex interactions between linguistic diversity, cultural identity, and political ideologies. The region's rich linguistic heritage, characterized by the coexistence of Arabic, Tamazight (Berber), and various local dialects, has been subject to both suppression and revitalization efforts, reflecting broader sociopolitical dynamics.Historically, North Africa has been a melting pot of cultures and languages, with Tamazight being one of the oldest indigenous languages in the region. However, the post-colonial era saw a push towards Arabic monolingualism as part of nation-building efforts. Benrabah (2013) argues that this linguistic homogenization was driven by pan-Arab ideologies, which sought to erase the region's multicultural past. This policy had far-reaching consequences for Amazigh communities, leading to their marginalization and the erosion of their cultural identity.The suppression of Tamazight was particularly pronounced in Algeria and Morocco. Hoffman (2008) documents how Moroccan authorities actively discouraged the use of Tamazight in public spaces and education, promoting Arabic as the sole national language. This linguistic hegemony was reinforced through media, education, and administrative policies, creating a diglossic situation where Arabic was associated with prestige and modernity, while Tamazight was relegated to informal, domestic spheres.However, the turn of the millennium marked a shift in this paradigm. Boukous (2011) notes that growing activism and international pressure led to gradual recognition of Tamazight in Morocco. A significant milestone was reached in 2001 when King Mohammed VI established the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM), signaling a new era of linguistic pluralism. This was followed by the introduction of Tamazight in some primary schools, albeit with limited resources and mixed results.The Arab Spring of 2011 further catalyzed the recognition of linguistic rights in North Africa. In Morocco, the 2011 constitution officially recognized Tamazight as a national language alongside Arabic, a move that Ennaji (2014) describes as a watershed moment for Amazigh rights. Similarly, Algeria amended its constitution in 2016 to recognize Tamazight as a national and official language. These developments reflect a growing acknowledgment of the region's multicultural heritage and the importance of linguistic diversity in fostering social cohesion.Despite these positive steps, the implementation of multilingual policies has faced numerous challenges. Lafkioui and Merolla (2016) highlight the persistent gaps between official recognition and practical implementation, particularly in education and media. The standardization of Tamazight, which exists in several varieties, has been a contentious issue. While efforts have been made to develop a unified script and grammar, debates continue over which variety should serve as the standard and how to balance standardization with preserving local linguistic diversity.The role of Dārija, the Moroccan Arabic dialect, adds another layer of complexity to the sociolinguistic situation. Miller (2017) observes that while Dārija is widely spoken in everyday life, its status remains ambiguous. Some advocate for its recognition as a distinct language, while others view it as a corrupted form of Standard Arabic. This debate intersects with discussions about national identity and the balance between local and pan-Arab affiliations.The impact of globalization and digital technologies on North Africa's linguistic landscape cannot be overlooked. Errihani (2019) explores how social media and digital platforms have provided new spaces for linguistic expression and identity negotiation. Young people, in particular, are creatively blending Arabic, Tamazight, French, and English in online communication, challenging traditional linguistic boundaries and creating new hybrid forms of expression.Education remains a critical battleground for linguistic rights and cultural preservation. While Tamazight has been introduced in some schools, Marley (2015) points out that the lack of qualified teachers, appropriate materials, and clear pedagogical strategies hampers effective implementation. Moreover, the dominance of French in higher education and certain professional sectors continues to influence language attitudes and choices.Looking ahead, the sociolinguistic situation in North Africa faces new challenges and opportunities. The ongoing tension between linguistic diversity and national unity continues to shape language policies and practices. El Aissati (2020) argues that true linguistic pluralism requires not just official recognition but also sustained investment in education, media, and cultural production in minoritized languages.In conclusion, the past two decades have seen significant shifts in North Africa's sociolinguistic landscape, particularly regarding the status of Tamazight. While progress has been made in recognizing linguistic diversity, the legacy of monolingual ideologies and practical challenges in implementation persist. As the region continues to navigate these complex issues, the balance between preserving cultural heritage and fostering national cohesion remains a delicate and ongoing process.", "References": [{"title": "Language Conflict in Algeria: From Colonialism to Post-Independence", "authors": "Mohamed Benrabah", "journal": "Multilingual Matters", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.21832/9781847699657"}, {"title": "We Share Walls: Language, Land, and Gender in Berber Morocco", "authors": "Katherine E.
