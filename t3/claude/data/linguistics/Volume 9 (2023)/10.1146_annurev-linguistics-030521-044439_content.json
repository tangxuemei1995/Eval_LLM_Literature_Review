{"Literature Review": "Compositionality, a fundamental principle in linguistics, has been a subject of intense debate and research in the field of computational linguistics. This principle, which states that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent parts and the rules used to combine them, has long been considered essential for understanding and modeling natural language. However, the advent of neural networks and their remarkable success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks has challenged the traditional view of compositionality's role in computational linguistics.The tension between neural approaches and compositional models has been a recurring theme in recent literature. Baroni (2020) conducted a comprehensive review of the state of compositionality in distributional semantics, highlighting the challenges faced by strictly compositional models in capturing the full complexity of natural language. The author argues that while compositionality remains a useful guiding principle, a more flexible interpretation may be necessary to accommodate the nuances of real-world language use.One of the primary areas where the debate on compositionality has been particularly relevant is semantic parsing. Semantic parsing involves translating natural language utterances into formal representations of their meaning, often in the form of logical expressions or database queries. Traditional approaches to semantic parsing relied heavily on compositional principles, building meaning representations bottom-up from the syntactic structure of sentences. However, as noted by Herzig and Berant (2021), neural models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many semantic parsing benchmarks without explicitly incorporating compositional structures.Despite the success of neural models, several researchers have argued that compositionality remains crucial for developing robust and generalizable NLP systems. Lake and Baroni (2018) demonstrated that standard sequence-to-sequence models struggle with systematic generalization, failing to compose familiar concepts in novel ways. Their findings suggest that incorporating compositional biases into neural architectures may be necessary to achieve human-like generalization capabilities.The importance of compositionality becomes even more apparent when considering low-resource scenarios or tasks requiring complex reasoning. Russin et al. (2020) showed that models with compositional inductive biases perform better than purely connectionist approaches on tasks involving compositional generalization, especially when training data is limited. This highlights the potential of compositionality as a tool for improving sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization in neural models.However, striking the right balance between the flexibility of neural approaches and the structure imposed by compositional principles remains a significant challenge. Khot et al. (2021) proposed a neurosymbolic framework that combines the strengths of neural networks with symbolic reasoning, demonstrating improved performance on complex question-answering tasks. This approach suggests that hybrid models incorporating both neural and compositional elements may offer a promising direction for future research.The role of compositionality in representation learning has also been a subject of recent investigation. Li et al. (2019) explored the emergence of compositional representations in neural language models, finding that while these models can capture some aspects of compositionality, they often rely on shortcuts that may not generalize well to novel compositions. This underscores the need for careful evaluation and analysis of the representations learned by neural models.As the field continues to grapple with these challenges, new evaluation paradigms have emerged to assess the compositional capabilities of NLP models. Keysers et al. (2020) introduced the Compositional Freebase Questions (CFQ) dataset, specifically designed to test models' ability to generalize compositionally. Such benchmarks provide valuable tools for measuring progress towards more compositional and generalizable language understanding systems.Looking forward, the integration of compositionality into neural architectures remains an active area of research. Andreas (2020) proposed neural module networks as a way to incorporate compositional structure into end-to-end differentiable models, demonstrating improved performance on tasks requiring compositional reasoning. Similarly, Nye et al. (2020) explored the use of program synthesis techniques to induce compositional language understanding models, showing promise in combining the strengths of neural and symbolic approaches.In conclusion, while the success of neural models has challenged traditional notions of compositionality in computational linguistics, recent literature suggests that compositional principles continue to play a crucial role in developing robust, generalizable, and interpretable NLP systems. The future of the field likely lies in finding novel ways to incorporate compositional biases into neural architectures, striking a balance between the flexibility required to handle the complexities of natural language and the structured representations necessary for systematic generalization and reasoning. As research progresses, we can expect to see further innovations in neurosymbolic approaches and compositionally-aware neural architectures, paving the way for more advanced and human-like language understanding systems.", "References": [{"title": "Compositionality in distributional semantics", "authors": "Marco Baroni", "journal": "Annual Review of Linguistics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "6", "first page": "197", "last page": "212", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011619-030303"}, {"title": "Decoupling structure and lexicon for zero-shot semantic parsing", "authors": "Jonathan Herzig, Jonathan Berant", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "4619", "last page": "4630", "DOI": "10.18653/v1/2021.emnlp-main.379"}, {"title": "Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks", "authors": "Brenden M.
