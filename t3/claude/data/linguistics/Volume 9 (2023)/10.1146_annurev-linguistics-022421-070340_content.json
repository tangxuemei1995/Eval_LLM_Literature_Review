{"Literature Review": "The study of language has long been a cornerstone of academic inquiry, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries and evolving into a rich, multifaceted field of research. This literature review explores the epistemological and methodological frameworks employed in the study of language, both within linguistics departments and across various disciplinary areas, while highlighting emerging transdisciplinary trends and the need for a renewed focus on the human communicative experience.Linguistics as a discipline has undergone significant transformations since its inception. Chomsky's (1957) groundbreaking work on generative grammar revolutionized the field, establishing a formalist approach that dominated linguistic research for decades. However, as noted by Hymes (1972), this narrow focus on linguistic competence often neglected the social and cultural aspects of language use, leading to the development of sociolinguistics and ethnography of speaking.The organizational structure of language studies across departments, degree programs, and professions has been a subject of ongoing debate. Halliday (1985) proposed a functional approach to language, emphasizing its role in social contexts and paving the way for interdisciplinary collaborations. This shift towards a more holistic understanding of language has led to the integration of linguistic research in fields such as psychology, anthropology, and cognitive science.One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the emergence of transdisciplinary trends in the study of language and communication. Pennycook (2018) argues for a translingual approach that challenges traditional notions of language boundaries and emphasizes the fluid nature of linguistic practices. This perspective aligns with the concept of 'translanguaging' introduced by García and Wei (2014), which views multilingual communication as a dynamic and integrated process rather than a combination of separate language systems.The need to recenter humans and the human communicative experience in linguistic research has become increasingly apparent. Bucholtz and Hall (2016) advocate for a sociocultural linguistic approach that places human interaction at the forefront of language study. This perspective acknowledges the complex interplay between language, identity, and social structures, offering a more nuanced understanding of how language shapes and is shaped by human experiences.Lexical and morphological investigations provide compelling examples of the complexity and relevance of language study across areas and paradigms. Bybee's (2010) usage-based theory of language highlights the importance of frequency and repetition in shaping linguistic structures, challenging traditional views of grammar as a static system. This approach has found applications in various fields, including language acquisition, historical linguistics, and cognitive science.In the realm of lexical semantics, Pustejovsky's (1995) generative lexicon theory offers a framework for understanding the creative aspects of word meaning, demonstrating how context and conceptual knowledge interact to generate novel interpretations. This work has implications for natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology, illustrating the far-reaching impact of linguistic research.The study of morphology has also benefited from cross-disciplinary approaches. Bauer et al. (2013) provide a comprehensive overview of word-formation processes across languages, incorporating insights from typology, psycholinguistics, and corpus linguistics. Their work underscores the importance of considering both universal and language-specific factors in morphological analysis.As the field of linguistics continues to evolve, new methodologies and technologies are reshaping research practices. Corpus linguistics, as described by McEnery and Hardie (2012), has revolutionized the study of language use, allowing researchers to analyze vast amounts of naturally occurring data. This approach has found applications in various subfields of linguistics, as well as in disciplines such as literary studies, history, and social sciences.The integration of neuroscientific methods in linguistic research has opened up new avenues for understanding the cognitive and neural bases of language. Friederici's (2011) work on the neurobiology of syntax exemplifies how interdisciplinary collaboration can yield insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying language processing and acquisition.In conclusion, the study of language across disciplines has undergone significant transformations, moving towards more integrated and holistic approaches. The emergence of transdisciplinary trends and the renewed focus on human communicative experiences have enriched our understanding of language and its role in society. As illustrated by lexical and morphological investigations, the complexity and relevance of language study continue to extend beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries, offering valuable insights into human cognition, social interaction, and cultural practices. Future research in this field will likely continue to benefit from cross-disciplinary collaborations and innovative methodologies, further expanding our knowledge of language and its multifaceted nature.", "References": [{"title": "Syntactic structures", "authors": "Noam Chomsky", "journal": "The Hague: Mouton", "year": "1957", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Models of the interaction of language and social life", "authors": "Dell H.
