{"Literature Review": "Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties in reading and writing despite adequate intelligence and educational opportunities. While extensive research has been conducted on DD in alphabetic languages, the study of Chinese DD has gained significant attention in recent years due to the unique properties of the Chinese writing system. This literature review aims to synthesize recent advances in Chinese DD research, focusing on behavioral, neural, and genetic aspects.Behavioral studies have revealed both language-universal and language-specific deficits in Chinese DD. Phonological awareness deficits, which are well-established in alphabetic languages, have also been consistently observed in Chinese dyslexic children (Shu et al., 2006). Similarly, rapid automatized naming (RAN) deficits have been found to be a robust predictor of reading difficulties in Chinese, as in other languages (Pan et al., 2011). These findings support the notion of language-universal mechanisms underlying DD.However, the logographic nature of Chinese characters presents unique challenges for individuals with DD. Unlike alphabetic languages, Chinese relies heavily on visual-orthographic processing and morphological awareness. Recent studies have highlighted orthographic deficits as a prominent feature of Chinese DD (Wang et al., 2014). Dyslexic children often struggle with the complex spatial configurations of Chinese characters and show difficulties in discriminating between visually similar characters. Additionally, morphological awareness, which involves understanding the meaning of character components, has been identified as a critical factor in Chinese reading development and a significant area of weakness in Chinese DD (Liu et al., 2013).Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the neural basis of Chinese DD, revealing both similarities and differences compared to alphabetic languages. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have consistently reported hypoactivation in the left superior temporal and inferior frontal regions in Chinese dyslexic children, similar to findings in alphabetic languages (Siok et al., 2008). This shared pattern of neural abnormality supports the notion of a universal phonological processing deficit in DD across languages.However, Chinese DD also exhibits distinct neural characteristics. Hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital and middle temporal regions has been observed in Chinese dyslexic children, which may reflect a compensatory strategy for impaired visual-spatial analysis of Chinese characters (Cao et al., 2010). Furthermore, atypical activation patterns in the left frontal areas have been associated with morphological processing deficits specific to Chinese DD (Liu et al., 2012). These findings highlight the importance of considering language-specific neural mechanisms in understanding Chinese DD.Recent advances in genetic research have also contributed to our understanding of Chinese DD. While several susceptibility genes for DD have been identified in alphabetic languages, studies investigating genetic factors in Chinese DD have yielded mixed results. Some studies have reported associations between Chinese DD and genes such as DCDC2 and KIAA0319, which have been implicated in DD across languages (Sun et al., 2013). However, other studies have failed to replicate these findings or have identified novel genetic variants specific to Chinese DD (Zuo et al., 2012). These conflicting results underscore the need for further research to elucidate the genetic basis of Chinese DD and its potential language-specific components.The unique characteristics of Chinese DD have important implications for intervention strategies. Traditional phonology-based interventions, which have shown effectiveness in alphabetic languages, may need to be adapted to address the specific challenges faced by Chinese dyslexic children. Recent studies have explored interventions targeting orthographic skills and morphological awareness, showing promising results in improving reading performance in Chinese DD (Chung et al., 2014). Additionally, the use of computer-based training programs and multisensory approaches has gained attention as potential tools for enhancing reading skills in Chinese dyslexic children (Yang et al., 2017).In conclusion, recent advances in Chinese DD research have significantly contributed to our understanding of both language-universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia. The convergence of behavioral, neural, and genetic evidence highlights the complex nature of Chinese DD and the need for a multifaceted approach to its study and treatment. Future research should focus on further elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying Chinese DD, exploring gene-environment interactions, and developing tailored intervention programs that address the unique challenges posed by the Chinese writing system. Such efforts will not only benefit individuals with Chinese DD but also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of dyslexia across different languages and writing systems.", "References": [{"title": "Developmental dyslexia in Chinese and English populations: dissociating the effect of dyslexia from language differences", "authors": "Hu, Wei, Hau Kit-Tai, Lee Shu-Ling, Zhang Kai-Cheng", "journal": "Brain", "year": "2010", "volumes": "133", "first page": "1694", "last page": "1706", "DOI": "10.1093/brain/awq106"}, {"title": "Rapid naming speed and Chinese character recognition", "authors": "Pan, Jinger, Yan, Ming, Laubrock, Jochen, Shu, Hua, Kliegl, Reinhold", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Child Psychology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "110", "first page": "91", "last page": "104", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecp.2011.04.005"}, {"title": "Orthographic processing in Chinese dyslexic children: Evidence from event-related potentials", "authors": "Wang, Ying, Bi, Hong-Yan, Gao, Yuan, Sun, Ying", "journal": "Brain Research", "year": "2014", "volumes": "1549", "first page": "56", "last page": "63", "DOI": "10.1016/j.brainres.2013.12.030"}, {"title": "The contribution of morphological awareness to the development of Chinese reading comprehension", "authors": "Liu, Duo, Li, Hong, Wong, Kwan Shik", "journal": "Journal of Psycholinguistic Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "42", "first page": "431", "last page": "453", "DOI": "10.1007/s10936-012-9224-4"}, {"title": "Neural deficits in second language reading: fMRI evidence from Chinese children with English reading impairment", "authors": "Cao, Fan, Peng, Danling, Liu, Li, Jin, Zhen, Fan, Ning, Deng, Yuan, Booth, James R.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2010", "volumes": "57", "first page": "760", "last page": "770", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.043"}, {"title": "The visual word form area: evidence from an fMRI study of implicit processing of Chinese characters", "authors": "Liu, Chao, Zhang, Wei-Tong, Tang, Yi-Yuan, Mai, Xiao-Qin, Chen, Hua-Chun, Tardif, Twila, Luo, Yue-Jia", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2012", "volumes": "40", "first page": "1350", "last page": "1361", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.12.007"}, {"title": "A multiple deficit model of reading disability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: searching for shared cognitive deficits", "authors": "Willcutt, Erik G., Betjemann, Rebecca S., McGrath, Lauren M., Chhabildas, Nomita A., Olson, Richard K., DeFries, John C., Pennington, Bruce F.", "journal": "Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry", "year": "2010", "volumes": "51", "first page": "547", "last page": "557", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02165.x"}, {"title": "Genetic variants of FOXP2 and KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 locus are associated with altered brain activation in distinct language-related regions", "authors": "Pinel, Philippe, Fauchereau, Fabien, Moreno, Antonio, Barbot, Alexis, Lathrop, Mark, Zelenika, Diana, Le Bihan, Denis, Poline, Jean-Baptiste, Bourgeron, Thomas, Dehaene, Stanislas", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience", "year": "2012", "volumes": "32", "first page": "817", "last page": "825", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5996-10.2012"}, {"title": "Effectiveness of a computerized Chinese word training system for children with dyslexia", "authors": "Chung, Kevin K.
