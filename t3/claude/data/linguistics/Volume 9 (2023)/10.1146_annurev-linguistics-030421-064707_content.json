{"Literature Review": "Constructed languages, also known as artificial languages or conlangs, have been a subject of fascination for linguists, philosophers, and enthusiasts for centuries. These languages, created deliberately by individuals or groups, serve various purposes and offer unique insights into language structure, acquisition, and use. This literature review explores the four main types of constructed languages: philosophical languages, international auxiliary languages, fictional languages, and languages created for psycholinguistic experiments. Philosophical languages, developed primarily in the 17th century, were attempts to create a perfect language that could accurately represent reality and facilitate clear thinking. Eco (1995) provides a comprehensive overview of these efforts, discussing notable examples such as John Wilkins' 'Real Character' and Gottfried Leibniz's 'characteristica universalis'. These languages aimed to eliminate ambiguity and reflect the true nature of things, often employing complex classification systems. However, as Large (1985) points out, the inherent complexity of these languages limited their practical use and adoption. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the emergence of international auxiliary languages, designed to facilitate global communication. The most famous of these is Esperanto, created by L.L. Zamenhof in 1887. Tonkin (2015) examines the history and development of Esperanto, highlighting its relative success compared to other auxiliary languages. Despite not achieving widespread adoption as a global lingua franca, Esperanto has maintained a dedicated community of speakers and continues to be the subject of linguistic research. Blanke (2001) provides a comprehensive analysis of the linguistic features of various international auxiliary languages, comparing their structures and assessing their potential for international communication. In recent decades, the creation of languages for fictional worlds has gained significant popularity, particularly in science fiction and fantasy genres. Peterson (2015) explores the process of language creation for media, drawing on his experience as the creator of Dothraki and Valyrian for the television series 'Game of Thrones'. These fictional languages, often referred to as 'artlangs', serve to enhance the authenticity and depth of imaginary worlds. Okrent (2009) provides a broader perspective on invented languages, including both auxiliary languages and fictional creations, examining their cultural impact and the motivations behind their creation. The use of constructed languages in psycholinguistic research has become increasingly common, offering controlled environments for studying language acquisition and processing. Fedzechkina et al. (2012) demonstrate how artificial languages can be used to investigate the relationship between language structure and communicative efficiency. Their study reveals that learners tend to restructure input languages to increase their communicative efficiency, providing insights into the forces shaping natural language evolution. Similarly, Kirby et al. (2008) use artificial language learning experiments to explore the emergence of linguistic structure, showing how cultural transmission can lead to the development of compositional language systems. The study of constructed languages offers unique opportunities for linguistic research. As Rosenfelder (2010) argues, conlangs allow linguists to explore the boundaries of possible language structures and test hypotheses about language universals. By creating languages with specific features, researchers can investigate how these features interact and influence language learning and use. This approach has been particularly fruitful in the field of cognitive linguistics, where constructed languages have been used to study the relationship between language and thought (Whorf, 1956; Lucy, 1992). However, the field of constructed language research is not without its challenges and criticisms. Some linguists argue that artificial languages cannot fully replicate the complexity and nuance of natural languages, limiting their applicability to real-world linguistic phenomena. Nonetheless, as Stria (2015) contends, the study of constructed languages can provide valuable insights into language planning, policy, and revitalization efforts for endangered natural languages. In conclusion, constructed languages represent a diverse and fascinating area of linguistic inquiry. From philosophical languages seeking to capture the essence of reality to international auxiliary languages aiming to bridge communication gaps, from fictional languages enriching imaginary worlds to artificial languages designed for controlled experiments, conlangs offer a wealth of research opportunities. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely that constructed languages will play an increasingly important role in our understanding of language structure, acquisition, and use, contributing to both theoretical linguistics and practical applications in language teaching and communication technology.", "References": [{"title": "Interlinguistics and Esperanto studies: Paths to the scholarly literature", "authors": "Detlev Blanke", "journal": "Language Problems and Language Planning", "year": "2001", "volumes": "25", "first page": "1", "last page": "28", "DOI": "10.1075/lplp.25.1.02bla"}, {"title": "Complexity in language acquisition", "authors": "Maryia Fedzechkina, T.
