{"Literature Review": "The concept of homesign has been a subject of significant interest and debate within the fields of linguistics, deaf studies, and language acquisition. Homesign refers to the gestural communication systems developed by deaf individuals who have not had sustained access to conventional sign languages or spoken languages. This review aims to explore the contested issues surrounding homesign research and the evolving perspectives in this field.Early studies on homesign primarily focused on documenting and analyzing these communication systems through the lens of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics. Goldin-Meadow and Mylander (1983) conducted pioneering research on child homesigners, demonstrating that these children could develop structured communication systems without exposure to conventional language models. Their work suggested that homesign exhibited certain linguistic properties, such as systematic word order and the use of categorical distinctions, which were seen as evidence for innate language capacities.Building on this foundation, Senghas and Coppola (2001) investigated the emergence of linguistic structure in Nicaraguan Sign Language, which evolved from a homesign-like system. Their research provided insights into how linguistic complexity can increase over generations of language users, supporting the idea that homesign could serve as a precursor to more fully developed sign languages.However, recent years have witnessed a shift in the approach to homesign research, sparked by a larger critical movement within Deaf Studies led by deaf scholars. This new wave of scholarship, often employing linguistic ethnographic methods, has begun to challenge many of the established theoretical presuppositions underlying the foundational homesign research.One of the primary contested issues is the conceptualization of language itself within homesign research. Kusters (2017) argues that traditional linguistic frameworks may not adequately capture the full complexity and diversity of communication practices among deaf individuals. She advocates for a more holistic approach that considers the social, cultural, and embodied aspects of communication.Similarly, De Meulder et al. (2019) critique the tendency in earlier homesign research to view these communication systems primarily through the lens of linguistic deficiency. They argue for a perspective that recognizes the creative and adaptive nature of homesign, viewing it as a legitimate form of language rather than an incomplete or primitive system.Another contested issue relates to the portrayal of deaf individuals and their communication practices in homesign research. Friedner and Kusters (2020) highlight the importance of considering deaf perspectives and experiences in research design and interpretation. They argue that the framing of homesign as a subject of academic study has often reinforced deficit-based views of deaf communication, potentially overlooking the rich communicative competencies of homesigners.The methodological approaches used in homesign research have also come under scrutiny. While early studies relied heavily on experimental and observational methods rooted in psycholinguistics, recent work has emphasized the value of ethnographic approaches. Hou and Kusters (2020) demonstrate how linguistic ethnography can provide a more nuanced understanding of homesign in its social and cultural context, revealing aspects of communication that may be overlooked by more traditional linguistic analyses.Furthermore, the relationship between homesign and broader issues of language rights and deaf education has become a focal point of recent scholarship. Snoddon and De Meulder (2020) argue that the framing of homesign research has implications for language policy and educational practices. They call for a more critical examination of how research on homesign intersects with issues of linguistic human rights and the promotion of sign language acquisition.The current moment of transition in homesign research also reflects broader shifts in the field of linguistics. As Occhino et al. (2021) note, there is growing recognition of the need to incorporate diverse perspectives and methodologies in the study of language, particularly when investigating communication systems that fall outside traditional linguistic categories.In conclusion, the field of homesign research is at a critical juncture. While early studies laid important groundwork in documenting and analyzing these communication systems, recent scholarship has raised crucial questions about the theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and ethical considerations underlying this research. As the field moves forward, it will be essential to continue engaging with these contested issues, incorporating diverse perspectives and approaches to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of homesign and its significance in the broader context of human communication and language emergence.", "References": [{"title": "The resilience of language: What gesture creation in deaf children can tell us about how all children learn language", "authors": "Susan Goldin-Meadow, Carolyn Mylander", "journal": "Psychology Press", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203943267"}, {"title": "Children creating language: How Nicaraguan Sign Language acquired a spatial grammar", "authors": "Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola", "journal": "Psychological Science", "year": "2001", "volumes": "12", "first page": "323", "last page": "328", "DOI": "10.1111/1467-9280.00359"}, {"title": "To use or not to use: Sign language in deaf education", "authors": "Annelies Kusters", "journal": "The Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies in Language", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "235", "last page": "252", "DOI": "10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190241414.013.16"}, {"title": "The legal recognition of sign languages: Advocacy and outcomes around the world", "authors": "Maartje De Meulder, Joseph J.
