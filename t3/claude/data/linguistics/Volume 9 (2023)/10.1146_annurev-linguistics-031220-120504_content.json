{"Literature Review": "Language documentation has emerged as a crucial subfield of linguistics over the past two and a half decades, coinciding with the widespread availability of affordable digital technologies. This synchronicity has led to a symbiotic relationship between technological advancements and the evolution of language documentation practices. This literature review aims to explore recent technological innovations in resource creation and mobilization within the field of language documentation.The advent of digital technologies has revolutionized the way linguists approach language documentation. As noted by Himmelmann (2006), the primary goal of language documentation is to create a lasting, multipurpose record of a language. This objective has been significantly facilitated by the development of various digital tools and platforms. Bird and Simons (2003) emphasized the importance of creating digital language documentation that is portable, long-lasting, and accessible to both the speech community and researchers.In recent years, there has been a shift towards more user-friendly and efficient tools for resource creation. Gawne and Berez-Kroeker (2018) highlighted the increasing use of mobile devices and apps for field recordings, allowing for more spontaneous and natural data collection. This trend has been further supported by the development of specialized software such as ELAN and FLEx, which have become standard tools for transcription and annotation (Drude et al., 2012).The creation of multimodal resources has also gained prominence in language documentation. Seyfeddinipur (2012) discussed the importance of video recordings in capturing not only linguistic data but also associated gestures and cultural contexts. This approach has been facilitated by advancements in video recording technology and the increasing affordability of high-quality equipment.In terms of resource mobilization, recent years have seen a significant shift towards open access and collaborative platforms. Thieberger and Berez (2012) emphasized the importance of making language documentation materials accessible to both researchers and community members. This has led to the development of online repositories and archives such as PARADISEC and the Language Archive, which provide long-term storage and access to language documentation resources (Nordlinger et al., 2019).The concept of 'mobilization' in language documentation extends beyond mere accessibility. Holton (2012) argued for the need to create resources that are not only preserved but also actively used in language revitalization efforts. This has led to innovations in the development of user-friendly interfaces and mobile applications that can bridge the gap between archived materials and practical language learning tools.One significant advancement in resource mobilization is the development of corpus management systems. Cox (2011) described the benefits of using such systems for organizing, searching, and analyzing large collections of language data. These tools have greatly enhanced the usability of documentary resources for both researchers and community members.The integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in language documentation has also gained traction. Anastasopoulos et al. (2020) demonstrated how machine learning algorithms can assist in tasks such as automatic transcription and annotation, potentially speeding up the resource creation process. However, they also cautioned about the limitations of these technologies, especially for under-resourced languages.Another important trend is the increasing focus on community involvement in both resource creation and mobilization. Czaykowska-Higgins (2009) advocated for a collaborative model of language documentation that involves community members at all stages of the process. This approach has been facilitated by user-friendly technologies that allow non-specialists to participate in documentation efforts.In conclusion, recent technological advancements have significantly impacted both the creation and mobilization of resources in language documentation. From improved recording and annotation tools to innovative platforms for sharing and utilizing language data, these technologies have expanded the possibilities for preserving and revitalizing endangered languages. However, as the field continues to evolve, it is crucial to maintain a balance between technological innovation and the core principles of ethical, community-centered language documentation.", "References": [{"title": "Documentary and descriptive linguistics", "authors": "Nikolaus P.
