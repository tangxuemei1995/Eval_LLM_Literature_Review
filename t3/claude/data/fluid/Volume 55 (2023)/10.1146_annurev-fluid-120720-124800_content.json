{"Literature Review": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become an indispensable tool in the aerospace industry, revolutionizing the design and analysis of aircraft and spacecraft. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of aerospace CFD technology, its applications, challenges, and future prospects.The evolution of CFD in aerospace engineering has been remarkable over the past few decades. Jameson et al. (2019) highlight how CFD has transitioned from a purely academic pursuit to an essential component of industrial design processes. The authors emphasize that CFD now plays a crucial role in reducing the time and cost associated with aircraft development by minimizing the need for physical prototypes and wind tunnel testing.One of the primary advantages of CFD in aerospace applications is its ability to simulate complex flow phenomena that are difficult or impossible to replicate in experimental settings. Wang and Zha (2021) demonstrate this capability in their study of supersonic inlet-isolator flow, where CFD simulations provided valuable insights into shock wave-boundary layer interactions that are challenging to observe experimentally.Geometry representation and manipulation remain central to the effective application of CFD in aerospace design. Kenway et al. (2017) discuss the importance of high-fidelity geometry modeling in aerodynamic shape optimization, emphasizing the need for seamless integration between CAD systems and CFD solvers. The authors propose novel approaches to overcome the limitations of traditional parametric CAD models in capturing complex geometries.Turbulence modeling continues to be a critical aspect of aerospace CFD simulations. Spalart (2015) provides a comprehensive review of turbulence models used in aerospace applications, highlighting the strengths and limitations of various approaches. The author emphasizes the ongoing challenge of balancing computational efficiency with accuracy in turbulence modeling, particularly for complex flow regimes encountered in aerospace applications.The development of higher-order numerical algorithms has been a focus of recent research in aerospace CFD. Wang et al. (2020) present a comparative study of various high-order methods for compressible flow simulations, demonstrating their potential to improve solution accuracy and reduce computational costs. The authors note that while high-order methods show promise, their widespread adoption in industrial settings is still limited due to implementation challenges and increased computational requirements.Output-based mesh adaptation has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the efficiency and accuracy of CFD simulations. Fidkowski and Darmofal (2011) provide a comprehensive review of output-based error estimation and mesh adaptation methods, highlighting their potential to automatically refine meshes in regions of high solution error. The authors discuss the application of these techniques to aerospace problems, demonstrating significant improvements in solution accuracy compared to uniform mesh refinement.Numerical design optimization has become an integral part of the aerospace design process, leveraging CFD simulations to explore vast design spaces efficiently. Martins and Lambe (2013) review various optimization algorithms and their applications in aerospace design, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary optimization in addressing the complex trade-offs inherent in aircraft design.Despite the significant progress in aerospace CFD technology, several challenges remain. Slotnick et al. (2014) provide a comprehensive assessment of the state of the art in CFD for aerospace applications, identifying key areas for future research and development. The authors highlight the need for improved turbulence modeling, better handling of complex geometries, and more efficient algorithms for large-scale simulations.Looking to the future, certification by analysis and model-based design are expected to become standard practices in the aerospace industry. Palacios et al. (2018) discuss the potential of digital twin technology in aerospace engineering, emphasizing the role of high-fidelity CFD simulations in creating accurate virtual representations of physical systems. The authors note that realizing this vision will require continued advancements in CFD technology, as well as improved integration with other simulation tools and experimental data.In conclusion, aerospace CFD technology has made significant strides in recent years, becoming an essential tool in the design and analysis of aircraft and spacecraft. However, challenges remain in areas such as turbulence modeling, geometry handling, and computational efficiency. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued advancement of aerospace CFD and its integration into the broader framework of digital engineering and model-based design.", "References": [{"title": "Fifty Years of CFD for Computational Fluid Dynamics", "authors": "Antony Jameson, Massimiliano Fatica, Sriram Shankaran, Karthik Duraisamy, Juan J.
