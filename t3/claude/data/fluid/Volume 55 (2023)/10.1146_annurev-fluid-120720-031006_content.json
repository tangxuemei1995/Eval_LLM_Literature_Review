{"Literature Review": "Turbulence, a ubiquitous phenomenon in fluid dynamics, has long been a subject of intense scientific inquiry. While much of the foundational work in turbulence theory has focused on homogeneous and isotropic flows, real-world turbulent systems are often characterized by inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to develop more sophisticated theoretical frameworks to understand and predict the behavior of such complex turbulent flows.One of the most significant developments in this field has been the application of quasi-linear approximations to inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. Marston et al. (2016) provided a comprehensive review of the direct statistical simulation (DSS) approach, which employs quasi-linear approximations to study the statistical properties of turbulent flows. This method has proven particularly useful in studying geophysical and astrophysical flows, where traditional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are often computationally prohibitive.Building on this work, Tobias and Marston (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of quasi-linear approximations in capturing the essential dynamics of stratified turbulence. Their study revealed that these approximations can accurately predict the formation and maintenance of zonal flows, a key feature of many geophysical and astrophysical systems. This finding has important implications for our understanding of planetary atmospheres and stellar interiors.The application of quasi-linear theory to inhomogeneous turbulence has also led to new insights into the nature of turbulent transport. Mitra and Brons (2018) used a quasi-linear approach to study turbulent thermal convection in a rotating sphere, a problem of great relevance to planetary and stellar physics. Their results showed that quasi-linear models can capture the essential features of heat transport in such systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to full DNS.While quasi-linear approximations have shown great promise, they are not without limitations. Farazmand et al. (2019) conducted a detailed comparison of quasi-linear and fully nonlinear models of stratified turbulence. Their study highlighted some of the shortcomings of quasi-linear approximations, particularly in capturing the full spectrum of energy transfer between scales. This work underscores the need for continued refinement of quasi-linear theories and careful consideration of their applicability to different turbulent regimes.In parallel with these developments in quasi-linear theory, there have been significant advances in statistical approaches to inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. Pouquet et al. (2017) presented a comprehensive review of recent progress in understanding the statistical properties of anisotropic turbulence, with a particular focus on the role of helicity in the energy cascade. Their work highlighted the importance of considering both direct and inverse cascades in anisotropic turbulent flows, a feature that is often overlooked in traditional turbulence models.The statistical approach has also been fruitfully applied to the study of wall-bounded turbulent flows, a classic example of inhomogeneous turbulence. Jiménez (2018) provided an in-depth analysis of the statistical properties of near-wall turbulence, emphasizing the role of coherent structures in the dynamics of these flows. This work has important implications for the development of improved wall models for large-eddy simulations of turbulent flows.Recent years have also seen significant progress in the development of new mathematical tools for analyzing inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. Biferale et al. (2020) introduced a novel approach based on the decomposition of the velocity field into helical modes, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the energy transfer mechanisms in anisotropic turbulence. This method has provided new insights into the nature of the energy cascade in rotating and stratified turbulent flows.Complementing these theoretical advances, there have been important developments in experimental techniques for studying inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. Bodenschatz et al. (2021) presented a comprehensive review of recent experimental studies of turbulent flows, highlighting new measurement techniques that allow for unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution in the study of complex turbulent systems. These experimental advances are crucial for validating and refining theoretical models of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence.Despite these significant advances, many open questions remain in the field of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence. One key challenge is the development of robust closure models that can accurately capture the effects of small-scale turbulence on large-scale flows in complex geometries. Another important area for future research is the integration of machine learning techniques with quasi-linear and statistical approaches to turbulence modeling, as highlighted by Duraisamy et al. (2019) in their review of data-driven turbulence modeling.In conclusion, the study of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence has seen significant progress in recent years, driven by advances in quasi-linear theory, statistical approaches, and experimental techniques. However, much work remains to be done to fully understand and predict the behavior of these complex turbulent systems. As our computational capabilities continue to grow and new theoretical tools are developed, we can expect further breakthroughs in this challenging and important field of fluid dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Direct statistical simulation of out-of-equilibrium jets", "authors": "J.
