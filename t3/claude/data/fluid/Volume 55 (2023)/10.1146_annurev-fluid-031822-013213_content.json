{"Literature Review": "The evaporation of sessile droplets is a fundamental phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in various scientific and industrial applications. This complex process has attracted significant attention from researchers across multiple disciplines due to its relevance in fields such as microfluidics, heat transfer, and surface science. The present literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the evaporation of sessile droplets, focusing on mathematical models, evaporation modes, and their applications.One of the primary approaches to understanding sessile droplet evaporation is through mathematical modeling. Picknett and Bexon's seminal work in 1977 laid the foundation for many subsequent studies by proposing a diffusion-limited model for droplet evaporation. Their model, which assumed a spherical-cap droplet shape and quasi-steady-state diffusion, has been widely used and refined over the years. Hu and Larson (2002) extended this model by incorporating the effects of substrate thermal properties and evaporative cooling, providing more accurate predictions of evaporation rates.The evaporation modes of sessile droplets have been a subject of intense investigation. Typically, three distinct modes are recognized: the constant contact radius (CCR) mode, the constant contact angle (CCA) mode, and the mixed mode. Stauber et al. (2014) conducted a comprehensive theoretical analysis of these modes, demonstrating how the transition between modes depends on the initial contact angle and the receding contact angle of the droplet. Their work has been instrumental in predicting droplet lifetimes and understanding the dynamics of the evaporation process.The influence of substrate properties on droplet evaporation has been extensively studied. Shanahan and Bourgès-Monnier (1994) investigated the effect of substrate roughness on evaporation kinetics, showing that increased roughness can lead to pinning of the contact line and prolonged evaporation times. More recently, Dash and Garimella (2013) examined the impact of substrate thermal conductivity on local evaporation rates, revealing that highly conductive substrates can significantly alter the temperature distribution within the droplet and affect overall evaporation dynamics.Environmental factors also play a crucial role in droplet evaporation. Carrier et al. (2016) studied the effects of relative humidity on evaporation rates, demonstrating that higher humidity levels lead to slower evaporation and longer droplet lifetimes. Additionally, Sefiane et al. (2009) investigated the influence of ambient temperature on evaporation dynamics, showing that elevated temperatures can induce complex thermal patterns within the droplet, leading to enhanced evaporation rates.The deposition of particles during droplet evaporation has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in various applications, such as inkjet printing and biomedical diagnostics. Deegan et al. (1997) provided a groundbreaking explanation for the 'coffee ring effect,' where suspended particles accumulate at the droplet's edge during evaporation. This work has inspired numerous studies on controlling particle deposition patterns, including the recent efforts by Mampallil and Eral (2018) to suppress the coffee ring effect through various physical and chemical means.The interaction between multiple droplets during evaporation is another area of growing interest. Carrier et al. (2013) investigated the evaporation of droplet arrays, revealing complex vapor-mediated interactions that can significantly affect overall evaporation rates and droplet lifetimes. These findings have important implications for applications involving droplet arrays, such as microfluidic devices and spray cooling systems.Recent advancements in experimental techniques have enabled more detailed investigations of droplet evaporation phenomena. For instance, Kang et al. (2013) used high-speed imaging and interferometry to study the internal flow patterns within evaporating droplets, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms driving particle transport and deposition. Such experimental approaches, combined with increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations, are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of sessile droplet evaporation.Looking to the future, several promising research directions are emerging. The evaporation of complex fluids, such as nanofluids and biological solutions, presents new challenges and opportunities for investigation. Additionally, the development of smart surfaces with tunable wettability properties offers exciting possibilities for controlling droplet evaporation dynamics. As our understanding of the fundamental physics governing sessile droplet evaporation continues to grow, so too will our ability to harness this phenomenon for innovative applications in fields ranging from energy to healthcare.In conclusion, the evaporation of sessile droplets remains a rich and active area of research, with significant progress made in recent decades through mathematical modeling, experimental investigations, and numerical simulations. As the field continues to evolve, interdisciplinary collaborations and the development of novel experimental and computational techniques will be crucial in addressing the remaining challenges and unlocking new applications for this fascinating phenomenon.", "References": [{"title": "Evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate", "authors": "R.
