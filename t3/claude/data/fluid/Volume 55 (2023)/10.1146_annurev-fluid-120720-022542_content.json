{"Literature Review": "Three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (3D STBLI) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their complex dynamics and widespread occurrence in aerospace applications. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on 3D STBLI, highlighting key findings, challenges, and future research directions.The study of 3D STBLI has been largely motivated by the limitations of two-dimensional (2D) models in accurately representing real-world flow phenomena. While 2D STBLI have been extensively studied and well-understood, the transition to 3D configurations introduces new complexities and challenges. Clemens and Narayanaswamy (2014) provide a comprehensive overview of the differences between 2D and 3D STBLI, emphasizing the need for dedicated research on 3D interactions.One of the most significant findings in 3D STBLI research is the emergence of conical asymptotic behavior in semi-infinite interactions. This phenomenon, as described by Gaitonde (2015), occurs when the specifics of the shock generator become insignificant, leading to a more generalized flow structure. The conical behavior has important implications for modeling and predicting 3D STBLI in various applications.The separation structure in 3D STBLI differs substantially from its 2D counterpart. Adler and Gaitonde (2018) highlight the skewed vortical structure characteristic of 3D separations, which results from the interaction between the essentially 2D influence of the boundary layer and the 3D nature of the swept shock. This complex structure poses challenges for both experimental measurements and numerical simulations.Spectral analysis of 3D STBLI reveals interesting differences compared to 2D interactions. While both 2D and 3D STBLI exhibit prominent spectral content below that of the turbulent boundary layer, the absence of a uniform separation length scale in 3D interactions leads to distinct spectral characteristics. Touber and Sandham (2011) observed that 3D STBLI spectra are more representative of mid-frequency, convective shear-layer dynamics, whereas phenomena associated with 2D separation-shock breathing are less pronounced.The breakdown of asymptotic behavior in certain regions of 3D STBLI has been a subject of recent investigation. Dwivedi et al. (2017) studied the configuration-dependent nature of this breakdown, particularly in inceptive regions near shock generators and symmetry planes. Understanding these localized phenomena is crucial for accurate prediction and control of 3D STBLI.Experimental techniques for studying 3D STBLI have advanced significantly in recent years. Humble (2009) provides an overview of various measurement techniques, including particle image velocimetry (PIV) and pressure-sensitive paint (PSP), which have enabled detailed characterization of 3D flow structures. These experimental advancements have been complemented by improvements in numerical simulation capabilities, as discussed by Bermejo-Moreno et al. (2014).The study of unsteady aspects of 3D STBLI has gained traction, with researchers investigating the temporal evolution of these interactions. Priebe and Martín (2012) conducted large-eddy simulations to examine the unsteady characteristics of 3D STBLI, revealing complex spatiotemporal dynamics that differ from 2D cases.Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of 3D STBLI research. Modal and non-modal stability analyses, which have proven valuable in understanding 2D STBLI, are still in their infancy for 3D configurations. Additionally, the study of moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions in 3D settings presents unique challenges and opportunities for future research.The interaction between 3D STBLI and flexible structures, known as fluid-structure interaction (FSI), is another area of growing interest. Spottswood et al. (2016) highlight the importance of understanding FSI in the context of 3D STBLI for aerospace applications, particularly in the design of high-speed vehicles.Flow control strategies for 3D STBLI represent a promising avenue for future research. While various control techniques have been developed for 2D interactions, their effectiveness and applicability to 3D configurations remain to be fully explored. Babinsky and Harvey (2011) discuss potential flow control methods for 3D STBLI, emphasizing the need for further investigation in this area.In conclusion, the study of 3D STBLI has made significant strides in recent years, revealing complex flow structures and dynamics that differ substantially from 2D interactions. However, many challenges remain, particularly in understanding localized phenomena, unsteady aspects, and developing effective control strategies. Future research directions should focus on advanced stability analyses, moving-shock interactions, fluid-structure interactions, and flow control techniques tailored to 3D STBLI configurations.", "References": [{"title": "Shock Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions: Progress and Challenges", "authors": "Clemens, Noel T. and Narayanaswamy, Venkateswaran", "journal": "Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "46", "first page": "469", "last page": "492", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141346"}, {"title": "Progress in Shock Wave/Boundary Layer Interactions", "authors": "Gaitonde, Datta V.", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2015", "volumes": "72", "first page": "80", "last page": "99", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paerosci.2014.09.002"}, {"title": "Unsteady Shock-Wave Dynamics in Three-Dimensional Transitional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Adler, Marcus C. and Gaitonde, Datta V.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "840", "first page": "291", "last page": "338", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2018.63"}, {"title": "Large-Eddy Simulation of Shock Wave/Turbulent Boundary-Layer Interaction", "authors": "Touber, Emile and Sandham, Neil D.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "671", "first page": "417", "last page": "465", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022112010005811"}, {"title": "Numerical Investigation of Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Turbulent-Boundary-Layer Interaction", "authors": "Dwivedi, Anubhav and Hildebrand, Nathaniel and Nichols, Joseph W. and Jovanovic, Mihailo R. and Candler, Graham V.", "journal": "Physical Review Fluids", "year": "2017", "volumes": "2", "first page": "043901", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.043901"}, {"title": "Recent Experimental Studies on Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Humble, Raymond A.", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2009", "volumes": "45", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paerosci.2008.11.001"}, {"title": "Large-Eddy Simulations of a Shock-Wave/Turbulent-Boundary-Layer Interaction", "authors": "Bermejo-Moreno, Ivan and Larsson, Johan and Bodart, Julien and Vicquelin, Ronan", "journal": "Center for Turbulence Research Annual Research Briefs", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "49", "last page": "60", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Direct Numerical Simulation of a Hypersonic Shock/Turbulent Boundary Layer Interaction", "authors": "Priebe, Stephan and Martín, M.
