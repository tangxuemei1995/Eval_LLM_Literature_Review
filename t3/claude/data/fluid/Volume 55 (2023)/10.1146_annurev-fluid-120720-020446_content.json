{"Literature Review": "Rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection (RRBC) is a fundamental system that combines the effects of thermal buoyancy and rotation, making it highly relevant to numerous geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on RRBC, focusing on its key features, dynamics, and implications for heat transport in various natural systems.RRBC is characterized by a fluid layer confined between two horizontal plates, with the lower plate heated and the upper plate cooled, while the entire system rotates about a vertical axis. The interplay between buoyancy-driven convection and rotational effects leads to a rich variety of flow regimes and structures. The strength of buoyancy is quantified by the Rayleigh number (Ra), while the influence of rotation is represented by the Ekman number (Ek) or the Rossby number (Ro).One of the primary effects of rotation on Rayleigh–Bénard convection is the suppression of the onset of convection. Chandrasekhar (1961) demonstrated that the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection increases with rotation rate. This suppression is due to the Taylor-Proudman effect, which tends to inhibit motions parallel to the rotation axis.As the rotation rate increases, the flow structure undergoes significant changes. In non-rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, thermal plumes are the dominant coherent structures. However, in RRBC, these plumes transform into vortical columns aligned with the rotation axis. Julien et al. (1996) showed that these columns are a result of the balance between Coriolis and buoyancy forces, leading to a state known as geostrophic turbulence.The presence of rotation also affects the velocity boundary layers in the system. Ekman boundary layers form near the top and bottom plates, characterized by a spiral flow structure. These layers play a crucial role in heat transport and the overall dynamics of RRBC. Kunnen et al. (2011) demonstrated that Ekman pumping in these boundary layers can enhance vertical transport in certain regimes.One of the most intriguing aspects of RRBC is its impact on global heat transport. Depending on the relative strengths of buoyancy and Coriolis forces, rotation can either enhance or suppress heat transfer. King et al. (2012) proposed a comprehensive scaling theory for heat transport in RRBC, identifying distinct regimes based on the competition between rotational and buoyancy effects.In the rotation-dominated regime, where Coriolis forces are strong compared to buoyancy, heat transport is primarily through Ekman pumping. This leads to an enhancement of heat transfer compared to non-rotating convection at the same Rayleigh number. Conversely, in the buoyancy-dominated regime, rotation tends to suppress large-scale circulation and reduce heat transport.The transition between these regimes has been the subject of intense study. Stevens et al. (2013) used direct numerical simulations to investigate this transition, finding that the crossover between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes occurs at a critical Rossby number that depends on the Prandtl number of the fluid.Recent studies have also explored the effects of non-Oberbeck–Boussinesq (NOB) conditions in RRBC. Horn et al. (2013) showed that NOB effects can lead to asymmetries in the flow structure and heat transport between the top and bottom of the container. These effects become particularly important in systems with large temperature differences or near critical points.Centrifugal buoyancy, another consequence of rotation, has been shown to have significant effects on RRBC, especially at high rotation rates. Homsy and Hudson (1969) demonstrated that centrifugal effects can lead to a radial temperature gradient, potentially destabilizing the flow even in the absence of gravitational buoyancy.The study of RRBC has benefited greatly from advances in experimental techniques and numerical simulations. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and thermochromic liquid crystal techniques have allowed for detailed measurements of velocity and temperature fields in laboratory experiments. Meanwhile, high-resolution direct numerical simulations have provided insights into the three-dimensional structure of the flow and the mechanisms of heat transport.In conclusion, RRBC represents a rich and complex system with direct relevance to many natural phenomena. The interplay between rotation and buoyancy leads to a variety of flow regimes and heat transport mechanisms. Future research in this field is likely to focus on extreme parameter regimes, more realistic boundary conditions, and the incorporation of additional effects such as magnetic fields and compressibility, further bridging the gap between idealized models and real-world geophysical and astrophysical systems.", "References": [{"title": "The stability of a horizontal fluid layer of fluid of finite depth subject to Coriolis forces and internal heat sources", "authors": "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar", "journal": "Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.
