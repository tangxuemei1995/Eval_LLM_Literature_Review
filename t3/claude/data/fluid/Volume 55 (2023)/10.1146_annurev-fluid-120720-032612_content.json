{"Literature Review": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) have emerged as a promising technology in the field of propulsion and power generation, offering the potential for significant improvements in efficiency and performance compared to conventional combustion systems. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of nonidealities in RDEs, focusing on the challenges and complexities that arise in practical implementations.RDEs operate on the principle of pressure-gain combustion, where a continuously propagating detonation wave confined within an annular chamber provides both shock-based compression and chemical heat release. The concept of RDEs was first proposed by Voitsekhovskii in the 1960s, but it has gained renewed interest in recent years due to advancements in computational capabilities and experimental techniques (Bykovskii et al., 2006).One of the primary advantages of RDEs is their ability to process high mass flow rates in compact designs, making them attractive for aerospace applications. Lu and Braun (2014) conducted a comprehensive review of RDE fundamentals and highlighted the potential for improved thermal efficiency and reduced entropy generation compared to conventional gas turbine engines.However, the realization of these theoretical benefits in practical RDE designs is hindered by various nonidealities. Unsteady mixing is a significant challenge in RDEs, as the high-speed detonation wave interacts with the fuel and oxidizer injection process. Schwer and Kailasanath (2013) used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of mixing on RDE performance and found that incomplete mixing can lead to reduced detonation wave speeds and lower overall efficiency.Secondary combustion processes, often referred to as deflagration, are another important nonideality in RDEs. These processes occur when unreacted or partially reacted mixtures from the primary detonation zone undergo subsequent combustion. Rankin et al. (2017) conducted experimental studies on an optically accessible RDE and observed significant heat release from secondary combustion, which can contribute to performance losses and increased heat loading on engine components.The presence of multiple competing waves is a complex phenomenon observed in many RDE configurations. Fujii et al. (2017) used high-speed visualization techniques to study wave dynamics in an RDE and identified various wave modes, including single-wave, counter-rotating wave, and multiple-wave modes. The interaction between these waves can significantly impact the overall performance and stability of the engine.Secondary waves, such as oblique shocks and expansion fans, also play a crucial role in RDE dynamics. Nordeen et al. (2014) developed a reduced-order model to analyze the impact of these secondary waves on RDE performance and found that they can affect the refill process and influence the overall cycle efficiency.The extreme unsteady environment in RDEs poses significant challenges for both experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Innovative diagnostic techniques have been developed to probe the complex flow field within RDEs. For instance, Bennewitz et al. (2019) employed high-speed stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure three-dimensional velocity fields in an operating RDE, providing valuable insights into the flow structures and mixing processes.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have become an essential tool for understanding RDE physics and optimizing designs. Cocks et al. (2016) conducted large-eddy simulations (LES) of an RDE and demonstrated the importance of resolving small-scale turbulent structures for accurate prediction of mixing and combustion processes.Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in fully understanding and mitigating the nonidealities in RDEs. The coupling between large-scale wave dynamics and small-scale mixing and combustion processes is particularly complex and requires further investigation. Additionally, the development of robust control strategies to manage multiple wave modes and optimize performance across a range of operating conditions is an active area of research.In conclusion, while RDEs offer significant potential for improved propulsion and power generation systems, the realization of these benefits requires a thorough understanding and management of various nonidealities. Unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves are key challenges that must be addressed through continued research and development efforts. As our understanding of these complex phenomena improves, it is expected that more efficient and practical RDE designs will emerge, potentially revolutionizing the field of pressure-gain combustion.", "References": [{"title": "Continuous Detonation Engines", "authors": "Fedor A.
