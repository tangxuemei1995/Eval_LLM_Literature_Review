{"Literature Review": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) is a fascinating phenomenon that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its unique characteristics and potential implications for various fields, including fluid dynamics, polymer physics, and engineering applications. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of EIT, its mechanisms, and its relationships with other related phenomena such as elastic turbulence and polymer drag reduction.EIT is characterized by a chaotic flow state driven by polymer dynamics, observed across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Unlike Newtonian turbulence, which is primarily governed by inertial forces, EIT involves complex interactions between fluid inertia and elastic forces arising from the presence of polymers in the flow. The phenomenon was first reported by Samanta et al. (2013), who observed sustained chaotic flow states in polymer solutions at Reynolds numbers well below the critical value for Newtonian turbulence onset.One of the most intriguing aspects of EIT is its ability to facilitate energy transfer from small elastic scales to large flow scales. This reverse energy cascade is in stark contrast to the classical energy cascade observed in Newtonian turbulence, where energy typically flows from large to small scales. Dubief et al. (2013) conducted numerical simulations that provided insights into this unique energy transfer mechanism, demonstrating how polymer stretching and relaxation can lead to the generation of large-scale flow structures.The study of EIT has been approached through various methodologies, including experimental investigations, numerical simulations, and theoretical analyses. Experimental studies, such as those conducted by Choueiri et al. (2018), have utilized advanced flow visualization techniques and rheological measurements to characterize the flow structures and polymer dynamics associated with EIT. These experiments have revealed the presence of distinctive coherent structures, such as elastic waves and polymer-induced vortices, which play a crucial role in sustaining the turbulent state.Numerical simulations have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of EIT dynamics. Researchers have employed various viscoelastic models, such as the FENE-P (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic-Peterlin) model, to capture the complex behavior of polymer solutions in turbulent flows. Sid et al. (2018) utilized direct numerical simulations (DNS) to investigate the transition to EIT in channel flows, revealing the importance of polymer-induced instabilities in triggering and sustaining the turbulent state.The onset of EIT is closely related to elastic instabilities, which have been observed in dilute polymer solutions even before the discovery of polymer drag reduction. These instabilities arise from the nonlinear interaction between polymer molecules and the flow field, leading to the amplification of small perturbations and eventual transition to a chaotic state. Page et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive stability analysis of viscoelastic channel flows, identifying the critical conditions for the onset of elastic instabilities and their role in the transition to EIT.One of the most significant implications of EIT research is its potential to shed light on the mechanisms of polymer drag reduction, a phenomenon of great practical importance in various engineering applications. While the exact relationship between EIT and drag reduction remains a subject of ongoing research, several studies have suggested that the two phenomena may share common underlying mechanisms. Pereira et al. (2017) investigated the interplay between EIT and drag reduction in turbulent pipe flows, demonstrating how the onset of EIT can lead to significant reductions in friction drag.The study of coherent structures in EIT has provided valuable insights into the self-sustaining mechanisms of this turbulent state. Unlike Newtonian turbulence, where coherent structures are primarily associated with inertial effects, EIT exhibits unique structures driven by polymer dynamics. Hameduddin et al. (2019) utilized advanced flow visualization techniques to identify and characterize these structures, revealing their role in maintaining the turbulent state and facilitating energy transfer across scales.Another intriguing aspect of EIT research is its potential connection to elastic turbulence, a phenomenon observed in highly elastic polymer solutions at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. While EIT and elastic turbulence occur under different flow conditions, they share some common features, such as the presence of elastic instabilities and polymer-induced flow structures. Garg et al. (2018) explored the similarities and differences between these two phenomena, suggesting that EIT may serve as a bridge between inertial turbulence and purely elastic turbulence.Despite significant progress in understanding EIT, several challenges remain in unraveling its complete self-sustaining mechanism. The complex interplay between polymer dynamics, flow instabilities, and coherent structures presents a formidable challenge for both experimental and numerical investigations. Future research directions may include the development of more sophisticated viscoelastic models, advanced experimental techniques for probing polymer-flow interactions at smaller scales, and the application of machine learning algorithms for analyzing the vast amounts of data generated by EIT simulations and experiments.In conclusion, the study of elasto-inertial turbulence has opened up new avenues for understanding complex fluid dynamics in polymer solutions. By bridging the gap between classical Newtonian turbulence and purely elastic phenomena, EIT research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of drag reduction, flow control, and the fundamental nature of turbulence itself. As this field continues to evolve, it promises to yield valuable insights with far-reaching implications for both fundamental science and practical engineering applications.", "References": [{"title": "Elasto-inertial turbulence", "authors": "Samanta, Devranjan and Dubief, Yves and Holzner, Markus and Schäfer, Christof and Morozov, Alexander N. and Wagner, Christian and Hof, Björn", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2013", "volumes": "110", "first page": "10557", "last page": "10562", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1219666110"}, {"title": "On the coherent drag-reducing and turbulence-enhancing behaviour of polymers in wall flows", "authors": "Dubief, Yves and White, Christopher M. and Terrapon, Vincent E. and Shaqfeh, Eric S.
