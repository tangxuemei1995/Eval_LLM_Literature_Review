{"Literature Review": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) have emerged as powerful computational techniques for simulating fluid flows in complex geometries while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. This literature review aims to explore the historical development, current applications, and future prospects of IBMs in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).The concept of IBMs can be traced back to the early 1960s, although they gained widespread recognition only in the 1970s with the pioneering work of Peskin [1]. Peskin introduced the immersed boundary method to simulate blood flow in the heart, demonstrating its potential for handling complex, moving boundaries. However, the limited computational resources of that era hindered the full exploitation of IBMs' capabilities.The fundamental principle of IBMs involves representing solid boundaries within a fluid domain through the introduction of forcing terms in the governing equations, rather than conforming the computational grid to the geometry [2]. This approach offers several advantages, including simplified grid generation, reduced computational costs, and the ability to handle moving and deforming boundaries efficiently.As computational power increased, IBMs gained traction in the scientific community, leading to the development of various formulations and implementations. Mohd-Yusof [3] introduced the direct forcing method, which improved the accuracy and stability of IBMs for rigid boundaries. Subsequently, Fadlun et al. [4] extended this approach to simulate flows around complex geometries, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical engineering applications.The versatility of IBMs has led to their application in a wide range of fluid dynamics problems. Mittal and Iaccarino [5] provided a comprehensive review of IBM applications, highlighting their use in simulating flows around bluff bodies, multiphase flows, and fluid-structure interaction problems. The ability of IBMs to handle moving and deforming boundaries has made them particularly attractive for biofluid dynamics simulations, as demonstrated by Griffith and Patankar [6] in their study of heart valve dynamics.One of the primary challenges in implementing IBMs is achieving accurate representation of boundary conditions, especially in high-Reynolds number flows where thin boundary layers need to be resolved. To address this issue, researchers have developed various techniques to improve near-wall resolution. Balaras [7] proposed a hybrid approach combining IBMs with wall models to simulate high-Reynolds number turbulent flows, demonstrating improved accuracy without excessive computational costs.The integration of IBMs with other numerical methods has further expanded their capabilities. For instance, Sotiropoulos and Yang [8] combined IBMs with overset grid methods to simulate complex engineering flows, showcasing the potential for hybrid approaches in tackling challenging fluid dynamics problems.Despite their advantages, IBMs face limitations in certain scenarios. The resolution of thin wall shear layers in high-Reynolds number flows remains a significant challenge, as IBMs cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at boundaries. To mitigate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies. However, these approaches may introduce additional complexities and potential pitfalls that must be carefully considered [9].The future outlook for IBMs appears promising, with ongoing research focusing on improving their accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to a broader range of problems. Advancements in high-performance computing and parallel algorithms are enabling the simulation of increasingly complex flows using IBMs. Additionally, the integration of IBMs with machine learning techniques shows potential for enhancing their predictive capabilities and reducing computational costs [10].In conclusion, Immersed Boundary Methods have evolved from a novel concept in the 1960s to a well-established and versatile tool in computational fluid dynamics. Their ability to handle complex geometries while maintaining computational efficiency has led to widespread adoption in various fields, including biofluid dynamics, multiphase flows, and fluid-structure interaction problems. As research continues to address existing limitations and explore new applications, IBMs are poised to play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of complex fluid dynamics phenomena and solving real-world engineering challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Flow patterns around heart valves: A numerical method", "authors": "Charles S.
