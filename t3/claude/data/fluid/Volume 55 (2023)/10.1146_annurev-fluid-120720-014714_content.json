{"Literature Review": "Free surface flows involving drop/bubble breakup, coalescence, and film/sheet rupture are of great interest in various fields, including microfluidics, ink jet printing, and spray technologies. These phenomena are characterized by the occurrence of hydrodynamic singularities, which present significant challenges for numerical simulations due to their multiscale nature. This literature review focuses on the advancements in sharp interface methods for simulating and analyzing free surface flows with singularities, particularly in the context of breakup and coalescence processes.The study of drop breakup and coalescence has been a subject of extensive research due to its fundamental importance in fluid dynamics and numerous practical applications. Eggers (1997) provided a comprehensive review of the nonlinear dynamics of liquid jets, highlighting the importance of singularities in the breakup process. The author emphasized the need for high-resolution numerical methods to capture the complex dynamics near the singularity.One of the primary challenges in simulating these phenomena is the vast range of length scales involved. As noted by Paulsen et al. (2012), the coalescence of two liquid drops involves dynamics spanning from the initial drop size (typically millimeters) down to molecular scales (nanometers). This multiscale nature necessitates numerical methods capable of resolving dynamics across 5-6 orders of magnitude in length scales.Sharp interface methods have emerged as powerful tools for simulating free surface flows with singularities. These methods aim to track the interface explicitly, allowing for accurate representation of the interface dynamics. Tryggvason et al. (2001) provided an overview of various front-tracking methods for multiphase flows, highlighting their advantages in capturing interfacial dynamics accurately.In the context of drop breakup, Notz and Basaran (2004) employed a finite element method with adaptive mesh refinement to study the dynamics of drop formation from a nozzle. Their approach allowed for high-resolution simulations of the pinch-off process, revealing intricate details of the neck thinning dynamics. Similarly, Suryo and Basaran (2006) used a sharp interface method to investigate the breakup of liquid bridges, demonstrating the method's ability to capture the complex flow patterns near the singularity.Coalescence processes have also been extensively studied using sharp interface methods. Paulsen et al. (2011) employed high-speed imaging and numerical simulations to investigate the early stages of drop coalescence, revealing a new regime of coalescence dynamics. Their work highlighted the importance of accurate interface tracking in capturing the rapid topological changes during coalescence.The development of adaptive mesh refinement techniques has been crucial in enabling high-resolution simulations of singularities in free surface flows. Popinet (2009) introduced an adaptive quad/octree method for incompressible flow simulations, which has been successfully applied to various free surface flow problems, including drop impact and breakup.Recent advancements in sharp interface methods have focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of simulations near singularities. Kahouadji et al. (2018) developed a hybrid approach combining boundary integral and finite element methods to simulate axisymmetric free surface flows. Their method demonstrated excellent agreement with experimental results for drop formation and coalescence processes.The application of sharp interface methods to practical problems has also seen significant progress. Castrejon-Pita et al. (2015) used a combination of experimental and numerical techniques to study drop formation in inkjet printing, demonstrating the potential of high-resolution simulations in optimizing industrial processes.Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the simulation of free surface flows with singularities. The treatment of topological changes, such as during breakup or coalescence, requires careful consideration to ensure physical consistency and numerical stability. Additionally, the incorporation of complex physics, such as surfactant effects or non-Newtonian fluid behavior, presents ongoing challenges for sharp interface methods.In conclusion, sharp interface methods have proven to be powerful tools for simulating and analyzing free surface flows with singularities. These methods have enabled high-resolution simulations of breakup and coalescence processes, providing insights into the complex dynamics near hydrodynamic singularities. As computational capabilities continue to improve, it is expected that sharp interface methods will play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of multiscale interfacial phenomena and their applications in various fields.", "References": [{"title": "Drop formation in a one-dimensional approximation of the Navier–Stokes equation", "authors": "Jens Eggers", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "1997", "volumes": "322", "first page": "1", "last page": "36", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022112096002716"}, {"title": "To coalesce or not to coalesce: How drops coalesce", "authors": "James D.
