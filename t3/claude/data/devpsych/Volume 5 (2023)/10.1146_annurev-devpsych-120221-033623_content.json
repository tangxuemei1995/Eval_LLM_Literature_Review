{"Literature Review": "Life-course epidemiology has emerged as a crucial field in understanding how exposures throughout an individual's life, from conception to old age, influence health outcomes. This approach recognizes that health is shaped by a complex interplay of biological, social, and environmental factors across the lifespan. However, the field has faced challenges in adopting robust causal inference methods, creating a tension between life-course theories and causal inference techniques. This literature review aims to explore this tension and discuss potential solutions to bridge the gap between life-course epidemiology and causal inference.The life-course approach to epidemiology has its roots in the work of Barker and colleagues, who proposed the fetal origins hypothesis, suggesting that prenatal exposures could have long-lasting effects on adult health outcomes (Barker et al., 1989). Since then, the field has expanded to encompass various models of how exposures at different life stages may influence health, including critical period models, accumulation models, and pathway models (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh, 2002).One of the primary challenges in life-course epidemiology is the long time frame between exposures and outcomes, which can span decades. This temporal distance makes it difficult to establish causal relationships using traditional epidemiological methods. Additionally, the complex nature of life-course exposures, which may involve multiple interacting factors over time, further complicates causal inference (VanderWeele, 2015).Despite these challenges, quasi-experimental methods have made significant contributions to testing life-course theories. Natural experiments, such as famines or policy changes, have provided opportunities to examine the long-term effects of early-life exposures. For example, studies of the Dutch Hunger Winter have shown that prenatal exposure to famine is associated with increased risk of various health outcomes in adulthood (Roseboom et al., 2011).However, quasi-experimental methods also have limitations in the context of life-course epidemiology. These approaches often rely on specific circumstances that may not be generalizable to other populations or time periods. Moreover, they may not capture the full complexity of life-course exposures and their interactions over time (Glymour and Hamad, 2018).To address these limitations and bridge the gap between life-course epidemiology and causal inference, several solutions have been proposed. One approach is to redefine estimands to maximize public health impact. This involves focusing on interventions that are feasible and relevant to public health policy, rather than attempting to isolate the effects of individual exposures (Hernán and Robins, 2020).Marginal structural models and structural nested models offer another promising avenue for integrating causal inference methods into life-course epidemiology. These approaches allow for the estimation of causal effects in the presence of time-varying exposures and confounders, which are common in life-course studies (Robins et al., 2000).Longitudinal instrumental variables approaches have also been developed to address the challenges of life-course epidemiology. These methods can help account for unmeasured confounding and reverse causation, which are particularly problematic in studies spanning long periods (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2015).The increasing availability of detailed data linkages, such as residential histories, offers new opportunities for life-course epidemiology. These data can provide more precise measures of environmental exposures over time and help account for spatial confounding (Pearce et al., 2016).Triangulation across methods has been proposed as a strategy to strengthen causal inference in life-course epidemiology. This approach involves using multiple study designs and analytical techniques to address the same research question, with the idea that consistent findings across different approaches provide stronger evidence for causal relationships (Lawlor et al., 2016).Adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference is another way to bridge the gap between life-course epidemiology and causal inference methods. This involves recognizing that different methods may be appropriate for different research questions and contexts, and that a combination of approaches may be necessary to fully understand complex life-course phenomena (Vandenbroucke et al., 2016).In conclusion, while tensions exist between life-course epidemiology and causal inference methods, there are numerous opportunities to bridge this divide. By adopting innovative methodological approaches, leveraging new data sources, and embracing a pluralistic approach to causal inference, researchers can enhance our understanding of how exposures across the life course shape health outcomes. This integration of life-course theory and robust causal inference methods has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of the determinants of health and inform more effective public health interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Fetal and infant growth and impaired glucose tolerance at age 64", "authors": "Barker, D.
