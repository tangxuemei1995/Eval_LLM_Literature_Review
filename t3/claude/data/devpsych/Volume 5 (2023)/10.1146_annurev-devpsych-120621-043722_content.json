{"Literature Review": "Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperamental trait characterized by heightened reactivity to novel stimuli and social reticence, which has been extensively studied over the past four decades. This literature review explores the proposed two-hit model as a complementary framework to better understand the developmental pathways from BI to anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety.The concept of BI was first introduced by Kagan and colleagues in the 1980s, who observed that some infants displayed heightened reactivity to unfamiliar stimuli and were more likely to exhibit shy and fearful behaviors in childhood (Kagan et al., 1984). Subsequent longitudinal studies have consistently demonstrated that BI in early childhood is a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder, in adolescence and adulthood (Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2009).The two-hit model, as proposed in the current review, suggests that specific time-limited experiences or 'hits' during infancy and adolescence may interact with BI-linked processes to trigger the developmental pathway from temperament to disorder. This model builds upon the diathesis-stress framework, which posits that individuals with certain vulnerabilities (such as BI) are more susceptible to developing psychopathology when exposed to environmental stressors (Monroe & Simons, 1991).The first 'hit' in the proposed model focuses on caregiver distress during infancy, including the prenatal period. Research has shown that maternal stress during pregnancy can influence fetal neurodevelopment and contribute to the emergence of BI-like traits in infants (Davis et al., 2007). Postnatally, caregiver anxiety and overprotective parenting styles have been associated with the maintenance and exacerbation of BI in young children (Rubin et al., 2002). These early experiences may shape the development of attentional and cognitive systems that are central to the BI phenotype.The second 'hit' occurs during adolescence, a period characterized by significant social reorientation. During this developmental stage, individuals with BI may face unique challenges as they navigate increasingly complex social environments and peer relationships. Adolescents with a history of BI have been found to exhibit altered patterns of neural activation in response to social stimuli, particularly in brain regions associated with fear and anxiety (Pérez-Edgar et al., 2014). These neurocognitive differences may contribute to the increased risk of social anxiety disorder among BI individuals during this period.The two-hit model emphasizes the importance of malleable attentional and cognitive systems in mediating the relationship between BI and anxiety. Attention bias to threat, for example, has been identified as a key cognitive process that may link BI to the development of anxiety disorders (Bar-Haim et al., 2007). Children with BI have been shown to display heightened attention to threat-related stimuli, which may contribute to the maintenance of anxious behaviors over time (Pérez-Edgar et al., 2010).Furthermore, the model highlights the potential for targeted interventions during these critical periods. Early interventions focusing on parent-child interactions and promoting secure attachment may help mitigate the impact of caregiver distress on BI infants (Rapee et al., 2010). In adolescence, cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting social skills and attention bias modification may be particularly beneficial for individuals with a history of BI (Amir et al., 2009).While the two-hit model provides a valuable framework for understanding the developmental trajectory from BI to anxiety, several open questions and caveats remain. First, the specificity of the 'hits' and their timing requires further investigation. It is possible that additional sensitive periods exist or that the impact of these experiences varies across individuals. Second, the model should consider the role of protective factors and resilience in moderating the relationship between BI and anxiety outcomes. Finally, future research should explore the potential gene-environment interactions that may influence the developmental pathway from BI to anxiety disorders.In conclusion, the proposed two-hit model offers a novel perspective on the developmental origins of anxiety in behaviorally inhibited individuals. By focusing on specific time-limited experiences in infancy and adolescence, this model provides a framework for understanding the complex interplay between temperament, environment, and neurocognitive processes in the emergence of anxiety disorders. Future research in this area has the potential to inform more targeted and effective interventions for individuals at risk for anxiety disorders based on their early temperamental profiles.", "References": [{"title": "Behavioral inhibition: Linking biology and behavior within a developmental framework", "authors": "Jerome Kagan, J.
