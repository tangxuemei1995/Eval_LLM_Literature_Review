{"Literature Review": "The study of children's acquisition and application of norms has gained significant attention in recent years, as researchers seek to understand the foundations of human social behavior and cooperation. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding how young children learn, internalize, and enforce social norms, with a focus on the developmental aspects of norm psychology.Norms are collectively shared rules or expectations that govern social interactions and promote coordination within human societies. The importance of norms in shaping human behavior has long been recognized, but recent interdisciplinary research has shed new light on their developmental origins and potentially species-unique aspects.One of the key findings in this field is that children acquire norms remarkably early in life. Schmidt and Tomasello (2012) demonstrated that even 3-year-olds can distinguish between moral norms (e.g., not harming others) and conventional norms (e.g., game rules) and respond differently to violations of each. This early differentiation suggests that children have a sophisticated understanding of normative contexts from a young age.The process of norm acquisition appears to be rapid and efficient. Rakoczy et al. (2008) found that children as young as 2 years old can learn novel game rules after minimal exposure and subsequently enforce these rules when playing with others. This ability to quickly internalize and apply new norms indicates a predisposition for normative learning in early childhood.Interestingly, children not only learn norms but also actively infer them from social contexts. In a study by Butler et al. (2015), 3- to 5-year-olds were able to infer unstated rules in novel situations based on the reactions of others. This suggests that children are attuned to social cues that indicate normative expectations, even when norms are not explicitly stated.One of the most striking aspects of children's norm psychology is their tendency to enforce norms as unaffected third-party observers. Vaish et al. (2011) found that 3-year-olds would intervene to stop a puppet from breaking a rule, even when the violation did not directly affect them. This behavior indicates a strong commitment to upholding social norms and suggests that norm enforcement may be an intrinsic aspect of human social cognition.The development of norm psychology appears to be closely linked to children's understanding of social roles and group membership. Over et al. (2018) demonstrated that children as young as 3 years old use group membership to guide their expectations about norm adherence, expecting in-group members to follow norms more strictly than out-group members. This finding highlights the interplay between norm psychology and social categorization in early childhood.Recent research has also explored the relationship between norm acquisition and moral development. Smetana et al. (2014) reviewed evidence suggesting that children's understanding of moral norms (e.g., fairness, harm prevention) develops earlier and is more robust than their grasp of conventional norms. This distinction may reflect the fundamental importance of moral norms in human social life.The role of cultural variation in norm acquisition has been a subject of increasing interest. House et al. (2013) conducted a cross-cultural study showing that while children across diverse societies develop similar basic normative understandings, there are also culture-specific differences in how norms are applied and enforced. This research underscores the interplay between biological predispositions and cultural learning in the development of norm psychology.Cognitive neuroscience has begun to shed light on the neural underpinnings of norm acquisition and enforcement. Decety and Cowell (2018) reviewed neuroimaging studies suggesting that norm-related behaviors in children are associated with activation in brain regions involved in social cognition, emotion processing, and executive function. These findings provide insights into the cognitive mechanisms supporting norm psychology.The study of children's norm acquisition and application has important implications for understanding human cooperation and social organization. Tomasello (2016) argued that the human capacity for shared intentionality, which includes the ability to create and follow social norms, was crucial for the evolution of human culture and cooperation. By examining how children develop this capacity, we gain insights into the foundations of human social life.In conclusion, recent developmental research has revealed that young children possess a sophisticated norm psychology, characterized by rapid acquisition, active inference, and third-party enforcement of social norms. This early-emerging capacity appears to be fundamental to human social cognition and may help explain the unique forms of cooperation and cultural transmission observed in our species. Future research in this field promises to further elucidate the ontogenetic and evolutionary roots of human normative behavior, contributing to our understanding of social development and the maintenance of cooperation in contemporary societies.", "References": [{"title": "Young children enforce social norms selectively depending on the violator's group affiliation", "authors": "Marco F.
