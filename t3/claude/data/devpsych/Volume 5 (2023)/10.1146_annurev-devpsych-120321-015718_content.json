{"Literature Review": "The development of racial understanding and attitudes in children is a complex and multifaceted process that has been the subject of extensive research in developmental psychology. This literature review aims to integrate findings from sociocognitive approaches and socialization perspectives to provide a comprehensive understanding of how children learn about race in the context of persistent structural and interpersonal racism in the United States.Sociocognitive approaches have focused on children's cognitive development and how it relates to their understanding of race. Research has shown that children as young as 3 months old can visually discriminate between faces of different racial groups (Kelly et al., 2005). By preschool age, children demonstrate awareness of racial categories and can accurately categorize individuals based on race (Pauker et al., 2016). This early ability to perceive and categorize racial differences forms the foundation for more complex racial cognition.As children develop, their understanding of race becomes more nuanced. Hirschfeld (1995) proposed that children possess an innate cognitive module for reasoning about human kinds, including race. This theory suggests that children are predisposed to view race as a fundamental and immutable characteristic. However, more recent research has challenged this view, demonstrating that children's beliefs about the stability and significance of race can be influenced by environmental factors and explicit teaching (Rhodes & Gelman, 2009).The development of racial attitudes and preferences has been another key area of investigation within the sociocognitive approach. Numerous studies have documented the emergence of in-group preferences and out-group biases in young children (Dunham et al., 2008). These biases appear to emerge early in development, with some research suggesting that infants as young as 3 months show preferences for faces of their own race (Bar-Haim et al., 2006). However, the strength and persistence of these biases can vary depending on factors such as the child's own racial group membership, the diversity of their environment, and explicit messages they receive about race.Intergroup contact theory, originally proposed by Allport (1954) and further developed by subsequent researchers, suggests that positive intergroup contact can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup attitudes. In the context of children's racial learning, studies have shown that children in more racially diverse environments tend to show less racial bias and more positive intergroup attitudes (Rutland et al., 2005). This highlights the importance of considering the broader social context in which children's racial learning occurs.Complementing the sociocognitive approach, socialization perspectives focus on the messages and experiences that shape children's racial understanding and attitudes. Parents play a crucial role in this process through ethnic-racial socialization (ERS), which encompasses the messages and practices parents use to teach their children about race and ethnicity (Hughes et al., 2006). Research has identified several dimensions of ERS, including cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, and egalitarianism.The content and frequency of ERS messages can vary significantly across racial and ethnic groups. For instance, African American parents are more likely to engage in preparation for bias and promotion of mistrust compared to European American parents, reflecting the realities of racial discrimination in the United States (Hughes et al., 2009). The impact of ERS on children's outcomes has been widely studied, with research generally indicating positive effects on racial identity development, self-esteem, and academic achievement, particularly for children of color (Neblett et al., 2012).However, it's important to note that ERS is not limited to explicit verbal messages. Children also learn about race through observation of their parents' behaviors, attitudes, and social networks. Castelli et al. (2008) found that children can pick up on subtle nonverbal cues from adults and use these to inform their own racial attitudes. This highlights the need for parents to be aware of both their explicit and implicit messages about race.Beyond parents, other socialization agents such as peers, teachers, and media also play significant roles in children's racial learning. Schools, in particular, have been identified as important contexts for racial socialization. Research has shown that teacher expectations, curriculum content, and school racial climate can all influence children's racial attitudes and academic outcomes (Byrd, 2015).The media, including television, movies, and increasingly, social media, also contribute to children's racial learning. Representations of racial groups in media can shape children's perceptions and attitudes, with research indicating that exposure to positive representations of racial outgroups can reduce prejudice (Ramasubramanian, 2015).It's crucial to consider these sociocognitive and socialization processes within the broader context of structural racism in the United States. Persistent racial inequalities in areas such as education, housing, and criminal justice form the backdrop against which children's racial learning occurs. These systemic inequalities can reinforce racial stereotypes and biases, even in the absence of explicit prejudicial messages (Eberhardt, 2019).In conclusion, children's racial learning is a complex process influenced by cognitive development, direct socialization experiences, and broader societal contexts. Future research should continue to integrate sociocognitive and socialization perspectives, while also considering the impact of structural racism. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing effective interventions to promote positive intergroup relations and combat racial prejudice from an early age.", "References": [{"title": "Three-month-olds, but not newborns, prefer own-race faces", "authors": "David J.
