{"Literature Review": "Emotion regulation in couples across adulthood is a critical area of research that has gained significant attention in recent years. This literature review aims to synthesize key findings and current directions in this field, highlighting the importance of emotion regulation in intimate relationships and its evolution throughout the lifespan. Emotion regulation refers to the processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions. In the context of couples, emotion regulation takes on a unique dynamic, characterized by coregulatory, bidirectional, and bivalent qualities. These qualities emphasize the interactive nature of emotion regulation within intimate relationships, where partners mutually influence each other's emotional experiences and expressions. The study of emotion regulation in couples has been greatly influenced by the socioemotional selectivity theory. This theory posits that as individuals age, they become more motivated to prioritize emotionally meaningful goals and relationships. This shift in motivation has significant implications for how couples regulate their emotions across adulthood. Research on emotion regulation in couples has employed various measures, including self-report questionnaires and performance-based assessments. While self-report measures provide valuable insights into individuals' perceptions of their emotion regulation abilities, performance-based measures offer a more objective assessment of these skills in action. A life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples reveals interesting patterns across different life stages. In infancy and early childhood, the foundations of emotion regulation are laid through interactions with caregivers. As individuals enter adolescence and young adulthood, romantic relationships become a crucial context for developing and refining emotion regulation skills. During midlife, couples face unique challenges that require effective emotion regulation strategies. These challenges may include work-related stress, parenting responsibilities, and caring for aging parents. Research has shown that couples who can effectively regulate their emotions during this period tend to report higher relationship satisfaction and overall well-being. As couples enter late life, emotion regulation takes on even greater importance. Older adults generally demonstrate better emotion regulation abilities compared to their younger counterparts. This improvement is often attributed to increased motivation for maintaining positive emotional experiences and a shift in focus towards emotionally meaningful goals. An intriguing concept in the field of emotion regulation in couples is the idea of a shift from 'me to us' across adulthood. This perspective suggests that as couples age, they may become more adept at regulating emotions not just for individual benefit, but for the good of the relationship as a whole. This shift may be driven by a combination of factors, including increased interdependence, shared life experiences, and a greater emphasis on relationship maintenance in later life. The consequences of effective emotion regulation in couples become increasingly significant with age. Research has demonstrated that couples who can successfully regulate their emotions experience better relationship outcomes, higher levels of well-being, and even improved physical health. For example, older couples who engage in positive emotion regulation strategies during conflict discussions show lower levels of physiological arousal and report higher relationship satisfaction. However, it is important to note that not all older couples demonstrate superior emotion regulation abilities. Factors such as individual differences, relationship history, and external stressors can influence a couple's capacity for effective emotion regulation. Future research in this field could benefit from several directions. Longitudinal studies tracking couples' emotion regulation abilities across the lifespan would provide valuable insights into the developmental trajectory of these skills. Additionally, investigating the role of cultural factors in shaping emotion regulation in couples across adulthood could enhance our understanding of the universality and specificity of these processes. Moreover, exploring the potential applications of this research in clinical settings could lead to the development of targeted interventions for couples experiencing difficulties with emotion regulation. Such interventions could be particularly beneficial for older couples facing challenges related to health issues, retirement, or other significant life transitions. In conclusion, the study of emotion regulation in couples across adulthood represents a rich and dynamic area of research. As our understanding of these processes continues to evolve, it holds promise for enhancing the quality of intimate relationships and promoting well-being throughout the lifespan.", "References": [{"title": "The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review", "authors": "James J.
