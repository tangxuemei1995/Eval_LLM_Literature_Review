{"Literature Review": "Adolescence is a critical period of human development characterized by significant biological, cognitive, and social changes. This literature review explores the neuroecosocial perspective on adolescent development, focusing on the interplay between brain maturation, mental health, and broader societal factors.The adolescent brain undergoes substantial structural and functional changes, particularly in regions associated with cognitive control, emotion regulation, and social cognition. Blakemore and Robbins (2012) highlight the protracted development of the prefrontal cortex, which continues to mature well into early adulthood. This prolonged development may contribute to the increased vulnerability to mental health problems observed during adolescence.Mental health concerns among adolescents have been on the rise globally. Patel et al. (2007) report that approximately 20% of adolescents worldwide experience mental health disorders, with depression, anxiety, and substance abuse being the most prevalent. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these issues, as noted by Racine et al. (2021), who found significant increases in depression and anxiety symptoms among youth during this period.Socioeconomic inequality plays a crucial role in shaping adolescent development and mental health outcomes. McLaughlin et al. (2011) demonstrate that exposure to poverty and economic hardship during childhood and adolescence is associated with increased risk for mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the importance of considering socioeconomic factors when examining adolescent brain development and mental health.Urbanicity is another critical factor influencing adolescent development. Lederbogen et al. (2011) reveal that city living is associated with increased amygdala activity, a brain region involved in emotion processing and stress responses. This heightened neural reactivity may contribute to the higher rates of mental health problems observed in urban environments. Furthermore, Newbury et al. (2018) find that exposure to air pollution in urban areas is associated with increased risk for psychotic experiences in adolescents, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental factors and mental health.The climate crisis presents a unique challenge for today's adolescents, with many experiencing eco-anxiety. Hickman et al. (2021) report that climate anxiety is widespread among young people globally, with 59% of their sample feeling very or extremely worried about climate change. This chronic stress may have long-term implications for brain development and mental health outcomes.Recent advances in developmental cognitive neuroscience have provided valuable insights into the adolescent brain. Crone and Dahl (2012) emphasize the importance of considering the social context when studying adolescent brain development, as peer interactions and social experiences play a crucial role in shaping neural plasticity during this period. This perspective aligns with the neuroecosocial approach, which recognizes the complex interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors in adolescent development.The field of youth-led research methods has gained traction in recent years, offering a promising approach to understanding adolescent experiences. Ozer and Piatt (2017) argue that involving young people as co-researchers can provide unique insights into adolescent development and mental health, while also promoting youth empowerment and agency.As we consider the future of adolescent research and interventions, it is crucial to adopt a holistic, neuroecosocial perspective. Fuhrmann et al. (2015) propose an integrative model of adolescent development that incorporates biological, cognitive, and social factors, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and supporting adolescent well-being.In conclusion, the neuroecosocial perspective on adolescent development offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between brain maturation, mental health, and broader societal factors. By considering the impact of socioeconomic inequality, urbanicity, and the climate crisis on adolescent development, researchers and policymakers can develop more effective strategies to support youth mental health and well-being in an ever-changing world.", "References": [{"title": "The neuroscience of adolescent decision-making", "authors": "Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Trevor W.
