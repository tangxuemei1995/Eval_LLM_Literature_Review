{"Literature Review": "Employee Green Behavior (EGB) has emerged as a critical component in the pursuit of environmental sustainability within organizations. As global concerns about climate change and environmental degradation intensify, businesses are increasingly recognizing their role in promoting sustainable practices. This literature review aims to synthesize current research on EGB, exploring its definitions, theoretical frameworks, antecedents, and consequences at multiple levels of analysis. Defining Employee Green Behavior EGB refers to scalable actions and behaviors that employees engage in to contribute to or detract from environmental sustainability in the work context. Norton et al. (2015) categorized EGB into two main types: required green behavior, which is part of employees' formal job responsibilities, and voluntary green behavior, which goes beyond formal job requirements. This distinction is crucial for understanding the motivations behind EGB and designing effective interventions. Theoretical Frameworks Several theoretical frameworks have been employed to explain EGB. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has been widely applied, as demonstrated by Greaves et al. (2013), who found that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control significantly predicted intentions to engage in EGB. Similarly, Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory has been used to explain the role of personal values and environmental beliefs in driving pro-environmental behaviors (Stern, 2000). Organizational support theory has also been influential in understanding how perceived organizational support for environmental initiatives affects EGB. Lamm et al. (2013) found that employees who perceived strong organizational support for sustainability were more likely to engage in voluntary green behaviors. Antecedents of EGB Research has identified various antecedents of EGB at multiple levels. At the individual level, environmental knowledge, attitudes, and values have been consistently linked to EGB. Kim et al. (2017) found that environmental knowledge and concern positively influenced employees' eco-friendly behavior intentions. Leadership plays a crucial role in promoting EGB. Robertson and Barling (2013) demonstrated that environmentally-specific transformational leadership positively influenced employees' pro-environmental passion and behaviors. At the team level, Raineri and Paillé (2016) showed that team green advocacy and eco-initiatives fostered individual EGB. Organizational-level factors, such as environmental management systems and green human resource management practices, have also been found to influence EGB. Dumont et al. (2017) revealed that green HRM practices positively affected employees' workplace green behaviors through the mediation of environmental commitment. Consequences of EGB The consequences of EGB extend beyond environmental outcomes. At the individual level, Ones and Dilchert (2012) found that engaging in EGB was associated with increased job satisfaction and organizational commitment. At the organizational level, Paillé et al. (2014) demonstrated that EGB contributed to improved environmental performance and competitive advantage. Interestingly, research has also explored the potential negative consequences of EGB. Truelove and Gillis (2018) found evidence of moral licensing, where engaging in one pro-environmental behavior reduced the likelihood of engaging in subsequent green behaviors. Methodological Approaches The field of EGB research has employed diverse methodological approaches. Cross-sectional surveys have been predominant, as seen in studies by Norton et al. (2014) and Kim et al. (2017). However, there is a growing recognition of the need for longitudinal and multi-level studies to capture the dynamic nature of EGB and its antecedents and consequences across different organizational levels. Experimental designs have also been utilized to establish causal relationships. For instance, Unsworth et al. (2013) used a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different interventions in promoting EGB. Future Directions and Practical Implications To advance the field, future research should focus on several key areas. First, there is a need for more longitudinal studies to understand the temporal dynamics of EGB and its antecedents. Second, multi-level studies that simultaneously examine individual, team, and organizational factors would provide a more comprehensive understanding of EGB. Third, research should explore the potential dark side of EGB, including moral licensing effects and potential conflicts with other work behaviors. Fourth, cross-cultural studies are needed to understand how cultural differences influence EGB and its antecedents. From a practical perspective, organizations can promote EGB through various strategies. Implementing green HRM practices, fostering environmentally-specific transformational leadership, and creating a supportive organizational climate for sustainability are key steps. Additionally, organizations should consider both required and voluntary green behaviors in their sustainability strategies and performance management systems. In conclusion, EGB represents a crucial aspect of organizational environmental sustainability. By understanding its antecedents and consequences at multiple levels, organizations can develop more effective strategies to promote sustainable practices and contribute to broader environmental goals. As research in this field continues to evolve, it will provide valuable insights for both scholars and practitioners in creating more environmentally sustainable organizations.", "References": [{"title": "Employee green behavior: A theoretical framework, multilevel review, and future research agenda", "authors": "Thomas A.
