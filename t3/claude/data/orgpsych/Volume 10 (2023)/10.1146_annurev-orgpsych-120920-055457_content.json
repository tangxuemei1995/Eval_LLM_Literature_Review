{"Literature Review": "The dynamic interplay between actors and contexts in fostering creativity and innovation has been a subject of increasing interest in organizational research over the past decade. This literature review examines the progress made since the seminal typology proposed by Anderson, Poto훾nik, and Zhou in 2014, which has significantly shaped the landscape of creativity and innovation studies. The 2014 typology presented four quadrants that categorized research based on the level of analysis (individual or team) and the nature of creativity (workplace creativity or innovation). This framework has proven to be a valuable tool for researchers, guiding numerous studies and helping to identify gaps in our understanding of the complex relationships between actors, contexts, and creative outcomes. In the first quadrant, focusing on individual workplace creativity, researchers have made significant strides in understanding how personal characteristics interact with environmental factors to influence creative performance. For instance, Amabile and Pratt (2016) proposed an updated componential model of creativity that emphasizes the dynamic nature of the creative process and the importance of work environment perceptions. Their work highlights how individual motivation and cognitive processes are shaped by organizational contexts, leading to varying levels of creative output. The second quadrant, addressing individual innovation, has seen an increased focus on the implementation phase of creative ideas. Zhou and Hoever (2014) conducted a comprehensive review of person-situation interactionist perspectives on workplace creativity, emphasizing the need to consider both personal and contextual factors in understanding innovative behavior. Their work underscores the importance of leadership styles, team climate, and organizational culture in facilitating or hindering the translation of creative ideas into practical innovations. Team-level workplace creativity, the third quadrant, has witnessed substantial growth in research exploring the collective creative process. H체lsheger, Anderson, and Salgado (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of team-level predictors of creativity and innovation, revealing the critical role of team processes such as communication, cohesion, and task orientation. Their findings emphasize the importance of considering team composition and diversity when examining collective creative outcomes. The fourth quadrant, team innovation, has seen increased attention to the ways in which teams navigate the complex process of implementing novel ideas within organizational contexts. West and Anderson (1996) proposed a model of team innovation that highlights the importance of team climate, particularly the dimensions of vision, participative safety, task orientation, and support for innovation. This model has been influential in guiding subsequent research on team-level innovation processes. One of the most significant developments in the field has been the growing recognition of the need for multilevel approaches to studying creativity and innovation. Kozlowski and Klein (2000) provided a comprehensive framework for multilevel research in organizations, which has been increasingly applied to creativity studies. This approach allows researchers to examine how individual, team, and organizational factors interact across levels to influence creative and innovative outcomes. The past decade has also seen an increased focus on the role of leadership in fostering creativity and innovation. Zhang and Bartol (2010) examined the concept of empowering leadership and its impact on employee creativity, finding that leaders who provide autonomy and encourage participation can significantly enhance individual creative performance. This line of research has been extended to team-level studies, with Chen, Farh, Campbell-Bush, Wu, and Wu (2013) investigating how transformational leadership influences team innovation through team climate and team creative efficacy. Another important area of progress has been the examination of the dark side of creativity and innovation. Gino and Ariely (2012) conducted a series of studies exploring the relationship between creativity and dishonesty, revealing that creative individuals may be more prone to unethical behavior under certain circumstances. This work has sparked a new line of inquiry into the potential negative consequences of promoting creativity in organizations. The role of technology in shaping creative processes and outcomes has also gained increased attention. Oldham and Da Silva (2015) reviewed the impact of digital technology on creativity in organizations, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges presented by new tools and platforms for collaboration and idea generation. As we look to the future, several desirable directions for research emerge. First, there is a need for more longitudinal studies that can capture the dynamic nature of creativity and innovation processes over time. Second, researchers should continue to explore the boundary conditions and contextual factors that moderate the relationship between individual and team characteristics and creative outcomes. Third, there is a growing need to examine creativity and innovation in diverse cultural contexts, moving beyond the predominantly Western-centric approach that has characterized much of the existing research. Finally, as organizations face increasingly complex and rapidly changing environments, studies that explore creativity and innovation in the context of organizational adaptation and resilience will be particularly valuable. In conclusion, the field of creativity and innovation research has made significant progress since the introduction of the 2014 typology. By continuing to build on this foundation and pursuing new directions, researchers can further enhance our understanding of the dynamic interplay between actors and contexts in fostering creativity and innovation in organizations.", "References": [{"title": "Creativity in Organizations: A State-of-the-Science Review and Integrative Model", "authors": "Teresa M.
