{"Literature Review": "Meta-analysis has emerged as a powerful and widely-used method for synthesizing research findings across multiple studies in organizational research. This statistical approach allows researchers to integrate results from diverse studies, providing a comprehensive understanding of a particular phenomenon and its underlying factors. The growing popularity of meta-analysis in organizational research can be attributed to its ability to overcome limitations of individual studies, such as small sample sizes and contextual constraints, while offering a more robust and generalizable perspective on research questions.One of the primary strengths of meta-analysis lies in its capacity to estimate the true effect size of a relationship or intervention by aggregating results from multiple studies. Schmidt and Hunter (2015) pioneered the development of meta-analytic techniques in organizational research, emphasizing the importance of correcting for statistical artifacts to obtain more accurate estimates of population parameters. Their work has been instrumental in establishing meta-analysis as a rigorous method for cumulating knowledge in the field.The process of conducting a meta-analysis involves several key steps, each requiring careful consideration and methodological decisions. Borenstein et al. (2009) provide a comprehensive guide to meta-analysis, outlining the essential stages from formulating research questions to interpreting and reporting results. One crucial aspect of meta-analysis is the selection of an appropriate effect size metric to represent the findings of individual studies in a common scale. Lipsey and Wilson (2001) discuss various effect size measures and their applications in different research contexts, highlighting the importance of choosing a metric that aligns with the nature of the research question and the available data.A significant challenge in meta-analysis is addressing the issue of publication bias, which can lead to overestimation of effect sizes due to the tendency for significant results to be more likely published. Rothstein et al. (2005) explore various methods for detecting and correcting publication bias, including funnel plots and trim-and-fill techniques. These approaches help researchers assess the robustness of their meta-analytic findings and provide more accurate estimates of true effect sizes.Another critical consideration in meta-analysis is the treatment of study quality and methodological differences across primary studies. Aguinis et al. (2011) emphasize the importance of incorporating study quality as a moderator in meta-analytic models, arguing that failing to account for methodological variations can lead to biased estimates and misleading conclusions. They propose a comprehensive framework for assessing and integrating study quality in meta-analyses, which has been widely adopted in organizational research.The choice of statistical model for meta-analysis is another crucial decision point that can significantly impact the results and interpretations. Field and Gillett (2010) compare fixed-effect and random-effects models, discussing their assumptions, strengths, and limitations. They argue that random-effects models are often more appropriate in organizational research due to the inherent heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies and contexts.Recent advancements in meta-analytic techniques have expanded the scope and sophistication of research synthesis in organizational science. For instance, Cheung (2015) introduces structural equation modeling approaches to meta-analysis, allowing researchers to test complex theoretical models and examine relationships among multiple variables simultaneously. This approach has gained traction in organizational research, enabling more nuanced investigations of mediating and moderating processes across studies.The application of meta-analysis in organizational research has led to significant theoretical and practical insights across various domains. For example, Judge et al. (2001) conducted a seminal meta-analysis on the relationship between personality traits and job performance, providing a comprehensive understanding of how individual differences relate to workplace outcomes. Their findings have had a lasting impact on personnel selection and assessment practices in organizations.Despite its strengths, meta-analysis is not without limitations and potential pitfalls. Cortina (2003) cautions against the uncritical use of meta-analysis, highlighting issues such as the 'apples and oranges' problem, where studies with fundamentally different designs or constructs are inappropriately combined. He emphasizes the importance of careful consideration of theoretical and methodological compatibility when selecting studies for inclusion in a meta-analysis.As meta-analysis continues to evolve, researchers are developing new approaches to address its limitations and expand its applicability. For instance, Jak and Cheung (2020) introduce novel methods for conducting meta-analysis with dependent effect sizes, addressing the common issue of multiple effect sizes extracted from the same sample. These advancements contribute to the ongoing refinement of meta-analytic techniques in organizational research.In conclusion, meta-analysis has become an indispensable tool in organizational research, offering a systematic and quantitative approach to synthesizing findings across studies. By carefully considering methodological options at each stage of the meta-analytic process, researchers can harness the full potential of this powerful technique to advance knowledge and inform practice in the field of organizational science.", "References": [{"title": "Methods of meta-analysis: Correcting error and bias in research findings", "authors": "Frank L.
