{"Literature Review": "The field of entrepreneurship research has experienced significant growth over the past decade, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects that drive entrepreneurial behavior. This literature review examines the intersection of action and process in entrepreneurship, highlighting key theories and models that have shaped our understanding of the entrepreneurial journey. Action theories have played a crucial role in explaining entrepreneurial behavior. One of the most influential frameworks is the effectuation/causation model proposed by Sarasvathy (2001). This model distinguishes between two approaches to entrepreneurship: effectuation, which involves leveraging existing resources and adapting to uncertainties, and causation, which follows a more traditional, goal-oriented approach. Research by Read et al. (2009) has shown that expert entrepreneurs tend to favor effectuation, particularly in uncertain environments. Another important action theory is bricolage, introduced by Baker and Nelson (2005). This concept describes how entrepreneurs create something from nothing by recombining available resources in novel ways. Bricolage has been particularly relevant in resource-constrained environments and has been linked to increased innovation and firm performance (Fisher, 2012). The theory of planned behavior (TPB), originally developed by Ajzen (1991), has been widely applied to entrepreneurship research. Kautonen et al. (2015) found that TPB components, including attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, significantly predict entrepreneurial intentions and subsequent actions. Action theory, as proposed by Frese (2009), emphasizes the importance of goal-setting, planning, and feedback in entrepreneurial success. This approach has been particularly useful in understanding how entrepreneurs navigate complex and dynamic environments. The process perspective in entrepreneurship research has gained traction, recognizing that entrepreneurial activities unfold over time and are influenced by various factors. McMullen and Dimov (2013) argue for a journey-based conceptualization of entrepreneurship, emphasizing the importance of studying entrepreneurial processes longitudinally. Cognition plays a crucial role in the entrepreneurial process. Mitchell et al. (2007) review cognitive research in entrepreneurship, highlighting how entrepreneurs' mental models and decision-making processes influence opportunity recognition and exploitation. Recent work by Grégoire et al. (2011) has focused on the role of cognitive mechanisms in opportunity identification, emphasizing the importance of pattern recognition and structural alignment. Motivation is another key antecedent of entrepreneurial action. Carsrud and Brännback (2011) review motivational factors in entrepreneurship, identifying both push (necessity-driven) and pull (opportunity-driven) factors. Their work highlights the complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in driving entrepreneurial behavior. Emotions have emerged as an important area of study in entrepreneurship research. Foo et al. (2015) examine the role of affect in entrepreneurial effort, finding that both positive and negative emotions can influence entrepreneurial persistence and decision-making. Cardon et al. (2012) introduce the concept of entrepreneurial passion, demonstrating its impact on opportunity recognition, venture growth, and persistence in the face of challenges. The action theory process model of entrepreneurship, as presented in this review, integrates these various perspectives. It recognizes that entrepreneurial actions are influenced by cognitive, motivational, and emotional factors, which themselves evolve throughout the entrepreneurial journey. This model aligns with the work of Shepherd et al. (2019), who emphasize the importance of studying entrepreneurship as a dynamic process rather than a static phenomenon. The recursive nature of the entrepreneurial process is highlighted by Baron (2008), who examines how cognitive biases and heuristics influence opportunity recognition and decision-making. This work underscores the importance of feedback loops in the entrepreneurial process, where outcomes of actions influence future cognitive processes and behaviors. In conclusion, the psychology of entrepreneurship has made significant strides in the past decade, particularly in understanding the interplay between action and process. The action theory process model provides a useful framework for integrating various theoretical perspectives and empirical findings. Future research should continue to explore the dynamic nature of entrepreneurial cognition, motivation, and emotion, as well as their impact on entrepreneurial actions and outcomes. Longitudinal studies and mixed-method approaches will be particularly valuable in capturing the complexity of the entrepreneurial journey.", "References": [{"title": "Causation and effectuation: Toward a theoretical shift from economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency", "authors": "Saras D.
