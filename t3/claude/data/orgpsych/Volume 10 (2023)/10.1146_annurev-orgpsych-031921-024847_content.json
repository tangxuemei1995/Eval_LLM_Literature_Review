{"Literature Review": "The concepts of decent work and meaningful work have gained significant attention in recent years as crucial aspects of contemporary employment. While these constructs emerge from distinct perspectives, they both play fundamental roles in shaping the quality of work experiences for individuals, organizations, and society at large. This literature review aims to explore the conceptual foundations, empirical evidence, and interconnections between decent work and meaningful work. Decent work, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO), encompasses basic workplace conditions that all employees should be entitled to, including fair wages, safe working environments, and social protection. The concept has its roots in social justice and human rights frameworks, emphasizing the importance of work in promoting human dignity and social inclusion. Empirical research has demonstrated that access to decent work is associated with improved physical and mental health outcomes, increased job satisfaction, and enhanced overall well-being. On the other hand, meaningful work is a more aspirational concept that reflects the significance and purpose individuals find in their work. Scholars have conceptualized meaningful work as a multidimensional construct encompassing elements such as purpose, coherence, and personal growth. Research has shown that experiencing work as meaningful is linked to various positive outcomes, including increased job performance, organizational commitment, and life satisfaction. While decent work and meaningful work have traditionally been studied separately, recent scholarship has begun to explore their interconnections. The Psychology of Working Theory (PWT) provides a useful framework for understanding how these constructs relate to each other. PWT posits that need satisfaction serves as a primary connector between decent work and meaningful work. Specifically, the theory suggests that access to decent work can facilitate the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, which in turn can contribute to the experience of meaningful work. Societal context plays a crucial role in shaping access to both decent work and meaningful work. Macro-level factors such as economic conditions, labor market policies, and cultural values can significantly influence the availability and quality of work opportunities. For instance, research has shown that countries with stronger social safety nets and more robust labor protections tend to have higher levels of decent work. Organizational conditions also play a vital role in promoting access to decent and meaningful work. Job design, organizational culture, and leadership practices can all contribute to creating work environments that support both basic workplace conditions and opportunities for meaningful engagement. Studies have demonstrated that organizations that prioritize employee well-being and provide opportunities for skill development and autonomy are more likely to foster both decent and meaningful work experiences. Individual practices and characteristics also influence the experience of decent and meaningful work, albeit to a lesser extent than societal and organizational factors. Personal factors such as career adaptability, proactive personality, and job crafting behaviors have been shown to contribute to individuals' ability to access and create meaningful work experiences within the constraints of their work environments. The intersection of decent work and meaningful work raises important questions about the nature of work quality in contemporary society. While decent work focuses on meeting basic standards and protections, meaningful work speaks to higher-order needs for purpose and significance. Future research should explore how these constructs interact and potentially reinforce each other, as well as investigate potential tensions or trade-offs between them. Methodologically, the field would benefit from a broader range of research approaches. While much of the existing literature relies on cross-sectional survey data, longitudinal studies and mixed-methods approaches could provide deeper insights into the dynamic nature of work experiences and the processes through which decent work and meaningful work develop over time. Interdisciplinary perspectives are also crucial for advancing our understanding of these complex constructs. Integrating insights from psychology, sociology, economics, and organizational studies can help capture the multifaceted nature of work quality and its implications for individuals and society. Finally, there is a pressing need for intervention research aimed at improving access to decent and meaningful work. Such research could focus on developing and evaluating strategies for enhancing work quality at various levels, from individual career counseling interventions to organizational change initiatives and policy-level interventions. In conclusion, the study of decent work and meaningful work represents a critical area of inquiry for understanding and improving the quality of contemporary work experiences. By exploring the connections between these constructs and adopting interdisciplinary, methodologically diverse approaches, researchers can contribute to developing more holistic and effective strategies for promoting work that is both decent and meaningful, ultimately enhancing the well-being of individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.", "References": [{"title": "The psychology of working theory", "authors": "Ryan D.
