{"Literature Review": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and climate regulation. While much attention has been given to surface SOC, the deep soil organic carbon, defined as SOC stored below 20 cm depth, represents a significant portion of the global carbon pool. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on deep SOC responses to global change drivers, highlighting the unique characteristics and challenges associated with studying this important carbon reservoir.Deep SOC constitutes over 70% of the total soil organic carbon stock, making it a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle (Jobbágy and Jackson, 2000). Unlike surface SOC, which is primarily influenced by plant inputs and microbial activity, deep SOC is subject to different controls and dynamics. Mineral associations and physical protection mechanisms become increasingly important with depth, potentially leading to longer residence times and altered responses to environmental changes (Rumpel and Kögel-Knabner, 2011).Global change drivers, including warming, shifting precipitation patterns, elevated CO2, and land use changes, are expected to impact deep SOC dynamics. However, our understanding of these impacts remains limited due to the scarcity of studies focusing on deep soil layers. Warming is anticipated to accelerate SOC decomposition rates, potentially leading to increased CO2 emissions. A meta-analysis by Zhou et al. (2018) found that warming generally increased SOC decomposition rates, but the magnitude of the effect decreased with soil depth. This suggests that deep SOC may be less sensitive to temperature changes compared to surface SOC, possibly due to physical and chemical protection mechanisms.Shifting precipitation patterns can affect deep SOC through changes in soil moisture, which influences microbial activity and carbon stabilization processes. Increased precipitation may enhance carbon input to deeper soil layers through increased plant productivity and root growth. Conversely, drought conditions could limit carbon inputs and alter decomposition rates. However, the net effect of changing precipitation on deep SOC remains uncertain, as few studies have explicitly examined this relationship in deep soil layers (Bardgett et al., 2008).Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can potentially increase carbon inputs to deep soil layers through enhanced plant productivity and root growth. A long-term free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment by Iversen et al. (2012) demonstrated increased root production and turnover at depths below 30 cm under elevated CO2 conditions. This suggests that deep SOC stocks may increase under future climate scenarios. However, the fate of this additional carbon input and its long-term stabilization in deep soil layers require further investigation.Land use and land cover changes have significant impacts on SOC dynamics, but their effects on deep SOC are less well understood compared to surface soils. Agricultural practices, such as tillage and crop rotations, can alter the distribution and stability of SOC throughout the soil profile. A global meta-analysis by Luo et al. (2010) found that land-use change from native vegetation to cropland resulted in SOC losses at all depths, with the relative loss being greater in deeper soil layers. This highlights the vulnerability of deep SOC to land-use change and the need for management practices that promote carbon sequestration throughout the soil profile.The response of deep SOC to global change drivers is likely to differ from that of surface SOC due to the predominance of mineral controls and reduced biotic influences with depth. Mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) becomes increasingly important in deeper soil layers, providing physical and chemical protection to organic carbon (Kögel-Knabner et al., 2008). This protection may render deep SOC less sensitive to short-term environmental changes but more vulnerable to long-term alterations in soil structure and mineralogy.Despite the importance of deep SOC in the global carbon cycle, there is a notable lack of studies explicitly focusing on its response to global change drivers. Most soil carbon studies are limited to the top 20-30 cm of the soil profile, potentially overlooking significant changes occurring in deeper layers. This knowledge gap hinders our ability to accurately predict the fate of soil carbon under future climate scenarios and develop effective strategies for soil carbon management and sequestration.To address these limitations, there is a pressing need for more comprehensive studies that incorporate deep soil layers in global change experiments and long-term monitoring efforts. Advanced techniques, such as isotope tracing and high-resolution imaging, can provide valuable insights into the dynamics and stabilization mechanisms of deep SOC (Schmidt et al., 2011). Additionally, the integration of deep SOC processes into Earth system models is crucial for improving projections of terrestrial carbon feedbacks to climate change.In conclusion, deep soil organic carbon represents a significant and potentially vulnerable component of the global carbon cycle. While our understanding of deep SOC responses to global change drivers remains limited, emerging evidence suggests that these responses may differ from those observed in surface soils. Future research efforts should prioritize the inclusion of deep soil layers in manipulative experiments, long-term observations, and modeling studies to better constrain the role of deep SOC in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "The vertical distribution of soil organic carbon and its relation to climate and vegetation", "authors": "Esteban G.
