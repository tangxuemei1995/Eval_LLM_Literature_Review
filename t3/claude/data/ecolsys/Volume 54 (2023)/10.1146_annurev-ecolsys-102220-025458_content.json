{"Literature Review": "The evolution of cetaceans, from their terrestrial ancestors to the diverse array of marine mammals we observe today, is a fascinating subject that has captivated researchers for decades. This literature review explores the ecophysiological drivers and limits of foraging in the evolution of cetaceans, focusing on how whales dive, feast, and fast.Cetaceans are divided into two main groups: odontocetes (toothed whales) and mysticetes (baleen whales). Both groups have evolved unique foraging strategies that have allowed them to exploit different niches in the marine environment. The evolution of these strategies has been closely tied to changes in body size, diving capacity, and sensory adaptations.Toothed whales have developed echolocation as a primary means of locating and capturing prey. This sophisticated biosonar system allows them to navigate and hunt in the dark depths of the ocean. Madsen et al. (2007) demonstrated that toothed whales can produce high-frequency clicks and process returning echoes to create detailed acoustic images of their surroundings, including potential prey items. This adaptation has enabled them to become efficient predators of deep-sea fish and cephalopods, which are among the most abundant prey sources in the ocean.The diving capabilities of toothed whales have also evolved to support their deep-sea foraging habits. Tyack et al. (2006) showed that some species, such as sperm whales and beaked whales, can dive to depths exceeding 1,000 meters and remain submerged for over an hour. These extreme diving abilities are made possible by a suite of physiological adaptations, including increased blood oxygen storage capacity and the ability to collapse their lungs to withstand high pressures at depth.Body size has played a crucial role in the evolution of cetacean foraging strategies. Goldbogen et al. (2019) found that larger body sizes in toothed whales are associated with increased diving capacity and the ability to capture larger prey items. This relationship has likely driven the evolution of gigantism in some toothed whale species, such as the sperm whale, which can reach lengths of up to 18 meters.Baleen whales, on the other hand, have evolved a different set of adaptations to exploit their prey resources. The most notable of these is the development of baleen plates, which allow them to filter large volumes of water to capture small prey items such as krill and schooling fish. Werth et al. (2018) described the complex morphology and function of baleen, highlighting its importance in the evolution of bulk filter feeding in mysticetes.The evolution of filter feeding in baleen whales has been accompanied by even more extreme increases in body size compared to toothed whales. Goldbogen and Madsen (2018) proposed that the ability to exploit dense patches of small prey through bulk filter feeding has driven the evolution of gigantism in baleen whales, with the blue whale reaching lengths of up to 30 meters and weights of up to 200 tons.The large body size of baleen whales is not only advantageous for filter feeding but also plays a crucial role in their ability to undertake long-distance migrations and fast for extended periods. Lockyer (1981) demonstrated that the blubber stores of large baleen whales allow them to survive for months without feeding during their annual migrations between feeding and breeding grounds. This fasting capacity is a key adaptation that enables baleen whales to exploit seasonally abundant prey resources in polar regions while breeding in warmer, less productive waters.The foraging strategies of both toothed and baleen whales are ultimately limited by the abundance and distribution of their prey. Hazen et al. (2015) showed that the spatial and temporal variability of prey resources can have significant impacts on the foraging success and population dynamics of cetaceans. Climate change and other anthropogenic factors that affect prey availability are therefore of great concern for the conservation of these species.The convergent evolution of gigantism in both toothed and baleen whales, despite their divergent foraging strategies, is a testament to the importance of body size in cetacean ecology. However, Gearty et al. (2018) suggested that there may be upper limits to body size in marine mammals, imposed by metabolic constraints and the energetic costs of foraging.In conclusion, the evolution of cetacean foraging strategies has been shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including body size, diving capacity, sensory adaptations, and prey availability. The divergent approaches of toothed and baleen whales to exploiting marine resources have led to a remarkable diversity of species and ecological niches. Understanding these ecophysiological drivers and limits is crucial for both our appreciation of cetacean evolution and our efforts to conserve these magnificent animals in the face of ongoing environmental changes.", "References": [{"title": "Biosonar performance of foraging beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris)", "authors": "Peter T.
