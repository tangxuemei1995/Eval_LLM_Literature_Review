{"Literature Review": "Large Old World fruit bats (LOWFBs), comprising species of Pteropus, Acerodon, and related genera within the pteropodid subfamily Pteropodinae, are facing an unprecedented crisis. These charismatic creatures, often referred to as flying foxes, play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning across the Paleotropics. However, their survival is increasingly threatened, with a staggering 71% of extant species classified as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [1]. This literature review aims to explore the causes and consequences of the impending extinction of LOWFBs, highlighting the unique challenges they face and the potential ecological ramifications of their decline.LOWFBs are distinguished by their large size, frugivorous diet, and their significant contributions to seed dispersal and pollination in tropical and subtropical ecosystems [2]. These bats are particularly important in island ecosystems, where they often serve as the primary pollinators and seed dispersers for many plant species [3]. However, their biological and ecological traits, which have evolved over millions of years, now render them particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic threats.One of the primary threats facing LOWFBs is habitat loss and fragmentation. As human populations expand and land-use changes accelerate, the forests that these bats depend on for food and shelter are rapidly disappearing [4]. This loss of habitat not only reduces the available resources for LOWFBs but also increases their exposure to other threats, such as hunting and human-wildlife conflict.Hunting poses a significant threat to LOWFB populations, particularly in regions where they are consumed as bushmeat or used in traditional medicine [5]. The large body size and gregarious nature of these bats make them easy targets for hunters. Moreover, their low reproductive rates – typically producing only one offspring per year – mean that populations struggle to recover from hunting pressure [6].Climate change presents another formidable challenge for LOWFBs. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering the phenology of fruit-bearing plants, potentially creating mismatches between bat foraging needs and food availability [7]. Additionally, extreme weather events, such as cyclones and heat waves, which are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, can cause significant mortality in LOWFB populations [8].The unique life history characteristics of LOWFBs exacerbate their vulnerability to these threats. Their long lifespan, late sexual maturity, and low fecundity mean that populations recover slowly from disturbances [9]. Furthermore, their high mobility and tendency to form large, conspicuous colonies make them susceptible to hunting and human persecution.The potential loss of LOWFBs is particularly concerning given their status as keystone species in many ecosystems. These bats play a disproportionately large role in maintaining ecosystem structure and function through their seed dispersal and pollination services [10]. The extinction of LOWFBs could therefore have far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem health across the Paleotropics.The decline of LOWFBs is likely to have cascading effects on the plant communities they service. Many plant species, particularly those on oceanic islands, have co-evolved with these bats and depend on them for pollination and seed dispersal. The loss of LOWFBs could lead to reduced genetic diversity in plant populations, altered forest composition, and potentially even co-extinctions of dependent plant species.Given the critical ecological roles of LOWFBs and the multiple threats they face, urgent conservation action is needed. Effective conservation strategies will require a multifaceted approach, addressing habitat protection, hunting regulation, and climate change mitigation. Additionally, there is a pressing need for further research to better understand the ecology and population dynamics of these species, as well as the full extent of their ecosystem services.In conclusion, the impending extinction of Large Old World fruit bats represents a significant conservation crisis with potentially far-reaching ecological consequences. The unique vulnerability of these species, stemming from their biological traits and the multiple anthropogenic threats they face, necessitates immediate and concerted conservation efforts. Protecting these keystone species is not only crucial for their own survival but also for maintaining the health and biodiversity of tropical and subtropical ecosystems across the Paleotropics.", "References": [{"title": "Extinction risk and conservation of the world's bats", "authors": "Tigga Kingston, Rodrigo A.
