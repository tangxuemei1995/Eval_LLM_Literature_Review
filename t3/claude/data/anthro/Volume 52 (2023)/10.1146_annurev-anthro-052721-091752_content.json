{"Literature Review": "The role of interpreters in facilitating communication across linguistic and cultural boundaries has long been recognized as crucial in various fields, including anthropology, international relations, and global business. However, recent scholarship has begun to critically examine the often invisible and undervalued nature of interpreters' labor, as well as the ethical complexities inherent in their work. This literature review explores the emerging body of research on the invisible labor and ethics of interpreting, with a focus on how these issues intersect with broader questions of global capitalism, professional ethics, and anthropological practice.The concept of invisible labor, as applied to interpreting, has gained traction in recent years. Scholars such as Cronin (2002) have argued that the work of interpreters is often rendered invisible by dominant language ideologies that assume the seamless transmission of meaning across languages. This invisibility is further reinforced by professional norms that emphasize neutrality and transparency, as noted by Angelelli (2004) in her groundbreaking study of medical interpreters. The paradox of interpreter invisibility is that it is often actively promoted by the profession itself, as a means of maintaining professional standards and ethical boundaries.However, this invisibility comes at a cost. As Koskinen (2008) demonstrates in her ethnographic study of EU interpreters, the labor of interpretation is frequently devalued and unrecognized within institutional settings. This devaluation is not merely symbolic but has material consequences for interpreters, who often face precarious working conditions and inadequate compensation. Pöchhacker (2016) argues that this devaluation is rooted in broader societal attitudes towards language work, which is often seen as a natural skill rather than a professional expertise.The invisible nature of interpreters' labor is closely tied to ideologies of linguistic transparency that underpin global and multilingual organizations. Maryns (2013) demonstrates how asylum procedures in Belgium rely on the assumption that language can be transparently transmitted across linguistic and cultural boundaries, an assumption that obscures the complex mediating role of interpreters. Similarly, Inghilleri (2005) shows how the ideal of neutrality in interpreting can conflict with the realities of power imbalances in interpreted encounters, particularly in contexts of conflict or political asylum.The ethical tensions faced by interpreters mirror those encountered by anthropologists, particularly in relation to ideals of professional neutrality versus advocacy. Wadensjö (1998) was among the first to challenge the notion of the interpreter as a neutral conduit, arguing instead for a view of interpreting as a form of situated interaction. This perspective has been further developed by scholars such as Baker (2006), who argues that interpreters inevitably make ethical choices in their work and should be recognized as active agents in the communication process.The ethical dilemmas faced by interpreters are particularly acute in humanitarian contexts. Moser-Mercer (2015) examines the challenges faced by interpreters working in conflict zones, highlighting the psychological toll of this work and the ethical complexities of maintaining professional boundaries in high-stakes situations. Similarly, Footitt and Kelly (2012) explore the role of interpreters in war and conflict, arguing that their work is central to the conduct of war but often overlooked in historical accounts.The study of interpreters' labor and ethics offers valuable insights for anthropological practice. As Gal (2015) argues, attention to the work of interpreters can help anthropologists reflect more critically on their own role as cultural mediators and the power dynamics inherent in fieldwork. Moreover, as Besteman (2016) suggests, the ethical dilemmas faced by interpreters in humanitarian contexts can illuminate broader tensions within the anthropology of humanitarianism.Finally, the invisible labor of interpreters must be understood within the context of global capitalism. Duchêne (2009) argues that the commodification of language skills in the global economy has led to new forms of exploitation and precarity for language workers, including interpreters. This perspective is echoed by Heller (2010), who examines how language has become a key site of capitalist valorization in the new economy.In conclusion, the growing body of literature on the invisible labor and ethics of interpreting offers a rich terrain for exploring broader questions about language, power, and global capitalism. By rendering visible the often-overlooked work of interpreters, this scholarship challenges dominant ideologies of linguistic transparency and professional neutrality. Moreover, it provides a valuable lens through which to examine the ethical complexities of cross-cultural communication and the paradoxes of globalization. As such, this field of study holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of both interpreting practices and anthropological ethics in an increasingly interconnected world.", "References": [{"title": "The Interpreter's Role: A Study of Asylum Hearings in Belgium and the UK", "authors": "Katrijn Maryns", "journal": "Journal of Sociolinguistics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "17", "first page": "81", "last page": "107", "DOI": "10.1111/josl.12013"}, {"title": "The Critical Link: Interpreters in the Community", "authors": "Cecilia Wadensjö", "journal": "Amsterdam: John Benjamins", "year": "1998", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1075/btl.29"}, {"title": "Interpreting as a Discourse Process", "authors": "Claudia V.
