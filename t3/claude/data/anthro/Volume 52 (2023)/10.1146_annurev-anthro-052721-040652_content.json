{"Literature Review": "The concept of decolonizing museums has gained significant traction in recent years, reflecting a broader shift in academic and cultural discourse towards addressing the legacies of colonialism and imperialism. This literature review examines the evolving landscape of museum decolonization, with a particular focus on Native North American heritage and its implications for museum practices globally.The origins of the decolonization movement in museums can be traced back to the critical discourse that emerged in the 1990s, challenging the traditional ethnographic museum model. Lonetree (2012) argues that these institutions often perpetuated colonial narratives and power structures, leading to misrepresentation and marginalization of indigenous cultures. This critique laid the groundwork for a paradigm shift in museum practices, emphasizing the need for more inclusive and culturally sensitive approaches.A pivotal moment in this trajectory was the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990. As discussed by Fine-Dare (2002), NAGPRA mandated the return of Native American cultural items and human remains to their respective tribes or descendants. This legislation not only addressed long-standing ethical concerns but also catalyzed broader discussions about the role of museums in preserving and presenting indigenous heritage.The implementation of NAGPRA has had far-reaching consequences for museum practices. Colwell (2017) explores how the act has fostered new collaborations between museums and Native American communities, leading to more nuanced and respectful approaches to collection management and exhibition design. These partnerships have challenged traditional curatorial authority and opened up spaces for indigenous voices and perspectives within museum settings.The representation of Native American cultures in public displays has been a central concern in the decolonization discourse. Phillips (2011) examines how museums have grappled with the complexities of portraying indigenous cultures authentically and respectfully. Her work highlights the importance of moving beyond static, essentialist representations towards more dynamic and contemporary portrayals of Native American life and culture.Involvement of indigenous communities in collections care has emerged as a crucial aspect of decolonizing museum practices. Kreps (2003) discusses the concept of 'appropriate museology,' which advocates for the integration of indigenous knowledge systems and cultural practices into museum work. This approach not only enhances the preservation of cultural heritage but also helps to address historical power imbalances in the museum sector.The rise of tribal museums represents a significant development in the decolonization of museum practices. Clifford (2013) explores how these institutions serve as sites of cultural revitalization and self-representation for indigenous communities. Tribal museums challenge the traditional Western museum model by prioritizing indigenous worldviews, knowledge systems, and modes of cultural transmission.The impact of decolonization efforts extends beyond Native North American contexts. Modest et al. (2018) provide a global perspective on museum decolonization, examining case studies from various countries and cultural contexts. Their work underscores the diversity of decolonial approaches and the importance of local specificities in shaping museum practices.As museums continue to grapple with their colonial legacies, new paradigms are emerging in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums. Bouquet (2012) explores how these shifts are reshaping the relationship between anthropology and museum practice, leading to more reflexive and collaborative approaches to cultural representation and interpretation.The process of indigenizing museums represents a further evolution in decolonial practice. Lonetree (2012) argues that indigenization goes beyond mere inclusion or consultation, calling for a fundamental restructuring of museum practices and power dynamics. This approach seeks to center indigenous knowledge, values, and ways of being in all aspects of museum work.As the field continues to evolve, challenges and opportunities remain. Simpson (2009) highlights the ongoing tensions between institutional traditions and decolonial aspirations, emphasizing the need for sustained commitment and structural change within the museum sector.In conclusion, the literature on decolonizing museums reveals a complex and dynamic field of inquiry. From the critical reflections of the 1990s to the emergence of tribal museums and new collaborative practices, the trajectory of museum decolonization reflects broader shifts in cultural politics and postcolonial discourse. As museums continue to navigate these changes, the ongoing dialogue between scholars, practitioners, and indigenous communities promises to reshape the role of museums in society, fostering more equitable and inclusive approaches to cultural heritage preservation and presentation.", "References": [{"title": "Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums", "authors": "Amy Lonetree", "journal": "University of North Carolina Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.5149/9780807837528_lonetree"}, {"title": "Grave Injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA", "authors": "Kathleen S.
