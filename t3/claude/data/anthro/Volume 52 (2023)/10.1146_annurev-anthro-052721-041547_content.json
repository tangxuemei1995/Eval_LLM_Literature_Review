{"Literature Review": "The study of algorithms has become increasingly important in social sciences as these computational processes permeate various aspects of modern life. However, as noted in the abstract, anthropological investigations often struggle to define and locate algorithms as concrete objects of study. This literature review aims to explore the concept of 'algorithmic ecologies' as a framework for understanding and studying algorithms in social contexts.The notion of algorithmic ecologies draws from various interdisciplinary fields, including science and technology studies, media studies, and anthropology. This approach views algorithms not as isolated technical artifacts but as part of complex socio-technical systems embedded in broader cultural, economic, and political contexts.Imaginaries play a crucial role in shaping algorithmic ecologies. Jasanoff and Kim (2015) introduced the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, describing how collective visions of scientific and technological progress influence social order. In the context of algorithms, these imaginaries shape public perceptions, policy decisions, and technological development. Beer (2017) further explores how algorithmic imaginaries influence everyday life and social structures.Infrastructures form the backbone of algorithmic ecologies. Star and Ruhleder (1996) define infrastructure as the often-invisible systems that support human activities. In the digital age, algorithmic infrastructures have become increasingly complex and pervasive. Plantin et al. (2018) examine how digital platforms have evolved into infrastructures, blurring the lines between public and private systems.Interfaces are critical components of algorithmic ecologies, mediating interactions between humans and computational systems. Galloway (2012) argues that interfaces are not neutral conduits but active sites of power and control. Seaver (2019) extends this idea to algorithmic systems, highlighting how user interfaces shape our understanding and interaction with algorithms.Identities within algorithmic ecologies are both shaped by and shape algorithmic processes. Cheney-Lippold (2011) introduces the concept of 'algorithmic identity,' exploring how data-driven categorization influences individual and collective identities. Noble (2018) further investigates how algorithmic bias reinforces existing social inequalities, particularly in terms of race and gender.Investments and interests drive the development and deployment of algorithms. Zuboff (2019) coined the term 'surveillance capitalism' to describe how tech companies monetize user data through algorithmic systems. Pasquale (2015) examines the 'black box society,' highlighting how proprietary algorithms influence various aspects of society, from finance to healthcare.The ecological approach to studying algorithms emphasizes their interconnectedness and embeddedness in social systems. Kitchin (2017) argues for a critical approach to data and algorithms, considering their social, economic, and political implications. Gillespie (2014) explores the public relevance of algorithms, emphasizing their role in shaping information flows and decision-making processes.By conceptualizing algorithms as part of broader ecologies, researchers can better understand their complex interactions with social systems. This approach allows for a more nuanced examination of how algorithms are imagined, implemented, interfaced, experienced, and leveraged by various actors.The ecological framework also highlights the dynamic nature of algorithmic systems. As Seaver (2017) notes, algorithms are not static objects but constantly evolving processes shaped by human decisions and social contexts. This perspective challenges simplistic notions of algorithmic determinism and emphasizes the importance of studying algorithms in their specific socio-technical environments.In conclusion, the concept of algorithmic ecologies offers a promising framework for studying algorithms in social science. By considering the multiple modalities of imaginaries, infrastructures, interfaces, identities, and investments, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of how algorithms operate within and influence social systems. This approach not only addresses the challenge of studying algorithms as concrete objects but also provides a rich conceptual toolkit for exploring their complex roles in contemporary society.", "References": [{"title": "Dreamscapes of Modernity: Sociotechnical Imaginaries and the Fabrication of Power", "authors": "Sheila Jasanoff, Sang-Hyun Kim", "journal": "University of Chicago Press", "year": "2015", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7208/chicago/9780226276663.001.0001"}, {"title": "The social power of algorithms", "authors": "David Beer", "journal": "Information, Communication & Society", "year": "2017", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1080/1369118X.2016.1216147"}, {"title": "Steps Toward an Ecology of Infrastructure: Design and Access for Large Information Spaces", "authors": "Susan Leigh Star, Karen Ruhleder", "journal": "Information Systems Research", "year": "1996", "volumes": "7", "first page": "111", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1287/isre.7.1.111"}, {"title": "The platformization of the web: Making web data platform ready", "authors": "Jean-Christophe Plantin, Carl Lagoze, Paul N Edwards, Christian Sandvig", "journal": "New Media & Society", "year": "2018", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1323", "last page": "1342", "DOI": "10.1177/1461444816688341"}, {"title": "A New Algorithmic Identity: Soft Biopolitics and the Modulation of Control", "authors": "John Cheney-Lippold", "journal": "Theory, Culture & Society", "year": "2011", "volumes": "28", "first page": "164", "last page": "181", "DOI": "10.1177/0263276411424420"}, {"title": "Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism", "authors": "Safiya Umoja Noble", "journal": "NYU Press", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5"}, {"title": "The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information", "authors": "Frank Pasquale", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "2015", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"}]}
