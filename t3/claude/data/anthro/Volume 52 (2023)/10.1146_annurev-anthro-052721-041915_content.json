{"Literature Review": "The anthropological study of masculinity has undergone significant transformations since the turn of the millennium, expanding its scope and deepening its theoretical foundations. This literature review aims to explore the developments in the field, highlighting key contributions and emerging trends in the anthropology of masculinity.One of the most notable shifts in recent years has been the increasing participation of scholars from the Global South in masculinity studies. This diversification has brought fresh perspectives and challenged the dominance of Western-centric approaches. For instance, Connell's (2016) work on Southern Theory in masculinity studies has been instrumental in highlighting the need for more inclusive and globally representative research. Similarly, Morrell et al. (2012) have contributed significantly to our understanding of masculinities in African contexts, emphasizing the importance of local knowledge and experiences.The intersection of masculinity and militarism has emerged as a crucial area of study. Anthropologists have explored how military institutions shape and reinforce particular forms of masculinity, often with far-reaching societal implications. Gutmann and Lutz's (2010) ethnographic work on the U.S. military provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between masculinity, violence, and national identity. Their research demonstrates how military service both constructs and challenges traditional notions of manhood.Public health has become another important focus in masculinity studies, with researchers examining how gendered expectations and behaviors impact health outcomes. Courtenay's (2000) seminal work on the connections between masculinity and health-risk behaviors has inspired numerous studies in this area. More recently, Fleming et al. (2016) have explored how masculine norms influence men's engagement with healthcare services, highlighting the need for gender-sensitive approaches in public health interventions.The study of gender inequalities has remained a central concern in the anthropology of masculinity. Researchers have increasingly focused on how masculinities are implicated in the perpetuation of gender-based disparities. Flood's (2015) work on men's involvement in gender equality initiatives has been particularly influential, emphasizing the importance of engaging men as allies in feminist movements. Additionally, Barker et al. (2011) have contributed to our understanding of how masculinities intersect with other forms of social inequality, such as race and class.The rise of trans* social movements has prompted anthropologists to reconsider binary frameworks of gender and sexuality. Valentine's (2007) ethnographic study of transgender communities in the United States has been groundbreaking in this regard, challenging essentialist notions of gender and highlighting the fluidity of gender identities. Building on this work, Halberstam's (2018) research on trans* masculinities has further expanded our understanding of gender diversity and its implications for masculinity studies.Innovative research in biological anthropology has also contributed to our understanding of masculinity. For example, Bribiescas' (2006) work on the evolutionary biology of male reproductive strategies has shed light on the biological underpinnings of certain masculine behaviors. Similarly, linguistic anthropologists have explored how language use reflects and reinforces gendered power dynamics. Cameron's (2005) research on language and masculinity has been particularly influential in this area, demonstrating how linguistic practices contribute to the construction and maintenance of masculine identities.Archaeology has also made significant contributions to masculinity studies, with researchers examining how material culture reflects and shapes gendered practices across different historical contexts. Joyce's (2008) work on ancient Mesoamerican masculinities, for instance, has provided valuable insights into the historical variability of gender constructions.As the field of masculinity studies continues to evolve, there is an ongoing debate about whether anthropologists should move beyond the study of women or men to explore gender, sex, and sexuality in less binary frameworks. Scholars like Butler (1990) have long argued for a more fluid understanding of gender, and this perspective has gained traction in recent anthropological research. For example, Boellstorff's (2007) work on gender and sexuality in Indonesia has demonstrated the value of approaching these topics from a non-binary perspective.The anthropology of masculinity has also begun to extend its focus beyond humans to include nonhuman animals. This emerging area of research, exemplified by the work of scholars like Fuentes (2012), explores how gender and sexuality manifest in other species and what this can tell us about the evolution and diversity of masculine behaviors.In conclusion, the anthropology of masculinity has experienced significant growth and diversification since 2000. The field has expanded its geographical and theoretical scope, embraced interdisciplinary approaches, and begun to challenge binary frameworks of gender and sexuality. As research in this area continues to evolve, it promises to provide ever more nuanced and comprehensive understandings of masculinity in its myriad forms and contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Masculinities", "authors": "Raewyn Connell", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "South African men and gender equality: A conversation with Bafana Khumalo and Dean Peacock", "authors": "Robert Morrell, Rachel Jewkes, Bafana Khumalo, Dean Peacock", "journal": "Men and Masculinities", "year": "2012", "volumes": "15", "first page": "116", "last page": "129", "DOI": "10.1177/1097184X11432111"}, {"title": "Breaking Ranks: Iraq Veterans Speak Out against the War", "authors": "Matthew Gutmann, Catherine Lutz", "journal": "University of California Press", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Constructions of masculinity and their influence on men's well-being: a theory of gender and health", "authors": "Will H.
