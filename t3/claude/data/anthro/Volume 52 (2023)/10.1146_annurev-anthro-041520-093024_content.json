{"Literature Review": "Global health interventions have been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate within anthropological circles, particularly concerning their implications for power dynamics, cultural sensitivity, and overall effectiveness. This literature review examines three primary lines of anthropological inquiry into global health interventions: those serving imperial and military objectives, 'magic bullet' interventions derived from laboratory science, and interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. Additionally, we explore emerging alternative approaches that challenge traditional intervention paradigms. The intersection of global health interventions with imperial and military objectives has been a significant area of anthropological research. Scholars have critically examined how health interventions have been used as tools for geopolitical influence and control. For instance, Birn and Dmitrienko (2005) analyzed the Rockefeller Foundation's early 20th-century public health campaigns in Latin America, revealing how these interventions served US economic and political interests while simultaneously addressing health concerns. Similarly, McMillen (2015) explored the complex relationship between colonial powers and tuberculosis control efforts in Africa, demonstrating how medical interventions were often intertwined with broader imperial agendas. The concept of 'magic bullet' interventions, arising from laboratory science and promising quick, targeted solutions to complex health problems, has also been a focus of anthropological critique. Biehl and Petryna (2013) examined the limitations of narrowly focused pharmaceutical interventions in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, arguing for a more holistic approach that considers social and economic factors. Packard (2016) further elaborated on this theme, tracing the history of magic bullet thinking in global health and its often-disappointing outcomes in practice. Anthropologists have also scrutinized interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques, which attempt to predict and control health outcomes through mathematical and statistical approaches. Adams (2016) provided a critical analysis of the rise of metrics and modeling in global health, arguing that these approaches often oversimplify complex social realities and marginalize local knowledge and expertise. Erikson (2012) similarly examined the limitations of data-driven interventions in addressing maternal mortality, highlighting the importance of contextual factors that may be overlooked in quantitative models. In response to these critiques, anthropologists have begun to explore alternative approaches to global health interventions, which we term 'intervention otherwise.' These approaches emphasize building relations of solidarity and care, designing interventions to be interactive and adaptable, and using data and modeling in support of health justice. For example, Farmer et al. (2013) described the concept of 'accompaniment' in global health, which involves long-term commitment to communities and prioritizes local agency and knowledge in intervention design and implementation. Benton (2015) examined how community health workers in Lesotho navigate and adapt global HIV/AIDS interventions to local contexts, demonstrating the potential for more flexible and responsive approaches to health programming. Similarly, Kenworthy (2017) explored how grassroots organizations in South Africa have leveraged global health resources to build local capacity and address broader social determinants of health. The use of data and modeling techniques in support of health justice represents another promising direction in 'intervention otherwise.' Krieger (2011) advocated for an 'ecosocial' approach to epidemiology that incorporates social and political factors into health models, potentially leading to more equitable and effective interventions. Moran-Thomas (2019) examined how community-based participatory research methods can democratize data collection and analysis, empowering local communities to shape health interventions according to their own priorities and needs. These alternative approaches to intervention challenge traditional Western power hierarchies in global health by drawing attention to diverse forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. They emphasize the importance of local context, community engagement, and long-term commitment in designing and implementing effective health interventions. The anthropological analysis of global health interventions has significant implications for ongoing debates about decolonizing global health. By critically examining the power dynamics inherent in traditional intervention models and highlighting alternative approaches, anthropologists contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and possibilities in this field. As global health continues to evolve, the insights provided by anthropological research can inform more equitable, effective, and culturally sensitive interventions that prioritize local agency and address the complex social determinants of health.", "References": [{"title": "Rockefeller international health and revolutionary Mexico", "authors": "Anne-Emanuelle Birn, Armando Sol√≥rzano", "journal": "Social Science & Medicine", "year": "1999", "volume": "49", "first page": "1530", "last page": "1560", "DOI": "10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00229-5"}, {"title": "Global Health Business: The Production and Performativity of Statistics in Sierra Leone and Germany", "authors": "Susan L.
