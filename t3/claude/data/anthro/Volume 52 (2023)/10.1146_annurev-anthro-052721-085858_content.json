{"Literature Review": "Human adaptation to extreme environments has been a subject of fascination and scientific inquiry for over a century. Anthropologists have long sought to understand how the human body responds to and survives in conditions that push the limits of physiological tolerance. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding human adaptation to extreme environments, with a focus on classic extreme conditions such as heat, cold, and high altitude, as well as emerging areas of research that consider the compounding effects of structural inequality and climate change.The human body's ability to adapt to extreme heat has been extensively studied. Early research by Wyndham et al. (1964) established the fundamental physiological responses to heat stress, including increased sweating and cardiovascular adaptations. More recent studies have built upon this foundation, with Sawka et al. (2011) demonstrating that heat acclimatization can occur within 7-14 days of exposure, leading to improved thermoregulation and reduced physiological strain. However, the limits of heat adaptation are being tested as global temperatures rise due to climate change. Kjellstrom et al. (2016) highlighted the increasing risk of heat-related illnesses and reduced work capacity in hot regions, particularly affecting vulnerable populations in low-income countries.Cold environments present a different set of challenges for human physiology. The seminal work of Irving et al. (1960) on Arctic populations laid the groundwork for understanding cold adaptation, identifying metabolic and circulatory adjustments that allow for survival in extreme cold. More recent research by Daanen and Van Marken Lichtenbelt (2016) has revealed the complexities of brown adipose tissue activation in cold exposure, suggesting potential health benefits of controlled cold exposure. However, as with heat adaptation, the impacts of climate change are altering the landscape of cold adaptation research, with Mäkinen (2007) noting the need to consider rapidly changing Arctic environments in future studies.High altitude environments have long been recognized as extreme due to their low oxygen availability. The groundbreaking work of Baker (1969) on high-altitude populations in the Andes set the stage for understanding genetic adaptations to hypoxia. Recent genetic studies, such as those by Beall et al. (2010), have identified specific genes associated with high-altitude adaptation in Tibetan populations, demonstrating the power of natural selection in shaping human physiology. However, as Bigham and Lee (2014) point out, the increasing accessibility of high-altitude environments through tourism and migration presents new challenges for understanding acute and chronic responses to hypoxia.While these classic extreme environments continue to be important areas of research, recent years have seen a broadening of the field to include other types of environmental extremes. For instance, Piantadosi (2003) explored the physiological challenges of deep-sea diving and space travel, environments that were once considered beyond human reach. These studies not only expand our understanding of human adaptability but also have practical implications for future exploration and habitation.An emerging and critical area of research is the intersection of extreme environments with structural inequality and climate change. Watts et al. (2015) argue that climate change is exacerbating existing health inequalities, with marginalized populations facing disproportionate exposure to environmental extremes. This perspective is further developed by Schell and Gallo (2012), who propose that structural inequality can be viewed as an extreme environment in itself, with chronic stress and limited resources impacting physiological adaptation and health outcomes.The concept of embodiment, as explored by Krieger (2005), provides a useful framework for understanding how these intersecting stressors are internalized and expressed in human biology. This approach suggests that the body literally incorporates the material and social world in which it exists, including the effects of extreme environments, inequality, and climate change. Future research in this area may help to elucidate the complex pathways through which environmental and social factors influence human adaptation and health.As we look to the future, it is clear that the study of human adaptation to extreme environments must evolve to address the challenges of a rapidly changing world. Ebi and Hess (2020) emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine physiological, genetic, and social perspectives to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change on human health. Additionally, there is a growing recognition of the importance of traditional ecological knowledge in understanding and responding to environmental extremes, as highlighted by Ford et al. (2016) in their work with Indigenous communities in the Arctic.In conclusion, the field of human adaptation to extreme environments has come a long way from its early focus on physiological responses to heat, cold, and altitude. While these classic areas of research remain important, the scope has expanded to include a wider range of extreme environments and to consider the complex interplay between environmental, social, and genetic factors. As we face the challenges of climate change and persistent structural inequalities, understanding human adaptation and resilience in extreme environments becomes not just a matter of scientific curiosity, but of urgent practical necessity.", "References": [{"title": "Human adaptation to heat and cold stress", "authors": "Wyndham, C.
