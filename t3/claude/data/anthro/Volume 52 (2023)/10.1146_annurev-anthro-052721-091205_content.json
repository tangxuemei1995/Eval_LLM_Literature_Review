{"Literature Review": "The intersection of social movements, power dynamics, and mediated visibility has become an increasingly important area of study in anthropology and media studies. This literature review examines how the anthropological study of media, through its production, circulation, and consumption, illuminates issues of social organization, political economy, and alternative visions for political futures. By synthesizing research on visual media, social movements, and hegemonic power, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of our current media environment and its implications for political, social, and cultural futures.The rise of digital media and social networking platforms has significantly altered the landscape of social movements and their visibility. Castells (2012) argues that the internet and mobile communication networks have facilitated the emergence of networked social movements, which are characterized by their horizontal organization and ability to rapidly mobilize supporters. These movements often challenge existing power structures and create new forms of political engagement. Building on this, Tufekci (2017) explores how digital technologies have empowered social movements while simultaneously exposing them to new vulnerabilities and forms of repression.The concept of mediated visibility plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics between social movements and power structures. Thompson (2005) introduces the idea of a 'new visibility' brought about by media technologies, where actions and events can be made visible to a wider audience, potentially challenging established power relations. This visibility, however, is not always advantageous to social movements. Uldam (2018) examines how corporations strategically manage their visibility in response to activist critiques, highlighting the complex interplay between visibility, power, and resistance in the digital age.The production and circulation of visual media within social movements have been the subject of extensive anthropological research. Postill (2018) explores how activists use social media to create and disseminate visual content, fostering solidarity and mobilizing support for their causes. Similarly, Juris (2012) investigates the role of digital media in shaping protest cultures and facilitating transnational activist networks. These studies underscore the importance of visual media in constructing collective identities and narratives within social movements.However, the relationship between social movements and media technologies is not without its complexities and contradictions. Treré (2019) critiques the techno-optimistic narratives surrounding digital activism, arguing that social media platforms can also reinforce existing power structures and exacerbate inequalities. This perspective is echoed by Couldry and Mejias (2019), who warn of the dangers of 'data colonialism' and the exploitation of user data by tech corporations.The role of states and corporations in shaping the media environment and influencing social movements has also been a focus of anthropological inquiry. Boler and Davis (2018) examine how state actors and tech companies collaborate to surveil and control online spaces, potentially limiting the effectiveness of digital activism. Conversely, Milan (2015) explores how activists develop alternative infrastructures and practices to resist corporate and state control over communication networks.The anthropological study of media production and consumption provides valuable insights into the broader societal implications of our evolving media landscape. Coleman (2010) investigates the cultural politics of hacking and digital activism, revealing how these practices challenge dominant power structures and create new forms of political engagement. Similarly, Ginsburg et al. (2002) explore how indigenous communities use media technologies to preserve cultural heritage and assert their rights, demonstrating the potential of media for cultural empowerment and resistance.As we look towards the future, the anthropological study of media, social movements, and power dynamics continues to evolve. Emerging research areas include the impact of artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance on social movements (Dencik et al., 2019), the role of affect and emotion in digital activism (Papacharissi, 2015), and the potential of decentralized technologies like blockchain for creating alternative political and economic systems (Reijers and Coeckelbergh, 2018).In conclusion, the anthropological study of media production, circulation, and consumption provides a critical lens through which to understand the complex relationships between social movements, power structures, and mediated visibility. By bringing together research on visual media, social movements, and hegemonic power, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of our current media environment and its implications for political, social, and cultural futures. As media technologies continue to evolve, anthropologists and media scholars must remain attentive to the ways in which these technologies shape and are shaped by social movements and power dynamics, offering insights that can inform more equitable and just political futures.", "References": [{"title": "Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age", "authors": "Manuel Castells", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest", "authors": "Zeynep Tufekci", "journal": "Yale University Press", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The New Visibility", "authors": "John B.
