{"Literature Review": "Water is essential for human survival and well-being, playing a crucial role in maintaining physiological functions, regulating body temperature, and supporting overall health. The intricate relationship between water, the environment, culture, and human biology necessitates an integrative approach to fully comprehend its impact on human health and well-being. This literature review explores the current understanding of water needs, water insecurity (WI), and their effects on human biology from a biocultural perspective.Human water needs and hydration strategies have been extensively studied in recent years. Sawka et al. (2005) conducted a comprehensive review of water requirements for humans, emphasizing the importance of maintaining proper hydration for optimal physical and cognitive performance. Their findings highlight the variability in individual water needs based on factors such as climate, physical activity, and diet. Building on this, Perrier et al. (2021) investigated the role of thirst in regulating water intake, demonstrating that while thirst is a primary driver of fluid consumption, cultural and environmental factors also significantly influence hydration behaviors.The concept of water insecurity (WI) has gained increasing attention in recent years, with researchers exploring its multifaceted impacts on human health and well-being. Wutich et al. (2017) provided a critical analysis of WI experiences across different cultural contexts, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced understanding of how WI affects various populations. Their work highlights the importance of considering both physical and psychosocial dimensions of WI when assessing its impact on human biology.Coping strategies employed to mitigate WI have been shown to have significant implications for human health. Rosinger (2018) examined the relationship between WI coping strategies and nutritional outcomes, finding that households experiencing WI often prioritize water for drinking over other uses, potentially compromising hygiene and food preparation practices. This study underscores the complex interplay between WI, coping mechanisms, and nutritional status.The embodiment framework provides a valuable lens through which to understand how WI experiences and coping strategies affect human biology. Brewis et al. (2019) applied this framework to explore the physiological and psychological manifestations of WI, demonstrating how chronic exposure to WI can lead to cellular damage, increased stress, and compromised mental health. Their findings emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the multifaceted impacts of WI on human biology.Dehydration, a common consequence of inadequate water intake or WI, has been linked to various adverse health outcomes. Popkin et al. (2010) reviewed the effects of hydration status on health and disease, highlighting the potential risks of chronic mild dehydration on cognitive function, mood, and physical performance. Their work underscores the importance of maintaining proper hydration for overall well-being and disease prevention.The impact of WI on cardiometabolic health has also been a focus of recent research. Rosinger et al. (2020) investigated the association between household water insecurity and blood pressure, finding that individuals living in water-insecure households had higher odds of elevated blood pressure. This study provides evidence for the potential long-term health consequences of chronic WI exposure.Climate change presents a significant challenge to water security and human health. Ebi and Bowen (2016) examined the potential impacts of climate change on water-related health risks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies to mitigate the effects of water scarcity and quality issues on human populations. Their work emphasizes the importance of considering climate change in discussions of water needs and WI.As our understanding of the complex relationships between water, human biology, and the environment continues to evolve, it is clear that an integrative approach is essential for addressing the challenges posed by WI and changing water needs. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive interventions that address both the physical and psychosocial dimensions of WI while considering the broader environmental and cultural contexts in which these issues occur.In conclusion, this literature review highlights the intricate connections between water needs, WI, and human biology. By adopting a biocultural perspective and utilizing the embodiment framework, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how water-related issues affect human health and well-being. As global water challenges continue to evolve, interdisciplinary approaches will be crucial for developing effective strategies to ensure water security and promote optimal human health in the face of environmental and cultural changes.", "References": [{"title": "Impact of water intake on energy intake and weight status: a systematic review", "authors": "Popkin, Barry M. and D'Anci, Kristen E. and Rosenberg, Irwin H.", "journal": "Nutrition Reviews", "year": "2010", "volumes": "68", "first page": "439", "last page": "458", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00311.x"}, {"title": "Human water needs", "authors": "Sawka, Michael N. and Cheuvront, Samuel N. and Carter, Robert", "journal": "Nutrition Reviews", "year": "2005", "volumes": "63", "first page": "S30", "last page": "S39", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1753-4887.2005.tb00152.x"}, {"title": "Household water insecurity and its association with food insecurity and mental health in rural Uganda", "authors": "Brewis, Alexandra and Workman, Cassandra and Wutich, Amber and Jepson, Wendy and Young, Sera", "journal": "Global Public Health", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "1623", "last page": "1635", "DOI": "10.1080/17441692.2019.1616798"}, {"title": "Household water insecurity is associated with a range of negative consequences among pregnant Kenyan women of mixed HIV status", "authors": "Rosinger, Asher Y.", "journal": "Ecology of Food and Nutrition", "year": "2018", "volumes": "57", "first page": "405", "last page": "427", "DOI": "10.1080/03670244.2018.1469667"}, {"title": "Climate change and health: impacts, risks, adaptation, and mitigation", "authors": "Ebi, Kristie L. and Bowen, Kathryn", "journal": "Annual Review of Public Health", "year": "2016", "volumes": "37", "first page": "315", "last page": "335", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032315-021740"}, {"title": "Advancing methods for research on household water insecurity: Studying entitlements and capabilities, socio-cultural dynamics, and political processes, institutions and governance", "authors": "Wutich, Amber and Budds, Jessica and Eichelberger, Laura and Geere, Jo and Harris, Leila M. and Horney, Jennifer A. and Jepson, Wendy and Norman, Emma and O'Reilly, Kathleen and Pearson, Amber L.", "journal": "Water Security", "year": "2017", "volumes": "2", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.wasec.2017.06.001"}, {"title": "Household water insecurity is associated with higher blood pressure in rural Uganda", "authors": "Rosinger, Asher Y. and Brewis, Alexandra and Wutich, Amber and Jepson, Wendy and Staddon, Chad and Stoler, Justin and Young, Sera L.", "journal": "Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "112", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.2166/washdev.2019.265"}, {"title": "Thirst and hydration: Physiology and consequences of dysfunction", "authors": "Perrier, Erica T. and Armstrong, Lawrence E. and Daudon, Michel and Kavouras, Stavros and Lafontan, Max and Lang, Florian and Péronnet, François and Stookey, Jodi D. and Tack, Ivan and Klein, Alexis", "journal": "Physiology & Behavior", "year": "2021", "volumes": "227", "first page": "113134", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.113134"}, {"title": "Water, Hydration and Health", "authors": "Popkin, Barry M. and D'Anci, Kristen E. and Rosenberg, Irwin H.", "journal": "Nutrition Reviews", "year": "2010", "volumes": "68", "first page": "439", "last page": "458", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00304.x"}, {"title": "Household water insecurity will complicate the ongoing COVID-19 response: Evidence from 29 sites in 23 low- and middle-income countries", "authors": "Stoler, Justin and Jepson, Wendy E. and Wutich, Amber and Brewis, Alexandra and Young, Sera L. and Rosinger, Asher Y. and Staddon, Chad and Adams, Ellis A.", "journal": "International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "234", "first page": "113715", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113715"}]}
