{"Literature Review": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, thriving in nutrient-poor waters through efficient material retention and recycling. Central to this remarkable ecosystem function is the intricate interplay between microorganisms and dissolved organic matter (DOM), which serves as an invisible currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. This literature review explores the pivotal role of microbial processes in facilitating the persistence and stability of coral reefs, with a focus on DOM transformation and recycling.The composition of microbial communities in coral reefs is highly diverse and dynamic. Wegley et al. (2007) conducted a metagenomic analysis of coral-associated microbes, revealing a complex assemblage of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. This microbial diversity is crucial for maintaining reef health and function, as different microbial groups perform specialized roles in nutrient cycling and organic matter processing.DOM in coral reefs originates from various sources, including coral mucus, algal exudates, and terrestrial inputs. Nelson et al. (2013) characterized the chemical composition of coral-derived DOM, finding it to be rich in proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. This organic matter serves as a vital energy source for reef microorganisms and plays a key role in biogeochemical cycling.The spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial DOM processing in reef habitats are complex and vary across different reef zones. Wild et al. (2004) demonstrated that coral mucus released into the water column is rapidly colonized by microorganisms, forming mucus aggregates that sink to the reef floor. These aggregates serve as hotspots of microbial activity, facilitating the recycling of organic matter and nutrients within the reef ecosystem.Microbial decomposition of DOM is a critical process in reef ecosystems, releasing essential nutrients for primary producers. Haas et al. (2011) investigated the degradation of coral- and algal-derived DOM by reef microbes, finding that microbial communities rapidly consume labile DOM components, leaving behind more recalcitrant forms. This selective consumption shapes the composition of the DOM pool and influences nutrient availability in the reef environment.The accretion of reef structure is intimately linked to microbial processes. Rohwer et al. (2002) identified diverse microbial communities associated with coral skeletons, suggesting that these microorganisms play a role in calcium carbonate precipitation and reef formation. Furthermore, microbial biofilms on reef surfaces contribute to the cementation of reef framework, enhancing structural complexity and stability.Trophic transfer in coral reefs is facilitated by microbial processing of DOM. Rix et al. (2017) demonstrated that sponges, key players in reef nutrient cycling, rely on their associated microbes to assimilate DOM and transfer it to higher trophic levels. This microbial-mediated trophic pathway represents a significant flux of energy and nutrients in reef ecosystems.Macronutrient recycling, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, is largely driven by microbial processes in coral reefs. Rädecker et al. (2015) elucidated the role of coral-associated microbes in nitrogen fixation, providing an important source of bioavailable nitrogen in nutrient-limited reef environments. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2018) investigated microbial phosphorus cycling in coral reefs, highlighting the importance of microbial enzymes in releasing bioavailable phosphorus from organic compounds.The resilience of coral reefs to global change is intricately linked to microbial-DOM interactions. However, widespread habitat degradation is altering these crucial processes. Haas et al. (2016) found that algal dominance in degraded reefs leads to increased labile DOM production, favoring fast-growing, potentially pathogenic bacteria. This shift in microbial community composition can create feedbacks that further reduce reef resilience.Climate change-induced ocean warming and acidification also impact microbial-DOM dynamics in coral reefs. Tout et al. (2015) observed alterations in coral-associated microbial communities under elevated temperature and pCO2 conditions, potentially affecting their capacity to process DOM and recycle nutrients efficiently.In conclusion, microbial interactions with DOM are central to coral reef ecosystem function and resilience. These processes underpin the high productivity, balanced metabolism, and nutrient retention that characterize healthy reef systems. As coral reefs face unprecedented threats from global change, understanding and preserving these crucial microbial-DOM interactions will be essential for developing effective conservation strategies and ensuring the long-term persistence of these invaluable ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community associated with the coral Porites astreoides", "authors": "Linda Wegley, Ross Edwards, Beltran Rodriguez-Brito, Hong Liu, Forest Rohwer", "journal": "Environmental Microbiology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "9", "first page": "2707", "last page": "2719", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01383.x"}, {"title": "Coral and macroalgal exudates vary in neutral sugar composition and differentially enrich reef bacterioplankton lineages", "authors": "Craig E.
