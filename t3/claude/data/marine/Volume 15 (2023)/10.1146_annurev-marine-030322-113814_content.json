{"Literature Review": "The global fishing industry plays a crucial role in providing food security for millions of people worldwide. However, the impact of fishing activities on marine and freshwater ecosystems has become a growing concern in recent decades. This literature review examines the current state of global fisheries science, focusing on the documentation of human impacts on oceans and the role of civil society in addressing these challenges.Fishing activities have been shown to have significant negative impacts on marine biodiversity. Worm et al. (2006) reported that the loss of marine biodiversity is impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations. The study highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive, ecosystem-based management of marine resources to prevent further degradation of ocean ecosystems.One of the major challenges in addressing the impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems is the lack of accurate and comprehensive data. Official fisheries statistics, such as those provided to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) by member countries, often underestimate the true extent of fishing activities, particularly in small-scale fisheries. Pauly and Zeller (2016) conducted a catch reconstruction study that revealed global catches between 1950 and 2010 were 50% higher than those reported to FAO, emphasizing the importance of including small-scale fisheries and discards in global catch estimates.The Sea Around Us project, initiated by Daniel Pauly and colleagues, has emerged as a crucial resource for addressing this data gap. The project aims to provide comprehensive and freely accessible fisheries data to civil society, researchers, and policymakers. Zeller et al. (2016) described the methodology used by the Sea Around Us to reconstruct catch data, which involves a thorough review of published and unpublished data sources, interviews with local experts, and the application of conservative assumptions to fill data gaps.The importance of including small-scale fisheries in global assessments cannot be overstated. Teh and Sumaila (2013) estimated that small-scale fisheries employ over 90% of the world's capture fishers and fish workers, highlighting their significant contribution to global food security and livelihoods. However, these fisheries are often overlooked in official statistics and management policies.The impact of industrial fishing on marine ecosystems has been well-documented in recent years. Kroodsma et al. (2018) used satellite technology to track the global footprint of fisheries, revealing that industrial fishing covers at least 55% of the ocean's surface – an area four times larger than that covered by agriculture. This extensive reach of industrial fishing has significant implications for marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.The availability of comprehensive fisheries data through platforms like the Sea Around Us has enabled researchers to develop and apply various indicators to assess the state of marine ecosystems. Kleisner et al. (2013) introduced the Marine Trophic Index (MTI) and Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index as tools for evaluating the ecological impacts of fishing. These indicators have since been widely used to assess changes in marine food webs and fishing practices over time.The role of civil society in addressing the challenges facing global fisheries has gained increasing recognition. Jentoft and Chuenpagdee (2009) argued that the involvement of civil society organizations is crucial for effective fisheries governance, as they can bridge the gap between local communities and policymakers, and advocate for more sustainable fishing practices.The open access nature of the Sea Around Us database has facilitated numerous studies on the state of global fisheries. For instance, Cashion et al. (2018) used this data to assess the global extent of fisheries subsidies and their impact on overfishing. Their findings highlighted the need for policy reforms to reduce harmful subsidies and promote sustainable fishing practices.As we move further into the 21st century, the importance of accurate and comprehensive fisheries data in informing policy decisions cannot be overstated. Pikitch (2018) emphasized the need for ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches that consider the broader impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems. Such approaches rely heavily on the availability of high-quality data and indicators, as provided by initiatives like the Sea Around Us.In conclusion, the documentation of human impacts on oceans through global fisheries science has made significant strides in recent years. The Sea Around Us project, by providing reconstructed catch data and derived indicators, has played a crucial role in serving civil society and informing policy decisions. As we face increasing challenges related to overfishing, climate change, and marine biodiversity loss, the continued development and dissemination of comprehensive fisheries data will be essential for ensuring the sustainable management of our oceans in the 21st century.", "References": [{"title": "Impacts of biodiversity loss on ocean ecosystem services", "authors": "Boris Worm, Edward B.
