{"Literature Review": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) has been a subject of intense research in climate science due to its significant impact on global climate patterns and its potential for improving long-term climate predictions. This literature review synthesizes current understanding of the modes and mechanisms of PDV, focusing on the dynamical processes that drive its evolution and the complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere.Traditionally, PDV has been characterized by statistical patterns of variance, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Newman et al. (2016) provided a comprehensive review of these patterns, highlighting their importance in describing large-scale climate variability in the Pacific basin. However, these statistical patterns do not fully capture the underlying dynamical processes that drive PDV.Recent studies have emphasized the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in shaping PDV. Di Lorenzo et al. (2015) proposed that PDV results from the integration of atmospheric forcing by the ocean, leading to a reddening of the climate spectrum. This integration process involves both shifts in the mean atmospheric circulation and changes in its strength, which are then reflected in oceanic patterns of variability.The concept of dynamical modes has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding PDV mechanisms. Lyu et al. (2017) identified two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes that contribute to PDV: the North Pacific–central Pacific (NP-CP) mode and the Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) mode. These modes capture different aspects of PDV and operate on different timescales, providing a more nuanced understanding of the variability.The NP-CP mode is associated with interannual to decadal-scale variability and is closely linked to tropical-extratropical teleconnections. Chiang and Vimont (2004) described the Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM), which plays a crucial role in connecting tropical and extratropical variability. The PMM has been shown to influence the development of El Niño events and contribute to PDV through its impact on tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs).On the other hand, the KOE mode is more closely associated with decadal to multidecadal variability and involves complex interactions between the Kuroshio Extension and the broader North Pacific circulation. Qiu et al. (2007) demonstrated the importance of the KOE region in modulating PDV through its influence on heat content anomalies and their subsequent propagation throughout the basin.The role of tropical-extratropical teleconnections in energizing and synchronizing PDV has been a focus of recent research. Alexander et al. (2010) showed how atmospheric bridges can transmit tropical Pacific SST anomalies to the extratropics, influencing mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and ocean heat content. These teleconnections operate in both directions, with extratropical processes also capable of influencing tropical variability.The South Pacific has been increasingly recognized as an important contributor to basin-scale PDV. Okumura (2013) demonstrated that South Pacific atmospheric variability can influence tropical Pacific SSTs through wind-driven ocean processes, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive, basin-wide approach to understanding PDV.El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a crucial role in PDV, acting as both a driver and a response to decadal-scale variability. Newman et al. (2003) proposed that the PDO could be understood as a reddened response to both atmospheric noise and ENSO forcing. More recent work by Lyu and Yu (2021) has further elucidated the complex relationships between ENSO and PDV, showing how different ENSO flavors can contribute to distinct patterns of decadal variability.The potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on PDV have also been a subject of recent investigation. Furtado et al. (2020) examined how global warming might alter the spatial and temporal characteristics of PDV, suggesting that changes in the mean state of the Pacific could lead to shifts in the dominant modes of variability.In conclusion, our understanding of PDV has evolved from simple statistical descriptions to a more nuanced view that incorporates complex dynamical processes and teleconnections. The identification of fundamental dynamical modes, such as the NP-CP and KOE modes, has provided new insights into the mechanisms driving PDV. Future research will likely focus on further elucidating these mechanisms, improving their representation in climate models, and exploring the potential impacts of climate change on PDV. As our understanding of PDV continues to grow, so too does the potential for improved long-term climate predictions and more effective climate change adaptation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Characteristics of and Mechanisms for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in a Set of Coupled Climate Models", "authors": "Matthew Newman, Michael A.
