{"Literature Review": "The Quaternary Period, spanning the last 2.6 million years, has been characterized by dramatic climate fluctuations and sea-level changes that have significantly impacted the global carbon cycle. One crucial aspect of this cycle is the burial of marine carbonates, which plays a vital role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels and ocean chemistry. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on global Quaternary carbonate burial, focusing on proxy- and model-based reconstructions and the persisting uncertainties in this field. Marine carbonate burial is a key component of the global carbon cycle, acting as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2 and influencing ocean alkalinity. During the Quaternary, glacial-interglacial cycles have led to substantial variations in sea level, exposing and flooding large areas of continental shelves where carbonate accumulation occurs. These changes have likely had significant impacts on the global carbonate budget and, consequently, on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Proxy-based reconstructions of carbonate burial have been instrumental in understanding past variations in the carbon cycle. One widely used proxy is the carbonate content of deep-sea sediments, which can be measured through various techniques such as coulometry or loss on ignition. Farrell and Prell demonstrated that carbonate preservation in the equatorial Pacific varied significantly between glacial and interglacial periods, suggesting changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry and burial rates. Another important proxy is the stable isotope composition of carbonate-forming elements. The stable carbon isotope (δ13C) record from benthic foraminifera has been used to infer changes in the global carbon cycle, including carbonate burial rates. More recently, the stable strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) system has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing carbonate burial fluxes. Krabbenhöft et al. showed that variations in seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios could be used to estimate changes in the global carbonate burial flux over glacial-interglacial timescales. The stable calcium isotope (δ44Ca) system has also gained attention as a potential proxy for carbonate burial. Fantle and DePaolo demonstrated that seawater δ44Ca values are sensitive to changes in the balance between carbonate weathering and burial. This proxy has the potential to provide continuous records of global carbonate burial, addressing some of the limitations of other proxies. Model-based approaches have complemented proxy-based reconstructions in understanding Quaternary carbonate burial. Ridgwell and Hargreaves used an Earth system model to simulate changes in carbonate burial during glacial-interglacial cycles, highlighting the importance of shelf-basin carbonate burial redistribution. Their results suggested that changes in shallow water carbonate deposition could account for a significant portion of glacial-interglacial CO2 variations. More recently, Wallmann et al. developed a model that couples carbonate burial with sea-level changes and continental weathering. Their simulations indicated that carbonate burial on continental shelves decreased significantly during glacial periods, leading to increased deep-sea carbonate preservation and changes in ocean alkalinity. Despite these advances, significant uncertainties persist in our understanding of Quaternary carbonate burial. One major challenge is reconciling the various proxy records, which often show discrepancies in the magnitude and timing of changes in carbonate burial. For example, Sigman and Boyle noted that while some proxies suggest increased carbonate preservation during glacial periods, others indicate decreased preservation. Another source of uncertainty is the spatial heterogeneity of carbonate burial. Most proxy records come from deep-sea sediments, which may not accurately represent global trends. The contribution of shallow water carbonate deposition, particularly on continental shelves, remains poorly constrained due to the difficulty in accessing these records. The role of organic carbon burial in modulating carbonate burial rates is another area of ongoing research. Cartapanis et al. suggested that changes in organic carbon burial could significantly impact carbonate compensation depth and, consequently, carbonate preservation patterns. Future research directions should focus on developing and refining proxies that can provide continuous, global records of carbonate burial. The integration of multiple proxy systems, such as combining Sr and Ca isotope records, may offer more robust reconstructions. Additionally, improved spatial coverage of proxy records, particularly from shallow water environments, is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of global carbonate burial patterns. Advancements in Earth system modeling, including the incorporation of spatially resolved carbonate burial processes and improved representations of shelf-basin interactions, will be essential for reconciling proxy records and understanding the mechanisms driving changes in carbonate burial over glacial-interglacial cycles. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial through proxy- and model-based approaches, important uncertainties remain. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for improving our understanding of the feedbacks between the carbon cycle, ocean chemistry, and climate during the Quaternary and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Ocean carbonate chemistry and climate change: Recent findings and future challenges", "authors": "Andy Ridgwell, Richard E.
