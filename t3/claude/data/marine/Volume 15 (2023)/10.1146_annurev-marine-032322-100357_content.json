{"Literature Review": "Gender equity in oceanography has been a topic of increasing importance in recent years, as the field strives to create a more inclusive and diverse workforce. This literature review examines the historical context, current status, and ongoing efforts to achieve gender equity in oceanography.Historically, women faced significant barriers to participation in oceanography. Orcutt and Cetinic (2014) describe how early oceanographic expeditions were predominantly male-dominated, with women often excluded from shipboard research. This exclusion was rooted in societal norms and institutional policies that limited women's access to education and professional opportunities in science. Kappel and Thompson (2014) note that even as women began to enter the field in greater numbers during the mid-20th century, they often faced discrimination and harassment, which hindered their career progression.In recent decades, there has been a concerted effort to increase gender diversity in oceanography. Clem et al. (2014) report that women now receive approximately half of the oceanography PhDs in many parts of the world, indicating progress at the early career stage. However, Macdonald et al. (2016) find that this parity does not extend to more senior positions, with women still underrepresented in tenured faculty roles and leadership positions within oceanographic institutions.The current status of gender equity in oceanography can be assessed through various quantitative measures. Conley and Stadmark (2012) analyzed authorship patterns in oceanographic journals and found that while the proportion of female first authors has increased over time, it still lags behind the proportion of women in the field. Similarly, Dutt et al. (2016) examined conference presentations and found that women were underrepresented as invited speakers at major oceanography conferences, particularly in more prestigious speaking slots.Funding and recognition are critical aspects of career advancement in oceanography. Shen (2013) investigated grant funding patterns and discovered that female principal investigators were less likely to receive large grants compared to their male counterparts, even when controlling for career stage and publication record. In terms of recognition, Holmes et al. (2015) analyzed awards and honors in oceanography and found that women were underrepresented among recipients, especially for more prestigious awards.Efforts to improve gender equity in oceanography have taken various forms. Mentoring programs have been identified as a crucial tool for supporting women in the field. Steinberg et al. (2019) describe the success of formal mentoring initiatives in increasing the retention and advancement of women in oceanography. Additionally, Bernard and Cooperdock (2018) highlight the importance of role models and suggest that increasing the visibility of successful women in oceanography can inspire and support the next generation of female scientists.Addressing unconscious bias has been another focus of gender equity efforts. Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) demonstrate that both male and female faculty members exhibit biases against female job candidates in academic science, including oceanography. In response, many institutions have implemented bias training programs, although their effectiveness remains a subject of debate (Devine et al., 2017).Structural changes to improve work-life balance have also been proposed as a means to promote gender equity. Cech and Blair-Loy (2019) argue that policies supporting parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and childcare assistance are essential for retaining women in oceanography, particularly given the field's demands for extended fieldwork and travel.Despite these efforts, challenges remain. Sexual harassment and hostile work environments continue to be significant issues in oceanography, as in other scientific fields. Clancy et al. (2014) report high rates of harassment experienced by women during fieldwork, highlighting the need for stronger policies and cultural changes to ensure safe and inclusive work environments.Looking forward, recommendations for improving gender equity in oceanography include reexamining selection and evaluation procedures to minimize bias, addressing structural inequities, and fostering a more inclusive culture. Grogan (2019) emphasizes the importance of engaging the entire oceanographic community in these efforts, arguing that gender equity benefits not only women but the field as a whole by promoting diversity of thought and maximizing talent utilization.In conclusion, while progress has been made toward gender equity in oceanography, significant work remains to be done. Continued research, policy changes, and community engagement are necessary to create an environment where oceanographers of all genders can thrive and contribute to the advancement of the field.", "References": [{"title": "Women in Oceanography: A Decade Later", "authors": "Beth N.
