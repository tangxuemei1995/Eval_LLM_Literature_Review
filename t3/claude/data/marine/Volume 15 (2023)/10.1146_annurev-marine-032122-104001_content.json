{"Literature Review": "Nitrogen isotopes preserved in fossil biominerals have emerged as a powerful tool for reconstructing past marine nitrogen cycling and its implications for ocean biogeochemistry, climate, and biodiversity. This literature review focuses on the insights gained from fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes in diatoms, foraminifera, and corals, highlighting their utility in understanding anthropogenic impacts, glacial-interglacial changes, and CO2 drawdown mechanisms.The marine nitrogen cycle plays a crucial role in regulating primary productivity and, consequently, atmospheric CO2 levels. Sigman et al. (2009) emphasized the importance of understanding past nitrogen cycling to predict future climate changes. The development of methods to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen has significantly advanced our ability to reconstruct past nitrogen dynamics (Ren et al., 2009).Diatoms, siliceous phytoplankton with excellent fossil preservation, have proven to be valuable archives of past nitrogen cycling. Studer et al. (2015) demonstrated that diatom-bound nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) in Southern Ocean sediments reflect changes in nitrate utilization, providing insights into glacial-interglacial CO2 drawdown mechanisms. Their study revealed enhanced nitrate consumption during glacial periods, suggesting increased efficiency of the biological pump.Foraminifera, ubiquitous marine protists with calcite shells, offer another important proxy for nitrogen isotope reconstructions. Ren et al. (2012) developed a method to measure δ15N in planktonic foraminifera, enabling high-resolution records of surface ocean nitrogen cycling. This approach has been particularly useful in reconstructing anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to coastal waters. Ren et al. (2017) used foraminiferal δ15N to document a century-long increase in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition in the South China Sea, highlighting the utility of this proxy in assessing human impacts on marine ecosystems.Coral skeletons provide a unique archive of nitrogen isotopes, offering high-resolution records spanning decades to centuries. Wang et al. (2016) demonstrated that δ15N in coral skeletal organic matter reflects changes in the nitrogen sources utilized by coral symbionts and food particles consumed by the coral host. This proxy has been particularly valuable in reconstructing anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to coral reef ecosystems. Yamazaki et al. (2011) used coral δ15N records to trace the impact of land-based pollution on coastal waters in Guam, providing evidence for increased terrestrial runoff and sewage inputs over the past century.The combination of these different fossil-bound nitrogen isotope proxies has enabled more comprehensive reconstructions of past nitrogen cycling. Galbraith et al. (2013) synthesized diatom and foraminifera δ15N records to assess changes in the global marine nitrogen inventory across glacial-interglacial cycles. Their study suggested that the marine nitrogen inventory was larger during glacial periods, potentially contributing to lower atmospheric CO2 levels.Recent methodological advances have further expanded the utility of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes. Martínez-García et al. (2014) developed a method to isolate and measure δ15N in specific diatom species, allowing for more precise reconstructions of surface nitrate utilization. This approach has been particularly valuable in resolving conflicting interpretations of bulk sediment δ15N records.While fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes have provided valuable insights, challenges remain in interpreting these proxies. Robinson et al. (2012) highlighted the importance of considering species-specific fractionation effects and potential diagenetic alterations when interpreting δ15N records. Additionally, Straub et al. (2013) demonstrated that changes in phytoplankton community composition could influence bulk sediment δ15N signals, emphasizing the need for species-specific approaches.Future directions in fossil-bound nitrogen isotope research include expanding method development to other fossil types, characterizing ecological and physiological variations in nitrogen isotope fractionation, and exploring extended timescales. Wang et al. (2019) recently developed a method to measure δ15N in fish teeth, opening up new possibilities for reconstructing nitrogen cycling in ancient oceans. Additionally, efforts to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history are ongoing, with potential applications to understanding nitrogen cycling during major climate transitions and extinction events.In conclusion, fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes in diatoms, foraminifera, and corals have provided crucial insights into past marine nitrogen cycling, anthropogenic impacts, and climate-driven changes in ocean biogeochemistry. As analytical techniques continue to improve and our understanding of nitrogen isotope systematics deepens, these proxies will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in unraveling the complex interactions between the nitrogen cycle, climate, and marine ecosystems throughout Earth's history.", "References": [{"title": "The influence of Antarctic subpolar gyres on glacial nitrogen and silicon cycling", "authors": "Sigman, Daniel M. and Hain, Mathis P. and Haug, Gerald H.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2009", "volumes": "459", "first page": "49", "last page": "54", "DOI": "10.1038/nature08066"}, {"title": "Nitrogen isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera from the modern ocean and recent sediments", "authors": "Ren, Haojia and Sigman, Daniel M. and Meckler, A.
