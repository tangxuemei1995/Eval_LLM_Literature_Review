{"Literature Review": "Tidal marshes and mangroves have gained increasing attention as nature-based solutions for coastal storm mitigation in recent years. As climate change continues to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of coastal storms, these ecosystems offer potential benefits in reducing flooding and erosion hazards. However, the effectiveness of these natural buffers is not uniform across all storm conditions and coastal landscapes, necessitating a nuanced understanding of their capabilities and limitations.Tidal wetlands have demonstrated significant capacity in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves. Möller et al. (2014) conducted a large-scale flume experiment that showed salt marshes can reduce wave heights by up to 60% over a 40-meter distance, even under extreme storm conditions. This wave attenuation is primarily attributed to the drag forces exerted by vegetation and the shallow water depths typical of these environments. Similarly, Horstman et al. (2014) found that mangrove forests can reduce wave heights by 31-46% over a 100-meter distance, with the complex root systems and dense canopies playing a crucial role in energy dissipation.However, the effectiveness of tidal wetlands in mitigating long-period storm surges is less pronounced and more variable. Wamsley et al. (2010) used numerical modeling to demonstrate that surge reduction by wetlands is highly dependent on storm characteristics, wetland properties, and coastal landscape geometry. In some cases, wetlands may even amplify surge levels due to channeling effects. This variability highlights the importance of site-specific assessments when considering wetlands for coastal defense.The role of tidal wetlands in limiting erosion is generally positive, but not without complexities. Gedan et al. (2011) reviewed multiple studies showing that salt marshes can significantly reduce erosion rates compared to unvegetated shorelines. However, the effectiveness can vary depending on factors such as sediment supply, wave energy, and vegetation characteristics. For mangroves, Alongi (2008) noted their ability to trap sediments and stabilize shorelines, but also emphasized that extreme events can cause substantial damage to mangrove forests.The recovery of wetland vegetation following storm damage is a critical factor in long-term coastal protection. Imbert (2018) studied mangrove recovery after major hurricanes in the Caribbean and found that while some species showed rapid regrowth, others took several years to recover, with some areas experiencing permanent changes in forest structure. This highlights the importance of considering species composition and resilience when evaluating the long-term protective capacity of mangrove forests.Climate change poses additional challenges to the persistence of tidal wetlands as coastal buffers. Kirwan and Megonigal (2013) reviewed the complex interactions between sea-level rise, vegetation growth, and sediment accretion in tidal marshes. They found that while some marshes may keep pace with moderate rates of sea-level rise, accelerated rates could lead to widespread marsh drowning. Similarly, Ward et al. (2016) highlighted the vulnerability of mangroves to sea-level rise, particularly in areas with limited sediment supply or constrained by coastal development.Human disturbances further complicate the role of tidal wetlands in coastal protection. Barbier et al. (2011) emphasized that human activities such as land reclamation, pollution, and altered hydrology can significantly degrade wetland ecosystems, reducing their capacity to provide storm protection services. This underscores the need for integrated coastal management approaches that consider both ecological and socio-economic factors.Given these uncertainties and complexities, nature-based coastal defense projects incorporating tidal wetlands require careful planning and adaptive management strategies. Temmerman et al. (2013) proposed a framework for integrating ecosystem-based approaches with traditional engineering solutions, emphasizing the need for long-term monitoring and flexibility in management practices. This approach allows for adjustments based on observed ecosystem responses and changing environmental conditions.In conclusion, while tidal marshes and mangroves offer significant potential as nature-based coastal storm buffers, their effectiveness is context-dependent and subject to various limitations. Short-period wave attenuation is generally robust, but storm surge mitigation is more variable and less reliable. Erosion control benefits are substantial but can be compromised by extreme events. Long-term persistence of these ecosystems faces challenges from climate change and human disturbances. As such, the integration of tidal wetlands into coastal defense strategies requires a nuanced, site-specific approach that acknowledges both their strengths and limitations. Adaptive management strategies, combining ecological restoration with traditional engineering where necessary, offer a promising path forward in harnessing the protective capacity of these valuable coastal ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Wave attenuation over coastal salt marshes under storm surge conditions", "authors": "Iris Möller, Matthias Kudella, Franziska Rupprecht, Tom Spencer, Maike Paul, Bregje K. van Wesenbeeck, Guido Wolters, Kai Jensen, Tjeerd J.
