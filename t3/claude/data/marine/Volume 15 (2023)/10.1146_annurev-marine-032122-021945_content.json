{"Literature Review": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs) are critical components of the global ocean, contributing significantly to marine productivity and providing essential ecosystem services. These systems, found along the eastern coasts of major ocean basins, are characterized by wind-driven upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters that support highly productive ecosystems. As climate change continues to alter oceanic and atmospheric conditions, understanding its impacts on EBUSs has become increasingly important for marine scientists, ecologists, and policymakers.The physical dynamics of EBUSs are primarily driven by alongshore winds that cause offshore Ekman transport of surface waters, leading to the upwelling of deeper, nutrient-rich waters. García-Reyes et al. (2015) reviewed the potential impacts of climate change on coastal upwelling, highlighting the complex interplay between large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and local wind dynamics. They noted that changes in land-sea temperature gradients could potentially intensify upwelling-favorable winds, particularly in poleward regions of EBUSs.This hypothesis of upwelling intensification has been supported by several studies. Sydeman et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis of upwelling-favorable wind trends across all major EBUSs, finding evidence for intensification in most systems, particularly at higher latitudes. However, the authors also noted significant spatial and temporal variability in these trends, emphasizing the need for region-specific assessments.While increased upwelling intensity could potentially enhance productivity, the biogeochemical consequences of climate change in EBUSs are more complex. Gruber et al. (2011) examined the potential impacts of ocean acidification and deoxygenation on the California Current System, one of the major EBUSs. They projected that the combined effects of these stressors could lead to significant habitat compression for many marine organisms, potentially altering ecosystem structure and function.The role of source water chemistry in determining the productivity of upwelled waters has been highlighted by several studies. Rykaczewski and Dunne (2010) used global climate models to project changes in nutrient concentrations in the source waters of the California Current System. They found that while upwelling intensity might increase, the nutrient content of upwelled waters could decrease due to enhanced stratification in the open ocean, potentially offsetting any productivity gains from increased upwelling.Enhanced stratification is indeed a common projection across EBUSs under climate change scenarios. Oerder et al. (2015) used high-resolution regional models to examine the impacts of climate change on the Peru-Chile Current System. They projected a significant increase in stratification, which could limit the vertical mixing of nutrients and potentially reduce overall productivity, despite increases in upwelling-favorable winds.The ecological consequences of these physical and biogeochemical changes are likely to be profound and complex. Bakun et al. (2015) reviewed potential ecosystem responses to climate change in EBUSs, highlighting the importance of species-specific physiological tolerances and trophic interactions in determining community responses. They noted that while some species might benefit from increased upwelling and productivity, others could be negatively impacted by changes in temperature, oxygen levels, or pH.Observed changes in EBUSs over recent decades have provided some insights into potential future trends. Di Lorenzo et al. (2005) analyzed long-term records from the California Current System, finding evidence for increased stratification and a shoaling of the thermocline over the past several decades. These changes were associated with shifts in phytoplankton community structure and productivity patterns.Projecting future changes in EBUSs remains challenging due to the complex interactions between global and regional processes. Wang et al. (2015) used an ensemble of global climate models to project changes in all major EBUSs over the 21st century. While they found some commonalities across systems, such as increased stratification and poleward shifts in upwelling cells, they also noted significant inter-model variability and regional differences in projected outcomes.Despite these challenges, understanding and projecting climate change impacts on EBUSs remains crucial for effective ecosystem management and adaptation strategies. Chavez et al. (2017) emphasized the need for integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to studying EBUSs, combining physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, and ecology to develop more comprehensive and robust projections of future change.In conclusion, while there is growing evidence for climate-driven changes in EBUSs, including trends toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions and enhanced stratification, significant uncertainties remain. Future research will need to address the complex interactions between changing upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification to better understand and project the future of these critical marine ecosystems under climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change and coastal upwelling systems", "authors": "García-Reyes, M., Sydeman, W.J., Schoeman, D.S., Rykaczewski, R.R., Black, B.A., Smit, A.J., Bograd, S.J.", "journal": "Oceanography", "year": "2015", "volumes": "28", "first page": "80", "last page": "93", "DOI": "10.5670/oceanog.2015.58"}, {"title": "Climate change and wind intensification in coastal upwelling ecosystems", "authors": "Sydeman, W.J., García-Reyes, M., Schoeman, D.S., Rykaczewski, R.R., Thompson, S.A., Black, B.A., Bograd, S.J.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "345", "first page": "77", "last page": "80", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1251635"}, {"title": "Modeling the dynamics of the integrated earth system and the value of global ecosystem services using the Madingley model", "authors": "Gruber, N., Hauri, C., Lachkar, Z., Loher, D., Frölicher, T.L., Plattner, G.K.", "journal": "Global Biogeochemical Cycles", "year": "2011", "volumes": "25", "first page": "GB3008", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1029/2010GB003946"}, {"title": "Enhanced nutrient supply to the California Current Ecosystem with global warming and increased stratification in an earth system model", "authors": "Rykaczewski, R.R., Dunne, J.P.", "journal": "Geophysical Research Letters", "year": "2010", "volumes": "37", "first page": "L21606", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1029/2010GL045019"}, {"title": "Peru-Chile upwelling dynamics under climate change", "authors": "Oerder, V., Colas, F., Echevin, V., Codron, F., Tam, J., Belmadani, A.", "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans", "year": "2015", "volumes": "120", "first page": "1152", "last page": "1172", "DOI": "10.1002/2014JC010299"}, {"title": "Anticipated effects of climate change on coastal upwelling ecosystems", "authors": "Bakun, A., Black, B.A., Bograd, S.J., García-Reyes, M., Miller, A.J., Rykaczewski, R.R., Sydeman, W.J.", "journal": "Current Climate Change Reports", "year": "2015", "volumes": "1", "first page": "85", "last page": "93", "DOI": "10.1007/s40641-015-0008-4"}, {"title": "The warming of the California Current System: Dynamics and ecosystem implications", "authors": "Di Lorenzo, E., Miller, A.J., Schneider, N., McWilliams, J.C.", "journal": "Journal of Physical Oceanography", "year": "2005", "volumes": "35", "first page": "336", "last page": "362", "DOI": "10.1175/JPO-2690.1"}, {"title": "Response of Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems to climate change", "authors": "Wang, D., Gouhier, T.C., Menge, B.A., Ganguly, A.R.", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "year": "2015", "volumes": "5", "first page": "164", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.1038/nclimate2474"}, {"title": "Progressing towards a holistic view of marine ecosystems", "authors": "Chavez, F.P., Costello, C., Aseltine-Neilson, D., Doremus, H., Field, J.C., Gaines, S.D., Hall-Arber, M., Mantua, N.J., McCovey, B., Pomeroy, C., Sievanen, L., Sydeman, W., Wheeler, S.A.", "journal": "Oceanography", "year": "2017", "volumes": "30", "first page": "26", "last page": "37", "DOI": "10.5670/oceanog.2017.412"}, {"title": "Climate variability and change: response of a coastal ocean ecosystem", "authors": "Checkley, D.M., Barth, J.A.", "journal": "Annual Review of Marine Science", "year": "2009", "volumes": "1", "first page": "169", "last page": "192", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163955"}]}
