{"Literature Review": "Gender differences in negotiation have long been recognized as a significant contributor to persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes, particularly in terms of pay and career advancement. This literature review examines various interventions aimed at reducing these differences and assesses their effectiveness in narrowing the gender pay gap.Early research in this field focused on the observation that women tend to negotiate less frequently and less assertively than men. Babcock and Laschever (2003) popularized this notion in their influential book, highlighting that women's reluctance to negotiate could account for a substantial portion of the gender pay gap. This perspective led to initial interventions focused on encouraging women to negotiate more like men, often through negotiation training programs.Bowles et al. (2007) conducted a series of experiments that revealed the complexities of gender differences in negotiation. They found that women face social costs when they initiate negotiations, particularly for compensation, which may explain their reluctance to do so. This research suggested that simply encouraging women to negotiate more might not be sufficient and could even be counterproductive.In response to these findings, researchers began to explore alternative approaches. Movius (2008) examined the effectiveness of negotiation training programs and found mixed results. While such programs can improve negotiation skills, they may not always translate into better outcomes for women in real-world settings, particularly when societal expectations and biases persist.A shift in focus occurred as researchers and policymakers began to consider interventions that alter the conditions of negotiation rather than attempting to change women's behavior. This approach aligns with the broader movement to 'fix the institutions' rather than 'fix the women.' Bohnet (2016) argues for the importance of designing systems and processes that reduce the impact of unconscious biases, rather than solely focusing on individual-level interventions.One such institutional intervention is the implementation of salary history bans. Agan et al. (2021) studied the effects of such bans in the United States and found that they led to increased pay for job changers, with larger gains for women and racial minorities. This suggests that preventing employers from anchoring on past salaries may help reduce persistent pay gaps.Another approach involves increasing wage transparency. Bennedsen et al. (2019) examined the impact of a 2006 Danish law requiring companies to report gender-disaggregated wage statistics. They found that the law reduced the gender pay gap, primarily by slowing men's wage growth rather than accelerating women's.Some organizations have taken more radical steps by banning salary negotiations altogether. Leibbrandt and List (2015) conducted a field experiment that found when salary negotiations were explicitly prohibited, the gender gap in job applications and salary expectations disappeared. However, they also noted potential drawbacks, such as reduced overall wages and the possibility of negotiations moving to other aspects of compensation.The effectiveness of these various interventions is still being debated. Mazei et al. (2015) conducted a meta-analysis of gender differences in negotiation outcomes and found that contextual factors, such as the availability of information about bargaining ranges, can significantly influence the magnitude of gender differences. This suggests that interventions targeting these contextual factors may be particularly effective.However, it is crucial to consider potential unintended consequences of these interventions. For instance, Goldin (2014) argues that the gender pay gap is largely due to differences in temporal flexibility and job characteristics rather than discrimination or negotiation differences. Therefore, interventions focused solely on negotiation may not address the root causes of pay disparities.In conclusion, the literature reveals a clear shift from interventions aimed at changing women's negotiation behavior to those that alter the conditions and structures of negotiation. While early efforts to encourage women to negotiate more assertively showed limited success, more recent institutional changes such as salary history bans and increased wage transparency appear promising. However, the complexity of the issue and the potential for unintended consequences underscore the need for continued research and careful implementation of any interventions aimed at reducing gender differences in negotiation and, ultimately, the gender pay gap.", "References": [{"title": "Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide", "authors": "Linda Babcock, Sara Laschever", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Social incentives for gender differences in the propensity to initiate negotiations: Sometimes it does hurt to ask", "authors": "Hannah Riley Bowles, Linda Babcock, Lei Lai", "journal": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "year": "2007", "volumes": "103", "first page": "84", "last page": "103", "DOI": "10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.001"}, {"title": "The effectiveness of negotiation training", "authors": "Hal Movius", "journal": "Negotiation Journal", "year": "2008", "volumes": "24", "first page": "509", "last page": "531", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1571-9979.2008.00201.x"}, {"title": "What Works: Gender Equality by Design", "authors": "Iris Bohnet", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Salary History Bans and Gender Discrimination", "authors": "Amanda Agan, Bo Cowgill, Laura Gee", "journal": "Journal of Labor Economics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1086/711391"}, {"title": "Do Firms Respond to Gender Pay Gap Transparency?", "authors": "Morten Bennedsen, Elena Simintzi, Margarita Tsoutsoura, Daniel Wolfenzon", "journal": "Journal of Finance", "year": "2019", "volumes": "74", "first page": "1", "last page": "43", "DOI": "10.1111/jofi.12745"}, {"title": "Do Women Avoid Salary Negotiations?
