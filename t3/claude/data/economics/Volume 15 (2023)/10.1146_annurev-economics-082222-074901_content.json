{"Literature Review": "The global financial landscape has undergone significant transformations over the past two decades, with non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) emerging as a dominant force in international capital flows, particularly to emerging markets (EMs). This shift has profound implications for global financial stability and the vulnerabilities of emerging economies. This literature review aims to synthesize current research on the role of NBFI in EM financing, its associated risks, and potential policy implications.The rise of NBFI, especially open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has been well-documented in recent literature. Goldstein et al. (2017) highlight that these investment vehicles now account for nearly half of the external financing flows to EMs, surpassing traditional cross-border lending by global banks. This trend reflects a broader shift in the global financial system, as noted by Claessens and Lewrick (2021), who emphasize the growing importance of market-based finance in both advanced and emerging economies.The increasing prominence of investment funds in EM financing has been associated with several potential benefits. Cerutti et al. (2019) argue that these flows enhance risk-sharing across borders and provide EMs with access to more diverse forms of financing. This diversification can potentially reduce reliance on any single source of external funding and contribute to financial deepening in recipient countries.However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the rise of NBFI also introduces new vulnerabilities to the global financial system, particularly for EMs. Fratzscher (2012) finds that investment funds are inherently more susceptible to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress. This vulnerability can lead to increased volatility in capital flows to EMs, potentially exacerbating economic instability during crisis periods.The procyclicality of investment fund flows to EMs during times of global stress has been a subject of particular concern in recent literature. Raddatz and Schmukler (2012) document that mutual funds tend to engage in momentum trading and contagion trading, amplifying shocks and potentially destabilizing asset prices in EMs. This behavior can lead to sudden stops or reversals in capital flows, which Calvo et al. (2006) identify as a significant source of macroeconomic instability in emerging economies.An important distinction within the realm of investment funds is between active and passive strategies. Miyajima and Shim (2014) find that benchmark-driven investments, particularly passive funds, appear to be more sensitive to global risk shocks compared to their active counterparts. This heightened sensitivity can be attributed to the mechanical nature of passive investing, which may lead to more pronounced and synchronized reactions to global events.The role of global risk factors in driving capital flows to EMs has been extensively studied. Rey (2015) argues for the existence of a global financial cycle, driven primarily by monetary conditions in center economies, particularly the United States. This global cycle significantly influences cross-border capital flows, credit growth, and asset prices in EMs. Building on this work, Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020) demonstrate that US monetary policy shocks have substantial spillover effects on global asset prices and capital flows, with particularly strong impacts on EMs.The sensitivity of EM capital flows to global risk factors is further exacerbated by the dollar's dominant role in international finance. Avdjiev et al. (2019) show that tightening US dollar funding conditions can lead to significant retrenchment in cross-border lending and investment fund flows to EMs. This 'dollar dominance' underscores the vulnerability of EMs to external financial conditions and highlights the need for policy measures to mitigate these risks.The procyclicality of investment fund flows and their sensitivity to global risk factors pose significant financial stability concerns for EMs. Chari et al. (2020) argue that these dynamics can lead to amplification of shocks and increased tail risks in EM asset prices. This heightened vulnerability calls for a reconsideration of macroprudential policy frameworks in EMs to address the specific challenges posed by NBFI.In conclusion, while the rise of NBFI has provided EMs with new sources of financing and potential benefits in terms of risk-sharing, it has also introduced new vulnerabilities. The procyclicality of investment fund flows, particularly during periods of global stress, poses significant challenges for financial stability in EMs. Future research and policy discussions should focus on developing targeted macroprudential measures to address these vulnerabilities while preserving the benefits of diverse financing sources for emerging economies.", "References": [{"title": "The Fragility of Short-Term Secured Funding Markets", "authors": "Itay Goldstein, Hao Jiang, David T.
