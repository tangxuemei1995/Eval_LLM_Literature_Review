{"Literature Review": "Local projections have emerged as a powerful and flexible tool in applied economics, bridging the gap between traditional time series methods and microeconometric approaches. This literature review explores the development, applications, and advantages of local projections in economic research, with a focus on their role in estimating dynamic causal effects.Local projections, introduced by Jordà (2005), offer a direct and robust method for estimating impulse response functions without the need to specify and estimate a full dynamic system. This approach has gained popularity due to its simplicity and flexibility, particularly in macroeconomic analysis. Stock and Watson (2018) demonstrate that local projections can be viewed as a generalization of vector autoregressions (VARs), providing a unified framework for time series analysis.One of the key advantages of local projections is their ability to accommodate non-linearities and state-dependent effects. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) utilize this feature to examine the state-dependent effects of fiscal policy, showing that government spending multipliers are larger during recessions than expansions. This flexibility has made local projections particularly useful in studying asymmetric and time-varying effects in macroeconomic relationships.In the realm of microeconometrics, local projections have found applications in panel data settings. Jordà and Taylor (2016) extend the local projections framework to panel data, allowing for the estimation of dynamic treatment effects in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. This development has opened up new possibilities for causal inference in applied microeconomics, bridging the gap between time series and cross-sectional approaches.The connection between local projections and the potential outcomes framework, as emphasized by Angrist et al. (2018), has further solidified the method's relevance in causal inference. By framing local projections in terms of potential outcomes, researchers can more easily interpret their results in the language of treatment effects, facilitating communication between macro- and microeconomists.Local projections have also proven valuable in addressing issues of endogeneity and identification in economic research. Ramey and Zubairy (2018) employ local projections with instrumental variables to estimate fiscal multipliers, demonstrating the method's adaptability to various identification strategies. This approach has been particularly useful in macroeconomic settings where traditional instrumental variable techniques may be challenging to implement.The robustness of local projections to model misspecification has been a significant factor in their growing popularity. Plagborg-Møller and Wolf (2021) show that local projections are more robust to misspecification of lag structure compared to VARs, making them an attractive option when the true data-generating process is uncertain. This robustness has led to increased adoption of local projections in policy analysis and forecasting.Despite their advantages, local projections are not without limitations. Herbst and Johannsen (2021) highlight that local projections may suffer from increased estimation uncertainty compared to more tightly parameterized models, particularly at longer horizons. This trade-off between flexibility and efficiency is an important consideration for researchers when choosing between local projections and alternative methods.The integration of machine learning techniques with local projections represents an exciting frontier in economic research. Barnichon and Brownlees (2019) propose a regularized local projections approach that combines the flexibility of local projections with the variable selection capabilities of machine learning methods. This hybrid approach shows promise in improving forecast accuracy and handling high-dimensional datasets.Looking ahead, the continued development and refinement of local projections are likely to further enhance their utility in applied economics. Areas for future research include the development of more efficient estimation techniques, improved methods for inference and uncertainty quantification, and further integration with causal inference frameworks from both macro- and microeconomic perspectives.In conclusion, local projections have emerged as a versatile and powerful tool in applied economics, offering a bridge between time series methods and microeconometric approaches. Their flexibility, robustness, and interpretability have made them increasingly popular in both macro- and microeconomic research. As the method continues to evolve and integrate with other techniques, local projections are poised to play an even more significant role in advancing our understanding of dynamic causal effects in economics.", "References": [{"title": "Local Projections", "authors": "Òscar Jordà", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2005", "volumes": "95", "first page": "161", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1257/0002828053828518"}, {"title": "Identification and Inference Using Event Studies", "authors": "James H.
