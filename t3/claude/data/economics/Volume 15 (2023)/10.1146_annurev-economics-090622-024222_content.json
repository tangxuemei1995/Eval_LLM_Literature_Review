{"Literature Review": "The digital age has ushered in a new era of economic dynamics, characterized by the rise of tech giants and their unprecedented market dominance. This literature review examines the complex interplay between competition, regulation, and industrial policy in the context of the digital economy, with a focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by the dominance of large technology firms.The emergence of digital platforms has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape across various industries. Cusumano et al. (2019) argue that platform-based business models have enabled tech giants to achieve rapid growth and establish dominant market positions through network effects and data accumulation. This dominance has raised concerns about market concentration and its potential negative impacts on competition, innovation, and consumer welfare.Antitrust authorities and policymakers worldwide have grappled with the challenge of adapting traditional regulatory frameworks to the digital age. Khan (2017) highlights the limitations of current antitrust approaches in addressing the unique characteristics of digital markets, such as zero-price services and multi-sided platforms. The author argues for a more holistic approach that considers the broader implications of market power beyond consumer welfare.The concept of fairness in digital markets has gained increasing attention in recent years. Crémer et al. (2019) emphasize the need for a fairness-oriented approach to regulation, which takes into account not only economic efficiency but also broader societal concerns such as privacy, data protection, and the preservation of democratic values. This perspective challenges the traditional focus on consumer welfare as the primary goal of competition policy.Industrial policy has re-emerged as a potential tool for addressing the challenges posed by tech giants' dominance. Mazzucato (2018) advocates for a more active role of the state in shaping markets and fostering innovation, arguing that targeted industrial policies can help create a more balanced and competitive digital ecosystem. This view contrasts with the laissez-faire approach that has dominated economic thinking in recent decades.The issue of contestability in digital markets has been a central concern for policymakers and researchers alike. Furman et al. (2019) argue that the lack of effective competition in many digital markets is due to high barriers to entry, strong network effects, and the strategic behavior of incumbent firms. They propose a range of measures to enhance contestability, including data portability and interoperability requirements.Merger control has emerged as a critical area of focus in the regulation of digital markets. Cunningham et al. (2021) examine the phenomenon of 'killer acquisitions' in the tech industry, where dominant firms acquire potential competitors to preempt future competition. The authors argue for a more stringent approach to merger review in digital markets, considering the long-term competitive implications of such acquisitions.The global nature of digital markets has led to challenges in coordinating regulatory approaches across jurisdictions. Bradford (2020) explores the concept of the 'Brussels Effect,' whereby EU regulations in areas such as data protection and competition law have influenced global standards. The author argues that regulatory convergence is essential for effective governance of the digital economy.The role of data as a competitive asset has been widely recognized in the literature. Zuboff (2019) introduces the concept of 'surveillance capitalism,' highlighting how the accumulation and exploitation of user data have become central to the business models of tech giants. This perspective underscores the need for regulatory frameworks that address the unique challenges posed by data-driven market power.As policymakers consider reforms to competition policy and industrial strategy, there is a growing consensus on the need for a nuanced approach that balances multiple objectives. Tirole (2020) argues for a regulatory framework that promotes innovation and economic dynamism while addressing concerns about market concentration and fairness. The author emphasizes the importance of evidence-based policymaking and the need for flexibility in adapting regulations to rapidly evolving digital markets.In conclusion, the literature reveals a complex landscape of challenges and potential solutions in addressing the dominance of tech giants in the digital age. While there is no consensus on a single optimal approach, there is growing recognition of the need for innovative regulatory frameworks that can effectively balance competition, innovation, and broader societal goals. As the digital economy continues to evolve, ongoing research and policy experimentation will be crucial in developing effective strategies for promoting a fair, competitive, and dynamic digital ecosystem.", "References": [{"title": "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox", "authors": "Lina M.
