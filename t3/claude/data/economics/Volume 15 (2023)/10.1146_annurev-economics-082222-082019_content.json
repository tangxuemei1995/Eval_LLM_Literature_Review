{"Literature Review": "The economic relationship between the United States and China has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate over the past two decades. This literature review aims to synthesize the theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of US-China trade relations, focusing on two major phenomena: the China shock and the recent US-China trade war.The China shock refers to the rapid increase in Chinese exports to the United States following China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Autor et al. (2013) pioneered the measurement of this shock, using the concept of 'import exposure' to quantify the impact on local labor markets in the US. Their influential work sparked a wave of research examining the multifaceted effects of increased trade with China on various economic outcomes in the United States.One of the most debated aspects of the China shock has been its impact on US manufacturing employment. While some studies, such as Pierce and Schott (2016), found significant negative effects on manufacturing jobs due to increased import competition from China, others have challenged this view. For instance, Acemoglu et al. (2016) argued that the China shock led to job losses not only in manufacturing but also in other sectors through input-output linkages.However, recent research by Fort et al. (2018) suggests that the decline in US manufacturing employment cannot be primarily attributed to Chinese import competition. They argue that technological change and shifts in consumer preferences played more significant roles in this decline. This highlights the complexity of disentangling the effects of trade from other concurrent economic trends.The aggregate gains from US-China trade have been substantial, as demonstrated by Amiti et al. (2017). They found that Chinese import competition led to lower prices for US consumers and increased product variety. However, these gains were not evenly distributed, creating both winners and losers in the US economy. Caliendo et al. (2019) developed a dynamic spatial model to analyze the heterogeneous effects of the China shock across different regions and sectors in the US, providing a more nuanced understanding of its distributional impacts.The recent US-China trade war, initiated in 2018, marked a significant shift in the trade relationship between the two countries. Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) developed a quantitative general equilibrium model to evaluate the effects of this trade war. Their findings indicate that the tariffs imposed by both countries led to welfare losses for consumers in both nations, primarily due to higher prices and reduced product variety.Contrary to the stated objectives of the trade war, its employment effects appear to have been relatively small. Flaaen and Pierce (2019) found that while the tariffs provided a small boost to employment in some protected industries, these gains were offset by job losses in other sectors due to higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs. This suggests that the trade war was largely ineffective in reversing the distributional effects of the China shock.The literature also highlights the importance of global value chains in understanding the impacts of both the China shock and the trade war. Johnson and Noguera (2017) demonstrated how the growth of global value chains has changed the nature of bilateral trade relationships, making it crucial to consider value-added trade flows rather than gross trade flows when assessing economic impacts.Recent work by Handley et al. (2020) has explored the role of policy uncertainty in shaping firms' responses to the trade war. They found that increased uncertainty about future trade policy led to a decline in US firm entry in China-exposed sectors, potentially having long-lasting effects on US industrial structure.In conclusion, the literature on US-China trade relations over the past two decades reveals a complex picture. While the aggregate gains from trade have been substantial, the distributional effects have been uneven, creating challenges for policymakers. The recent trade war, while aiming to address these challenges, appears to have generated welfare losses without significantly altering the underlying economic dynamics. As global trade patterns continue to evolve, further research will be crucial in guiding evidence-based policy decisions in this critical area of international economics.", "References": [{"title": "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States", "authors": "David H.
