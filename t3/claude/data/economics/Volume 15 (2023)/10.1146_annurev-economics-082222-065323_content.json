{"Literature Review": "The econometrics of nonlinear budget sets has emerged as a crucial area of study in economics, particularly in the analysis of consumer behavior and policy evaluation. This literature review aims to explore the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimating choice models with nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the budget set regression and its implications for economic analysis.The study of nonlinear budget sets has its roots in the seminal work of Burtless and Hausman (1978), who introduced a framework for analyzing labor supply decisions in the presence of nonlinear tax schedules. Their approach laid the foundation for subsequent research in this field, highlighting the importance of accounting for nonlinearities in budget constraints when estimating consumer preferences and behavior.One of the key challenges in analyzing nonlinear budget sets is the potential for bias in traditional estimation methods. Blomquist and Newey (2002) addressed this issue by developing a nonparametric approach to estimating labor supply functions with nonlinear budget sets. Their method, which relies on series approximation, provides a flexible framework for modeling consumer choices without imposing restrictive functional form assumptions.The budget set regression, which represents the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set, has become a central focus in the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets. Manski (2014) emphasized the importance of this approach, arguing that it offers a more robust and informative analysis compared to traditional maximum likelihood estimation. The budget set regression allows researchers to capture the complex relationships between budget constraints and consumer choices without relying on strong parametric assumptions.One of the key advantages of the budget set regression approach is its ability to reduce the curse of dimensionality in nonparametric models with general heterogeneity. Blundell et al. (2007) demonstrated how utility maximization in such models can lead to dimension reduction, allowing for more efficient estimation and inference. This insight has been particularly valuable in applications to labor supply and taxation, where accounting for individual heterogeneity is crucial for accurate policy analysis.The literature has also explored the information provided by kink probabilities in nonparametric utility models with general heterogeneity. Saez (2010) showed how bunching at kink points in nonlinear budget sets can be used to identify behavioral responses to taxation. This approach has been widely adopted in empirical studies of tax policy, providing valuable insights into the elasticity of taxable income and other behavioral parameters.Instrumental variable estimation has played a significant role in addressing endogeneity concerns in the analysis of nonlinear budget sets. Blundell et al. (1998) developed an instrumental variable approach for estimating labor supply models with nonlinear budget constraints, demonstrating how this method can provide evidence of heterogeneity in preferences. Subsequent research has built on this framework, refining instrumental variable techniques for use in various contexts involving nonlinear budget sets.Recent advances in the field have focused on developing more flexible and robust estimation methods. Blomquist et al. (2015) proposed a new approach to nonparametric identification and estimation of labor supply models with nonlinear budget sets, which allows for general heterogeneity and optimization errors. Their method provides a unified framework for analyzing various types of nonlinear budget constraints, including those arising from complex tax and transfer systems.The application of machine learning techniques to the analysis of nonlinear budget sets represents an emerging area of research. Athey and Imbens (2019) discussed the potential of machine learning methods for causal inference in economics, including applications to nonlinear budget set problems. These approaches offer promising avenues for handling high-dimensional data and complex nonlinearities in budget constraints.Empirical studies using the budget set regression approach have yielded results that often differ from those obtained through maximum likelihood estimation. For example, Blomquist and Newey (2017) found significant differences in estimated labor supply elasticities when using their nonparametric approach compared to traditional parametric methods. These findings underscore the importance of flexible modeling approaches in policy analysis and welfare evaluation.In conclusion, the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with the development of nonparametric models and methods providing researchers with powerful tools for analyzing consumer behavior and policy impacts. The budget set regression approach, in particular, has emerged as a valuable framework for addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear budget constraints and heterogeneity in preferences. As the field continues to advance, integrating new methodological approaches and leveraging increasing computational power, it promises to yield even more nuanced and policy-relevant insights into economic behavior in the presence of complex budget constraints.", "References": [{"title": "Income Effects and the Welfare Evaluation of Tax Reforms", "authors": "Gary Burtless, Jerry A.
