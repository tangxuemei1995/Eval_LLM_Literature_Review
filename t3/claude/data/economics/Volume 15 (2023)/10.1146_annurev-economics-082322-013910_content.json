{"Literature Review": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator has been a cornerstone in various fields of economics, including business cycle theory, macroeconomic growth and development, and international trade. Its widespread use can be attributed to its tractable properties, particularly when dealing with multiple goods and factors. However, the reliance on CES aggregators has led to a need for exploring alternative, non-CES aggregators to address specific research questions and relax certain assumptions.One of the key limitations of CES aggregators is their inherent homotheticity, which implies that preferences or production technologies remain unchanged as scale increases. Matsuyama (2019) introduced the generalized constant elasticity of substitution (GCES) demand system, which allows for non-homothetic preferences while maintaining other desirable properties of CES. This approach has proven particularly useful in studying structural change and the effects of income distribution on aggregate demand.Another important class of non-CES aggregators is the implicitly additive demand system. Hanoch (1975) pioneered this approach, which maintains separability between goods while allowing for variable elasticities of substitution. Comin et al. (2021) further developed this concept by introducing the normalized CES demand system, which combines features of both CES and implicitly additive demand systems. This hybrid approach has been particularly valuable in analyzing long-run structural transformation and cross-country income differences.The concept of gross substitutes and complements is crucial in many economic applications. While CES aggregators assume a constant elasticity of substitution between all pairs of goods, non-CES aggregators can allow for more flexible relationships. Fally (2018) proposed a class of aggregators that maintain the gross substitute property while allowing for variable elasticities, which has proven useful in international trade models and the analysis of production networks.Essential and inessential goods represent another dimension where non-CES aggregators can provide valuable insights. Sato (1967) introduced the concept of minimum expenditure functions, which allow for the incorporation of essential goods in demand systems. This approach has been further developed by Fally (2022), who proposed a class of aggregators that can accommodate both essential and inessential goods while maintaining other desirable properties of CES.The constant returns to scale (CRS) property is often crucial in production function analysis. While CES production functions exhibit CRS, non-CES aggregators can maintain this property while allowing for more flexible substitution patterns. Morishima (1967) introduced the concept of the elasticity of substitution between pairs of inputs, which has been instrumental in developing non-CES production functions that maintain CRS.One of the challenges in working with non-CES aggregators is maintaining analytical tractability. Matsuyama and Ushchev (2017) proposed the homothetic CES-plus demand system, which adds flexibility to the standard CES framework while preserving many of its tractable properties. This approach has been particularly useful in studying the effects of productivity differences across sectors and countries.The relationship between different classes of non-CES aggregators is an important area of research. Fally and Faber (2022) provided a comprehensive analysis of the connections between various non-CES demand systems, highlighting the trade-offs between flexibility and tractability. Their work has been instrumental in guiding researchers towards the most appropriate aggregator for specific applications.While non-CES aggregators offer increased flexibility, they often come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Baqaee and Farhi (2019) developed techniques for analyzing general equilibrium models with arbitrary production networks and demand systems, including non-CES aggregators. Their approach has opened up new avenues for research in macroeconomics and international trade.In conclusion, the exploration of non-CES aggregators has significantly expanded the toolkit available to economists for modeling complex economic phenomena. By selectively relaxing certain properties of CES aggregators, researchers can tailor their models to specific research questions while maintaining analytical tractability. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely that new classes of non-CES aggregators will emerge, further enhancing our ability to analyze and understand economic systems across various domains.", "References": [{"title": "Engel's Law in the Global Economy: Demand-Induced Patterns of Structural Change, Innovation, and Trade", "authors": "Kiminori Matsuyama", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2019", "volumes": "87", "first page": "497", "last page": "528", "DOI": "10.3982/ECTA13765"}, {"title": "Separable Utility and Aggregation", "authors": "Giora Hanoch", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "1975", "volumes": "43", "first page": "311", "last page": "331", "DOI": "10.2307/1913584"}, {"title": "Structural Change with Long-run Income and Price Effects", "authors": "Diego Comin, Danial Lashkari, Mart√≠ Mestieri", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2021", "volumes": "89", "first page": "311", "last page": "374", "DOI": "10.3982/ECTA16317"}, {"title": "Generalized Separability and the Gains from Trade", "authors": "Thibault Fally", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2018", "volumes": "108", "first page": "1609", "last page": "1637", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.20171541"}, {"title": "The Commodity Pattern of Trade: A New Approach", "authors": "Ryuzo Sato", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "1967", "volumes": "57", "first page": "694", "last page": "707", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Nonhomothetic CES Demand Systems: The Kuznets Curve Revisited", "authors": "Thibault Fally", "journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "130", "first page": "1608", "last page": "1646", "DOI": "10.1086/719277"}, {"title": "A Constant Elasticity of Substitution Production Function", "authors": "Michio Morishima", "journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "year": "1967", "volumes": "34", "first page": "225", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.2307/2296809"}, {"title": "Beyond CES: Three Alternative Classes of Flexible Homothetic Demand Systems", "authors": "Kiminori Matsuyama, Philip Ushchev", "journal": "CEPR Discussion Paper", "year": "2017", "volumes": "12210", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Nonhomothetic Preferences and International Trade", "authors": "Thibault Fally, Benjamin Faber", "journal": "Annual Review of Economics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "14", "first page": "539", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-economics-051520-025625"}, {"title": "Macroeconomics with Heterogeneous Agents and Input-Output Networks", "authors": "David Rezza Baqaee, Emmanuel Farhi", "journal": "NBER Working Paper", "year": "2019", "volumes": "24684", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3386/w24684"}]}
