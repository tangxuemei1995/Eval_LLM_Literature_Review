{"Literature Review": "The field of partial identification has gained significant traction in econometrics and statistics over the past few decades, offering a nuanced approach to parameter estimation when point identification is not feasible. This literature review aims to explore recent developments in partial identification, focusing on general frameworks and specific applications. Partial identification arose from the recognition that many empirically relevant scenarios do not allow for precise parameter estimation due to various limitations in data or model assumptions. Instead of yielding a single point estimate, partial identification methods provide a set of plausible values for the parameter of interest, known as the identified set. This approach offers a more robust and honest representation of what can be learned from available data and assumptions. General Frameworks for Partial Identification: One of the foundational works in partial identification is Manski's (1989) study on treatment effects, which introduced the concept of bounds analysis. This approach has since been extended and refined by numerous researchers. Tamer (2010) provided a comprehensive overview of partial identification in econometrics, discussing its philosophical underpinnings and practical implications. More recently, Molinari (2020) presented a unified framework for partial identification analysis, synthesizing various strands of literature and providing a systematic approach to deriving identified sets. This work has been instrumental in standardizing the language and methods used in partial identification across different applications. Chesher and Rosen (2017) developed a general approach to partial identification in models defined by moment inequalities and equalities. Their work provides a powerful tool for characterizing identified sets in a wide range of econometric models, including those with discrete outcomes and endogenous explanatory variables. Recent Developments in Specific Areas: Treatment Effects: Building on Manski's seminal work, recent studies have further refined methods for partially identifying treatment effects. For instance, Imbens and Manski (2004) developed confidence intervals for partially identified parameters, which has been particularly useful in the context of treatment effects. More recently, Machado et al. (2019) proposed novel methods for partially identifying quantile treatment effects under various assumptions about selection mechanisms. Shape Restrictions: The use of shape restrictions has emerged as a powerful tool in partial identification. Chetverikov et al. (2018) provided a comprehensive treatment of shape restrictions in econometrics, including their application in partial identification problems. They demonstrated how incorporating plausible shape restrictions can significantly tighten identified sets. Optimizing Behavior: Partial identification methods have also been applied to models of optimizing behavior. Pakes et al. (2015) developed a framework for analyzing models where agents make optimal choices subject to various constraints. Their approach allows for the partial identification of structural parameters in complex economic models, even when point identification is infeasible. Bounds in High-Dimensional Models: As econometric models become increasingly complex, researchers have developed methods for partial identification in high-dimensional settings. Chernozhukov et al. (2015) proposed novel techniques for estimating bounds on parameters in models with many moment inequalities, which has applications in various fields, including industrial organization and labor economics. Partial Identification in Dynamic Models: Recent work has also focused on extending partial identification methods to dynamic settings. Norets and Tang (2014) developed approaches for partially identifying parameters in dynamic discrete choice models, which are widely used in labor economics and other fields. Inference and Computation: Advances in computational methods have facilitated more sophisticated approaches to inference in partially identified models. Kaido et al. (2019) proposed a novel algorithm for computing confidence sets in models defined by moment inequalities, which has improved the feasibility of partial identification analysis in complex settings. In conclusion, the field of partial identification has seen significant advancements in recent years, both in terms of general frameworks and specific applications. These developments have expanded the toolkit available to researchers dealing with scenarios where point identification is not possible. By providing a more nuanced understanding of what can be learned from data and assumptions, partial identification methods continue to enhance the robustness and credibility of empirical research across various disciplines.", "References": [{"title": "Nonparametric Analysis of Treatment Effects in Ordered Response Models", "authors": "Charles F.
