{"Literature Review": "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, requiring a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to mitigation and adaptation. This literature review examines the portfolio of economic policies needed to combat climate change, focusing on carbon pricing, green R&D support, and other complementary measures.Carbon pricing has emerged as a cornerstone of climate policy, with both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness. Nordhaus (2019) argues that a global carbon tax is the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as it directly addresses the externality of carbon pollution. However, the implementation of carbon pricing schemes has been uneven across countries. Burke et al. (2016) find that while carbon prices have been introduced in many jurisdictions, they are often set too low to drive significant emissions reductions.One challenge in implementing effective carbon pricing is the risk of carbon leakage, where emissions-intensive industries relocate to regions with less stringent climate policies. To address this issue, Mehling et al. (2019) propose the use of carbon border adjustments, which would apply a carbon price to imported goods based on their embedded emissions. While such measures could help level the playing field and prevent leakage, their design and implementation remain contentious in international trade discussions.Complementing carbon pricing, support for green R&D has been identified as a crucial element in driving technological innovation for climate change mitigation. Acemoglu et al. (2012) demonstrate that combining carbon taxes with subsidies for clean technology research can significantly reduce the economic costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Empirical evidence from Popp (2019) supports this view, showing that both carbon pricing and direct R&D subsidies have positive effects on clean energy innovation.However, the effectiveness of green R&D support depends on careful policy design. Hepburn et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of targeting R&D subsidies towards technologies with the highest potential for emissions reductions and cost decreases. They also highlight the need for a balanced approach that supports both basic research and applied development.While carbon pricing and green R&D support form the backbone of climate policy, other measures play important roles in addressing specific market failures and behavioral barriers. Energy efficiency standards, for instance, have been shown to be effective in reducing emissions from buildings and appliances. Gillingham et al. (2018) find that such standards can complement carbon pricing by addressing informational and behavioral barriers that may prevent optimal energy-saving investments.Bans on certain high-emission technologies or practices have also been employed as part of climate policy portfolios. Sterner et al. (2019) argue that bans can be particularly effective for addressing emissions from sources that are difficult to price directly, such as certain industrial processes or land-use changes. However, they caution that bans should be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences and ensure a just transition for affected industries and workers.Targeted subsidies for low-carbon technologies and practices have been widely used but often criticized for their cost-effectiveness compared to broader pricing mechanisms. Nevertheless, Meckling et al. (2017) contend that such subsidies can play a crucial role in building political support for climate policies and creating constituencies for further action. They argue that a sequenced approach, starting with targeted support and gradually transitioning to more comprehensive pricing, may be more politically feasible than attempting to implement economy-wide carbon pricing from the outset.The coherence and coordination of these various policy instruments remain a significant challenge. Rosenbloom et al. (2020) emphasize the need for policy mixes that are mutually reinforcing rather than contradictory. They highlight instances where fossil fuel subsidies have undermined the effectiveness of carbon pricing and clean energy support, underscoring the importance of policy alignment across sectors and levels of government.In the international context, climate finance has emerged as a critical component of global efforts to address climate change. Buchner et al. (2019) track the flows of climate finance and find that while overall investment in climate action has increased, it remains far below the levels needed to meet global climate goals. They emphasize the need for increased public finance to catalyze private investment, particularly in developing countries.As the urgency of climate action intensifies, there is growing recognition of the need for a comprehensive and well-coordinated portfolio of economic policies. While carbon pricing and green R&D support remain central, the effective implementation of complementary measures such as standards, bans, and targeted subsidies is crucial. Future research should focus on optimizing policy mixes, addressing implementation challenges, and ensuring a just transition to a low-carbon economy.", "References": [{"title": "The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World", "authors": "William D.
