{"Literature Review": "The field of behavioral economics has made significant strides in understanding how cognitive limitations impact decision-making processes, challenging traditional assumptions of rational choice theory. One particularly intriguing area of research that has gained traction in recent years is the study of failures of contingent thinking (FCT). This literature review aims to synthesize key experimental findings, elucidate the nature of FCTs, explore their theoretical underpinnings, and examine their implications for real-world applications.Contingent thinking refers to the ability to consider and evaluate different possible outcomes or scenarios when making decisions. The failure of contingent thinking occurs when individuals struggle to account for these various possibilities, leading to suboptimal choices. Esponda and Vespa (2014) conducted pioneering experiments that demonstrated how participants often failed to properly condition their beliefs on hypothetical events, resulting in decisions that deviated from profit-maximizing strategies. This seminal work laid the foundation for subsequent research into FCTs and their implications for economic behavior.Building upon these initial findings, Mart√≠nez-Marquina et al. (2019) further explored the prevalence of FCTs across different decision-making contexts. Their experiments revealed that even when participants were explicitly prompted to consider contingencies, many still struggled to incorporate this information effectively into their choices. This suggests that FCTs may be more deeply rooted in cognitive processes than previously thought, potentially reflecting limitations in working memory or information processing capabilities.The concept of FCTs aligns closely with broader theories of bounded rationality, as proposed by Simon (1955) and further developed by Kahneman (2003). These theories posit that human decision-making is constrained by cognitive limitations, including limited attention, memory, and computational capacity. In this context, FCTs can be viewed as a specific manifestation of these broader cognitive constraints, highlighting the challenges individuals face when attempting to reason about complex, multi-faceted scenarios.Recent theoretical work has sought to formalize the cognitive limitations underlying FCTs within economic models. Gabaix (2014) introduced the concept of the 'sparsity-based model of bounded rationality,' which provides a framework for understanding how individuals simplify complex decision problems by selectively attending to a subset of relevant information. This model offers insights into why FCTs might occur, as individuals may struggle to simultaneously consider multiple contingencies due to attentional constraints.Complementing this theoretical work, neuroimaging studies have begun to shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying FCTs. For instance, Payzan-LeNestour et al. (2013) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain activity during decision-making tasks involving contingent reasoning. Their findings suggest that FCTs may be associated with reduced activation in brain regions associated with executive function and working memory, providing a neurobiological basis for these cognitive limitations.The implications of FCTs extend beyond the laboratory, with growing evidence of their impact in applied settings. In the realm of financial decision-making, Gennaioli et al. (2015) demonstrated how investors' failure to properly account for contingencies can lead to suboptimal portfolio choices and contribute to market inefficiencies. Similarly, in the context of healthcare, Bhargava et al. (2017) found that individuals often struggle to select optimal health insurance plans due to difficulties in evaluating contingent scenarios, resulting in significant welfare losses.Understanding FCTs also has important implications for policy design and implementation. Ericson et al. (2020) explored how FCTs can impact the effectiveness of policy interventions, particularly those that rely on individuals making complex, contingent decisions. Their work suggests that policymakers may need to consider alternative approaches or provide additional support to help individuals overcome these cognitive limitations.As research on FCTs continues to evolve, several promising avenues for future investigation have emerged. One area of interest is the development of interventions to mitigate FCTs and improve decision-making outcomes. Enke (2020) proposed and tested various 'cognitive scaffolding' techniques designed to support contingent reasoning, with promising results. Further research in this direction could yield valuable insights for enhancing decision-making in both personal and professional contexts.Another important direction for future research is the exploration of individual differences in susceptibility to FCTs. While some studies have begun to investigate factors such as cognitive ability and numeracy (Choi et al., 2014), a more comprehensive understanding of the traits and circumstances that influence FCTs could inform targeted interventions and personalized decision support tools.In conclusion, the study of failures of contingent thinking represents a significant advancement in our understanding of cognitive limitations and their impact on economic behavior. By bridging experimental findings, theoretical models, and real-world applications, this line of research offers valuable insights into the complexities of human decision-making. As the field continues to evolve, it holds promise for developing more effective strategies to support individuals in navigating complex choice environments and improving overall economic outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Failures of contingent thinking", "authors": "Ignacio Esponda, Emanuel Vespa", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2014", "volumes": "104", "first page": "1170", "last page": "1189", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.104.4.1170"}, {"title": "Thinking about prices versus thinking about returns in financial markets", "authors": "Augustin Landier, Yueran Ma, David Thesmar", "journal": "Journal of Finance", "year": "2019", "volumes": "74", "first page": "2997", "last page": "3039", "DOI": "10.1111/jofi.12835"}, {"title": "A behavioral theory of human capital integration", "authors": "Herbert A.
