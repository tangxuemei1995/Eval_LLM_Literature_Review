{"Literature Review": "The concept of Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) has gained significant attention in recent years as countries seek to address the challenge of carbon leakage and maintain competitiveness in the face of disparate climate policies. This literature review examines the economic rationale behind BCA, its potential impacts, and the various design considerations that policymakers must grapple with when implementing such measures.The primary motivation for BCA stems from the phenomenon of carbon leakage, which occurs when stringent climate policies in one country lead to increased emissions in countries with less stringent regulations. Böhringer et al. (2012) provide a comprehensive analysis of carbon leakage, estimating that unilateral climate policies can result in leakage rates of 15-30% without compensating measures. This underscores the need for mechanisms like BCA to maintain the environmental integrity of climate policies.The economic rationale for BCA is rooted in the concept of leveling the playing field for domestic producers facing higher production costs due to carbon pricing. Mehling et al. (2019) argue that BCA can help preserve the competitiveness of domestic industries while simultaneously incentivizing foreign producers to reduce their carbon footprint. However, the authors also note that the design of BCA schemes must carefully balance environmental effectiveness with economic efficiency and legal compatibility.One of the key debates in the literature revolves around the relative merits of BCA compared to alternative measures such as free allocation of emissions allowances. Monjon and Quirion (2011) conducted a comparative analysis of these approaches, finding that BCA is generally more effective in reducing carbon leakage than free allocation. Their study suggests that a full BCA could reduce leakage rates by up to 65% compared to a scenario without any compensating measures.The potential trade impacts of BCA have been a subject of intense scrutiny. Branger and Quirion (2014) reviewed 25 studies on the topic and concluded that while BCA can effectively reduce leakage, its impact on global welfare is ambiguous and depends heavily on specific design features. They emphasize the importance of considering not only the direct effects on trade flows but also the indirect effects on terms of trade and global emissions.The design of BCA schemes presents numerous challenges, as highlighted by Cosbey et al. (2019). These include determining the scope of covered sectors and emissions, calculating the carbon content of imported goods, and deciding how to treat exports. The authors stress the importance of transparency and fairness in BCA design to enhance its legitimacy and minimize the risk of retaliatory measures from trading partners.Legal considerations, particularly compatibility with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, are crucial in BCA design. Pauwelyn (2013) provides a detailed analysis of the legal challenges and potential justifications for BCA under international trade law. He argues that while BCA could potentially be justified under GATT Article XX, careful design is necessary to ensure non-discrimination and avoid arbitrary restrictions on international trade.The concept of 'climate clubs' has emerged as a potential framework for implementing BCA in a multilateral context. Nordhaus (2015) proposes a model where countries forming a climate club would impose uniform carbon prices internally and apply BCA to non-members. This approach could potentially address some of the concerns about unilateral action and provide a pathway for broader international cooperation on climate policy.The effectiveness of BCA in reducing global emissions is a critical consideration. Böhringer et al. (2016) used a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model to assess the environmental and economic impacts of BCA. Their results suggest that while BCA can effectively reduce leakage, its impact on global emissions is relatively modest, highlighting the need for complementary measures to achieve significant emissions reductions.Finally, the distributional impacts of BCA, both within and between countries, warrant careful consideration. Larch and Wanner (2017) examine the welfare effects of BCA, finding that while it can improve the terms of trade for implementing countries, it may have negative impacts on developing countries. This underscores the importance of considering equity concerns and potentially incorporating measures to mitigate adverse effects on vulnerable economies.In conclusion, the literature on BCA reveals a complex interplay of economic, environmental, legal, and political considerations. While BCA shows promise as a tool to address carbon leakage and maintain competitiveness, its effectiveness and acceptability depend crucially on careful design and implementation. Future research should focus on refining BCA designs to maximize environmental effectiveness while minimizing potential negative impacts on international trade and developing economies.", "References": [{"title": "Alternative designs for a border carbon adjustment", "authors": "Christoph Böhringer, Jared C.
