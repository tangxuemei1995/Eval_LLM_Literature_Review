{"Literature Review": "The intersection of gender and international relations (IR) has become an increasingly important area of study over the past three decades, with scholars exploring how gender dynamics shape and are shaped by global politics. This literature review examines four key areas of research within this field: gender and political economy, gender and security, queer approaches, and feminist foreign policy.Gender and Political Economy:The study of gender and political economy in IR has highlighted how global economic structures and processes are inherently gendered. Elias and Roberts (2018) argue that feminist political economy approaches have been crucial in exposing the gendered nature of global production, social reproduction, and financial systems. Their work demonstrates how gender inequalities are embedded in and reproduced by global economic institutions and practices.Building on this foundation, True (2012) explores the gendered impacts of globalization, showing how economic liberalization has often exacerbated gender inequalities in both the formal and informal sectors. She argues that understanding these gendered dynamics is essential for developing more equitable global economic policies.Gender and Security:The field of gender and security has expanded significantly, moving beyond traditional state-centric notions of security to encompass human security and the gendered dimensions of conflict and peace. Tickner (2019) provides a comprehensive overview of feminist approaches to security studies, highlighting how gender analysis has transformed our understanding of war, peace, and security.Shepherd (2017) further develops this line of inquiry by examining the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda at the United Nations. Her work reveals both the progress made in recognizing women's roles in conflict resolution and peacebuilding, as well as the persistent challenges in translating policy commitments into meaningful action.Queer Approaches:Queer approaches to IR have emerged as a critical intervention, challenging heteronormative assumptions in global politics and expanding our understanding of gender and sexuality. Weber (2016) offers a groundbreaking analysis of how queer theory can be applied to IR, demonstrating how heteronormativity shapes international institutions, norms, and practices.Building on this work, Richter-Montpetit and Weber (2017) explore the intersections of queer theory and postcolonial approaches in IR. They argue that combining these perspectives can provide a more nuanced understanding of how sexuality, gender, and race intersect in global power relations.Feminist Foreign Policy:The concept of feminist foreign policy has gained traction in recent years, with several countries adopting explicitly feminist approaches to their international relations. Aggestam et al. (2019) provide a comprehensive analysis of Sweden's feminist foreign policy, examining its implementation and impact on global gender equality efforts.Thompson and Clement (2019) further explore the potential of feminist foreign policy to transform international relations. They argue that such approaches can lead to more inclusive, sustainable, and just global outcomes by centering gender equality and human rights in foreign policy decision-making.Challenges and Future Directions:Despite significant progress in integrating gender analysis into IR, challenges remain. Parashar (2019) highlights the ongoing marginalization of non-Western feminist perspectives in IR scholarship, calling for greater engagement with diverse voices and experiences in the field.The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the importance of gender analysis in global politics. Smith and Davies (2021) examine the gendered impacts of the pandemic, revealing how pre-existing inequalities have been exacerbated and new challenges have emerged for gender equality in areas such as healthcare, economic security, and domestic violence.Looking ahead, Enloe (2017) argues for the continued relevance and necessity of feminist approaches in IR. She emphasizes the need to remain attentive to the everyday experiences of marginalized groups and to challenge power structures that perpetuate gender inequalities at all levels of global politics.In conclusion, the study of gender and international relations has evolved significantly, offering critical insights into the gendered nature of global politics. As scholars continue to explore the intersections of gender, sexuality, race, and other forms of identity in IR, they contribute to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of international relations. This ongoing research not only enriches academic discourse but also has the potential to inform more equitable and just global policies and practices.", "References": [{"title": "Feminist political economy and global social reproduction", "authors": "Juanita Elias, Adrienne Roberts", "journal": "Review of International Political Economy", "year": "2018", "volumes": "25", "first page": "701", "last page": "721", "DOI": "10.1080/09692290.2018.1513415"}, {"title": "The Political Economy of Violence Against Women", "authors": "Jacqui True", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755929.001.0001"}, {"title": "Gendering World Politics: Issues and Approaches in the Post-Cold War Era", "authors": "J.
