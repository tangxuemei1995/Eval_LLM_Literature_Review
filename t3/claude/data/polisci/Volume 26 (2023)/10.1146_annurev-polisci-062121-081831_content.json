{"Literature Review": "The role of women in power structures within the developing world has been a subject of increasing scholarly attention in recent years. This literature review examines the multifaceted nature of women's negotiation of power in the Global South, challenging the prevailing notion that women's power is inherently greater in the Global North.At the macro level of state development, research has shed light on the complex relationship between women's subordination and the formation of modern political orders. Htun and Weldon (2018) argue that the exclusion of women from political processes has been integral to the establishment of liberal democratic states. However, this paradigm is being challenged by emerging models in the developing world. For instance, Tripp (2015) demonstrates how post-conflict African countries have become global leaders in women's political representation, often surpassing their Western counterparts.The concept of 'state feminism' has gained traction in explaining how developing nations are more likely to recognize and incorporate women's power into governance structures. Mazur and McBride (2007) define state feminism as the actions by women's policy agencies to include women's movement demands and actors into the state to produce feminist outcomes in either policy or social impact. This approach has been particularly evident in Latin America, where Franceschet (2011) observes that women's movements have successfully lobbied for gender quotas and women's ministries, effectively institutionalizing feminist advocacy within the state apparatus.At the meso level of policy-making processes, developing world states have shown a greater propensity to recognize and co-opt women's power. Krook (2009) highlights the widespread adoption of gender quotas in the Global South as a mechanism to increase women's political representation. These quotas have not only increased the numerical presence of women in politics but have also led to substantive changes in policy outcomes. Piscopo (2014) demonstrates how women legislators in Argentina have been instrumental in pushing for gender-sensitive policies, particularly in areas of reproductive rights and violence against women.The micro level of intrafamily negotiations of patriarchal power presents perhaps the most dynamic arena for understanding women's power in the developing world. Kabeer (1999) pioneered the concept of women's empowerment as a process of change, emphasizing the importance of decision-making power within households. Building on this, Doss (2013) provides evidence from various developing countries showing how women's control over household resources can lead to improved outcomes in child health and education.Interestingly, research by Alesina et al. (2013) suggests that the historical use of the plow in agriculture has had long-lasting effects on gender norms and women's participation in the workforce and politics. This finding underscores the importance of understanding the historical and cultural contexts that shape gender relations in different societies.The intersection of women's empowerment and economic development has been a focal point of research in recent years. Duflo (2012) argues that while economic development can lead to greater gender equality, the relationship is not automatic and requires targeted interventions. This perspective challenges simplistic notions of development and emphasizes the need for nuanced approaches to promoting women's power.In the realm of political representation, developing countries have often been at the forefront of innovation. Rwanda, for example, has achieved the highest percentage of women in parliament globally, a feat explored by Burnet (2008). This case study demonstrates how post-conflict societies can create opportunities for transformative change in gender relations.Finally, the role of transnational feminist networks in shaping global gender norms cannot be overlooked. Keck and Sikkink (1998) illustrate how these networks have been particularly effective in the developing world, often bypassing unresponsive states to bring about change through international pressure.In conclusion, this review of the literature reveals that the developing world provides rich and diverse models of women's negotiation of power. From state-level policies to intrafamily dynamics, the Global South offers valuable insights that challenge and expand our understanding of gender and power. As research in this field continues to evolve, it promises to yield more nuanced and context-specific approaches to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "Gender and the Politics of Rights and Democracy in Latin America", "authors": "Susan Franceschet", "journal": "Latin American Politics and Society", "year": "2011", "volumes": "53", "first page": "179", "last page": "186", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1548-2456.2011.00123.x"}, {"title": "Quotas for Women in Politics: Gender and Candidate Selection Reform Worldwide", "authors": "Mona Lena Krook", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2009", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195375671.001.0001"}, {"title": "Resources, Agency, Achievements: Reflections on the Measurement of Women's Empowerment", "authors": "Naila Kabeer", "journal": "Development and Change", "year": "1999", "volumes": "30", "first page": "435", "last page": "464", "DOI": "10.1111/1467-7660.00125"}, {"title": "Women's Empowerment and Economic Development", "authors": "Esther Duflo", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2012", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1051", "last page": "1079", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.50.4.1051"}, {"title": "The Fertile Ground: Women's Empowerment and Crop Intensification in Burkina Faso", "authors": "Cheryl Doss", "journal": "Agricultural Economics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "44", "first page": "45", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1574-0862.2012.00625.x"}, {"title": "The Origins of Gender Roles: Women and the Plough", "authors": "Alberto Alesina, Paola Giuliano, Nathan Nunn", "journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "128", "first page": "469", "last page": "530", "DOI": "10.1093/qje/qjt005"}, {"title": "Rwanda's Women in Power", "authors": "Jennie Burnet", "journal": "Journal of Democracy", "year": "2008", "volumes": "19", "first page": "110", "last page": "124", "DOI": "10.1353/jod.0.0040"}, {"title": "Activists beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics", "authors": "Margaret Keck, Kathryn Sikkink", "journal": "Cornell University Press", "year": "1998", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7591/9780801471292"}, {"title": "The Logics of Gender Justice: State Action on Women's Rights Around the World", "authors": "Mala Htun, S.
