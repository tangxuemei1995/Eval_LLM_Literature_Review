{"Literature Review": "The intersection of international energy politics and climate change has become an increasingly critical area of study in recent years. As the world grapples with the urgent need to address global warming, the dynamics of energy production, distribution, and consumption are undergoing significant transformations. This literature review examines the complex interplay between energy politics and climate change, focusing on the challenges and opportunities presented by the clean energy transition.The global energy landscape has long been dominated by fossil fuels, particularly oil, which has played a central role in shaping international relations and economic development. However, as Goldthau and Sovacool (2012) argue, the imperative to mitigate climate change is driving a shift towards cleaner energy sources, fundamentally altering the geopolitical dynamics of energy. This transition is not merely a technological challenge but a deeply political process, involving complex negotiations between various stakeholders at local, national, and international levels.One of the key areas of consensus among scholars is the identification of potential winners and losers in the clean energy transition. Meckling and Hughes (2018) provide a comprehensive analysis of the distributive politics of decarbonization, highlighting how different countries and sectors are likely to be affected. They argue that while some nations rich in renewable energy resources stand to benefit, others heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports may face significant economic challenges. This perspective is echoed by Vakulchuk et al. (2020), who examine the geopolitical implications of the energy transition for oil-exporting countries.However, political scientists often diverge from other disciplines in their assessment of the obstacles to the clean energy transition. While economists and physical scientists tend to focus on technological and market-based barriers, political scientists emphasize the role of institutional inertia, vested interests, and power dynamics. Stokes and Breetz (2018) demonstrate how incumbent fossil fuel industries often wield significant political influence to slow or obstruct clean energy policies. Similarly, Newell and Johnstone (2018) argue that the politics of energy transitions are shaped by complex socio-technical systems that resist rapid change.The persistence of fossil fuel politics alongside emerging clean energy dynamics is a crucial theme in the literature. Bridge and Bradshaw (2017) contend that despite the push for decarbonization, oil remains a critical geopolitical resource, with its production and trade continuing to shape international relations. This view is supported by Van de Graaf and Bradshaw (2018), who argue that the clean energy transition is likely to be a protracted process, during which traditional energy geopolitics will coexist with new forms of competition and cooperation around renewable technologies.The role of state actors in shaping energy transitions is another important area of research. Kuzemko et al. (2016) examine how different types of political economies influence national approaches to energy policy and climate change mitigation. They find that state-market relations, political institutions, and ideas about the role of government all play crucial roles in determining the pace and direction of energy transitions.International cooperation and conflict in the context of climate change and energy transitions have also received significant scholarly attention. Colgan et al. (2021) analyze the potential for new forms of international cooperation around clean energy technologies, while also warning of the risks of increased competition for critical minerals and other resources essential for renewable energy systems. This perspective is complemented by Overland et al. (2019), who explore how the shift to renewable energy might reshape global power dynamics and alliances.The literature also highlights the importance of considering energy justice and equity in the clean energy transition. Sovacool et al. (2019) argue that without careful consideration of distributional impacts, the transition to clean energy could exacerbate existing inequalities both within and between nations. This concern is particularly relevant for developing countries, as explored by Akizu-Gardoki et al. (2021), who examine the challenges of balancing energy access, economic development, and climate mitigation in the Global South.In conclusion, the literature on international energy politics in the age of climate change reveals a complex and evolving landscape. While there is broad agreement on the need for a clean energy transition, political scientists emphasize the significant political, institutional, and social barriers to rapid change. The coexistence of traditional fossil fuel politics with emerging clean energy dynamics creates a multifaceted challenge for policymakers and researchers alike. As the world continues to grapple with the urgent need to address climate change, understanding these political dynamics will be crucial for navigating the path towards a sustainable energy future.", "References": [{"title": "The Global Energy Transition and the Global South", "authors": "Akizu-Gardoki, Ortzi and Bueno, Gorka and Wiedmann, Thomas and Lopez-Guede, Jose Manuel and Arto, IÃ±aki and Hernandez, Patxi and Moran, Daniel", "journal": "Energies", "year": "2021", "volumes": "14", "first page": "1539", "last page": "1539", "DOI": "10.3390/en14061539"}, {"title": "Global Energy Governance in a Multipolar World", "authors": "Goldthau, Andreas and Sovacool, Benjamin K.", "journal": "Global Policy", "year": "2012", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00121.x"}, {"title": "Global Energy and Climate Governance: Towards an Integrated Architecture", "authors": "Kuzemko, Caroline and Lockwood, Matthew and Mitchell, Catherine and Hoggett, Richard", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2016.1252265"}, {"title": "Global Energy Transition and the Political Economy of Clean Energy", "authors": "Meckling, Jonas and Hughes, Llewelyn", "journal": "International Studies Quarterly", "year": "2018", "volumes": "62", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1093/isq/sqx028"}, {"title": "The Politics of Accelerating Low-Carbon Transitions: Towards a New Research Agenda", "authors": "Newell, Peter and Johnstone, Phil", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "44", "first page": "304", "last page": "311", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2018.06.001"}, {"title": "The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy: Debunking Four Emerging Myths", "authors": "Overland, Indra and Bazilian, Morgan and Ilimbek Uulu, Talgat and Vakulchuk, Roman and Westphal, Kirsten", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "49", "first page": "36", "last page": "40", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018"}, {"title": "Decarbonization and Its Discontents: A Critical Energy Justice Perspective on Four Low-Carbon Transitions", "authors": "Sovacool, Benjamin K. and Burke, Matthew and Baker, Lucy and Kotikalapudi, Chaitanya Kumar and Wlokas, Holle", "journal": "Climatic Change", "year": "2019", "volumes": "155", "first page": "581", "last page": "619", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-019-02521-7"}, {"title": "Accelerating Low-Carbon Transitions: Towards a Political Economy Framework", "authors": "Stokes, Leah C. and Breetz, Hanna L.", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "44", "first page": "11", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2018.04.027"}, {"title": "The Geopolitical Economy of a Globalizing Gas Market", "authors": "Van de Graaf, Thijs and Bradshaw, Michael", "journal": "Handbook of the International Political Economy of Energy and Natural Resources", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "39", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.4337/9781783475636.00012"}, {"title": "The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy: Debunking Four Emerging Myths", "authors": "Vakulchuk, Roman and Overland, Indra and Scholten, Daniel", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "49", "first page": "36", "last page": "40", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018"}]}
