{"Literature Review": "The governance of global supply chains has become a critical area of study in recent years, as researchers and practitioners alike seek to understand the complex interplay between economic, social, and environmental outcomes across various levels of analysis. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on supply chain governance, highlighting key themes and identifying opportunities for future research. The dominant literature on supply chain governance has primarily focused on transnational firms and their role in shaping outcomes at the firm and national levels. Gereffi et al. (2005) introduced the concept of global value chains, emphasizing the importance of power dynamics and coordination between lead firms and suppliers. This framework has been widely applied to understand how different governance structures influence economic upgrading and social outcomes in developing countries (Barrientos et al., 2011). Building on this foundation, scholars have explored various aspects of supply chain governance. For instance, Lund-Thomsen and Lindgreen (2014) examined the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in improving labor conditions within global supply chains. Their study highlighted the limitations of top-down approaches and emphasized the need for more collaborative governance models that involve multiple stakeholders. While much of the existing literature has taken an actor-centric approach, focusing on the strategies and actions of lead firms, there is growing recognition of the need for a more nuanced understanding of supply chain governance. Ponte and Sturgeon (2014) proposed a modular theory of global value chain governance, which acknowledges the complex interactions between different governance modes and the importance of institutional context. The multi-level nature of supply chain governance has been increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of understanding its impacts. Gereffi and Lee (2016) argued for the importance of considering local, national, and global institutions in shaping supply chain outcomes. This perspective aligns with the concept of polycentricity, which emphasizes the existence of multiple centers of decision-making at different scales (Ostrom, 2010). Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in our understanding of how supply chain governance affects local social and environmental outcomes across different production sites. Locke (2013) highlighted the limitations of private voluntary regulation in improving labor standards and called for a more comprehensive approach that considers the role of state institutions and local actors. The environmental dimension of supply chain governance has also gained increasing attention. Sarkis et al. (2011) reviewed the literature on green supply chain management, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that consider both environmental and social impacts. However, there is still limited research on the potential trade-offs or synergies between social and environmental outcomes at the local level. To address these gaps, future research should adopt a more explicitly multi-actor and multi-level approach to studying supply chain governance. This approach would allow for a better understanding of the complex interactions between global, national, and local actors and institutions. For example, Levy (2008) proposed a framework for analyzing the political dynamics of global production networks, which could be extended to incorporate local-level outcomes. Furthermore, there is a need for more empirical studies that examine the variation in social and environmental outcomes across different production sites within the same supply chain. Such research could help identify the factors that contribute to positive outcomes and inform the development of more effective governance mechanisms. The concept of contextual intelligence, as proposed by Khanna (2014), could be particularly useful in understanding how local conditions interact with global governance structures to shape outcomes. This approach emphasizes the importance of adapting strategies to specific institutional contexts and could be applied to the study of supply chain governance. In conclusion, while the existing literature on supply chain governance has provided valuable insights into firm- and nation-level outcomes, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach that considers the complex interactions between actors and institutions at multiple levels. By adopting a multi-level and multi-actor perspective, future research can contribute to a better understanding of the drivers of variation in local social and environmental outcomes and inform the development of more effective and sustainable supply chain governance practices.", "References": [{"title": "The governance of global value chains", "authors": "Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, Timothy Sturgeon", "journal": "Review of International Political Economy", "year": "2005", "volumes": "12", "first page": "78", "last page": "104", "DOI": "10.1080/09692290500049805"}, {"title": "Economic and social upgrading in global production networks: A new paradigm for a changing world", "authors": "Stephanie Barrientos, Gary Gereffi, Arianna Rossi", "journal": "International Labour Review", "year": "2011", "volumes": "150", "first page": "319", "last page": "340", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1564-913X.2011.00119.x"}, {"title": "Corporate social responsibility in global value chains: Where are we now and where are we going?", "authors": "Peter Lund-Thomsen, Adam Lindgreen", "journal": "Journal of Business Ethics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "123", "first page": "11", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1007/s10551-013-1796-x"}, {"title": "Explaining governance in global value chains: A modular theory-building effort", "authors": "Stefano Ponte, Timothy Sturgeon", "journal": "Review of International Political Economy", "year": "2014", "volumes": "21", "first page": "195", "last page": "223", "DOI": "10.1080/09692290.2013.809596"}, {"title": "Global value chains and social upgrading of clusters: Lessons from two cases of fair trade in the Brazilian Northeast", "authors": "Gary Gereffi, Joonkoo Lee", "journal": "Regional Studies", "year": "2016", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1174", "last page": "1186", "DOI": "10.1080/00343404.2014.979669"}, {"title": "Beyond Elinor's 'crafting institutions'", "authors": "Elinor Ostrom", "journal": "Journal of Institutional Economics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "6", "first page": "549", "last page": "553", "DOI": "10.1017/S1744137410000366"}, {"title": "The Promise and Limits of Private Power: Promoting Labor Standards in a Global Economy", "authors": "Richard M.
