{"Literature Review": "The economic backgrounds of politicians have become a focal point of renewed interest in political science research, reflecting growing concerns about the representativeness of democratic institutions. This literature review examines recent studies on the economic characteristics of politicians, their implications for political behavior, and the broader consequences for democratic representation. A consistent finding across recent studies is that politicians tend to be significantly more economically advantaged than the general population they represent. Carnes and Lupu (2015) conducted a comprehensive analysis of legislative bodies in 30 countries, revealing that working-class citizens are dramatically underrepresented in politics worldwide. They found that workers constitute an average of only 13% of legislatures, despite making up a majority of the workforce in most countries. This economic disparity is not limited to legislative bodies; similar patterns have been observed in executive positions and other political offices (Dal Bó et al., 2017). The economic advantages of politicians extend beyond income to include factors such as wealth, education, and occupational background. Beach and Jones (2017) examined the wealth of U.S. Congress members, finding that the median net worth of legislators was more than five times that of the median American household. In terms of education, Bovens and Wille (2017) documented a growing 'diploma democracy' in Western countries, where highly educated individuals are increasingly overrepresented in political positions. This economic and educational gap between politicians and citizens has significant implications for political decision-making and policy outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated that politicians from different economic backgrounds tend to have divergent policy preferences and voting behaviors. For instance, Carnes (2013) found that U.S. legislators from working-class backgrounds were more likely to support labor-friendly policies and vote for redistributive measures compared to their more affluent colleagues. The impact of politicians' economic backgrounds extends beyond voting behavior to other aspects of political representation. Hemingway (2020) showed that legislators from privileged backgrounds were less likely to prioritize constituent service activities that primarily benefit lower-income citizens. Similarly, Rosset et al. (2013) found that economically advantaged politicians were less responsive to the policy preferences of low-income voters. While there is a growing consensus about the existence and consequences of economic disparities among politicians, the literature is less unified in explaining why politicians tend to be so economically advantaged. Several competing theories have been proposed. One perspective, advanced by Bernardi and Pritoni (2021), suggests that the high costs associated with running for office create significant barriers for less affluent candidates. Another explanation, proposed by Thomsen (2014), focuses on party gatekeepers and recruitment processes that favor candidates with greater financial resources and professional networks. Some scholars have explored the role of voter preferences in perpetuating the economic advantage of politicians. Campbell and Cowley (2014) conducted experimental studies suggesting that voters often prefer candidates with higher socioeconomic status, perceiving them as more competent and capable leaders. However, other research has challenged this view, indicating that voters may actually prefer candidates from more modest backgrounds under certain circumstances (Carnes and Lupu, 2016). The intersection of economic background with other social characteristics, such as race and gender, adds another layer of complexity to this field of study. Lawless and Fox (2010) found that the underrepresentation of women in politics is partly explained by gender differences in personal income and access to networks of wealth. Similarly, Shah (2014) demonstrated how the interplay between class and race affects the political representation of minority groups. As research in this area continues to evolve, several promising avenues for future investigation emerge. First, there is a need for more comparative studies that examine how the economic backgrounds of politicians vary across different political systems and cultural contexts. Second, longitudinal studies could provide valuable insights into how the economic composition of political institutions has changed over time and what factors have driven these changes. Finally, more research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms linking politicians' economic backgrounds to their behavior in office and to explore potential interventions that could increase the economic diversity of political representatives. In conclusion, the growing body of literature on the economic backgrounds of politicians highlights significant disparities between political elites and the general population. These disparities have important implications for political behavior, policy outcomes, and the quality of democratic representation. While scholars have made considerable progress in documenting and analyzing these patterns, many questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding the underlying causes of economic advantage in politics and potential strategies for promoting greater economic diversity among political representatives.", "References": [{"title": "Why are there so few working-class people in political office?
