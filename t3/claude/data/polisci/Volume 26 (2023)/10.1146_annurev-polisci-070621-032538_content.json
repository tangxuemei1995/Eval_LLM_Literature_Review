{"Literature Review": "The political landscape of the United States has been significantly influenced by the growing presence and engagement of Asian Americans, a diverse and rapidly expanding demographic group. This literature review examines the evolving role of Asian Americans in twenty-first-century politics, focusing on their racial formation, civic engagement, political participation, partisanship, and representation.The racial formation and positioning of Asian Americans within the broader racial landscape of the United States have been subjects of extensive scholarly inquiry. Wong et al. (2011) argue that the 'model minority' myth has played a crucial role in shaping the racial identity of Asian Americans, often positioning them as a 'wedge' between white and black Americans. This racial triangulation theory, first proposed by Kim (1999), continues to influence how Asian Americans are perceived and how they navigate political spaces.The history of Asian American civic engagement provides essential context for understanding their contemporary political involvement. Lee (2015) traces the evolution of Asian American political activism from the early 20th century to the present, highlighting key moments such as the civil rights movement and the campaign for Japanese American redress. This historical perspective reveals a long-standing tradition of political engagement, despite periods of exclusion and discrimination.Political participation among Asian Americans has been a growing area of research. Ramakrishnan et al. (2017) conducted a comprehensive study of Asian American voting behavior, finding that while participation rates have increased over time, they still lag behind those of other racial groups. The authors attribute this gap to factors such as language barriers, lack of outreach from political parties, and the immigrant backgrounds of many Asian Americans.Partisanship and vote choice among Asian Americans have also attracted scholarly attention. Wong et al. (2011) note that Asian Americans have increasingly aligned with the Democratic Party in recent decades, a trend that has continued in subsequent elections. However, Kuo et al. (2017) caution against treating Asian Americans as a monolithic voting bloc, highlighting significant variations in political preferences across different ethnic subgroups and generations.Issue orientations among Asian Americans have been explored in relation to both domestic and foreign policy. Junn et al. (2008) find that Asian Americans tend to hold progressive views on issues such as healthcare, education, and immigration reform. In terms of foreign policy, Kuo (2017) examines how Asian Americans' transnational ties influence their attitudes towards U.S. relations with their countries of origin.The political representation of Asian Americans has been a persistent challenge. Lai et al. (2013) document the gradual increase in Asian American elected officials at various levels of government but note that representation still falls short of population parity. The authors argue that factors such as racial stereotypes, lack of political networks, and campaign finance disparities contribute to this underrepresentation.Recent research has also focused on the role of Asian Americans in contemporary activism and social movements. Ocampo (2018) examines the involvement of Asian Americans in the Black Lives Matter movement, highlighting the potential for cross-racial coalitions. This work speaks to the broader question of Asian Americans' racial positioning and its implications for political alliances.The intersection of gender and race in Asian American politics has emerged as an important area of study. Lien (2010) provides a comprehensive analysis of how gender shapes political participation and representation among Asian Americans, revealing both progress and persistent challenges for Asian American women in politics.Looking to the future, scholars have identified several key areas for further research. Lee and Ramakrishnan (2020) call for more nuanced studies of pan-ethnic Asian American identity formation and its political consequences. They argue that understanding the complexities of this process is crucial for predicting future voting patterns and policy preferences.In conclusion, the literature on Asian Americans and twenty-first-century politics reveals a complex and dynamic picture. While Asian Americans have made significant strides in political engagement and representation, challenges remain. Future research must continue to explore the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, and generational status in shaping Asian American political behavior and outcomes. As the Asian American population continues to grow and diversify, their role in shaping American politics is likely to become increasingly significant in the years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Asian American Political Participation: Emerging Constituents and Their Political Identities", "authors": "Janelle Wong, S.
