{"Literature Review": "The South has long occupied a unique position in American political development, with its distinctive history, culture, and institutions shaping both regional and national politics. Recent scholarship has shifted away from the traditional view of the South as gradually converging with the rest of the nation, instead emphasizing the region's enduring commitment to white supremacy and its profound influence on national politics and institutions. This literature review examines recent works on the South in American political development, focusing on the interpretive issues they raise and the debates they have sparked.One of the most significant shifts in recent scholarship has been the recognition of the South's outsized influence on national politics. Mickey (2015) argues that the South's political institutions and practices have had a determining effect on the development of American democracy, challenging the notion of the region as an outlier. Similarly, Katznelson (2013) demonstrates how southern Democrats in Congress shaped New Deal and Fair Deal policies to preserve racial hierarchies, effectively nationalizing aspects of the southern racial order.The sources of southern influence have been a subject of debate among scholars. Crespino (2007) emphasizes the role of conservative ideology in shaping southern politics and its national impact, while Lowndes (2008) focuses on the importance of race and white supremacy as organizing principles. These differing perspectives highlight the complex interplay between ideology, race, and political institutions in understanding southern influence.Two broad pathways of southern influence have emerged in recent literature. The first pathway emphasizes the South's role in shaping national institutions and policies. Bateman, Katznelson, and Lapinski (2018) demonstrate how southern representatives in Congress used their disproportionate power to influence legislation and maintain racial hierarchies. This institutional approach is complemented by works such as Frymer (2017), which examines how southern interests shaped labor law and union development in ways that reinforced racial divisions.The second pathway focuses on the South's cultural and ideological influence on national politics. Maxwell and Shields (2019) argue that southern racial attitudes have spread beyond the region, shaping white racial views nationwide. This cultural diffusion of southern racial ideology has had profound implications for national politics, as explored by Jardina (2019) in her analysis of white identity politics.Recent works on southern regimes have also provoked significant debate. Gibson (2012) characterizes the Jim Crow South as an authoritarian enclave within a democratic nation, challenging traditional conceptions of American democracy. This perspective has been both influential and controversial, with scholars such as Mickey (2015) building on this framework while others have critiqued its applicability.The debate over southern regimes extends to the post-Civil Rights era. Shafer and Johnston (2006) argue that the South has become more like the rest of the nation in its politics, while still maintaining distinct cultural characteristics. In contrast, Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell, and Maya Sen (2018) contend that the legacy of slavery continues to shape southern politics and racial attitudes, suggesting a more enduring form of regional distinctiveness.The role of class and economic factors in shaping southern politics has also been a subject of recent scholarship. Metzl (2019) explores how racial resentment has led working-class white southerners to support policies that undermine their own economic interests. This work contributes to ongoing debates about the relative importance of race and class in southern political behavior.While recent scholarship has made significant contributions to our understanding of the South in American political development, it also has limitations. Many works tend to treat the South as a monolithic entity, overlooking important intraregional variations. Additionally, the focus on white supremacy, while crucial, sometimes overshadows other important factors shaping southern politics, such as religion, urbanization, and economic change.In conclusion, recent literature on the South in American political development has significantly reshaped our understanding of the region's role in national politics. By emphasizing the South's enduring commitment to white supremacy and its determining influence on national institutions and policies, scholars have challenged long-held assumptions about regional convergence and American democracy. However, as research in this field continues to evolve, it is likely that some of the more sweeping interpretive claims will be refined, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the South's complex role in American political development.", "References": [{"title": "The New Southern Politics", "authors": "J.
