{"Literature Review": "The politics of global health governance has evolved significantly over the past century, reflecting changing power dynamics, economic interests, and global health priorities. This literature review traces the development of global health governance through seven distinct eras, from imperialism to the current COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting key themes and debates that have shaped the field.The roots of global health governance can be traced back to the era of imperialism and colonialism, where health interventions were often used as tools of colonial control and economic exploitation. Packard (2016) argues that early international health efforts were primarily focused on protecting colonial interests and trade routes rather than improving the health of local populations. This period saw the establishment of the first international health organizations, such as the Office International d'Hygiène Publique in 1907, which laid the groundwork for future global health institutions (Fidler, 2001).The post-World War II era marked a significant shift in global health governance with the establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948. Brown et al. (2006) describe how the WHO's initial focus on disease eradication campaigns, such as the successful smallpox eradication program, helped establish its legitimacy as a global health leader. However, Chorev (2012) notes that Cold War politics and tensions between developed and developing countries often influenced WHO priorities and decision-making processes.The 1970s and 1980s saw a growing emphasis on primary health care and health system strengthening, as exemplified by the 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration. However, Cueto (2004) argues that this comprehensive approach was soon overshadowed by the rise of selective primary health care, which focused on cost-effective interventions targeting specific diseases. This shift reflected the growing influence of neoliberal economic policies and the increasing role of non-state actors in global health governance.The HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s marked a turning point in global health governance, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and spurring new forms of activism and collaboration. Buse and Walt (2000) describe how the emergence of public-private partnerships, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, transformed the landscape of global health financing and governance. These new arrangements brought increased resources and attention to global health issues but also raised concerns about accountability and the influence of private sector interests.The early 2000s ushered in what some scholars have termed the 'golden age' of global health. Garrett (2007) notes that this period saw unprecedented levels of funding and political attention directed towards global health issues, particularly HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The creation of new initiatives such as the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation significantly altered the power dynamics in global health governance, sometimes overshadowing traditional multilateral institutions like the WHO.However, this golden age was not without its critics. Gostin (2014) argues that the focus on vertical disease-specific programs often came at the expense of broader health system strengthening efforts, creating parallel structures that sometimes undermined national health systems. Additionally, the emphasis on infectious diseases in the Global South reflected ongoing power imbalances in global health priority-setting, with the interests of high-income countries often taking precedence.The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa exposed significant weaknesses in the global health governance system, particularly in terms of outbreak preparedness and response. Moon et al. (2015) highlight how this crisis led to renewed calls for WHO reform and increased investment in global health security. This period also saw growing recognition of the importance of addressing non-communicable diseases and social determinants of health, as reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought global health governance to the forefront of international politics, reinforcing the centrality of states in responding to health crises while also highlighting the limitations of current governance structures. Kickbusch and Gitahi (2020) argue that the pandemic has exposed deep inequalities in global health and the need for more robust and equitable governance mechanisms. The crisis has also reignited debates about the appropriate balance between national sovereignty and global cooperation in addressing transnational health threats.As we move forward, the field of global health governance faces several key challenges and debates. These include addressing persistent health inequities, balancing infectious disease control with broader health system strengthening, navigating the complex relationships between state and non-state actors, and developing more effective mechanisms for global health security and pandemic preparedness. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of effective global health governance in an increasingly interconnected world.", "References": [{"title": "The World Health Organization and the Transition From 'International' to 'Global' Public Health", "authors": "Theodore M.
