{"Literature Review": "The study of nonviolent resistance has gained significant traction in recent years, with scholars examining the effectiveness of unarmed collective action in achieving political and social change. However, the role of violence within predominantly nonviolent movements remains a contentious and complex issue. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of how various forms of violence interact with and impact nonviolent resistance movements.Nonviolent resistance, characterized by coordinated protests, strikes, and boycotts, has been shown to be an effective method for challenging oppressive regimes and promoting social change. Chenoweth and Stephan's seminal work demonstrated that nonviolent campaigns have been more successful than violent insurgencies in achieving their goals, particularly in the context of regime change and self-determination movements. Their study of 323 violent and nonviolent campaigns between 1900 and 2006 found that nonviolent resistance campaigns were nearly twice as likely to achieve full or partial success compared to violent campaigns.Despite the effectiveness of nonviolent methods, many movements experience some degree of violence, either from within their ranks or from external actors. This phenomenon has led to the concept of 'violent flanks' – groups or actions within a broader nonviolent movement that engage in violent tactics. The impact of these violent flanks on movement outcomes has been a subject of considerable debate among scholars.Some researchers argue that the presence of violent flanks can be beneficial to nonviolent movements. Haines proposed the 'radical flank effect' theory, suggesting that the presence of more radical or violent elements can make moderate factions appear more reasonable and increase their chances of negotiation success. This perspective has found some support in case studies, such as Pearlman's analysis of the Palestinian national movement, which highlighted instances where violent flanks created leverage for nonviolent activists.However, the majority of empirical evidence suggests that violent flanks are more likely to hinder than help nonviolent movements. Chenoweth and Schock's comparative study of nonviolent campaigns found that those with violent flanks were less likely to achieve their goals than purely nonviolent movements. They argue that violent actions can undermine the moral and practical advantages of nonviolent resistance, such as the potential to win over security forces and maintain broad-based participation.The relationship between violence and movement outcomes becomes more nuanced when considering different types and scales of violent action. Wasow's research on the U.S. civil rights movement demonstrated that peaceful protests increased Democratic vote share in proximate counties, while violent protests had the opposite effect, benefiting Republican candidates. This study highlights the importance of distinguishing between organized armed violence and more spontaneous, unarmed collective violence or riots.Recent scholarship has attempted to provide a more granular analysis of violent actions within nonviolent movements. Pinckney's work on civil resistance campaigns in Africa found that limited violent actions, particularly those targeting property rather than people, did not significantly reduce a movement's chances of success. However, more intense or sustained violence was associated with decreased likelihood of achieving campaign goals.The media's role in framing violent events within nonviolent movements is another crucial factor to consider. Sutton, Butcher, and Svensson's analysis of international news coverage of the Arab Spring uprisings revealed that reports of violence tended to overshadow nonviolent actions, potentially influencing public perception and international support for these movements.The directionality of the relationship between violence and nonviolent resistance is also an important area of inquiry. While much research focuses on how violent actions impact nonviolent movements, some scholars have examined how the emergence of nonviolent campaigns affects ongoing armed conflicts. Dudouet's work on conflict transformation suggests that nonviolent movements can sometimes emerge from, and ultimately supplant, armed struggles.As the field of nonviolent resistance studies continues to evolve, researchers are calling for greater analytical precision in examining the effects of violent flanks. Factors such as the timing, intensity, and nature of violent actions, as well as the specific political and social context in which they occur, all play crucial roles in determining outcomes.In conclusion, while the presence of violent flanks within nonviolent movements remains a common phenomenon, the balance of evidence suggests that organized armed violence tends to reduce the chances of success for otherwise nonviolent campaigns. The effects of unarmed collective violence, such as riots or property destruction, appear more ambiguous and context-dependent. Future research in this field would benefit from more nuanced categorizations of violent actions, consideration of media framing effects, and longitudinal studies to better understand the complex dynamics between violence and nonviolent resistance over time.", "References": [{"title": "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", "authors": "Erica Chenoweth, Maria J.
