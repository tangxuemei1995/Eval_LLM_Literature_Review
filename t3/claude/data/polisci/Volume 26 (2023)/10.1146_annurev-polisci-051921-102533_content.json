{"Literature Review": "The concept of agenda democracy, as introduced in this study, represents a significant shift in our understanding of democratic processes and their relationship to agenda setting. This review explores the existing literature on agenda setting, democratic theory, and related concepts to contextualize the importance of this new framework. Agenda setting has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of political processes. McCombs and Shaw's (1972) seminal work on media agenda setting laid the foundation for understanding how issues gain prominence in public discourse. However, as noted by Walgrave and Van Aelst (2006), the focus has often been on media influence rather than broader political dynamics. The disconnect between agenda setting and democratic theory, as highlighted in the abstract, is indeed a curious development. Schattschneider's (1960) seminal work on the 'mobilization of bias' in political systems provides a crucial starting point for understanding this relationship. He argued that the organization of politics is the mobilization of bias, emphasizing how certain issues are organized into politics while others are organized out. Dahl's (1961) concept of polyarchy further enriched our understanding of democracy, emphasizing the importance of contestation and participation. However, as Bachrach and Baratz (1962) pointed out, Dahl's approach did not fully account for the 'second face of power' - the ability to prevent issues from reaching the agenda in the first place. The concept of agenda democracy builds on these foundational works and recent developments in political theory. It aligns with Dryzek's (2000) emphasis on deliberative democracy, which highlights the importance of inclusive and authentic dialogue in shaping political agendas. Similarly, Young's (2000) work on inclusive democracy underscores the need to consider diverse voices in agenda-setting processes. The broad understanding of agendas proposed in this study resonates with Kingdon's (1984) multiple streams framework, which views agenda setting as a complex interplay of problems, policies, and politics. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how issues rise to prominence and how institutional structures shape these processes. The recognition that many democratic regimes have institutions that systematically render agendas nondemocratic echoes Lukes' (2005) third dimension of power, which focuses on how political systems shape people's preferences and perceptions of what is possible. This perspective is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of inequality generation and maintenance mentioned in the abstract. The emphasis on examining the interstices of institutions and society aligns with recent work on contentious politics by McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly (2001). Their dynamic, interactive model of contentious politics provides a framework for understanding how social movements, advocacy campaigns, and other forms of collective action can influence agenda-setting processes. The concept of agenda democracy also resonates with recent work on democratic innovations. Smith's (2009) analysis of democratic innovations highlights the potential of new institutional designs to enhance citizen participation in agenda-setting processes. Similarly, Fung and Wright's (2003) concept of empowered participatory governance provides insights into how institutions can be designed to promote more inclusive agenda-setting processes. The call to examine democratizing agenda restrictions aligns with recent work on democratic backsliding (Bermeo, 2016). This perspective highlights the importance of understanding how democratic institutions can be eroded over time, including through subtle changes in agenda-setting processes. Finally, the consideration of decomposing the term 'movement' reflects recent debates in social movement theory. As della Porta and Diani (2020) note, the boundaries between social movements, interest groups, and other forms of collective action are increasingly blurred in contemporary politics. In conclusion, the concept of agenda democracy offers a promising framework for integrating insights from agenda setting, democratic theory, and social movement studies. By focusing on the processes through which issues are included or excluded from political agendas, it provides a new lens for understanding democratic processes and their challenges in contemporary societies.", "References": [{"title": "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media", "authors": "Maxwell E.
