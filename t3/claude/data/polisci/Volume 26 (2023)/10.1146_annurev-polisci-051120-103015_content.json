{"Literature Review": "The intersection of politics, policy, and public health has become increasingly apparent in recent years, particularly in light of global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as noted by Greer et al. (2017), political science has not yet made a significant contribution to understanding the political economy of health, despite its unique position to analyze the complex relationships between power structures, policy decisions, and health outcomes. The political economy of health is a multifaceted field that examines how political, economic, and social factors influence population health and health equity. This approach recognizes that health outcomes are not solely determined by individual behaviors or medical interventions but are deeply rooted in broader societal structures and power dynamics (Bambra et al., 2019). One key aspect of the political economy of health is the concept of social determinants of health (SDH). These are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels (Marmot et al., 2020). Political scientists are well-positioned to analyze how political processes and power structures influence these social determinants and, consequently, health outcomes. The role of policy in shaping population health is another critical area where political science can contribute significantly. Policies across various sectors, including education, housing, employment, and environmental protection, have profound impacts on health outcomes (Kickbusch, 2015). For instance, Beckfield and Krieger (2009) demonstrated how welfare state policies can influence health inequalities, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the political determinants of health. Health systems themselves are inherently political constructs, shaped by historical legacies, power dynamics, and competing interests. Greer et al. (2019) argue that understanding health system reform requires a deep analysis of political institutions, interest groups, and policy processes. Political scientists can provide valuable insights into how these factors interact to shape health system design and performance. The global nature of many health challenges, from infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases, necessitates an understanding of global health governance. Brown and Held (2017) emphasize the importance of analyzing power dynamics in global health institutions and the role of various actors, including nation-states, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations, in shaping global health policies. Health equity, or the absence of avoidable and unfair differences in health outcomes between population groups, is a central concern in the political economy of health. Navarro (2009) argues that political ideologies and power structures play a crucial role in determining the distribution of health resources and outcomes. Political scientists can contribute to this field by examining how different political systems and ideologies influence health equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for a political economy approach to health. Greer et al. (2020) demonstrate how variations in political systems, leadership, and policy responses have led to dramatically different outcomes across countries. This underscores the importance of understanding the political context in which health policies are formulated and implemented. Climate change represents another critical area where political science can contribute to understanding health outcomes. Watts et al. (2021) argue that addressing the health impacts of climate change requires a deep understanding of political processes, international negotiations, and policy implementation at multiple levels of governance. As we move forward, there is a pressing need for political scientists to engage more deeply with health issues. This engagement should go beyond traditional health policy analysis to examine the fundamental power structures and political processes that shape population health. By bringing their unique analytical tools and perspectives to bear on these issues, political scientists can make significant contributions to understanding and addressing the complex challenges facing global health in the 21st century. In conclusion, the political economy of health represents a rich and largely untapped area for political science research. By examining the pathways and mechanisms through which power configurations influence health outcomes and equity, political scientists can provide crucial insights into the complex interplay between politics, policy, and public health. This approach has the potential to inform more effective and equitable health policies and contribute to improving population health outcomes globally.", "References": [{"title": "Bringing the state back in: Understanding and validating measures of governments' political commitment to HIV", "authors": "Scott L.
