{"Literature Review": "Political inequality has become a growing concern in rich democracies, as it threatens the fundamental principles of democratic governance. This literature review examines the current state of research on political inequality, focusing on two key aspects: participation and representation. We explore how rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions have impacted political participation and investigate the links between substantive and descriptive representation.Participation in democratic processes is a cornerstone of political equality. However, research has consistently shown that individuals with fewer resources participate less in political activities compared to those with more resources (Verba et al., 1995). This participation gap has been exacerbated by rising income inequality in many rich democracies. Solt (2008) found that higher levels of income inequality are associated with lower political engagement among low-income individuals, while the wealthy maintain high levels of participation. This trend creates a self-reinforcing cycle, where the politically active wealthy have more influence over policy decisions, potentially leading to policies that further increase inequality.The weakening of trade unions has also contributed to political inequality. Historically, unions have played a crucial role in mobilizing working-class voters and advocating for their interests (Rosenfeld, 2014). However, union membership has declined significantly in many rich democracies over the past few decades. This decline has had a detrimental effect on political participation among lower-income groups. Flavin and Radcliff (2011) demonstrated that higher union density is associated with increased voter turnout, particularly among less-educated and lower-income individuals.The erosion of collective organizations like unions has left individual resources as the primary determinant of political participation. This shift has made it increasingly difficult for less-resourced individuals to counter the growing political influence of the wealthy. Schlozman et al. (2012) argue that this trend has led to a 'participation paradox,' where those who would benefit most from political engagement are the least likely to participate.Turning to representation, research has revealed similar patterns of inequality. Both substantive and descriptive representation tend to favor higher-status social groups. Substantive representation refers to the extent to which policymakers act in the interests of their constituents, while descriptive representation concerns the demographic similarity between representatives and the represented.In terms of substantive representation, numerous studies have found that the opinions and preferences of decision-makers are more congruent with those of wealthier citizens. Gilens and Page (2014) conducted a comprehensive analysis of U.S. policy decisions and concluded that economic elites and organized business interests have substantial independent impacts on policy, while average citizens have little to no independent influence. This finding suggests a significant bias in policy responsiveness towards the preferences of the affluent.The issue of unequal representation extends beyond the United States. Across rich democracies, Peters and Ensink (2015) found that governments are generally more responsive to the preferences of high-income citizens than to those of low-income citizens. This pattern of unequal responsiveness has been observed in various policy areas, including social welfare, economic regulation, and taxation.Descriptive representation, while distinct from substantive representation, may also play a role in perpetuating political inequality. The underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in political institutions can lead to a lack of attention to their specific needs and interests. Carnes and Lupu (2015) found that legislators from working-class backgrounds are more likely to support policies that benefit lower-income groups, suggesting that descriptive representation can influence substantive outcomes.However, the relationship between descriptive and substantive representation is complex. While increasing the descriptive representation of underrepresented groups can lead to more diverse perspectives in policymaking, it does not guarantee improved substantive representation. Pitkin (1967) argued that the mere presence of demographically similar representatives does not ensure that they will act in the interests of their group.The growing social distance between rulers and ruled in rich democracies further exacerbates political inequality. As political elites become increasingly disconnected from the experiences and concerns of ordinary citizens, representative democracy becomes more biased in favor of higher-status social groups. This disconnect can lead to a decline in trust in political institutions and a sense of alienation among less privileged citizens (Dalton, 2017).In conclusion, the literature on political inequality in rich democracies paints a concerning picture. Both participation and representation show clear patterns of bias favoring those with greater resources and higher social status. The weakening of collective organizations like trade unions has left individual resources as the primary determinant of political engagement, making it difficult for less-resourced individuals to counter these trends. As the gap between the politically active and inactive widens, and as representatives become less responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens, the fundamental principles of democratic equality are increasingly under threat. Addressing these issues will require concerted efforts to strengthen collective organizations, reduce economic inequality, and create more inclusive political institutions.", "References": [{"title": "Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics", "authors": "Sidney Verba, Kay Lehman Schlozman, Henry E.
