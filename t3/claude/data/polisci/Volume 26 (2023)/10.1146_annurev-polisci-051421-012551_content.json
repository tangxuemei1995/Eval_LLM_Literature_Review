{"Literature Review": "The study of environmental effects on politics has gained significant traction in recent years, with a growing body of literature exploring how local contexts shape political behavior, particularly through interpersonal contact with social out-groups. This literature review aims to synthesize current research on context and contact in political science, highlighting key findings, methodological approaches, and areas for future investigation.The foundation of this research agenda lies in the classic contact theory, first proposed by Gordon Allport in 1954. Allport's hypothesis suggested that under certain conditions, intergroup contact could reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. While this theory has been extensively studied in social psychology, political scientists have increasingly adapted and expanded upon it to explore broader political implications.One significant development in this field has been the expansion of research beyond Western, high-income contexts. Studies have emerged from various lower- and middle-income countries, providing valuable insights into how context and contact operate in diverse political and social environments. For instance, Bhavnani et al. (2014) examined the effects of interethnic proximity on ethnic violence in Nairobi, Kenya, finding that ethnically diverse neighborhoods experienced less violence during periods of political tension.The conceptualization of 'context' itself has evolved in recent literature. While early studies often focused on demographic composition of neighborhoods, more recent work has broadened this definition to include various forms of social, economic, and physical environments. Enos (2017) demonstrated how even subtle changes in the racial composition of train platforms could influence political attitudes, highlighting the importance of considering micro-level contexts.Researchers have also begun to explore how different types of contact influence political behavior. Mousa (2020) conducted a field experiment in post-ISIS Iraq, examining how intergroup contact through soccer leagues affected social cohesion between Christians and Muslims. This study exemplifies the growing interest in understanding how structured, positive interactions can shape political attitudes and behaviors in conflict-affected societies.The intersection of ethnic and class-based contact has emerged as a particularly fruitful area of research. McConnaughy et al. (2010) explored how the interaction of racial and economic contexts influences political participation among Latinos in the United States, demonstrating the complex interplay between different forms of social identity and environmental factors.Methodologically, the field has seen significant advancements. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology has enabled more precise measurements of spatial contexts, allowing researchers to examine neighborhood effects at various scales. Enos and Celaya (2018) utilized high-resolution geocoded data to study how proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border influences attitudes towards immigration, demonstrating the potential of these new methodological approaches.The role of built environments in mediating context and contact effects has gained increasing attention. Nall and Mummolo (2017) examined how highway construction influenced racial attitudes and political behavior in the United States, highlighting how physical infrastructure can shape patterns of intergroup contact and, consequently, political outcomes.In the digital age, researchers have also begun to consider how online environments may mirror or alter the effects of physical contexts. Bail et al. (2018) conducted an experiment exposing Twitter users to opposing political views, finding that such exposure actually increased political polarization, challenging some assumptions about the benefits of cross-cutting exposure in online spaces.Despite these advancements, several challenges and opportunities remain in the study of context and contact effects on politics. First, there is a need for more longitudinal studies to better understand how these effects evolve over time and across generations. Second, while much of the literature has focused on ethnic and racial contexts, there is room for more research on other forms of diversity, such as religious or ideological differences.Furthermore, as globalization and technological advancements continue to reshape social interactions, future research should explore how transnational connections and virtual communities influence political behavior. Additionally, there is a need for more interdisciplinary work, integrating insights from psychology, sociology, and urban planning to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how environments shape political attitudes and behaviors.In conclusion, the study of context and contact effects on politics has evolved significantly, moving beyond the classic contact theory to explore a wide range of environmental influences on political behavior. As this field continues to grow, it promises to provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between social environments and political outcomes, with important implications for policy and practice in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.", "References": [{"title": "A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory", "authors": "Thomas F.
