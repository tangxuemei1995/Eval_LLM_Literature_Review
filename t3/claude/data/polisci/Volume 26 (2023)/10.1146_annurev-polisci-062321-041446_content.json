{"Literature Review": "The concept of racist dehumanization has emerged as a critical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of racial prejudice and discrimination in the United States. This literature review explores the multifaceted processes of racist dehumanization, focusing particularly on its impact on Indigenous and Black communities, and examines its role in shaping contemporary white racial attitudes.Racist dehumanization is a process that constructs and maintains racial hierarchies by categorizing certain groups as fully human (typically white) and others as less than human (non-white). This concept has deep historical roots and continues to influence modern societal structures and attitudes. Haslam and Loughnan (2014) provide a comprehensive overview of dehumanization, emphasizing its pervasive nature in intergroup relations and its role in facilitating violence and discrimination.The dehumanization of Indigenous peoples in the United States has a long and tragic history. Wolfe (2006) argues that the logic of elimination underpinning settler colonialism inherently dehumanizes Indigenous populations, justifying their displacement and cultural erasure. This process of dehumanization has been instrumental in the dispossession of Indigenous lands and the suppression of Indigenous cultures. Coates (2015) further explores how this historical dehumanization continues to shape contemporary policies and attitudes towards Indigenous communities.Similarly, the dehumanization of Black people has been a persistent feature of American society since the era of slavery. Goff et al. (2008) demonstrate how the association of Black people with apes, a classic form of dehumanization, persists in contemporary society and influences perceptions and treatment of Black individuals. This dehumanization has far-reaching consequences, including in the criminal justice system, as highlighted by Alexander (2010) in her seminal work on mass incarceration.The processes of dehumanization are not static but evolve over time. Esses et al. (2013) examine how dehumanization adapts to changing social norms, often taking on more subtle forms in contemporary society. This evolution presents challenges for researchers and policymakers seeking to address racial prejudice, as modern expressions of dehumanization may be less overt but equally pernicious.White racial prejudice, as argued by Bonilla-Silva (2006), can be understood as a product of these historical processes of dehumanization. The author's concept of 'color-blind racism' illustrates how racist ideologies persist in a society that ostensibly rejects overt racism. This perspective aligns with the idea that contemporary white racial attitudes are, in part, a residue of long-standing dehumanizing processes.The impact of racist dehumanization extends beyond individual attitudes to shape institutional structures and policies. Feagin (2013) introduces the concept of the 'white racial frame,' which encompasses not only beliefs and emotions but also interpretive racial narratives and inclinations to discriminatory action. This framework helps explain how dehumanizing attitudes become embedded in societal institutions, perpetuating racial inequalities.Recent research has also explored the psychological mechanisms underlying dehumanization. Kteily and Bruneau (2017) demonstrate that blatant dehumanization is a unique predictor of hostile intergroup attitudes and behavior, distinct from subtle forms of prejudice. Their work underscores the importance of explicitly measuring and addressing dehumanization in efforts to reduce intergroup conflict.The study of racist dehumanization has significant implications for policy and practice. Richeson and Sommers (2016) review the psychological science of racial bias, highlighting the need for interventions that go beyond individual-level prejudice reduction to address systemic and structural manifestations of racism. Their work emphasizes the importance of considering dehumanization in developing comprehensive strategies to combat racial inequality.In conclusion, the concept of racist dehumanization provides a powerful lens through which to examine the persistence of racial prejudice in the United States. By understanding the historical processes of dehumanization and their contemporary manifestations, researchers can gain deeper insights into the nature and consequences of white racial prejudice. This approach opens new avenues for addressing racial inequalities and promoting more just and equitable social structures. Future research in this field should continue to explore the intersections between dehumanization, institutional racism, and individual attitudes, with the goal of developing more effective strategies for combating racial prejudice and discrimination.", "References": [{"title": "Dehumanization: An Integrative Review", "authors": "Nick Haslam, Steve Loughnan", "journal": "Personality and Social Psychology Review", "year": "2014", "volumes": "18", "first page": "26", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1177/1088868313495858"}, {"title": "Settler colonialism and the elimination of the native", "authors": "Patrick Wolfe", "journal": "Journal of Genocide Research", "year": "2006", "volumes": "8", "first page": "387", "last page": "409", "DOI": "10.1080/14623520601056240"}, {"title": "The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America", "authors": "Thomas King", "journal": "University of Minnesota Press", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Not quite human: Infrahumanization in response to collective responsibility for intergroup killing", "authors": "Phillip Atiba Goff, Jennifer L.
