{"Literature Review": "Power sharing in authoritarian regimes has emerged as a critical area of study in political science, offering insights into the mechanisms by which autocratic rulers maintain their grip on power while accommodating potential challengers. This literature review synthesizes recent research on authoritarian power sharing, focusing on its conceptual foundations, enforcement mechanisms, and strategic implications.The concept of power sharing in authoritarian contexts has evolved significantly in recent years. Svolik (2012) provides a foundational framework, arguing that power sharing is a crucial strategy for dictators to prevent coups and maintain regime stability. Building on this, Boix and Svolik (2013) emphasize the role of institutions in facilitating credible power-sharing arrangements, highlighting how they can serve as coordination devices for elite cooperation.However, recent scholarship has refined our understanding of what constitutes genuine power sharing. Meng (2020) argues that true power sharing involves not just the distribution of spoils but also the reallocation of power that makes it costly for the ruler to renege on agreements. This perspective challenges earlier notions that equated power sharing with mere patronage distribution or co-optation.The enforcement of power-sharing deals emerges as a central challenge in authoritarian regimes. Weak institutions create what Svolik (2009) terms the 'dictator's dilemma,' where the lack of credible commitment mechanisms undermines power-sharing arrangements. Magaloni (2008) explores how ruling parties can serve as commitment devices, but acknowledges their limitations in highly personalist regimes.In response to these institutional weaknesses, scholars have identified alternative enforcement mechanisms. Roessler and Ohls (2018) highlight the role of coercive capabilities, arguing that challengers with independent military power can more effectively enforce power-sharing deals. However, this creates what Paine (2021) calls a 'guardianship dilemma,' where the same coercive capabilities that enable power sharing also pose a threat to the ruler.The strategic calculus of authoritarian power sharing has received increasing attention. Rundlett and Svolik (2016) develop a formal model demonstrating how power-sharing arrangements can emerge as equilibrium outcomes under specific conditions. They argue that credible punishment capabilities, willingness to forgo harmful actions, and the ruler's acquiescence to diminished power are crucial factors.Recent research has also explored the varied forms that power sharing can take. Arriola (2009) examines how cabinet appointments serve as a power-sharing mechanism in African countries, while Gandhi and Przeworski (2007) analyze the role of legislatures and parties in co-opting potential opposition. These studies highlight the diverse institutional arrangements through which power can be shared in authoritarian contexts.The relationship between power sharing and regime durability has been a subject of debate. While some scholars argue that power sharing enhances regime stability (Magaloni, 2008; Svolik, 2012), others suggest it can lead to increased contestation and potential regime breakdown. Meng (2020) provides evidence that power-sharing arrangements can sometimes backfire, leading to increased coup attempts.The international dimension of authoritarian power sharing has also gained attention. Bormann et al. (2019) examine how external actors can influence power-sharing arrangements, particularly in post-conflict settings. Their work highlights the complex interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping authoritarian power dynamics.Finally, recent scholarship has begun to explore the long-term consequences of authoritarian power sharing. Slater (2010) argues that durable power-sharing arrangements can lead to the emergence of 'strong-state democratization' in some contexts, while Albertus and Menaldo (2018) examine how power-sharing deals can shape democratic transitions and subsequent regime trajectories.In conclusion, the literature on authoritarian power sharing has made significant strides in recent years, offering a more nuanced understanding of its conceptual foundations, enforcement challenges, and strategic implications. Future research could benefit from more comparative studies across different types of authoritarian regimes, as well as longitudinal analyses to better understand the long-term consequences of power-sharing arrangements. Additionally, the intersection of power sharing with other key concepts in authoritarian politics, such as repression and legitimation, remains a promising area for further investigation.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Authoritarian Rule", "authors": "Milan W.
