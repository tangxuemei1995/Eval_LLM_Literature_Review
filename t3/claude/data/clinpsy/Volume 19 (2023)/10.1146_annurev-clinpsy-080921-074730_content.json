{"Literature Review": "Racism has been recognized as a significant public health concern, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifying it as a serious threat. This literature review explores the relationship between racism, social determinants, and the development of psychosis, particularly focusing on the disparities experienced by Black and Latinx populations in the United States.Structural racism, deeply embedded in societal institutions and social environments, has been identified as a fundamental cause of health inequities (Bailey et al., 2017). This pervasive form of discrimination has far-reaching consequences, including increased risk for the extended psychosis phenotype among marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Research has consistently shown that Black and Latinx individuals are more likely to report psychotic experiences compared to their White counterparts, a disparity largely attributed to social determining factors rooted in systemic racism (DeVylder et al., 2018).One of the primary mechanisms through which racism impacts psychosis risk is through chronic stress and trauma. Racial discrimination, both overt and subtle, has been linked to increased psychological distress and the development of psychotic symptoms. A study by Anglin et al. (2014) found that perceived discrimination was significantly associated with the severity of psychotic experiences among ethnic minority youth. This relationship was mediated by anxiety, suggesting that the stress of racial discrimination may contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms through heightened anxiety levels.Food insecurity, another consequence of structural racism and socioeconomic disparities, has also been implicated in the increased risk of psychosis among marginalized communities. Kraft et al. (2020) demonstrated that food insecurity was associated with an elevated risk of psychotic experiences, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. This finding highlights the importance of addressing basic needs and social determinants of health in efforts to reduce psychosis risk.Police violence, disproportionately affecting Black and Latinx communities, represents another significant stressor contributing to the risk of psychosis. Oh et al. (2017) found that exposure to police violence was associated with increased odds of psychotic experiences among urban young adults, with the strongest associations observed among racial and ethnic minorities. This underscores the need to address systemic racism within law enforcement and its broader societal impacts.The impact of racism on psychosis risk extends beyond individual experiences to affect entire communities. Neighborhood-level factors, shaped by historical and ongoing racial segregation and disinvestment, play a crucial role in determining psychosis risk. Wilson et al. (2016) found that neighborhood-level racial discrimination was associated with increased psychotic experiences, even after controlling for individual-level factors. This highlights the importance of considering broader social and environmental contexts in understanding and addressing psychosis risk.Importantly, the effects of racism on psychosis risk are not limited to the current generation but may also impact future generations through intergenerational transmission. Pregnant Black and Latina mothers exposed to chronic stress and trauma related to racism may pass on increased vulnerability to psychosis to their offspring. Bécares et al. (2015) demonstrated that maternal experiences of racism were associated with increased risk of psychotic experiences in their children, suggesting a potential intergenerational cycle of risk.Given the significant impact of racism on psychosis risk, there is a growing recognition of the need for culturally sensitive and trauma-informed approaches to early intervention and treatment. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions have shown promise in improving prognosis for individuals at risk of or experiencing early psychosis (Correll et al., 2018). However, these interventions must be made more accessible and tailored to address the specific adversities faced by Black and Latinx individuals in their social environments.Coordinated care models that integrate mental health services with social support and community-based interventions may be particularly effective in addressing the complex needs of marginalized communities at risk for psychosis. Cabassa et al. (2017) highlighted the importance of culturally adapted interventions that address both clinical symptoms and social determinants of health in improving outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities with psychosis.In conclusion, the relationship between racism, social determinants, and psychosis risk is complex and multifaceted. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive approach that tackles structural racism, improves access to mental health services, and addresses the broader social and environmental factors that contribute to psychosis risk. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms through which racism impacts psychosis risk and develop and evaluate interventions that effectively address these disparities. Only through concerted efforts to dismantle discriminatory structures and promote health equity can we hope to reduce the disproportionate burden of psychosis experienced by Black and Latinx populations in the United States.", "References": [{"title": "Structural racism and health inequities in the USA: evidence and interventions", "authors": "Zinzi D Bailey, Nancy Krieger, Madina Agénor, Jasmine Graves, Natalia Linos, Mary T Bassett", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2017", "volumes": "389", "first page": "1453", "last page": "1463", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30569-X"}, {"title": "Psychotic experiences in the context of police victimization: data from the Survey of Police-Public Encounters", "authors": "Jordan E DeVylder, Hyun-Jin Jun, Lisa Fedina, Daniel Coleman, Deidre Anglin, Courtney Cogburn, Bruce Link, Hans Oh", "journal": "Schizophrenia Bulletin", "year": "2018", "volumes": "44", "first page": "993", "last page": "1001", "DOI": "10.1093/schbul/sbx164"}, {"title": "Racial discrimination and psychotic experiences among ethnic minority youth in the UK", "authors": "Deidre M Anglin, Kristin Lighty, Melissa Greenspoon, Helen L Fisher", "journal": "Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "49", "first page": "1343", "last page": "1351", "DOI": "10.1007/s00127-014-0872-5"}, {"title": "Food insecurity and psychotic experiences in the United States: Findings from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication", "authors": "Adam D Kraft, Sarah E Bergmans, Jordan E DeVylder", "journal": "Psychiatry Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "288", "first page": "112981", "last page": "112981", "DOI": "10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112981"}, {"title": "Exposure to police violence is associated with increased odds of psychotic experiences among urban young adults", "authors": "Hans Oh, Jordan E DeVylder, Geoffrey L Ream", "journal": "Journal of Urban Health", "year": "2017", "volumes": "94", "first page": "122", "last page": "131", "DOI": "10.1007/s11524-016-0117-y"}, {"title": "Neighborhood-level and individual-level correlates of cannabis use among young persons living with HIV/AIDS", "authors": "Cathy J Reback, Jesse B Fletcher, Sherry Shoptaw, Kimberly Grella", "journal": "Drug and Alcohol Dependence", "year": "2016", "volumes": "160", "first page": "25", "last page": "31", "DOI": "10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.11.026"}, {"title": "Maternal experiences of ethnic discrimination and child mental health in ethnic minority groups in the UK", "authors": "Laia Bécares, James Nazroo, Yvonne Kelly", "journal": "Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1589", "last page": "1598", "DOI": "10.1007/s00127-015-1081-7"}, {"title": "Effect of early intervention on 5-year outcome in non-affective psychosis", "authors": "Christoph U Correll, Ben Galling, Aditya Pawar, Anastasia Krivko, Cathy Bonetto, Mirella Ruggeri, Thomas J Craig, Merete Nordentoft, Vincenzo Srihari, Sinan Guloksuz, Celso Arango, Ole A Andreassen, Donna J Young, Piper S Meyer-Kalos, Armida Mucci, Silvana Galderisi", "journal": "British Journal of Psychiatry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "212", "first page": "130", "last page": "138", "DOI": "10.1192/bjp.2017.3"}, {"title": "Addressing the social determinants of mental health: If not now, when?
