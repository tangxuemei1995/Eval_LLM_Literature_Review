{"Literature Review": "Parental incarceration has emerged as a critical area of study in recent years, given its widespread impact on children and families across the United States. This literature review examines the current state of research on the risk factors and resilience processes associated with children of incarcerated parents, while also proposing a critical reframing of the resilience paradigm.The scope of parental incarceration in the United States is staggering, with an estimated 2.7 million children having a parent in prison or jail at any given time (Turney & Goodsell, 2018). This phenomenon disproportionately affects children from marginalized communities, particularly African American and Latino families, exacerbating existing social inequalities (Wakefield & Wildeman, 2014). The impact of parental incarceration on children's well-being has been well-documented, with studies consistently showing increased risks for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems.Research has identified several mechanisms through which parental incarceration affects children's outcomes. Geller et al. (2012) found that the economic strain resulting from the loss of a parent's income can lead to material hardship and residential instability, which in turn negatively impact children's development. Additionally, the stigma associated with having an incarcerated parent can lead to social isolation and discrimination, further compounding the challenges these children face (Arditti, 2012).Despite these adversities, an emerging body of literature highlights the resilience exhibited by many children of incarcerated parents. Resilience, defined as positive adaptation in the face of significant adversity, has been observed in various domains of functioning among these children. For instance, Poehlmann-Tynan et al. (2017) found that some children of incarcerated mothers demonstrated age-appropriate social skills and academic achievement, despite the challenges they faced.Several factors have been identified as contributing to resilience among children with incarcerated parents. Stable and supportive caregiving arrangements, whether with the non-incarcerated parent or other family members, have been shown to play a crucial role in promoting positive outcomes (Shlafer et al., 2013). Additionally, maintaining contact with the incarcerated parent, when appropriate and feasible, has been associated with better emotional adjustment and reduced behavioral problems in children (Poehlmann-Tynan et al., 2015).Interventions targeting children of incarcerated parents have shown promise in mitigating risks and fostering resilience. Mentoring programs, such as those offered by Big Brothers Big Sisters, have demonstrated positive effects on children's self-esteem, academic performance, and behavioral outcomes (Jucovy, 2003). Similarly, family-based interventions that focus on strengthening relationships between children, caregivers, and incarcerated parents have shown potential in improving family functioning and child well-being (Miller et al., 2013).While the growing body of research on resilience among children of incarcerated parents is encouraging, it is crucial to critically examine the framing of resilience in this context. As argued by Arditti (2015), the focus on individual resilience should not overshadow the need for broader social and institutional changes to address the root causes of mass incarceration and its impact on families. A more nuanced understanding of resilience that considers the intersecting inequalities faced by these children is necessary to develop comprehensive and effective interventions.The concept of intersectionality, as introduced by Crenshaw (1989), provides a valuable framework for understanding the complex interplay of multiple social identities and systems of oppression that shape the experiences of children with incarcerated parents. By adopting an intersectional approach, researchers can better account for the ways in which factors such as race, class, and gender interact with parental incarceration to influence children's outcomes and resilience processes.Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that resilience research and practice should complement, rather than replace, efforts to address systemic inequalities and reduce the reliance on incarceration as a means of social control. As highlighted by Wakefield and Wildeman (2014), the disproportionate impact of parental incarceration on minority communities perpetuates cycles of disadvantage and exacerbates existing social disparities.In conclusion, while the study of risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents has yielded valuable insights, there is a need for a more contextualized and socially just approach to research and practice in this field. Future studies should adopt intersectional frameworks to better understand the complex experiences of these children and develop more targeted interventions. Additionally, researchers and practitioners should work towards integrating resilience-promoting strategies with broader efforts to address the systemic issues underlying mass incarceration and its impact on families. By doing so, we can move towards a more comprehensive and equitable approach to supporting children affected by parental incarceration.", "References": [{"title": "Parental Incarceration and Child Wellbeing: An Overlooked and Misunderstood Problem", "authors": "Kristin Turney, Rebecca Goodsell", "journal": "Future of Children", "year": "2018", "volumes": "28", "first page": "147", "last page": "168", "DOI": "10.1353/foc.2018.0007"}, {"title": "Children of the prison boom: Mass incarceration and the future of American inequality", "authors": "Sara Wakefield, Christopher Wildeman", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199989225.001.0001"}, {"title": "Parental Incarceration and Child Well-Being: Implications for Urban Families", "authors": "Amanda Geller, Carey E.
