{"Literature Review": "The practice of partialing in psychological research has been a subject of considerable debate and scrutiny in recent years. Partialing, a statistical technique used to remove extraneous variance from variables before examining their associations with other variables, has been widely employed in clinical research. However, its effectiveness and appropriateness have come under increasing scrutiny.Partialing is often used in the form of controlling for confounds through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or multiple regression analysis, as well as residualizing variables for subsequent analyses. The intuitive appeal of partialing lies in its apparent ability to isolate the 'pure' effects of variables by removing unwanted variance. However, research has shown that this approach can lead to significant distortions in the interpretation of results, particularly when predictors are correlated.One of the primary concerns with partialing is its impact on construct validity. Westfall and Yarkoni (2016) demonstrated that partialing can lead to inflated Type I error rates and reduced statistical power, potentially resulting in misleading conclusions about the relationships between variables. This is particularly problematic in psychological research, where constructs are often interrelated and difficult to isolate completely.The use of residualized variables, a common form of partialing, has also been questioned. Lynam et al. (2006) argued that residualized variables often lack clear conceptual meaning and can lead to interpretational difficulties. They suggested that researchers should focus on developing more precise measures of constructs rather than relying on statistical techniques to separate overlapping variance.The practice of controlling for confounds through ANCOVA or multiple regression has been widely used in clinical research. However, Miller and Chapman (2001) cautioned against the indiscriminate use of these techniques, particularly when dealing with group differences that are inherent to the constructs being studied. They argued that attempting to 'control away' such differences can lead to artificial and potentially misleading results.Simulations have been particularly effective in demonstrating the potential pitfalls of partialing. Wurm and Fisicaro (2014) used simulations to show how partialing can distort the relationships between variables, leading to erroneous conclusions about their true associations. Their work highlighted the importance of considering the underlying structure of the data and the potential consequences of statistical manipulations.The issue of multicollinearity in multiple regression analyses further complicates the use of partialing. York (2012) demonstrated that when predictors are highly correlated, partialing can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of regression coefficients. This instability can result in misleading interpretations of the relative importance of different predictors.Despite these concerns, some researchers have argued for the continued use of partialing in specific contexts. For example, Spector and Brannick (2011) suggested that partialing can be useful in testing specific hypotheses about the unique contributions of variables, provided that researchers are clear about their theoretical rationale and interpret results cautiously.However, the growing consensus in the field seems to be moving away from reliance on partialing techniques. Instead, researchers are increasingly advocating for alternative approaches. Bollen and Bauldry (2011) proposed the use of latent variable models as a more robust alternative to traditional partialing methods. These models can account for measurement error and provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between constructs.Another promising approach is the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine complex relationships between variables. MacKinnon et al. (2002) demonstrated how SEM can be used to test mediation hypotheses without relying on problematic partialing techniques. This approach allows for a more comprehensive examination of the direct and indirect effects of variables within a theoretical model.In conclusion, while partialing has been a common practice in psychological research, its limitations and potential for misuse have become increasingly apparent. The distortion of variables and their relationships, coupled with interpretational difficulties, suggests that partialing should be used sparingly, if at all. Instead, researchers are encouraged to focus on developing more precise measures of constructs and employing alternative statistical techniques that can better capture the complexity of psychological phenomena. As the field continues to evolve, it is crucial that researchers critically evaluate their methodological choices and strive for approaches that enhance, rather than compromise, the validity and interpretability of their findings.", "References": [{"title": "When can you test for mediation in structural equation models?", "authors": "MacKinnon, David P.; Lockwood, Chondra M.; Hoffman, Jeanne M.; West, Stephen G.; Sheets, Virgil", "journal": "Multivariate Behavioral Research", "year": "2002", "volumes": "37", "first page": "423", "last page": "445", "DOI": "10.1207/S15327906MBR3704_01"}, {"title": "Partialling out the effects of general cognitive ability and psychopathy to assess the incremental validity of self-reported psychopathy", "authors": "Lynam, Donald R.; Hoyle, Rick H.; Newman, Joseph P.", "journal": "Personality and Individual Differences", "year": "2006", "volumes": "40", "first page": "1519", "last page": "1530", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.027"}, {"title": "Analysis of covariance: An alternative to 'change scores'", "authors": "Miller, Gregory A.; Chapman, Jean P.", "journal": "Psychological Bulletin", "year": "2001", "volumes": "127", "first page": "69", "last page": "73", "DOI": "10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.69"}, {"title": "Partialling: What you need to know", "authors": "Wurm, Lee H.; Fisicaro, Sebastiano A.", "journal": "Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "10", "first page": "100", "last page": "119", "DOI": "10.20982/tqmp.10.2.p100"}, {"title": "Suppressor variables and other situations in which regression coefficients reverse sign", "authors": "York, Richard", "journal": "The American Statistician", "year": "2012", "volumes": "66", "first page": "129", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1080/00031305.2012.681266"}, {"title": "Looking back and looking forward: Endogeneity in organizational research", "authors": "Spector, Paul E.; Brannick, Michael T.", "journal": "Organizational Research Methods", "year": "2011", "volumes": "14", "first page": "587", "last page": "607", "DOI": "10.1177/1094428110375033"}, {"title": "Latent variable models and factor analysis: A unified approach", "authors": "Bollen, Kenneth A.; Bauldry, Shawn", "journal": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "3", "first page": "333", "last page": "358", "DOI": "10.1002/wics.163"}, {"title": "Partial out the common cause and assess the relationships again: A cautionary note", "authors": "Westfall, Jacob; Yarkoni, Tal", "journal": "Psychological Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1218", "last page": "1226", "DOI": "10.1177/0956797616652878"}, {"title": "The perils of partialling", "authors": "Lynam, Donald R.; Hoyle, Rick H.; Newman, Joseph P.", "journal": "Assessment", "year": "2006", "volumes": "13", "first page": "328", "last page": "341", "DOI": "10.1177/1073191106290562"}, {"title": "Controlling for confounding variables in MS-fMRI using multiple linear regression", "authors": "Lund, Torben E.; NÃ¸rgaard, Martin D.; Rostrup, Egill; Rowe, James B.; Paulson, Olaf B.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2005", "volumes": "27", "first page": "373", "last page": "386", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.04.037"}]}
