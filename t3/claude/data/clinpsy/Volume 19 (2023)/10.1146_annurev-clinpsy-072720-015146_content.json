{"Literature Review": "The mental health of African American youth is a critical area of concern, given the pervasive impact of racism on their well-being. This literature review examines recent studies investigating racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that mitigate the effects of racism on the mental health of African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults. The focus is on four key resilience factors: ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting. Ethnic and racial identity (ERI) has been consistently identified as a crucial protective factor for African American youth. Sellers et al. (2006) found that a strong, positive racial identity was associated with better psychological functioning and lower levels of depression among African American adolescents. More recently, Yip (2018) demonstrated that ERI can buffer the negative effects of racial discrimination on mental health outcomes, particularly when youth have a strong sense of belonging to their racial group. However, the relationship between ERI and mental health is complex. Seaton et al. (2011) observed that while a strong racial identity can be protective, it may also heighten sensitivity to racial discrimination, potentially leading to increased psychological distress. This highlights the need for nuanced approaches to understanding and fostering ERI as a resilience factor. Ethnic-racial socialization (ERS) has emerged as another critical protective mechanism. Hughes et al. (2006) defined ERS as the transmission of messages from parents to children about ethnicity and race. Recent research by Anderson et al. (2020) found that cultural socialization, a component of ERS focusing on cultural pride and heritage, was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression in African American adolescents exposed to racial discrimination. Interestingly, Neblett et al. (2013) observed that different types of ERS messages might have varying effects on youth mental health. For instance, preparation for bias messages, while intended to be protective, could sometimes increase anxiety if not balanced with positive cultural messages. This underscores the importance of considering the specific content and context of ERS in research and interventions. Religiosity and spirituality have long been recognized as sources of strength and resilience in African American communities. Hope et al. (2017) found that religious involvement was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms among African American adolescents, particularly for those experiencing high levels of racial discrimination. Butler-Barnes et al. (2018) further demonstrated that spirituality could enhance academic persistence and psychological well-being in African American youth facing racial barriers in educational settings. However, the protective effects of religiosity and spirituality may vary based on individual and contextual factors. Mattis and Grayman-Simpson (2013) argued for a more nuanced understanding of how different aspects of religiosity and spirituality (e.g., private practices, communal worship, spiritual beliefs) may differentially impact mental health outcomes in African American youth. Family and parenting factors play a crucial role in fostering resilience among African American youth. McLoyd et al. (2019) reviewed recent literature on African American parenting, highlighting the importance of warm, supportive parenting styles in promoting positive mental health outcomes for youth exposed to racial discrimination. Additionally, Gaylord-Harden et al. (2018) found that family cohesion and support could buffer the effects of community violence and racial discrimination on depressive symptoms in African American adolescents. Recent research has also emphasized the need to consider intersectionality in understanding resilience factors. For example, Chavous et al. (2008) examined how gender interacts with racial identity and discrimination experiences to influence academic outcomes and psychological well-being in African American adolescents. Their findings suggest that the protective effects of racial identity may operate differently for boys and girls, highlighting the importance of considering multiple social identities in resilience research. Moreover, there is growing recognition of the need to examine resilience factors within the broader context of structural racism. Lewis et al. (2021) argued for a more comprehensive approach that considers how systemic inequities shape the development and effectiveness of individual and family-level resilience factors. This perspective emphasizes the importance of addressing broader societal issues alongside promoting individual and family resilience. In conclusion, recent literature on racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in African American youth mental health has built upon foundational research while incorporating new perspectives and methodologies. The complex interplay between various resilience factors, as well as their interaction with individual, family, and societal contexts, underscores the need for multifaceted approaches to promoting mental health equity for African American youth. Future research should continue to explore these nuances, with a particular focus on intersectionality and structural factors, to inform more effective prevention, intervention, and policy efforts.", "References": [{"title": "Racial Identity Matters: The Relationship between Racial Discrimination and Psychological Functioning in African American Adolescents", "authors": "Robert M.
