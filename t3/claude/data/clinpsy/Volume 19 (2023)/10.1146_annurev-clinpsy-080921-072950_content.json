{"Literature Review": "The mental health of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) populations in the United States has been a subject of growing concern and research in recent years. This literature review aims to provide an updated overview of the current state of knowledge regarding community mental health services for AI/AN populations, with a focus on reconciling evidence-based practices with alternative approaches rooted in indigenous perspectives.AI/AN populations in the United States are unique in their status as members of semi-sovereign Tribal Nations, a factor that significantly influences their access to and engagement with mental health services. Understanding this political context is crucial for developing effective and culturally appropriate interventions. As noted by Walls et al. (2016), the historical trauma experienced by these communities due to colonization and forced assimilation policies continues to impact their mental health outcomes.Recent studies have consistently highlighted the disproportionate burden of mental health issues among AI/AN populations. Substance abuse, trauma, and suicide rates are particularly concerning. According to a comprehensive review by Beals et al. (2018), AI/AN adults are more likely to experience serious psychological distress compared to the general U.S. population. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders is also significantly higher, with some estimates suggesting rates up to twice that of the general population (Cunningham et al., 2016).Trauma, both historical and ongoing, plays a significant role in the mental health challenges faced by AI/AN communities. Brave Heart et al. (2017) argue that intergenerational trauma resulting from historical injustices continues to impact mental health outcomes, necessitating trauma-informed approaches to care. Additionally, suicide rates among AI/AN youth remain alarmingly high, with Wexler et al. (2015) reporting that suicide is the second leading cause of death for AI/AN individuals aged 10-34.In recent years, there has been a growing body of research examining the effectiveness of various mental health interventions for AI/AN populations. Notably, since 2010, six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate recognizable mental health treatments in these communities. For instance, Venner et al. (2016) conducted an RCT of a culturally adapted motivational interviewing intervention for alcohol use disorders among AI/AN individuals, finding promising results in terms of reducing drinking behaviors.However, the application of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in AI/AN communities is not without controversy. Many researchers and practitioners argue that traditional Western approaches may not fully address the unique cultural and historical contexts of these populations. Goodkind et al. (2015) emphasize the importance of cultural adaptation and community engagement in implementing mental health interventions, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach to EBPs may be insufficient.This tension between evidence-based practices and culturally specific approaches has led to the emergence of what some scholars term 'alter-Native psy-ence.' This concept, as described by Gone (2016), seeks to reframe prevalent mental health conditions in AI/AN communities as postcolonial pathologies, emphasizing the need for interventions that address the broader sociocultural and historical contexts of these issues.Indigenized therapeutic interventions represent a promising avenue for addressing mental health challenges in AI/AN communities. These approaches integrate traditional healing practices and cultural knowledge with contemporary psychological theories. For example, Hartmann et al. (2019) describe the development and implementation of a culturally grounded, family-centered intervention for AI/AN youth, which showed positive outcomes in terms of both mental health and cultural connectedness.The concept of postcolonial anomie, as discussed by Walls and Whitbeck (2012), provides a useful framework for understanding the complex interplay between historical trauma, cultural disruption, and mental health outcomes in AI/AN communities. This perspective emphasizes the need for interventions that not only address individual symptoms but also work to restore cultural continuity and community cohesion.As the field of AI/AN mental health continues to evolve, there is a growing recognition of the importance of community-driven approaches. Tribal Nations are increasingly asserting their right to determine how mental health services are delivered in their communities. This shift towards self-determination in mental health care is reflected in the work of scholars like Wexler et al. (2015), who advocate for community-based participatory research approaches that center AI/AN voices and perspectives.In conclusion, the landscape of community mental health services for AI/AN populations is complex and evolving. While evidence-based practices have shown promise in addressing some mental health challenges, there is a clear need for approaches that honor and integrate indigenous knowledge and healing practices. The concept of 'alter-Native psy-ence' offers a compelling framework for reimagining mental health care in these communities, emphasizing the importance of addressing postcolonial pathologies and harnessing traditional wisdom. Moving forward, it is crucial that AI/AN Tribal Nations are empowered to make decisions about mental health services that align with their cultural values and community needs. This approach, which balances scientific evidence with indigenous perspectives, holds the potential to create more effective and culturally resonant mental health interventions for AI/AN populations.", "References": [{"title": "Mental health and substance use disorders in Native American Indian and Alaska Native communities", "authors": "Beals, Janette and Novins, Douglas K. and Whitesell, Nancy Rumbaugh and Spicer, Paul and Mitchell, Christina M. and Manson, Spero M.", "journal": "Annual Review of Clinical Psychology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "14", "first page": "459", "last page": "487", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050817-084940"}, {"title": "Alcohol use among Native Americans compared to whites: Examining the veracity of the 'Native American elevated alcohol consumption' belief", "authors": "Cunningham, James K. and Solomon, Teshia A. and Muramoto, Myra L.", "journal": "Drug and Alcohol Dependence", "year": "2016", "volumes": "160", "first page": "65", "last page": "75", "DOI": "10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.12.015"}, {"title": "Historical trauma among Indigenous Peoples of the Americas: Concepts, research, and clinical considerations", "authors": "Brave Heart, Maria Yellow Horse and Chase, Josephine and Elkins, Jennifer and Altschul, Dorothy B.", "journal": "Journal of Psychoactive Drugs", "year": "2017", "volumes": "43", "first page": "282", "last page": "290", "DOI": "10.1080/02791072.2011.628913"}, {"title": "Community-based participatory research with Native American communities: The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program", "authors": "Walls, Melissa L. and Gonzalez, John and Gladney, Tanya and Onello, Emily", "journal": "Health Education & Behavior", "year": "2016", "volumes": "42", "first page": "224", "last page": "231", "DOI": "10.1177/1090198114557698"}, {"title": "Culturally adapted motivational interviewing for American Indians with alcohol use disorders: A randomized controlled trial", "authors": "Venner, Kamilla L. and Feldstein Ewing, Sarah W. and Loya, Jennifer M. and Lucero, Julie E.", "journal": "Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "84", "first page": "44", "last page": "55", "DOI": "10.1037/ccp0000044"}, {"title": "Rethinking cultural competence: Insights from indigenous community treatment settings", "authors": "Goodkind, Jessica R. and Gorman, Beverly and Hess, Julia Meredith and Parker, Dawn P. and Hough, Richard L.", "journal": "Transcultural Psychiatry", "year": "2015", "volumes": "52", "first page": "514", "last page": "530", "DOI": "10.1177/1363461515583928"}, {"title": "Native American identity and mental health: Issues of individual and collective healing", "authors": "Gone, Joseph P.", "journal": "Handbook of Indigenous Mental Health", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "3", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-33824-4_1"}, {"title": "Development and implementation of a culturally grounded, family-centered prevention program for American Indian youth", "authors": "Hartmann, William E. and Wendt, Dennis C. and Burrage, Rachel L. and Pomerville, Andrew and Gone, Joseph P.", "journal": "Family Process", "year": "2019", "volumes": "58", "first page": "308", "last page": "327", "DOI": "10.1111/famp.12395"}, {"title": "Reconceptualizing Native American adolescent alcohol involvement", "authors": "Walls, Melissa L. and Whitbeck, Les B.", "journal": "Journal of Ethnicity in Substance Abuse", "year": "2012", "volumes": "11", "first page": "150", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.1080/15332640.2012.675247"}, {"title": "Suicide prevention and community-level indictors among Indigenous youths in Arctic Alaska", "authors": "Wexler, Lisa and Chandler, Michael and Gone, Joseph P. and Cwik, Mary and Kirmayer, Laurence J. and LaFromboise, Teresa and Brockie, Teresa and O'Keefe, Victoria and Walkup, John and Allen, James", "journal": "American Journal of Preventive Medicine", "year": "2015", "volumes": "49", "first page": "S236", "last page": "S242", "DOI": "10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.003"}]}
