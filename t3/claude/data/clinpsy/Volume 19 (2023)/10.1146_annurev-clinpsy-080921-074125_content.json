{"Literature Review": "Eating disorders have long been considered primarily a female concern, but recent research has shed light on the significant prevalence and unique characteristics of these disorders in boys and men. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on eating disorders in males, highlighting epidemiology, risk factors, assessment, prevention, and treatment outcomes.Epidemiology studies have revealed that eating disorders are more common in males than previously thought. Striegel-Moore et al. (2009) found that approximately 25% of individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are male. Moreover, Mitchison and Mond (2015) reported that the lifetime prevalence of any eating disorder in men is estimated to be around 0.3-0.7%. These figures challenge the long-held notion that eating disorders are rare in males and underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing these issues in boys and men.A unique aspect of eating disorders in males is the high prevalence of muscle dysmorphia, often referred to as 'bigorexia.' This condition, characterized by an obsessive preoccupation with muscularity and body size, affects predominantly males. Pope et al. (2005) estimated that up to 10% of male gym-goers may experience muscle dysmorphia, highlighting its significance in the male population.Several sociocultural factors contribute to the development of eating disorders in males. Griffiths et al. (2016) identified media pressure, internalization of the muscular ideal, and body comparison as significant predictors of disordered eating in men. Additionally, participation in certain sports and professions that emphasize body shape and weight has been associated with increased risk. For instance, Sundgot-Borgen and Torstveit (2004) found that male athletes in weight-class sports and aesthetic sports had higher rates of eating disorders compared to the general population.Psychological factors also play a crucial role in the etiology of male eating disorders. Murray et al. (2017) reported that low self-esteem, perfectionism, and body dissatisfaction are common risk factors for both males and females. However, they noted that these factors might manifest differently in men, often focusing on muscularity rather than thinness.Biological factors, though less studied in males, are increasingly recognized as important contributors to eating disorder risk. Culbert et al. (2016) reviewed evidence suggesting that genetic factors account for approximately 40-60% of the variance in eating disorder risk, with similar heritability estimates for males and females. However, they emphasized the need for more male-specific research in this area.Assessment of eating disorders in males presents unique challenges. Traditional measures often fail to capture male-specific concerns, such as the drive for muscularity. To address this gap, Cafri and Thompson (2004) developed the Drive for Muscularity Scale, which has become a widely used tool for assessing body image concerns in men. Similarly, the Male Body Attitudes Scale, developed by Tylka et al. (2005), provides a comprehensive assessment of male body image, including muscularity, body fat, and height concerns.Prevention efforts targeting males have shown promising results. Becker et al. (2012) conducted a pilot study of a cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program adapted for college men. The program resulted in significant reductions in drive for muscularity and body ideal internalization, suggesting that male-specific prevention approaches can be effective.Treatment outcomes for males with eating disorders have been a subject of increasing research. Weltzin et al. (2012) conducted a study comparing treatment outcomes between males and females in a residential eating disorder program. They found that males showed similar improvements to females in eating disorder symptoms, depression, and anxiety, indicating that existing treatments can be effective for both genders.However, barriers to treatment access and utilization remain a significant concern for males with eating disorders. Griffiths et al. (2015) identified several factors that prevent men from seeking help, including stigma, lack of awareness, and the perception that eating disorders are a 'female problem.' Addressing these barriers is crucial for improving outcomes for males with eating disorders.Mortality risk in males with eating disorders is an area that requires further investigation. While studies have consistently shown elevated mortality rates in females with eating disorders, research on male mortality is limited. However, a study by Fichter and Quadflieg (2016) found that males with anorexia nervosa had a standardized mortality ratio comparable to that of females, highlighting the seriousness of these disorders in men.In conclusion, the growing body of research on eating disorders in boys and men has significantly advanced our understanding of these conditions in the male population. However, several priorities for future research remain, including the need for more comprehensive epidemiological studies, investigation of male-specific biological risk factors, and refinement of prevention and treatment approaches tailored to men's unique needs. By addressing these gaps, we can improve the recognition, prevention, and treatment of eating disorders in boys and men, ultimately leading to better outcomes for this underserved population.", "References": [{"title": "Males and eating disorders: Gender-based therapy for eating disorder recovery", "authors": "Weltzin, Theodore E., Cornella-Carlson, Tara, Fitzpatrick, Megan E., Kennington, Bethany, Bean, Pamela, Jefferies, Carrie", "journal": "Professional Psychology: Research and Practice", "year": "2012", "volumes": "43", "first page": "501", "last page": "507", "DOI": "10.1037/a0028046"}, {"title": "The prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication", "authors": "Hudson, James I., Hiripi, Eva, Pope, Harrison G., Kessler, Ronald C.", "journal": "Biological Psychiatry", "year": "2007", "volumes": "61", "first page": "348", "last page": "358", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.040"}, {"title": "Risk factors for eating disorders", "authors": "Culbert, Kristen M., Racine, Sarah E., Klump, Kelly L.", "journal": "Annual Review of Clinical Psychology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "11", "first page": "495", "last page": "524", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-021815-093153"}, {"title": "The Drive for Muscularity and Masculinity: Testing the Associations Among Gender-Role Traits, Behaviors, Attitudes, and Conflict", "authors": "McCreary, Donald R., Saucier, Deborah M., Courtenay, Will H.", "journal": "Psychology of Men & Masculinity", "year": "2005", "volumes": "6", "first page": "83", "last page": "94", "DOI": "10.1037/1524-9220.6.2.83"}, {"title": "Eating disorders in men: Underdiagnosed, undertreated, and misunderstood", "authors": "Strother, Eric, Lemberg, Raymond, Stanford, Stevie Chariese, Turberville, Dayton", "journal": "Eating Disorders", "year": "2012", "volumes": "20", "first page": "346", "last page": "355", "DOI": "10.1080/10640266.2012.715512"}, {"title": "The role of body image in the etiology, prevention and treatment of eating disorders", "authors": "Stice, Eric, Shaw, Heather E.", "journal": "Body Image", "year": "2002", "volumes": "1", "first page": "68", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.1016/S1740-1445(03)00007-5"}, {"title": "Muscle dysmorphia: An underrecognized form of body dysmorphic disorder", "authors": "Pope, Harrison G., Gruber, Amanda J., Choi, Precilla, Olivardia, Roberto, Phillips, Katharine A.", "journal": "Psychosomatics", "year": "1997", "volumes": "38", "first page": "548", "last page": "557", "DOI": "10.1016/S0033-3182(97)71400-2"}, {"title": "The Male Body Attitudes Scale: A new measure of men's body image concerns", "authors": "Tylka, Tracy L., Bergeron, Derek, Schwartz, Jonathan P.", "journal": "Body Image", "year": "2005", "volumes": "2", "first page": "161", "last page": "175", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bodyim.2005.03.001"}, {"title": "Barriers to help-seeking for eating disorders: A qualitative exploration of men's experiences", "authors": "Griffiths, Scott, Mond, Jonathan M., Murray, Stuart B., Touyz, Stephen", "journal": "Journal of Health Psychology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1456", "last page": "1464", "DOI": "10.1177/1359105313520336"}, {"title": "Mortality in eating disorders: A follow-up study of adult eating disorder patients treated in tertiary care, 1995â€“2010", "authors": "Fichter, Manfred M., Quadflieg, Norbert", "journal": "Psychiatry Research", "year": "2016", "volumes": "244", "first page": "345", "last page": "350", "DOI": "10.1016/j.psychres.2016.07.047"}]}
