{"Literature Review": "Supernatural attributions, which involve ascribing events to divine, demonic, or mystical forces, have been a significant aspect of human cognition and culture throughout history. These beliefs, encompassing notions of God, the devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma, continue to shape the worldviews and experiences of many individuals worldwide. This literature review aims to explore the psychological relevance and implications of supernatural attributions, drawing from a diverse body of research in psychology, anthropology, and religious studies. The prevalence and impact of supernatural beliefs have been widely documented across cultures. Norenzayan and Hansen (2006) found that belief in supernatural agents is a near-universal human trait, with variations in specific beliefs across different societies. This ubiquity suggests that supernatural attributions may serve important psychological functions. Indeed, Pargament et al. (2000) demonstrated that religious coping strategies, which often involve supernatural attributions, can be associated with positive psychological outcomes in times of stress. However, the relationship between supernatural attributions and mental health is complex. While some studies have shown positive effects, others have highlighted potential negative consequences. For instance, Exline et al. (2014) introduced the concept of 'spiritual struggles,' where individuals grapple with negative religious cognitions, including feeling punished or abandoned by God. These struggles were found to be associated with various forms of psychological distress, including depression and anxiety. The cognitive underpinnings of supernatural attributions have been a subject of considerable research. Boyer (2003) proposed that supernatural beliefs are rooted in ordinary cognitive processes, such as agency detection and theory of mind. This perspective suggests that supernatural attributions are not necessarily irrational but rather extensions of our evolved cognitive tendencies. Building on this, Willard and Norenzayan (2013) found that individual differences in mentalizing abilities were positively associated with belief in God, supporting the idea that supernatural beliefs are linked to social cognitive processes. Cultural factors play a crucial role in shaping supernatural attributions. Legare and Gelman (2008) demonstrated that cultural context influences how individuals interpret and explain unusual events, with some cultures more prone to supernatural explanations than others. This highlights the importance of considering cultural diversity when studying supernatural attributions in clinical settings. Interestingly, supernatural attributions are not limited to dramatic or seemingly inexplicable events. Lupfer et al. (1992) found that people often attribute everyday occurrences to supernatural causes, particularly when these events are personally significant. This suggests that supernatural attributions are deeply integrated into many individuals' daily cognitive processes and decision-making. The relationship between supernatural attributions and psychopathology has been a topic of ongoing debate. While some researchers have associated certain types of supernatural beliefs with psychotic symptoms (Peters et al., 1999), others argue for a more nuanced understanding. Mohr and Pfeifer (2009) proposed that the content and context of supernatural beliefs, rather than their mere presence, are crucial in determining their relationship to mental health. Personality factors also play a role in supernatural attributions. Saroglou (2002) conducted a meta-analysis showing that religiosity, which often involves supernatural beliefs, is associated with certain personality traits, particularly conscientiousness and agreeableness. This suggests that individual differences in personality may predispose some individuals to make supernatural attributions more readily than others. The moral dimension of supernatural attributions is another important area of study. Shariff and Rhemtulla (2012) found that belief in punitive supernatural agents was associated with lower crime rates, suggesting that supernatural beliefs can serve as a form of social control and moral guidance. In conclusion, supernatural attributions represent a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with significant implications for clinical psychology. While they can serve as coping mechanisms and sources of meaning, they can also be associated with psychological distress in certain contexts. The interplay between cognitive, cultural, and personality factors in shaping supernatural attributions highlights the need for a nuanced and culturally sensitive approach in clinical practice. As our understanding of this area grows, it becomes increasingly clear that supernatural attributions are an integral part of human psychology and cannot be overlooked in comprehensive mental health care.", "References": [{"title": "Cognitive and emotional determinants of religious belief", "authors": "Ara Norenzayan, Ian G.
