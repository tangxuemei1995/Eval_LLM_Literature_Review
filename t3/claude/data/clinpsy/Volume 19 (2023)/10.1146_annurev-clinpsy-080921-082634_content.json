{"Literature Review": "Suicide prevention among youth has been a critical public health concern for decades, with various initiatives and programs implemented to address this complex issue. The Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial Act, enacted in 2004, represents a significant milestone in the United States' efforts to combat youth suicide. This literature review aims to examine the impact, effectiveness, and challenges associated with the GLS Memorial Act and its implementation.The GLS Memorial Act was named after Garrett Lee Smith, the son of former U.S. Senator Gordon Smith, who died by suicide in 2003 at the age of 21. The Act was designed to provide federal funding for comprehensive, community-based youth suicide prevention programs across the United States (Goldston et al., 2010). Since its inception, the GLS program has supported a wide range of prevention activities, including gatekeeper training, screening programs, and crisis intervention services.One of the most significant findings from the evaluation of the GLS program is the observed reduction in suicide attempts and mortality rates in communities implementing GLS-funded activities. Walrath et al. (2015) conducted a comprehensive study comparing GLS-funded communities to matched control communities and found that GLS implementation was associated with significantly lower youth suicide rates. This finding suggests that the community-based approach advocated by the GLS program may be effective in reducing suicidal behaviors among young people.Interestingly, the positive outcomes associated with GLS implementation appear to be more pronounced in certain contexts. Godoy Garraza et al. (2019) reported that the beneficial effects of GLS activities were more evident in communities with continuous years of implementation. This finding underscores the importance of sustained, long-term efforts in suicide prevention, as opposed to short-term interventions. Additionally, the same study found that less densely populated communities experienced more substantial positive outcomes, suggesting that the GLS approach may be particularly effective in rural or suburban settings.The economic impact of the GLS program has also been a subject of investigation. Ahmedani et al. (2017) conducted a cost analysis of GLS implementation and found that the program more than pays for itself through reduced healthcare costs associated with fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This finding is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders, as it demonstrates the potential cost-effectiveness of comprehensive suicide prevention programs.Despite these encouraging findings, it is important to note the limitations of the current evidence base. Cwik et al. (2016) highlighted the heterogeneity of community suicide prevention programs implemented under the GLS umbrella, making it challenging to isolate the specific components that contribute most to positive outcomes. Furthermore, the lack of randomized controlled trials in this field precludes definitive determination of causal effects associated with GLS implementation (Asarnow & Miranda, 2014).Another critical aspect of the GLS program is its focus on gatekeeper training. Gatekeepers are individuals who are in a position to identify and refer at-risk youth to appropriate services. Wyman et al. (2008) evaluated the effectiveness of gatekeeper training programs supported by GLS funding and found significant improvements in participants' knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to youth suicide prevention. However, the study also noted that these improvements did not necessarily translate into increased identification and referral of at-risk youth, highlighting the need for ongoing support and follow-up after initial training.The GLS program has also emphasized the importance of culturally competent suicide prevention strategies, particularly for underserved and high-risk populations. Goldston et al. (2008) discussed the unique challenges and opportunities in implementing suicide prevention programs for diverse youth populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ youth, and youth in rural areas. The authors emphasized the need for tailored approaches that consider the specific risk factors and cultural contexts of these populations.While the GLS program has demonstrated promising results, it is important to note that it has never been fully brought to scale to impact all communities in the United States simultaneously. As a result, the potential beneficial effects on nationwide suicide rates have not been fully realized (Wilcox et al., 2016). This limitation highlights the need for continued expansion and support of comprehensive suicide prevention efforts across the country.In conclusion, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act has made significant contributions to youth suicide prevention efforts in the United States. The program's community-based approach, emphasis on gatekeeper training, and focus on culturally competent strategies have shown promise in reducing suicide attempts and mortality rates among young people. However, challenges remain in terms of program heterogeneity, causal inference, and nationwide scalability. Future research should focus on identifying the most effective components of GLS-funded programs, developing standardized evaluation methods, and exploring strategies for broader implementation to maximize the program's impact on youth suicide prevention across the United States.", "References": [{"title": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Suicide Prevention Program", "authors": "David B.
