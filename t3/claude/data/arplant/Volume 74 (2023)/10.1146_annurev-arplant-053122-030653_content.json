{"Literature Review": "De novo domestication, the process of domesticating wild plants or rapidly improving weakly domesticated crops using genome editing technologies, has emerged as a promising approach to address global food security challenges in the face of climate change. This literature review explores the potential and limitations of de novo domestication, focusing on plant developmental genetics, ethnobotany, and the ethical considerations surrounding this innovative technique.The advent of precise genome editing tools, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has revolutionized plant breeding by allowing targeted modifications to plant genomes. Li et al. (2018) demonstrated the successful domestication of wild tomato species using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit genes associated with fruit size, plant architecture, and nutritional quality. This groundbreaking study highlighted the potential of de novo domestication to rapidly develop new crop varieties with desirable traits.One of the key advantages of de novo domestication is the ability to tap into the vast genetic diversity of wild plant species. Traditional breeding methods often rely on the limited genetic variation within domesticated crops, whereas de novo domestication allows breeders to access a broader range of genetic resources. Zsögön et al. (2018) showcased this potential by domesticating wild tomato relatives, introducing traits such as increased fruit size and enhanced lycopene content, which are typically absent in cultivated tomatoes.Plant developmental genetics plays a crucial role in de novo domestication efforts. Understanding the genetic basis of key domestication traits, such as plant architecture, flowering time, and fruit development, is essential for successful genome editing interventions. Fernie and Yan (2019) reviewed the molecular mechanisms underlying domestication traits in various crops, providing valuable insights for future de novo domestication projects.Climate change resilience is a critical consideration in de novo domestication efforts. Wild plant species often possess adaptive traits that enable them to thrive in challenging environments. By harnessing these traits through genome editing, researchers aim to develop climate-resilient crops. Brozynska et al. (2016) discussed the potential of using wild rice relatives to improve the stress tolerance of cultivated rice, highlighting the importance of preserving and utilizing wild genetic resources.While the genetic potential of de novo domestication is promising, it is crucial to consider the complex interplay between genetics and the environment. Conventional breeding and phenotypic selection remain essential components of crop development, especially when adapting plants to diverse environments and cultural preferences. Østerberg et al. (2017) emphasized the importance of combining genome editing with traditional breeding approaches to achieve optimal results in crop improvement.Ethnobotany and indigenous knowledge play vital roles in de novo domestication efforts. Traditional ecological knowledge can provide valuable insights into the potential uses and adaptations of wild plant species. Ulian et al. (2020) explored the importance of integrating indigenous knowledge into crop domestication and improvement programs, emphasizing the need for collaborative approaches that respect local cultures and biodiversity.Ethical considerations surrounding de novo domestication are of paramount importance. The use of indigenous plants and associated traditional knowledge raises questions about intellectual property rights and benefit-sharing. Khoury et al. (2016) discussed the ethical implications of accessing and utilizing plant genetic resources, highlighting the need for equitable partnerships between researchers and indigenous communities.Despite its potential, de novo domestication faces several challenges. The complex genetics underlying plant domestication traits are not fully understood, limiting the scope of genome editing interventions. Gao (2021) reviewed the current state of knowledge regarding domestication genes and their interactions, emphasizing the need for further research to unlock the full potential of de novo domestication.Furthermore, the long-term ecological and evolutionary consequences of introducing genome-edited crops into agricultural systems remain uncertain. Altpeter et al. (2016) discussed the potential environmental impacts of genome-edited crops, highlighting the need for comprehensive risk assessments and regulatory frameworks.In conclusion, de novo domestication using genome editing technologies offers a powerful tool for developing new crop varieties with enhanced traits. However, success in this endeavor requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines cutting-edge genetic technologies with traditional breeding methods, ethnobotanical knowledge, and ethical considerations. As our understanding of plant genetics and domestication processes continues to grow, de novo domestication has the potential to play a significant role in addressing global food security challenges in the face of climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Domestication of wild tomato is accelerated by genome editing", "authors": "Li, T., Yang, X., Yu, Y., Si, X., Zhai, X., Zhang, H., Dong, W., Gao, C., Xu, C.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1160", "last page": "1163", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.4273"}, {"title": "De novo domestication of wild tomato using genome editing", "authors": "Zsögön, A., Čermák, T., Naves, E.R., Notini, M.M., Edel, K.H., Weinl, S., Freschi, L., Voytas, D.F., Kudla, J., Peres, L.E.P.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1211", "last page": "1216", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.4272"}, {"title": "Molecular and physiological traits of transgenic crops: Prospects and challenges", "authors": "Fernie, A.R., Yan, J.", "journal": "Annual Review of Plant Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "70", "first page": "403", "last page": "431", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-arplant-050718-100301"}, {"title": "Rice genomics: Revealing past, present and future", "authors": "Brozynska, M., Furtado, A., Henry, R.J.", "journal": "Plant Biotechnology Journal", "year": "2016", "volumes": "14", "first page": "860", "last page": "871", "DOI": "10.1111/pbi.12501"}, {"title": "Prospects for genome editing in vegetable crops", "authors": "Østerberg, J.T., Xiang, W., Olsen, L.I., Edenbrandt, A.K., Vedel, S.E., Christiansen, A., Landes, X., Andersen, M.M., Pagh, P., Sandøe, P., Nielsen, J., Christensen, S.B., Thorsen, B.J., Kappel, K., Gamborg, C., Palmgren, M.", "journal": "Trends in Biotechnology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "35", "first page": "679", "last page": "681", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.06.001"}, {"title": "Unlocking plant resources to support food security and promote sustainable agriculture", "authors": "Ulian, T., Diazgranados, M., Pironon, S., Padulosi, S., Liu, U., Davies, L., Howes, M.J.R., Borrell, J.S., Ondo, I., Pérez-Escobar, O.A., Sharrock, S., Ryan, P., Hunter, D., Lee, M.A., Barstow, C., Łuczaj, Ł., Pieroni, A., Cámara-Leret, R., Noorani, A., Mba, C., Nono Womdim, R., Muminjanov, H., Antonelli, A., Pritchard, H.W., Mattana, E.", "journal": "Plants, People, Planet", "year": "2020", "volumes": "2", "first page": "421", "last page": "445", "DOI": "10.1002/ppp3.10145"}, {"title": "Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide", "authors": "Khoury, C.K., Achicanoy, H.A., Bjorkman, A.D., Navarro-Racines, C., Guarino, L., Flores-Palacios, X., Engels, J.M.M., Wiersema, J.H., Dempewolf, H., Sotelo, S., Ramírez-Villegas, J., Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P., Fowler, C., Jarvis, A., Rieseberg, L.H., Struik, P.C.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2016", "volumes": "283", "first page": "20160792", "last page": "20160792", "DOI": "10.1098/rspb.2016.0792"}, {"title": "Genome editing for crop improvement: Challenges and opportunities", "authors": "Gao, C.", "journal": "Journal of Integrative Plant Biology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "63", "first page": "3", "last page": "5", "DOI": "10.1111/jipb.13063"}, {"title": "Advancing crop transformation in the era of genome editing", "authors": "Altpeter, F., Springer, N.M., Bartley, L.E., Blechl, A.E., Brutnell, T.P., Citovsky, V., Conrad, L.J., Gelvin, S.B., Jackson, D.P., Kausch, A.P., Lemaux, P.G., Medford, J.I., Orozco-Cárdenas, M.L., Tricoli, D.M., Van Eck, J., Voytas, D.F., Walbot, V., Wang, K., Zhang, Z.J., Stewart, C.N.", "journal": "The Plant Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1510", "last page": "1520", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.16.00196"}]}
