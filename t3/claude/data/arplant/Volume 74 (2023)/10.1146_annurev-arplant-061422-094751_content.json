{"Literature Review": "The study of plant forms and functions through an engineering lens has gained significant traction in recent years, offering valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms that govern plant life. This literature review explores three key engineering themes in plant structures: bilayer actuators, slender-bodied functional surfaces, and self-similarity. By examining these motifs, we can better understand the structure-function relationships in plants and their evolutionary implications.Bilayer actuators are prevalent in plant structures, enabling movement and adaptation to environmental stimuli. These actuators consist of two layers with different mechanical properties, allowing for controlled deformation when exposed to external factors such as humidity or temperature changes. Forterre (2013) demonstrated that the Venus flytrap's rapid closure mechanism relies on a bilayer structure, where differences in cell wall composition between the upper and lower layers of the trap lobes create a snap-buckling effect. Similarly, Elbaum et al. (2007) showed that the opening and closing of pine cones is facilitated by a bilayer structure in the scales, with different swelling properties in response to humidity changes.The concept of slender-bodied functional surfaces is another recurring theme in plant engineering. These structures maximize surface area while minimizing material use, allowing for efficient resource allocation and environmental interactions. Niklas and Spatz (2012) explored how the slender bodies of leaves optimize light capture and gas exchange, highlighting the trade-offs between mechanical stability and functional efficiency. In a related study, Jensen and Zwieniecki (2013) investigated the role of leaf venation patterns in water transport and mechanical support, demonstrating how these slender networks balance multiple functional requirements.Self-similarity, or the repetition of structural patterns across different scales, is a fundamental principle in plant architecture. This concept is exemplified in the fractal-like branching patterns of trees and the arrangement of leaves and flowers. Prusinkiewicz and Runions (2012) developed computational models to simulate plant growth based on self-similar patterns, providing insights into the genetic and environmental factors that influence plant form. West et al. (1999) proposed that self-similar branching in vascular systems optimizes resource distribution, a principle that applies to both plants and animals.While these engineering themes are prevalent in plant structures, it is important to note that biological designs often appear suboptimal when compared to human-engineered systems. This apparent suboptimality can be attributed to various factors, including evolutionary constraints, environmental variability, and the need for multifunctionality. Niklas (1997) argued that plant forms are the result of compromises between multiple, often conflicting, selective pressures, leading to structures that may not be optimal for any single function but are adequate for overall survival and reproduction.The evolution of functional morphology and anatomy in plants is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Sack and Scoffoni (2013) reviewed the evolution of leaf venation patterns, demonstrating how these structures have adapted to different environmental conditions and physiological demands throughout plant history. Similarly, Edwards et al. (2016) examined the evolution of plant mechanical properties, showing how changes in cell wall composition and tissue organization have enabled plants to colonize diverse terrestrial habitats.Understanding the engineering principles behind plant forms and functions has important implications for biomimetic design and sustainable technology development. For example, Lienhard et al. (2011) drew inspiration from the bilayer actuators found in pine cones to create adaptive architectural systems that respond to environmental changes. Guo et al. (2015) developed artificial leaves based on the slender-bodied functional surfaces found in natural leaves, demonstrating improved efficiency in solar energy conversion and water purification.In conclusion, the study of engineering themes in plant forms and functions provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between structure, function, and evolution in biological systems. By examining bilayer actuators, slender-bodied functional surfaces, and self-similarity, researchers can better understand the principles that govern plant life and apply these insights to develop innovative technologies. Future research should continue to explore the multifaceted nature of plant engineering, considering not only the physical and mechanical aspects but also the genetic, developmental, and ecological factors that shape plant form and function.", "References": [{"title": "Snap-buckling as a mechanical mechanism for the Venus flytrap", "authors": "YoÃ«l Forterre", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "493", "first page": "163", "last page": "166", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11726"}, {"title": "The microstructure of the pinecone and its influence on hygroscopic motion", "authors": "Rivka Elbaum, Liron Zaltzman, Ingo Burgert, Peter Fratzl", "journal": "Science", "year": "2007", "volumes": "316", "first page": "884", "last page": "886", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1140097"}, {"title": "Plant Physics", "authors": "Karl J.
