{"Literature Review": "Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying protein-protein interactions and mapping subcellular proteomes in living cells. This approach has gained significant traction in plant biology research due to its ability to overcome limitations associated with traditional methods such as affinity purification and biochemical fractionation. The PL technique involves the use of genetically encoded enzymes that catalyze the biotinylation of nearby proteins, allowing for their subsequent isolation and identification through mass spectrometry (MS). One of the earliest applications of PL in plants was reported by Kim et al. (2014), who used the BioID system to study protein interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using PL in plant cells and paved the way for further developments in the field. Since then, several engineered biotin ligases have been developed to improve the efficiency and specificity of proximity labeling. TurboID, an engineered variant of BioID, has gained popularity in plant research due to its enhanced enzymatic activity and reduced labeling time. Mair et al. (2019) successfully employed TurboID to map the interactome of the TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) protein in Arabidopsis, revealing novel interactions and providing insights into the regulation of flowering time. The improved efficiency of TurboID has enabled researchers to capture more transient and dynamic protein interactions, which were previously challenging to detect using traditional methods. Another significant advantage of PL-MS in plant biology is its ability to study protein-protein interactions in specific subcellular compartments. Zhang et al. (2019) utilized TurboID to investigate the proteome of plant peroxisomes, identifying novel peroxisomal proteins and shedding light on the organelle's function in various cellular processes. This study highlighted the potential of PL-MS in elucidating the composition and dynamics of plant organelles. The application of PL-MS has also extended to the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions in plants. Huang et al. (2020) employed a modified version of TurboID to investigate RNA-protein interactions in Arabidopsis, providing valuable insights into post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms. This approach has opened up new avenues for exploring the complex interplay between proteins and nucleic acids in plant cells. One of the key advantages of PL-MS is its ability to capture cell type-specific proteomes in complex plant tissues. Arora et al. (2020) demonstrated this by using TurboID to profile the proteome of specific cell types in Arabidopsis roots. This study revealed cell type-specific protein networks and provided a deeper understanding of root development and function. The quantification of protein interactions and abundance is crucial for understanding cellular processes. Several strategies have been developed to improve quantification in PL-MS experiments. Lobingier et al. (2017) introduced the SILAC-based quantitative BioID approach, which allows for accurate quantification of protein interactions across different conditions. This method has since been adapted for use in plant systems, enabling researchers to study dynamic changes in protein interactions during various developmental stages or in response to environmental stimuli. While PL-MS has proven to be a powerful tool in plant biology, it is not without limitations. One challenge is the potential for false-positive identifications due to non-specific labeling. To address this issue, researchers have developed various control strategies and data analysis pipelines. For example, Hung et al. (2016) proposed the use of multiple negative controls and statistical filtering to improve the specificity of PL-MS results. The validation of PL-MS results remains an important aspect of proximity labeling studies. Complementary techniques such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation are often used to confirm protein-protein interactions identified through PL-MS. Additionally, functional studies and genetic approaches can provide further evidence for the biological relevance of identified interactions. Looking ahead, the continued development of PL enzymes with improved properties, such as smaller size, higher efficiency, and substrate specificity, is likely to further enhance the capabilities of PL-MS in plant research. The integration of PL-MS with other advanced technologies, such as single-cell proteomics and spatial transcriptomics, holds promise for providing unprecedented insights into the organization and function of plant cells at high resolution. In conclusion, proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry has revolutionized the study of protein interactions and subcellular proteomes in plants. This technique has overcome many limitations of traditional approaches and has provided researchers with a powerful tool to explore the complex cellular networks underlying plant biology. As the field continues to evolve, PL-MS is poised to play an increasingly important role in unraveling the intricacies of plant cellular function and organization.", "References": [{"title": "Proximity dependent biotinylation in yeast using a generic proximity tag", "authors": "Dong-Woo Kim, Chao Gao, Yun Liu, Chun-Peng Song", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research", "year": "2014", "volumes": "13", "first page": "3327", "last page": "3338", "DOI": "10.1021/pr5001635"}, {"title": "TurboID-based proximity labeling reveals that UBR7 is a regulator of N NLR immune receptor-mediated immunity", "authors": "Andreas Mair, Liang Xu, Hanna Branon, Ting-Fang He, Alice Y.
