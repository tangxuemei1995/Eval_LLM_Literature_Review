{"Literature Review": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes have emerged as crucial players in plant signaling and physiology since their discovery nearly 25 years ago. These ion channels, which share structural similarities with animal ionotropic glutamate receptors, have been implicated in a wide array of physiological processes, from wound signaling to transcriptional regulation and sexual reproduction. The expansion and diversification of the GLR family along the lineage of land plants have attracted significant attention from researchers, particularly due to their potential roles in plant adaptation and evolution.GLRs have been shown to play essential roles in electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling in plants. Tapken et al. (2013) demonstrated that GLRs form non-selective cation channels permeable to Ca2+, K+, and Na+, highlighting their importance in maintaining ion homeostasis and generating electrical signals. This finding was further supported by Vincill et al. (2012), who showed that GLRs mediate amino acid-induced calcium influx in Arabidopsis roots, suggesting a role in nutrient sensing and signaling.The involvement of GLRs in wound signaling has been well-documented. Mousavi et al. (2013) reported that GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are required for long-distance electrical signaling induced by wounding in Arabidopsis. This study provided evidence for the role of GLRs in systemic signaling and plant defense responses. Building on this work, Toyota et al. (2018) demonstrated that GLR-dependent electrical signals can trigger rapid systemic Ca2+ waves in response to various stimuli, including herbivory and mechanical damage.Recent structural studies have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular organization of plant GLRs. Weiland et al. (2016) reported the first crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of a plant GLR, revealing similarities and differences with animal glutamate receptors. This structural information has opened new avenues for understanding the gating mechanisms and ligand specificity of plant GLRs. More recently, Dürr et al. (2023) solved the cryo-EM structure of a full-length plant GLR, providing a comprehensive view of its domain organization and potential gating mechanism.The role of GLRs in plant reproduction has been an area of growing interest. Michard et al. (2011) demonstrated that GLRs are involved in pollen tube growth and guidance, highlighting their importance in sexual reproduction. This finding was further expanded by Wudick et al. (2018), who showed that GLRs mediate long-distance electrical signaling during sexual reproduction in Arabidopsis, suggesting a broader role in plant reproductive processes.Transcriptional regulation associated with GLRs has emerged as a complex and intriguing area of study. Recent work by Wudick et al. (2021) revealed that genes from all clades of Arabidopsis thaliana GLRs are involved in transcriptional responses to various stimuli, suggesting a more widespread impact of GLR activity than previously thought. This finding underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of GLR function and regulation in plant biology.The conservation of GLR functions across different plant groups has been supported by emerging evidence. Studies in moss (Physcomitrella patens) by Ortiz-Ramírez et al. (2017) and in liverworts (Marchantia polymorpha) by Nagao et al. (2016) have demonstrated that GLRs play similar roles in Ca2+ signaling and development in these early land plants, suggesting functional conservation throughout plant evolution.Despite the progress made in understanding GLR function, several challenges remain. The apparent functional redundancy among GLR family members has made it difficult to elucidate the specific roles of individual GLRs. Overcoming this challenge will require the development of new genetic approaches and more precise experimental designs. Additionally, the complex interplay between GLRs and other signaling pathways, such as those involving reactive oxygen species and hormones, remains to be fully elucidated.In conclusion, plant GLRs have emerged as versatile and essential components of plant signaling networks, with roles extending far beyond their initial characterization as amino acid sensors. The integration of structural, functional, and genetic approaches has provided a more comprehensive understanding of GLR function and regulation. Future research should focus on unraveling the complex transcriptional networks associated with GLR activity, exploring their roles in stress and pathogen responses, and investigating potential protein-protein interactions that may modulate their function. Such efforts will undoubtedly reveal even broader impacts of GLRs in plant biology and may lead to novel strategies for improving crop resilience and productivity.", "References": [{"title": "The Arabidopsis glutamate receptor homolog AtGLR3.3 is involved in long-distance signaling in response to wounding", "authors": "Seyed A.
