{"Literature Review": "Polar metals represent a fascinating class of materials that challenge our conventional understanding of polarity and metallicity. Traditionally, these properties were thought to be mutually exclusive, as the free electrons in metals were expected to screen out any internal electric fields associated with polarity. However, recent advances in materials science and condensed matter physics have led to the discovery and engineering of materials that exhibit both polar and metallic characteristics simultaneously.The concept of polar metals was first proposed over five decades ago, but it wasn't until recently that significant progress has been made in their realization and understanding. The breakthrough came with the experimental identification of LiOsO3 and WTe2 as the first examples of polar metals. This discovery has sparked intense research interest in the field, leading to the exploration of various mechanisms that allow for the coexistence of polarity and metallicity.One of the key principles in designing polar metals is the concept of 'improper ferroelectricity.' In this mechanism, the polar distortion is not driven by the polarization itself but rather by another primary order parameter. This approach allows for the persistence of polar distortions even in the presence of metallic screening. The perovskite structure, known for its versatility in accommodating various chemical compositions and structural distortions, has proven to be a fertile ground for realizing polar metals.Another important strategy in engineering polar metals involves the use of layered structures. In these materials, the polar distortions and metallic conduction can be spatially separated, allowing for their coexistence. This approach has been particularly successful in two-dimensional materials like WTe2, where the polar distortions are confined to the atomic layers while metallicity persists in the plane.The interplay between polarity and metallicity in these materials gives rise to a host of interesting properties and potential applications. For instance, polar metals have been found to exhibit novel topological states, opening up new avenues in the field of topology. The presence of both polarity and metallicity also offers unique opportunities in spintronics, where the control of spin currents through electrical means could lead to more efficient and versatile devices.Furthermore, the coexistence of polarity and superconductivity in some polar metals has attracted significant attention. This combination could potentially lead to unconventional superconducting states and novel quantum phenomena. The field of magnetoelectricity has also benefited from the study of polar metals, as these materials provide a platform for exploring the interplay between magnetic and electric order parameters in a metallic environment.Despite the progress made in recent years, several challenges remain in the field of polar metals. One of the primary difficulties lies in the experimental verification of polarity in metallic systems. Traditional ferroelectric characterization techniques, such as polarization-electric field hysteresis measurements, are not applicable to metals due to their high conductivity. As a result, researchers have had to develop new experimental approaches, including symmetry analysis through structural characterization and the use of second-harmonic generation spectroscopy.Another challenge is the theoretical description of polar metals. The conventional theory of ferroelectricity, based on the concept of Born effective charges, breaks down in metallic systems. This has necessitated the development of new theoretical frameworks that can accurately describe the polar state in the presence of itinerant electrons.Looking ahead, the field of polar metals holds great promise for both fundamental science and technological applications. The unique combination of polarity and metallicity offers a rich playground for exploring novel quantum phenomena and developing new functional materials. Future research directions may include the search for room-temperature polar metals, the exploration of polar superconductors, and the development of polar metal-based devices for spintronics and quantum computing.In conclusion, polar metals represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of material properties. By challenging the conventional wisdom that polarity and metallicity are incompatible, these materials have opened up new avenues for materials design and engineering. As research in this field continues to advance, we can expect to see further discoveries that push the boundaries of condensed matter physics and materials science, potentially leading to transformative technologies in electronics, energy, and quantum information processing.", "References": [{"title": "Ferroelectric metal LiOsO3", "authors": "Youguo Shi, Yanfeng Guo, Xia Wang, Andrew J.
