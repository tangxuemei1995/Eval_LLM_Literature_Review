{"Literature Review": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool in materials science research, offering unprecedented capabilities for characterizing materials at atomic and nanoscale levels. This literature review aims to explore the recent advancements in quantitative STEM techniques, focusing on imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and tomography, while highlighting the importance of data analysis and simulation methods.STEM imaging has undergone significant improvements in recent years, particularly with the advent of aberration-corrected microscopes. Pennycook et al. (2015) demonstrated that aberration correction allows for sub-Ångström resolution imaging, enabling the visualization of individual atoms and their arrangements in complex materials. This capability has revolutionized our understanding of material structures and defects at the atomic scale. Furthermore, Yankovich et al. (2014) showed that quantitative STEM imaging could be used to measure atomic column positions with picometer precision, opening up new possibilities for studying subtle structural distortions and strain fields in materials.In the realm of diffraction, STEM has proven to be particularly useful for analyzing local crystal structures and orientations. As highlighted by Ophus (2019), the development of four-dimensional STEM (4D-STEM) techniques has enabled the acquisition of full diffraction patterns at each scan position, providing rich information about local crystallography and strain. This approach has been successfully applied to various materials systems, including 2D materials and nanostructures. Complementary to 4D-STEM, precession electron diffraction (PED) has gained popularity for its ability to reduce dynamical scattering effects and improve the reliability of structure factor measurements, as demonstrated by Midgley and Eggeman (2015).Spectroscopic techniques in STEM have also seen significant advancements, particularly in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Krivanek et al. (2014) showcased the potential of monochromated STEM-EELS for probing vibrational modes in materials with high spatial resolution, pushing the boundaries of spectroscopic analysis at the nanoscale. In the field of EDS, Chen et al. (2016) demonstrated the use of large-area silicon drift detectors for efficient X-ray collection, enabling rapid elemental mapping with high spatial resolution and sensitivity.Tomography has emerged as a powerful technique for three-dimensional characterization of materials using STEM. Goris et al. (2015) illustrated the application of electron tomography for 3D imaging of nanoparticles and nanostructures with atomic resolution. This approach has provided valuable insights into the three-dimensional arrangements of atoms and defects in materials, which are crucial for understanding their properties and behavior.The quantitative analysis of STEM data has become increasingly important, with a growing emphasis on developing robust and efficient computational methods. As discussed by Spurgeon et al. (2021), open-source software tools have played a crucial role in advancing quantitative STEM analysis, enabling researchers to process and interpret large datasets more effectively. These tools have facilitated the development of advanced image processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and simulation methods for STEM data analysis.Simulation methods have become indispensable for interpreting STEM data and extracting quantitative information. Kirkland (2020) provided a comprehensive overview of multislice simulations for STEM imaging and diffraction, which have become the gold standard for modeling electron-specimen interactions. These simulations are essential for understanding contrast mechanisms, quantifying image intensities, and interpreting complex diffraction patterns.Despite the numerous advancements in quantitative STEM techniques, challenges remain. One of the primary concerns is radiation damage, particularly when studying beam-sensitive materials. Egerton (2019) discussed various strategies for mitigating beam damage, including low-dose imaging techniques and cryogenic sample holders. Another challenge lies in the interpretation of 3D tomographic reconstructions, where artifacts and missing information can affect the accuracy of the results.Looking towards the future, several promising directions for quantitative STEM research are emerging. The integration of in situ and operando techniques with STEM is enabling real-time observations of material dynamics and reactions, as demonstrated by Taheri et al. (2016). Additionally, the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for STEM data analysis is expected to revolutionize the way we extract and interpret information from complex datasets.In conclusion, quantitative STEM has become an indispensable tool in materials science research, offering a wide range of capabilities for characterizing materials at the atomic and nanoscale levels. The continuous development of instrumentation, data analysis methods, and simulation techniques is pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with STEM. As the field continues to evolve, it is expected that quantitative STEM will play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of materials and their properties.", "References": [{"title": "Advanced STEM-EELS Techniques", "authors": "Stephen J.
