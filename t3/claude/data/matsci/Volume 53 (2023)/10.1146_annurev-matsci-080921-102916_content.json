{"Literature Review": "Soft robotics has emerged as a promising field that aims to bridge the gap between artificial machines and biological systems through innovative materials design. This approach seeks to create robots that exhibit physical intelligence, passive adaptability, and morphological computation, characteristics inherent to living organisms. The development of electrically controllable materials is crucial for advancing soft robotics, as it enables the creation of machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent.Thermomechanical actuation has been a significant focus in the development of electrically controllable soft robotic materials. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to undergo reversible shape changes in response to temperature variations induced by electrical current. Wang et al. (2016) demonstrated the use of NiTi-based SMAs in soft robotic applications, showcasing their potential for creating compact and efficient actuators. However, challenges such as slow response times and limited strain recovery have led researchers to explore alternative materials.Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) have emerged as a promising electrostatic actuation strategy for soft robotics. These materials consist of a thin elastomer film sandwiched between compliant electrodes, which deform when subjected to an electric field. Pelrine et al. (2000) pioneered the development of DEAs, demonstrating their potential for large strains and fast response times. Recent advancements in DEA technology have focused on improving their performance and durability. For instance, Zhao et al. (2018) developed a novel DEA design that achieved a strain of over 100% while maintaining high cycle life.Electroactive polymers (EAPs) represent another class of materials that have shown great promise in soft robotic applications. Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are a type of EAP that exhibit bending deformation when subjected to an electric field. Kim and Tadokoro (2007) provided a comprehensive review of IPMC actuators, highlighting their potential for creating biomimetic soft robots. However, challenges such as low force output and dehydration issues have limited their widespread adoption.Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have gained attention as potential actuators for soft robots due to their ability to undergo large, reversible deformations in response to various stimuli, including electric fields. Ohm et al. (2012) demonstrated the use of LCEs in creating soft robotic actuators with programmable shape changes. Recent work by Ware et al. (2015) has focused on developing electrically responsive LCEs, opening up new possibilities for precise control in soft robotic systems.Electrochemical actuators have also shown promise in soft robotics applications. Conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole and polyaniline, can undergo volume changes when subjected to electrochemical reactions. Smela (2003) provided an overview of conducting polymer actuators and their potential applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and soft robotics. Recent advancements in this field have focused on improving the performance and durability of these materials.The integration of sensing capabilities into soft robotic materials is crucial for achieving true bioinspired autonomy. Stretchable and flexible electronics have emerged as a key enabling technology for this purpose. Rogers et al. (2010) demonstrated the development of stretchable electronic systems that can be seamlessly integrated into soft robotic structures. Recent work by Xu et al. (2019) has focused on creating multifunctional soft materials that combine sensing and actuation capabilities, paving the way for more advanced and autonomous soft robots.Control strategies for soft robots present unique challenges due to the inherent nonlinearity and compliance of the materials used. Traditional control methods often fall short in addressing these challenges. Rus and Tolley (2015) provided an overview of the control challenges in soft robotics and proposed potential solutions. Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown promise in developing more effective control strategies for soft robots.The fabrication of soft robotic materials and structures has been greatly facilitated by advancements in 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies. Truby and Lewis (2016) reviewed the state-of-the-art in 3D printing of soft robotic materials, highlighting the potential for creating complex, multimaterial structures with embedded functionality. Recent work by Wallin et al. (2018) has focused on developing new 3D printable materials with electrically controllable properties, further expanding the design space for soft robots.As the field of soft robotics continues to evolve, there is a growing need for materials that can simultaneously sense, actuate, and compute. Majidi (2014) proposed the concept of robotic materials, which integrate sensing, actuation, and computation at the material level. This approach holds great promise for creating truly autonomous and adaptive soft robots that can interact seamlessly with their environment.In conclusion, the development of electrically controllable materials for soft, bioinspired machines has made significant progress in recent years. Advances in thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical actuation strategies, coupled with innovations in sensing and control, have paved the way for more sophisticated and capable soft robots. As research in this field continues to progress, we can expect to see the emergence of next-generation robotic materials that will enable soft machines to achieve true bioinspired autonomy, bridging the gap between artificial and biological systems.", "References": [{"title": "Soft robotics: Review of fluid-driven intrinsically soft devices; manufacturing, sensing, control, and applications in human-robot interaction", "authors": "Daniela Rus, Michael T.
