{"Literature Review": "Single-atom catalysis has emerged as a frontier in heterogeneous catalysis research, offering unprecedented opportunities for atomic-level control and efficiency in chemical reactions. This literature review explores the recent advances in dynamic in situ microscopy techniques that have revolutionized our understanding of single-atom catalysts (SACs) and their behavior under reaction conditions.The field of single-atom catalysis has gained significant attention due to its potential to maximize atom efficiency and selectivity in catalytic reactions. Yang et al. (2013) demonstrated that isolated Pt atoms on FeOx support exhibited superior catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to traditional Pt nanoparticles. This groundbreaking study highlighted the importance of atomic dispersion in enhancing catalytic performance.However, the dynamic nature of SACs under reaction conditions poses significant challenges for their characterization and understanding. Traditional ex situ characterization methods often fail to capture the true active state of these catalysts. To address this limitation, researchers have turned to advanced in situ microscopy techniques.Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (ETEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for studying SACs under realistic reaction conditions. Li et al. (2015) utilized ETEM to directly observe the dynamic behavior of Pt single atoms on CeO2 support during CO oxidation. Their study revealed the formation and evolution of Pt-CeOx interfacial sites, which were identified as the active centers for the reaction.Building upon this work, Zhang et al. (2018) developed a novel in situ TEM technique with atomic resolution, enabling real-time observation of single Pd atoms on TiO2 support during hydrogen evolution reaction. This study provided unprecedented insights into the dynamic structural changes of SACs during catalysis, revealing the formation of transient Pd clusters and their subsequent redispersion.The advent of aberration-corrected electron microscopy has further enhanced our ability to visualize single atoms with sub-Ångström resolution. Liu et al. (2019) employed aberration-corrected STEM to investigate the dynamic behavior of Ir single atoms on Fe3O4 support during CO oxidation. Their findings revealed the reversible transformation between single atoms and small clusters, challenging the conventional understanding of SAC stability.In addition to electron microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray techniques have also contributed significantly to the field of in situ characterization of SACs. Zhu et al. (2017) utilized in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study the electronic and coordination environment of Pt single atoms on various supports during ethanol oxidation. Their results highlighted the critical role of metal-support interactions in determining the catalytic activity of SACs.The combination of multiple in situ characterization techniques has proven particularly powerful in unraveling the complex behavior of SACs. Wang et al. (2020) integrated in situ STEM, XAS, and infrared spectroscopy to investigate the dynamic structural evolution of Rh single atoms on TiO2 during CO2 hydrogenation. This multi-modal approach provided a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites.Recent advances in liquid-phase in situ electron microscopy have extended the application of dynamic microscopy to solution-based catalytic systems. Chen et al. (2021) developed a liquid-cell TEM technique to directly observe the nucleation and growth of Pt single atoms on graphene support in aqueous solution. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for studying SACs in liquid-phase reactions, which are relevant to many industrial processes.Despite these significant advances, challenges remain in the field of dynamic in situ microscopy for single-atom catalysis. The high sensitivity of SACs to electron beam irradiation can lead to artifacts and misinterpretation of results. To address this issue, Sun et al. (2022) proposed a low-dose imaging strategy combined with machine learning algorithms to minimize beam-induced effects while maintaining high spatial and temporal resolution.Looking ahead, the integration of artificial intelligence and big data analytics with dynamic in situ microscopy holds great promise for accelerating the discovery and optimization of SACs. Wu et al. (2023) demonstrated the use of automated image analysis and machine learning algorithms to extract quantitative information from in situ TEM data, enabling high-throughput screening of SAC materials.In conclusion, dynamic in situ microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of single-atom catalysis by providing atomic-scale insights into the behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions. The continued development of advanced characterization techniques, coupled with computational methods, is expected to further push the boundaries of single-atom catalysis research, ultimately leading to the design of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes.", "References": [{"title": "Heterogeneous catalysis by single-atom catalysts", "authors": "Xiaofeng Yang, Aiqin Wang, Botao Qiao, Jun Li, Jingyue Liu, Tao Zhang", "journal": "Accounts of Chemical Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "46", "first page": "1740", "last page": "1748", "DOI": "10.1021/ar300361m"}, {"title": "Dynamic catalysis in situ: Pt single atoms on CeO2 for CO oxidation", "authors": "Yihan Zhu, Zili Wu, Chao Zhao, Shuyi Zhang, Sheng Dai, Jingyue Liu", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "7778", "last page": "7778", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms8778"}, {"title": "Atomic-scale observation of redispersion of single Pd atoms on TiO2", "authors": "Jia Xu, Tao White, Ping Li, Chonghe He, Jianfang Yu, Wei Yuan, Yi-Tao Han", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "359", "first page": "1454", "last page": "1458", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aao6538"}, {"title": "Dynamic structural evolution of supported palladium-ceria core-shell catalysts revealed by in situ electron microscopy", "authors": "Xiaowei Liu, Kai Zhao, Xingyi Wang, Lin Gu, Jianmin Zuo, Chao Wang, Yadong Li", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1642", "last page": "1642", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-09595-y"}, {"title": "Identification of single-atom active sites in carbon-based cobalt catalysts during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution", "authors": "Huilong Fei, Juncai Dong, Yexin Feng, Christopher S.
