{"Literature Review": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of various materials, offering unprecedented control over their functional characteristics. This literature review explores recent advancements in the field, focusing on the application of ionic gating to oxides, magnetic thin-film heterostructures, and van der Waals 2D layers.The principle of ionic gating involves the use of an electrolyte to apply strong electric fields to a material's surface, inducing significant changes in its properties. Leighton et al. (2019) provided a comprehensive overview of the ionic gating mechanism, highlighting its ability to achieve high carrier densities and electric fields that surpass those attainable through conventional solid-state gating methods. This technique has proven particularly effective in manipulating the electronic structure of transition metal oxides, as demonstrated by Nakano et al. (2012) in their groundbreaking study on VO2.In the realm of transition metal oxides, ionic gating has been instrumental in exploring novel phases and properties. Shi et al. (2013) reported the electric field-induced superconductivity in an insulating copper oxide, demonstrating the potential of ionic gating to induce dramatic changes in electronic behavior. Similarly, Li et al. (2019) observed a reversible insulator-metal transition in NdNiO3 thin films using ionic liquid gating, showcasing the technique's ability to modulate electronic phase transitions.The application of ionic gating to magnetic thin-film heterostructures has opened up new avenues for controlling magnetism at the nanoscale. Bauer et al. (2015) demonstrated voltage-controlled switching of the magnetic easy axis in ultrathin Co films, illustrating the potential for low-power magnetic device applications. In a related study, Tan et al. (2019) achieved reversible control of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Ta/CoFeB/MgO structures using ionic gating, further emphasizing the technique's versatility in manipulating magnetic properties.Van der Waals 2D materials have also been subject to extensive investigation using ionic gating techniques. Ye et al. (2012) reported the observation of superconductivity in ionically gated MoS2, showcasing the potential of this approach in exploring exotic phases in 2D systems. Building on this work, Lu et al. (2015) demonstrated the ability to tune the band structure and induce a topological phase transition in few-layer WTe2 using ionic gating, highlighting the technique's capacity to access novel quantum states in 2D materials.The mechanisms underlying the effects of ionic gating are diverse and material-dependent. In some cases, the applied electric field induces electrostatic doping, modifying the carrier concentration and band structure of the material. In other instances, ionic gating can trigger electrochemical reactions, leading to changes in the material's crystal structure or composition. Jeong et al. (2013) provided insights into these mechanisms by studying the reversible control of lattice strain in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ thin films using ionic liquid gating, demonstrating the interplay between electrostatic and electrochemical effects.The potential applications of ionic gating extend beyond fundamental research into the realm of functional devices. In particular, the field of neuromorphic computing has shown great promise for leveraging the unique properties of ionically gated materials. Wang et al. (2018) demonstrated a synaptic transistor based on an ionically gated WO3 channel, showcasing the potential for creating brain-inspired computing architectures. This work highlights the possibility of using ionic gating to create artificial synapses and neurons, paving the way for more efficient and biologically inspired computing systems.Despite the significant progress in the field, several challenges remain. The long-term stability of ionically gated devices, the scalability of the technique for large-scale applications, and the need for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms all present opportunities for future research. Additionally, the exploration of new material systems and the development of novel device architectures that can fully exploit the unique capabilities of ionic gating are areas of ongoing investigation.In conclusion, ionic gating has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool for tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of a wide range of materials. From inducing superconductivity in insulators to controlling magnetism at the nanoscale and exploring exotic phases in 2D materials, this technique has opened up new avenues for both fundamental research and practical applications. As the field continues to evolve, ionic gating is poised to play a crucial role in the development of next-generation electronic and magnetic devices, particularly in the emerging field of neuromorphic computing.", "References": [{"title": "Ionic liquid gating of ultra-thin magnetic films", "authors": "Uwe Bauer, Lide Yao, Aik Jun Tan, Parnika Agrawal, Satoru Emori, Harry L.
