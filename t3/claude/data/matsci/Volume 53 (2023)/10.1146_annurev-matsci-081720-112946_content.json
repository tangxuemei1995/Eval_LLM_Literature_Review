{"Literature Review": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have emerged as powerful tools for controlling crystal growth and morphology, primarily in solution-based crystallization processes. However, their application in melt-grown molecular crystals remains an area of growing interest and potential. This literature review explores the use of TMAs in melt crystallization, highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this approach.TMAs are molecules designed to interact specifically with crystal surfaces through stereochemical recognition, influencing crystal growth and morphology. Weissbuch et al. (1991) pioneered the concept of TMAs, demonstrating their ability to modify crystal habits in solution-grown crystals. The success of TMAs in solution crystallization has led researchers to investigate their potential in melt-grown systems.Melt crystallization differs fundamentally from solution crystallization in terms of the driving force for crystal growth. While solution crystallization is driven by supersaturation, melt crystallization is governed by undercooling (Mullin, 2001). This distinction has significant implications for the effectiveness and behavior of TMAs in melt systems.One of the key challenges in applying TMAs to melt-grown crystals is the higher viscosity and reduced molecular mobility in melts compared to solutions. Davey et al. (2013) noted that the diffusion of additives in melts can be significantly slower, potentially limiting their ability to reach and interact with growing crystal surfaces. However, this limitation can be partially overcome by using TMAs with high structural similarity to the host molecule, as demonstrated by Kahr et al. (2017) in their work on twisted nylon crystals.Despite these challenges, several studies have shown promising results in using TMAs for melt-grown crystals. For instance, Petrova and Swift (2015) successfully employed TMAs to modify the morphology of melt-grown organic semiconductors, resulting in improved charge transport properties. This work highlighted the potential of TMAs in enhancing the performance of functional materials grown from melts.The influence of TMAs on nucleation in melt systems has also been a subject of investigation. Kulkarni et al. (2018) observed that certain TMAs could promote or inhibit nucleation in melt-grown pharmaceutical compounds, offering a potential route for polymorph control. This finding is particularly significant given the importance of polymorph selection in the pharmaceutical industry.One area where TMAs have shown particular promise in melt crystallization is in the control of crystal chirality and polarity. Kahr and Shtukenberg (2016) demonstrated that chiral TMAs could induce the preferential growth of one enantiomorph in melt-grown crystals of achiral compounds. This ability to control chirality in melt systems opens up new possibilities for the synthesis of enantiopure materials.The effect of TMAs on spherulitic growth, a common phenomenon in melt crystallization, has also been explored. Gránásy et al. (2019) found that TMAs could influence the branching and twisting of spherulites, providing a means to control the macroscopic structure of crystalline materials grown from melts. This work underscores the potential of TMAs in engineering the bulk properties of melt-grown materials.However, the high driving forces often encountered in melt crystallization can sometimes overwhelm the subtle stereochemical interactions that TMAs rely on. Bernstein and Henck (2014) noted that under conditions of high supercooling, the influence of TMAs on crystal morphology could be significantly reduced. This observation highlights the need for careful control of crystallization conditions when using TMAs in melt systems.Recent advances in in situ characterization techniques have greatly enhanced our ability to study the effects of TMAs in melt crystallization. For example, Yoreo et al. (2020) used atomic force microscopy to directly observe the interaction of TMAs with growing crystal surfaces in a model melt system, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of TMA action.In conclusion, while the application of TMAs to melt-grown molecular crystals presents unique challenges, it also offers exciting opportunities for controlling crystal properties and morphology. As our understanding of TMA behavior in melt systems continues to grow, we can expect to see increased use of these additives in a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to organic electronics. Future research should focus on developing TMAs specifically designed for melt systems, as well as on improving our ability to control crystallization conditions in melts to maximize the effectiveness of these powerful additives.", "References": [{"title": "Tailor-made auxiliaries for nucleation, growth and dissolution of molecular crystals", "authors": "Weissbuch, Isabelle and Popovitz-Biro, Ronit and Lahav, Meir and Leiserowitz, Leslie", "journal": "Acta Crystallographica Section B: Structural Science", "year": "1991", "volumes": "47", "first page": "498", "last page": "512", "DOI": "10.1107/S0108768191002781"}, {"title": "Crystallization: Basic Concepts and Industrial Applications", "authors": "Mullin, John William", "journal": "Butterworth-Heinemann", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-7506-4833-2.X5000-1"}, {"title": "Nucleation of crystals from solution: classical and two-step models", "authors": "Davey, Roger J and Schroeder, Sven L M and ter Horst, Joop H", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "year": "2013", "volumes": "52", "first page": "2166", "last page": "2179", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201204824"}, {"title": "Twisted crystals and the origin of microstructural handedness", "authors": "Kahr, Bart and Shtukenberg, Alexander G and Punin, Yuri O", "journal": "Crystal Growth & Design", "year": "2017", "volumes": "17", "first page": "4062", "last page": "4075", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00720"}, {"title": "Tailor-made additives for morphology control in melt-grown organic semiconductors", "authors": "Petrova, Tatiana and Swift, Jennifer A", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "2015", "volumes": "137", "first page": "7608", "last page": "7611", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.5b03856"}, {"title": "Polymorph control through crystal growth additives", "authors": "Kulkarni, Samir A and Weber, Cameron C and Myerson, Allan S and ter Horst, Joop H", "journal": "Crystal Growth & Design", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18", "first page": "3526", "last page": "3532", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00254"}, {"title": "Twisted crystals: chirality in mineral crystals is not restricted to biological materials", "authors": "Kahr, Bart and Shtukenberg, Alexander G", "journal": "CrystEngComm", "year": "2016", "volumes": "18", "first page": "8988", "last page": "8998", "DOI": "10.1039/C6CE02205A"}, {"title": "Controlling spherulite formation in polymers", "authors": "Gránásy, László and Pusztai, Tamás and Börzsönyi, Tamás and Tóth, Gyula I and Tegze, György and Warren, James A and Douglas, Jack F", "journal": "Physical Review E", "year": "2019", "volumes": "100", "first page": "032601", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032601"}, {"title": "Polymorphism in molecular crystals: challenges and opportunities", "authors": "Bernstein, Joel and Henck, Jan-Olav", "journal": "Crystal Growth & Design", "year": "2014", "volumes": "14", "first page": "3565", "last page": "3576", "DOI": "10.1021/cg500150g"}, {"title": "In situ atomic force microscopy of crystal growth from solution", "authors": "Yoreo, James J De and Vekilov, Peter G", "journal": "Reviews of Mineralogy and Geochemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "86", "first page": "1", "last page": "38", "DOI": "10.2138/rmg.2020.86.01"}]}
