{"Literature Review": "Piezoelectric materials have garnered significant attention in recent decades due to their unique ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. This property, known as the piezoelectric effect, has led to the development of numerous applications across various fields, including medical imaging, energy harvesting, and structural health monitoring. However, traditional piezoelectric materials often face limitations in terms of flexibility, durability, or overall performance. To address these challenges, researchers have turned to piezoelectric composites, which combine the advantages of different materials to create more versatile and efficient piezoelectric systems.The concept of piezoelectric composites was first introduced by Newnham et al. in 1978, who proposed a classification system based on the connectivity of the constituent phases. This system, known as the connectivity model, describes the arrangement of the active (piezoelectric) and passive (non-piezoelectric) phases within the composite. The most common connectivity patterns are 0-3, 1-3, and 2-2, where the numbers represent the dimensionality of each phase.One of the primary advantages of piezoelectric composites is their ability to combine the high electromechanical coupling and piezoelectric coefficients of ferroelectric ceramics or single crystals with the flexibility and formability of polymers. This combination allows for the creation of materials with tailored properties suitable for specific applications. For instance, Tressler et al. demonstrated that 1-3 composites of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) in a polymer matrix exhibited significantly improved hydrostatic sensitivity compared to monolithic PZT, making them ideal for underwater acoustic sensing applications.The choice of materials for both the active and passive phases plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of piezoelectric composites. Ferroelectric ceramics, such as PZT and barium titanate (BaTiO3), are commonly used as the active phase due to their high piezoelectric coefficients and electromechanical coupling factors. However, these materials are often brittle and difficult to shape into complex geometries. To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored the use of single crystals, such as lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) and lead zinc niobate-lead titanate (PZN-PT), which offer even higher piezoelectric properties than traditional ceramics.The passive phase, typically a polymer, serves multiple purposes in piezoelectric composites. It provides flexibility, improves mechanical strength, and allows for easier processing and shaping of the final product. Common polymer matrices include epoxy resins, polyurethanes, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The choice of polymer can significantly impact the overall properties of the composite, as demonstrated by Yamada et al., who showed that the use of different polymer matrices in PZT-based composites resulted in varying degrees of flexibility and piezoelectric response.The design and fabrication of piezoelectric composites require careful consideration of several factors, including the volume fraction of the active phase, the size and shape of the piezoelectric particles or fibers, and the processing methods used. Theoretical models, such as the finite element method (FEM) and effective medium theory, have been developed to predict the properties of piezoelectric composites and optimize their design. For example, Kar-Gupta and Venkatesh used FEM to investigate the effect of fiber shape on the electromechanical properties of 1-3 piezocomposites, demonstrating that non-circular fibers could lead to enhanced performance in certain applications.One of the most prominent applications of piezoelectric composites is in medical ultrasound imaging and therapy. The high electromechanical coupling and low acoustic impedance of 1-3 composites make them ideal for ultrasound transducers, offering improved sensitivity and bandwidth compared to traditional monolithic piezoelectric materials. Smith et al. demonstrated that 1-3 composites of PMN-PT single crystals in epoxy exhibited superior performance in medical imaging applications, with higher sensitivity and broader bandwidth than conventional PZT-based transducers.In addition to medical applications, piezoelectric composites have shown great potential in energy harvesting systems. The flexibility and durability of these materials make them suitable for harvesting energy from various mechanical sources, such as vibrations, wind, and human motion. For instance, Ren et al. developed a flexible piezoelectric composite based on BaTiO3 nanoparticles embedded in a PVDF matrix, which demonstrated excellent energy harvesting performance under various mechanical deformations.Structural health monitoring is another field where piezoelectric composites have found significant applications. The ability to integrate these materials into structures without compromising their mechanical integrity makes them ideal for detecting and monitoring damage in various structures, including aircraft, bridges, and buildings. Giurgiutiu and Zagrai showed that piezoelectric composite sensors could effectively detect and localize damage in aluminum plates, demonstrating their potential for real-time structural health monitoring.As research in piezoelectric composites continues to advance, new materials and fabrication techniques are being explored to further enhance their performance and expand their applications. For example, the incorporation of nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, into piezoelectric composites has shown promise in improving their mechanical and electrical properties. Additionally, emerging fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing and electrospinning, are enabling the creation of more complex and customized piezoelectric composite structures.In conclusion, piezoelectric composites represent a versatile and promising class of materials that combine the advantages of different constituents to overcome the limitations of traditional piezoelectric materials. Their ability to offer tailored properties for specific applications has led to their widespread use in various fields, including medical imaging, energy harvesting, and structural health monitoring. As research in this area continues to progress, it is expected that piezoelectric composites will play an increasingly important role in the development of advanced sensors, actuators, and energy conversion devices.", "References": [{"title": "Connectivity and piezoelectric-pyroelectric composites", "authors": "R.
