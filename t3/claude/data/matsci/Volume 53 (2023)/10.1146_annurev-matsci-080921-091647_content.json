{"Literature Review": "Abnormal grain growth (AGG) is a fascinating phenomenon in materials science that has captivated researchers for decades due to its significant impact on material properties and performance. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of extreme AGG, focusing on the mechanisms driving this process and their connection to microstructural outcomes.AGG is characterized by the preferential growth of a subset of grains at the expense of the surrounding matrix grains, resulting in a bimodal grain size distribution. Extreme AGG, as defined by Rollett et al. (2022), occurs when abnormal grains grow to at least an order of magnitude larger than their matrix counterparts. This extreme case provides a unique opportunity to study the underlying mechanisms of AGG by examining the abnormal/matrix interface.The driving forces behind AGG have been a subject of extensive research. Humphreys and Hatherly (2004) proposed that AGG occurs when normal grain growth is inhibited, and a subset of grains possesses a growth advantage. This advantage can arise from various factors, including differences in grain boundary (GB) energy, mobility, or the presence of second-phase particles.GB energy anisotropy has been identified as a crucial factor in AGG. Rollett et al. (2022) demonstrated through simulations that anisotropies in GB energy leave distinct morphological signatures at the abnormal/matrix interface. This finding is supported by earlier work by Holm et al. (2003), who showed that even small variations in GB energy could lead to AGG under certain conditions.GB mobility anisotropy is another key factor influencing AGG. Mendelson (1969) proposed that differences in GB mobility could lead to AGG, and this concept has been further developed in recent years. Simulations by Rollett et al. (2022) revealed that GB mobility variability produces characteristic patterns at the abnormal/matrix boundary, distinct from those caused by energy anisotropy.The interplay between GB energy and mobility anisotropies is complex and can lead to various abnormal grain morphologies. Prismatic growth, characterized by flat interfaces between abnormal and matrix grains, has been observed in some systems. However, Rollett et al. (2022) noted that most reported instances of AGG exhibit morphologies consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability.Zener pinning, caused by the presence of second-phase particles, plays a crucial role in AGG. Hillert (1965) first described the pinning effect of particles on grain boundaries, and subsequent research has shown that the distribution and size of these particles can significantly influence AGG. Nes et al. (1985) demonstrated that a non-uniform distribution of pinning particles could promote AGG by allowing some grains to grow preferentially.Recent advancements in experimental techniques and computational modeling have provided new insights into AGG mechanisms. In situ observations using high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, as reported by Sharma et al. (2020), have allowed researchers to track the evolution of individual grains during AGG in real-time. These studies have revealed the complex dynamics of grain interactions and the role of local neighborhood effects in determining which grains become abnormal.Computational models have also contributed significantly to our understanding of AGG. Phase-field simulations, such as those conducted by Krill and Chen (2002), have provided valuable insights into the effects of various parameters on AGG, including GB energy and mobility anisotropies, particle pinning, and initial grain size distributions.Despite these advances, several open questions remain regarding extreme AGG. One key issue, as highlighted by Rollett et al. (2022), is the mechanism by which the growth advantage of abnormal grains is established and maintained as they advance through the matrix. This question is particularly relevant in systems where the abnormal grains exhibit complex, non-prismatic morphologies.Another area of ongoing research is the role of triple junctions in AGG. Gottstein and Shvindlerman (2010) proposed that triple junction drag could significantly influence grain growth kinetics, and recent studies have suggested that this effect may be particularly important in nanocrystalline materials prone to AGG.In conclusion, extreme AGG represents a complex interplay of various mechanisms, including GB energy and mobility anisotropies, Zener pinning, and local neighborhood effects. While significant progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms and their connection to microstructural outcomes, further research is needed to fully elucidate the processes governing the initiation and propagation of extreme AGG. Such understanding is crucial for developing strategies to control grain growth in materials processing and for designing materials with tailored microstructures and properties.", "References": [{"title": "Extreme Abnormal Grain Growth: Connecting Mechanisms to Microstructural Outcomes", "authors": "Anthony D.
