{"Literature Review": "Low-dimensional (L-D) ice has emerged as a fascinating subject of study in recent years, attracting significant attention due to its unique structure, morphology, and crystal quality. This review aims to explore the current understanding of L-D ice, focusing on its crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties across zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) configurations.The study of L-D ice is crucial for understanding the behavior of water in confined spaces and at interfaces, which has implications for various fields, including materials science, biology, and environmental science. Algara-Siller et al. (2015) reported the observation of a new ice phase, square ice, formed between graphene sheets, demonstrating the potential for novel ice structures in confined geometries.Crystal growth of L-D ice presents unique challenges and opportunities. Chen et al. (2017) investigated the growth of ice nanocrystals on graphene surfaces, revealing the importance of surface properties in determining ice nucleation and growth patterns. The study of ice crystal growth in confined spaces has led to insights into the fundamental processes of ice formation and the role of interfaces in controlling crystal morphology.The molecular structure of L-D ice can differ significantly from bulk ice, leading to novel properties. Qiu and Molinero (2017) used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the structure of water confined in carbon nanotubes, revealing the formation of helical ice nanotubes with unique hydrogen bonding patterns. These findings highlight the importance of confinement in shaping the molecular arrangement of water molecules in L-D ice.Phase morphologies of L-D ice exhibit a rich diversity, depending on the dimensionality and confinement conditions. Zhu et al. (2019) reported the formation of various 2D ice phases on metal surfaces, including hexagonal, pentagonal, and square ice structures. These studies demonstrate the potential for engineering novel ice phases through careful control of substrate properties and growth conditions.The physical properties of L-D ice often deviate significantly from those of bulk ice, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical applications. Optical properties of L-D ice have been investigated by Koga et al. (2020), who observed enhanced light scattering and unique spectral features in ice nanocrystals. These findings suggest potential applications in optical sensing and photonic devices.Mechanical properties of L-D ice have also attracted considerable attention. Zhang et al. (2018) studied the mechanical behavior of ice nanotubes, revealing enhanced strength and flexibility compared to bulk ice. These unique mechanical properties could lead to the development of novel ice-based nanocomposites and materials with tailored mechanical responses.The behavior of ice under extreme conditions, such as high pressure or strong electric fields, has been a subject of intense research. Yen et al. (2021) investigated the phase transitions of confined ice under high pressure, uncovering novel high-pressure ice phases with potential implications for planetary science and materials engineering.Interfacial phenomena play a crucial role in the properties and behavior of L-D ice. Guo et al. (2016) studied the interaction between water and various substrates, revealing the importance of surface chemistry in determining ice nucleation and growth. Understanding these interfacial effects is essential for developing ice-phobic surfaces and controlling ice formation in various applications.Recent advances in characterization techniques have greatly enhanced our ability to study L-D ice at the molecular level. Cryogenic electron microscopy, as demonstrated by Xu et al. (2022), has enabled direct visualization of ice nanostructures with atomic resolution, providing unprecedented insights into the structure and dynamics of L-D ice.As research in L-D ice continues to progress, several exciting avenues for future study and application emerge. The development of novel ice-based materials with tailored properties, such as enhanced thermal insulation or controlled drug release, holds promise for technological innovations. Furthermore, the study of L-D ice in biological systems, such as cellular membranes or protein hydration shells, may lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of water-mediated biological processes.In conclusion, the field of L-D ice research has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by advances in experimental techniques and computational modeling. The unique properties and behaviors of L-D ice offer exciting opportunities for fundamental scientific discoveries and technological applications. As our understanding of L-D ice continues to evolve, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in fields ranging from materials science to biology and environmental science.", "References": [{"title": "Square ice in graphene nanocapillaries", "authors": "G.
