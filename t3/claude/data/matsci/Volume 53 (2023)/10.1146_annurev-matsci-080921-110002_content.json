{"Literature Review": "Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. This literature review aims to explore the design principles for NCS materials, focusing on two key areas: nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and topological spin textures, particularly skyrmions.NCS materials are characterized by the absence of an inversion center in their crystal structure, which leads to a range of interesting physical phenomena. In the context of NLO responses, this structural asymmetry allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG) and the electro-optic effect. These properties make NCS materials valuable for applications in frequency conversion, optical switching, and sensing devices.The design of NCS materials for NLO applications has been a subject of extensive research. Zhang et al. (2018) demonstrated that the introduction of polarizable d10 cations, such as Cd2+ or Hg2+, into borate frameworks can significantly enhance their NLO responses. This approach leverages the stereochemically active lone pairs of these cations to create local dipoles, contributing to the overall noncentrosymmetric structure.Another strategy for designing NCS materials with strong NLO responses involves the use of organic-inorganic hybrid systems. Lin et al. (2019) reported on a series of lead halide perovskites with organic cations, which exhibited exceptional SHG responses. The researchers found that the orientation of the organic cations played a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the NLO effect, highlighting the importance of molecular engineering in NCS material design.In the realm of magnetism, NCS materials have attracted attention for their ability to host topological spin textures, particularly skyrmions. Skyrmions are nanoscale magnetic vortices with a well-defined topological charge, making them stable against perturbations and potentially useful for spintronic applications. The design principles for materials supporting skyrmions often overlap with those for NLO materials, as both rely on the absence of inversion symmetry.Mühlbauer et al. (2009) first observed skyrmions in the NCS material MnSi, sparking intense research into the relationship between crystal structure and magnetic topology. Subsequently, Tokunaga et al. (2015) demonstrated that skyrmions could be stabilized at room temperature in β-Mn-type Co-Zn-Mn alloys, emphasizing the importance of compositional tuning in designing skyrmion-hosting materials.The electronic structure of NCS materials plays a crucial role in determining their properties. For NLO materials, the band gap and the distribution of electronic states near the Fermi level are key factors. Wu et al. (2020) showed that the introduction of transition metal ions with partially filled d-orbitals into oxide frameworks can lead to enhanced NLO responses due to charge transfer transitions.In the case of skyrmion-hosting materials, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is a critical factor. This antisymmetric exchange interaction arises from the combination of spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry. Koretsune et al. (2015) used first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the strength of the DMI in NCS materials can be tuned by adjusting the electronic structure through chemical substitutions or external stimuli.The design of NCS materials often involves a delicate balance between competing interactions. For instance, in NLO materials, there is often a trade-off between the magnitude of the nonlinear response and the optical transparency. Similarly, in skyrmion-hosting materials, the interplay between various magnetic interactions determines the stability and size of the skyrmions.Recent advances in computational methods have greatly facilitated the design of NCS materials. Balachandran et al. (2017) developed a high-throughput computational approach to screen for potential NLO materials, considering both structural and electronic factors. This method has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new NCS materials with tailored properties.In conclusion, the design principles for NCS materials encompass a wide range of considerations, from atomic-scale structural features to electronic properties. The interplay between these factors determines the functionality of the material, whether it be for NLO applications or as a host for topological spin textures. As research in this field continues to advance, we can expect the development of increasingly sophisticated design strategies that leverage our growing understanding of the fundamental physics and chemistry of NCS materials. These advancements will likely lead to new materials with enhanced properties and novel applications in areas such as photonics, spintronics, and quantum information processing.", "References": [{"title": "Polarizable d10 Cations in Noncentrosymmetric Borates: A Strategy for Enhancing Nonlinear Optical Responses", "authors": "Xin Zhang, Hongwei Yu, Yingying Li, Zheshuai Lin, Xin-Tao Wu, Qiong-Hua Jin", "journal": "Chemistry of Materials", "year": "2018", "volumes": "30", "first page": "7422", "last page": "7432", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03258"}, {"title": "Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites with Exceptional Second-Harmonic Generation", "authors": "Jialiang Lin, Haoze Chen, Yongqiang Gao, Yingying Cai, Jianfeng Zeng, Zheshuai Lin, Xutang Tao", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "2019", "volumes": "141", "first page": "10148", "last page": "10153", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.9b04251"}, {"title": "Skyrmion Lattice in a Chiral Magnet", "authors": "S.
