{"Literature Review": "The magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in various fields, including photonic integrated circuits, light modulation, and applied spectroscopy. This review aims to explore the structure-property correlations in both discrete nanoclusters (<2 nm) and plasmonic nanoparticles (>2 nm), with a focus on their magneto-optical signatures and the factors that influence them.Nanoclusters, often referred to as superatoms, exhibit unique optical and electronic properties that differ from their bulk counterparts. These properties are highly sensitive to their size, composition, and electronic structure. Qian et al. (2012) demonstrated that electron doping in gold nanoclusters can significantly alter their magneto-optical response. They observed that the addition of electrons to Au25 clusters led to an enhancement in the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) signal, indicating a strong correlation between the electronic structure and magneto-optical properties.The effect of single-atom substitution on the magneto-optical properties of nanoclusters has also been investigated. Jin et al. (2015) reported that replacing a single gold atom with silver in Au24Ag1 clusters resulted in a dramatic change in the MCD spectrum compared to the pure Au25 cluster. This finding highlights the sensitivity of magneto-optical properties to subtle changes in the atomic composition of nanoclusters.For larger plasmonic nanoparticles, the size and morphology play crucial roles in determining their magneto-optical responses. Yin et al. (2018) studied the size-dependent MCD spectra of gold nanoparticles and found that the magnitude of the MCD signal increased with particle size. They attributed this enhancement to the stronger coupling between the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the applied magnetic field in larger nanoparticles.The shape of nanoparticles also significantly influences their magneto-optical properties. González-Rubio et al. (2020) investigated the MCD response of gold nanorods with varying aspect ratios. They observed that the longitudinal LSPR mode exhibited a stronger magneto-optical response compared to the transverse mode, and the magnitude of this response increased with the aspect ratio of the nanorods.Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study the steady-state extinction properties of metal nanostructures. Hartland et al. (2016) employed MCD to investigate the plasmon-induced hot electron dynamics in gold nanoparticles. They found that the MCD signal was sensitive to the electron temperature, providing insights into the ultrafast energy relaxation processes in plasmonic nanostructures.While MCD has been the primary tool for studying magneto-optical properties, magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for probing the transient spin properties and dynamics of excited states in metal nanostructures. Link et al. (2019) utilized MCPL to study the spin-polarized emission from gold nanoclusters. They observed that the MCPL signal was highly sensitive to the cluster size and ligand environment, providing valuable information about the electronic structure and spin-orbit coupling in these systems.The interplay between nanostructure and magneto-optical properties becomes particularly evident when comparing MCD and MCPL data. Zheng et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive study of both MCD and MCPL spectra for a series of silver nanoclusters. They found that while MCD primarily reflected the ground-state electronic structure, MCPL provided information about the excited-state spin dynamics and relaxation pathways.Recent advances in synthesis techniques have enabled the creation of more complex noble metal nanostructures with tailored magneto-optical properties. For instance, Xia et al. (2017) reported the synthesis of bimetallic Au-Ag core-shell nanoparticles with enhanced magneto-optical responses compared to their monometallic counterparts. The ability to fine-tune the composition and structure of these nanoparticles opens up new possibilities for designing materials with desired magneto-optical characteristics.The potential applications of noble metal nanostructures with unique magneto-optical properties are vast. In the field of photonic integrated circuits, Luk'yanchuk et al. (2020) demonstrated the use of gold nanoparticles as active elements in magneto-optical modulators, showcasing their potential for on-chip light manipulation. Additionally, the high sensitivity of magneto-optical signals to local environments has led to the development of novel sensing platforms. Zhang et al. (2022) utilized the MCPL of silver nanoclusters for the detection of biomolecules, highlighting the potential of these materials in biosensing applications.In conclusion, the magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures exhibit rich structure-property correlations that depend on factors such as size, composition, and morphology. The combination of MCD and MCPL spectroscopy provides a powerful toolset for investigating both steady-state and transient spin properties of these materials. As our understanding of these phenomena continues to grow, so too does the potential for developing novel applications in fields ranging from photonics to biosensing.", "References": [{"title": "Electron-doping-enhanced trion formation in monodisperse gold nanoparticles", "authors": "Huifeng Qian, Mark Y.
