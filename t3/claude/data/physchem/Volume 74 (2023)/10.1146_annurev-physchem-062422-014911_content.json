{"Literature Review": "The field of plasmonics has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains, including sensing, photocatalysis, and photothermal therapy. At the heart of these applications lies the phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures. LSPRs are collective oscillations of conduction electrons in response to incident electromagnetic radiation, resulting in enhanced light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. This review focuses on the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, with particular emphasis on the steady-state behavior and its implications for practical applications.The process of photothermalization begins with the excitation of LSPRs, which subsequently decay through various pathways. Brongersma et al. (2015) provide a comprehensive overview of these decay mechanisms, highlighting the importance of both radiative and non-radiative processes. The non-radiative decay, which is of particular interest in the context of photothermalization, involves the generation of energetic charge carriers, often referred to as 'hot' electrons and holes.The dynamics of these hot carriers have been extensively studied using ultrafast spectroscopy techniques. Hartland et al. (2017) review the latest advances in this field, demonstrating that the initial distribution of hot carriers is highly non-thermal and evolves on femtosecond timescales. However, it is crucial to note that many practical applications of plasmonic nanostructures involve continuous-wave illumination, where steady-state conditions prevail. Baffou and Quidant (2013) emphasize the importance of understanding the steady-state behavior for optimizing plasmonic systems in real-world scenarios.One of the key challenges in studying photothermalization under steady-state conditions is the accurate measurement of temperature at the nanoscale. Raman thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool for this purpose. Xie and Cahill (2016) demonstrate the use of anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratios in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to probe the local temperature of plasmonic nanostructures. This technique has provided valuable insights into the spatial distribution of heat generation and dissipation in various nanostructure geometries.The steady-state temperature distribution around plasmonic nanostructures is governed by a complex interplay of factors, including the nanoparticle size, shape, and material properties, as well as the surrounding medium. Govorov and Richardson (2007) developed a theoretical framework for understanding these effects, which has since been validated and extended by numerous experimental studies. For instance, Baffou et al. (2010) used fluorescence polarization anisotropy to map the three-dimensional temperature distribution around gold nanoparticles, revealing the importance of particle size and interparticle coupling in determining the extent of localized heating.The insights gained from steady-state studies have significant implications for the design of plasmonic nanostructures for specific applications. In the field of photocatalysis, for example, the balance between hot carrier generation and thermal effects plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity. Christopher et al. (2011) demonstrated that plasmonic photocatalysis can be driven by both hot electron injection and localized heating, with the dominant mechanism depending on the reaction conditions and nanostructure properties.Similarly, in photothermal therapy, the ability to precisely control the spatial and temporal distribution of heat is essential for maximizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Qin and Bischof (2012) review the various strategies for optimizing plasmonic nanostructures for photothermal therapy, emphasizing the importance of considering both the optical and thermal properties of the nanoparticles.Recent advances in nanofabrication techniques have enabled the creation of increasingly complex plasmonic nanostructures with tailored optical and thermal properties. Zhu et al. (2016) demonstrate the use of DNA-mediated self-assembly to create three-dimensional plasmonic metamaterials with precisely controlled hot-spot distributions. Such structures offer new opportunities for fine-tuning the photothermalization process for specific applications.In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures under steady-state conditions is crucial for optimizing their performance in real-world applications. While ultrafast studies have provided valuable insights into the fundamental physics of plasmon decay, steady-state investigations are essential for bridging the gap between these fundamental processes and practical implementations. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of advanced experimental techniques, theoretical modeling, and innovative nanostructure designs will undoubtedly lead to new breakthroughs in plasmonic technologies.", "References": [{"title": "Plasmonics for improved photovoltaic devices", "authors": "Harry A.
