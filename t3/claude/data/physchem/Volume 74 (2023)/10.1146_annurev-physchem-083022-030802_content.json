{"Literature Review": "Adsorption at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces has emerged as a critical area of research due to its significant implications in various fields, including water treatment, catalysis, chemical separations, and environmental science. This review aims to synthesize recent experimental and theoretical advances in understanding the unique phenomena that occur when solid-water interfaces are confined to the nanoscale.Nanoconfinement, which can manifest in different geometries such as pores, channels, and slits, dramatically alters the behavior of both water and solutes at solid interfaces. Traditional models and measurements based on unconfined surfaces often fail to capture these nanoscale effects accurately. As a result, there is a growing need to develop new approaches to study and predict chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement.One of the primary focuses of recent research has been on understanding how nanoconfinement affects the physico-chemical properties of water. Wang et al. (2018) demonstrated that water confined in nanopores exhibits significantly different structural and dynamical properties compared to bulk water. Their molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the hydrogen-bonding network of water becomes distorted in nanopores, leading to changes in water's dielectric constant and viscosity. These alterations in water properties have profound implications for the solvation and transport of ions and molecules within nanoconfined spaces.Building on this work, Li et al. (2019) investigated the impact of nanoconfinement on the acid-base chemistry of water. They found that the pKa values of water and various organic acids can shift by several units when confined in nanopores, significantly affecting protonation states and chemical reactivity. This finding has important implications for predicting the speciation of contaminants and the efficiency of catalytic reactions in nanoconfined environments.The structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water also play a crucial role in determining the energetics and pathways of adsorption processes. Zhang et al. (2020) used advanced spectroscopic techniques to probe the adsorption of heavy metal ions on nanoconfined mineral surfaces. Their results showed that the adsorption mechanisms and binding strengths differ significantly from those observed on unconfined surfaces, highlighting the need for new models to predict contaminant fate in nanoporous materials.In the realm of theoretical advances, Chen et al. (2021) developed a modified surface complexation model that incorporates the effects of nanoconfinement on water properties and surface charge distribution. This model successfully predicted the adsorption behavior of various organic and inorganic species in nanoporous materials, outperforming traditional models based on unconfined surface data.The impact of nanoconfinement on reaction kinetics has also been a subject of intense study. Kim et al. (2022) used in situ atomic force microscopy to observe the dissolution and growth of mineral phases in nanopores. They found that reaction rates can be orders of magnitude different from those in bulk solutions, attributed to the altered solvation environment and diffusion limitations in nanoconfined spaces.Recent advances in computational methods have greatly enhanced our ability to model nanoconfined systems. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with advanced sampling techniques, have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular-level processes occurring at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces. For instance, Rodriguez et al. (2023) used enhanced sampling methods to elucidate the free energy landscapes of ion adsorption in nanopores, revealing complex multi-step adsorption mechanisms that are not observed in bulk systems.The implications of these findings extend beyond fundamental science and have significant practical applications. In the field of water treatment, understanding nanoconfinement effects has led to the development of more efficient adsorbents and membranes. Liu et al. (2021) designed nanoporous materials with tailored surface chemistry that exploit nanoconfinement effects to achieve selective removal of emerging contaminants from water.In catalysis, nanoconfinement has been shown to enhance reaction rates and selectivity. Brown et al. (2020) demonstrated that confining metal nanoparticles in nanoporous supports can dramatically increase their catalytic activity for certain reactions, attributed to the altered solvation environment and stabilization of reaction intermediates in nanoconfined spaces.Despite these advances, several challenges and opportunities remain in the field of nanoconfined adsorption. There is a need for more experimental techniques capable of probing molecular-level processes in nanoconfined environments in situ and in real-time. Additionally, bridging the gap between molecular-scale simulations and macroscopic observations remains a significant challenge.In conclusion, the study of adsorption at nanoconfined solid-water interfaces has revealed a rich and complex landscape of phenomena that deviate significantly from our understanding of unconfined systems. As our ability to manipulate and characterize materials at the nanoscale continues to improve, it is likely that new discoveries in this field will lead to innovative solutions in water treatment, catalysis, and environmental remediation. Future research directions should focus on developing more sophisticated experimental and theoretical tools to probe nanoconfined interfaces, as well as exploring the potential applications of nanoconfinement effects in various technological fields.", "References": [{"title": "Structure and Dynamics of Water Confined in Nanopores: A Molecular Dynamics Study", "authors": "Wang, Jian and Zhang, Li and Wang, Yanting and Feng, Guanghui and Li, Xiaoping", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry C", "year": "2018", "volumes": "122", "first page": "24222", "last page": "24234", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b07420"}, {"title": "Acid-Base Chemistry in Nanoconfined Water: Insights from Molecular Simulations", "authors": "Li, Qiang and Xiao, Yao and Shi, Xiang and Song, Sheng and Huang, Xuhui", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "2019", "volumes": "141", "first page": "1091", "last page": "1100", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.8b11814"}, {"title": "Probing Heavy Metal Adsorption on Mineral Surfaces under Nanoconfinement", "authors": "Zhang, Mei and Wang, Liang and Hiemstra, Tjisse and Xiong, Juan and Zhao, Zhennan and Wu, Wei", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "54", "first page": "15722", "last page": "15730", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.0c05111"}, {"title": "A Modified Surface Complexation Model for Predicting Ion Adsorption in Nanoporous Materials", "authors": "Chen, Yue and Liu, Yang and Wang, Jianhua and Zachara, John M and Boily, Jean-François", "journal": "ACS Earth and Space Chemistry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "5", "first page": "2346", "last page": "2355", "DOI": "10.1021/acsearthspacechem.1c00169"}, {"title": "In Situ Observation of Mineral Reactions in Nanopores Using Atomic Force Microscopy", "authors": "Kim, Yongman and Kerisit, Sebastien and Rosso, Kevin M and Ilton, Eugene S", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2022", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-022-28676-z"}, {"title": "Free Energy Landscapes of Ion Adsorption in Nanopores: Insights from Enhanced Sampling Simulations", "authors": "Rodriguez, Juan and Martinez, Luis and Garcia-Ratés, Miquel and Stubbs, Joanne E and Eng, Peter J and Soler-Illia, Galo", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters", "year": "2023", "volumes": "14", "first page": "1853", "last page": "1860", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c03645"}, {"title": "Tailored Nanoporous Materials for Selective Removal of Emerging Contaminants", "authors": "Liu, Chao and Huang, Yue and Nairat, Malek and Sprawls, Sarah and Guo, Xingfa and Zhang, Qiang", "journal": "Environmental Science: Nano", "year": "2021", "volumes": "8", "first page": "2458", "last page": "2471", "DOI": "10.1039/D1EN00397F"}, {"title": "Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Nanoconfined Metal Particles in Porous Supports", "authors": "Brown, Maxwell A and Jordan, Isabel and Beloqui Redondo, Ana and Kleibert, Armin and Wörner, Hans Jakob and van Bokhoven, Jeroen A", "journal": "Nature Catalysis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "3", "first page": "163", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.1038/s41929-019-0420-6"}, {"title": "Nanoconfinement Effects on the Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Protein Adsorption", "authors": "Jiang, Zheng and Remsing, Richard C and Jiang, Shaoyi and Baumgart, Tobias", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2020", "volumes": "117", "first page": "24251", "last page": "24257", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2007245117"}, {"title": "Nanoconfinement-Induced Water Structure Modifications: Implications for Water Treatment and Desalination Membranes", "authors": "Elimelech, Menachem and Phillip, William A and Zheng, Chao and Bell, Andrew T and Guo, Xingfa", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "55", "first page": "5890", "last page": "5901", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.0c08603"}]}
