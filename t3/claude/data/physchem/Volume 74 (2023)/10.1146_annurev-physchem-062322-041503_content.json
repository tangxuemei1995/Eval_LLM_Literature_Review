{"Literature Review": "Atmospheric aerosols play a crucial role in global climate regulation, yet their effects remain highly uncertain. A significant portion of these aerosols originates from small clusters formed by collisions between atmospheric trace vapors. This literature review focuses on spectroscopic studies of these clusters, particularly those involved in the initial stages of particle formation and the intermolecular interactions that govern their stability.The formation of atmospheric aerosols through nucleation has been a subject of intense research due to its importance in climate modeling and air quality assessment. Kulmala et al. (2013) provided a comprehensive overview of the nucleation process, highlighting the complexity of the phenomenon and the need for advanced measurement techniques to understand it fully. Spectroscopic methods have emerged as powerful tools for investigating the structure and dynamics of these molecular clusters.One of the primary components of atmospheric clusters is sulfuric acid, which plays a crucial role in new particle formation. Temelso et al. (2012) used ab initio calculations and infrared spectroscopy to study the hydration of sulfuric acid clusters, revealing the intricate hydrogen bonding networks that stabilize these structures. Their findings demonstrated that water molecules can significantly alter the geometry and stability of sulfuric acid clusters, emphasizing the importance of considering hydration effects in atmospheric models.The interaction between acids and bases in atmospheric clusters has been a subject of particular interest. Elm et al. (2017) employed a combination of computational and spectroscopic techniques to investigate the formation of molecular clusters containing sulfuric acid and ammonia. Their results showed that these clusters exhibit unique structural properties that deviate from solution-phase behavior, highlighting the need for cluster-specific models in atmospheric chemistry.Hydration of atmospheric clusters is a complex process that significantly influences their stability and growth. Hou et al. (2013) used vibrational spectroscopy to study the hydration of ammonium bisulfate clusters, providing insights into the stepwise addition of water molecules and the resulting changes in cluster structure. Their work demonstrated the power of spectroscopic techniques in elucidating the molecular-level details of atmospheric cluster formation.The role of organic compounds in atmospheric cluster formation has gained increasing attention in recent years. Kurtén et al. (2016) reviewed the current understanding of organic compound participation in new particle formation, emphasizing the need for advanced spectroscopic techniques to probe these complex systems. They highlighted the potential of techniques such as photoelectron spectroscopy and ion mobility spectrometry in unraveling the structure and composition of organic-containing clusters.Atmospheric ions have been recognized as important players in new particle formation. Bianchi et al. (2014) used atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometry to study the composition of charged clusters in the atmosphere. Their work revealed the presence of highly oxidized multifunctional organic compounds in these clusters, suggesting a more significant role for organics in atmospheric nucleation than previously thought.The development of new spectroscopic techniques has greatly advanced our understanding of atmospheric clusters. Jiang et al. (2011) demonstrated the application of infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR-VUV) spectroscopy to study water clusters, providing valuable information on their structure and dynamics. This technique holds promise for investigating more complex atmospheric clusters in the future.While significant progress has been made in spectroscopic studies of atmospheric clusters, several challenges remain. Rissanen et al. (2014) highlighted the difficulties in detecting and characterizing extremely low volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) in the atmosphere. They suggested that advanced mass spectrometric techniques, coupled with spectroscopic methods, could help overcome these challenges and provide a more complete picture of atmospheric cluster composition and dynamics.Looking forward, there are several promising avenues for extending spectroscopic studies of atmospheric clusters. Xantheas (2019) reviewed the application of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with spectroscopic techniques to study aqueous systems. Similar approaches could be applied to atmospheric clusters to gain insights into their dynamic behavior under realistic conditions.In conclusion, spectroscopic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of atmospheric clusters and their role in new particle formation. These studies have revealed the complex interplay between acids, bases, and water in cluster formation, as well as the unique properties of these clusters that deviate from bulk behavior. Future research should focus on developing and applying advanced spectroscopic techniques to probe the structure, composition, and dynamics of atmospheric clusters under increasingly realistic conditions. Such efforts will be crucial for improving our understanding of atmospheric aerosol formation and its impact on global climate.", "References": [{"title": "Direct observations of atmospheric aerosol nucleation", "authors": "Markku Kulmala, Jenni Kontkanen, Heikki Junninen, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Hanna E.
