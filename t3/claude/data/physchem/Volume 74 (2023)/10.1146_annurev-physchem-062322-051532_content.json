{"Literature Review": "The field of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, offering unprecedented insights into elementary molecular events occurring on femtosecond and subfemtosecond timescales. This literature review focuses on the application of ultrafast X-ray probes to study conical intersections and their role in photochemical processes. Conical intersections are critical features in the potential energy landscapes of molecules, facilitating ultrafast, nonradiative transitions between electronic states. These intersections play a crucial role in determining photochemical outcomes and molecular functionalities. Traditional spectroscopic techniques have been limited in their ability to directly observe and characterize these fleeting events. However, the advent of ultrafast X-ray sources has revolutionized our capabilities to probe conical intersections with unprecedented temporal and spectral resolution. The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has been instrumental in advancing ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy. Pellegrini et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive overview of XFEL technology, highlighting its ability to generate intense, coherent X-ray pulses with durations as short as a few femtoseconds. These sources have enabled time-resolved X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy experiments with atomic spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution, opening new avenues for studying molecular dynamics. One of the key advantages of ultrafast X-ray probes is their element specificity, allowing researchers to track the motion of specific atoms within a molecule during photochemical reactions. Minitti et al. (2015) demonstrated this capability by using femtosecond X-ray scattering to observe the ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Their study revealed the structural changes associated with the passage through a conical intersection, providing direct evidence of the coupled nuclear and electronic motions involved in the reaction. The ability to probe both electronic and nuclear dynamics simultaneously has been a long-standing goal in the field of ultrafast spectroscopy. Young et al. (2018) reviewed recent advances in X-ray spectroscopy techniques that allow for the observation of electronic state dynamics during photochemical reactions. They highlighted the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to track changes in electronic structure as molecules traverse conical intersections. Theoretical studies have played a crucial role in interpreting experimental results and predicting new spectroscopic signatures of conical intersections. Kowalewski et al. (2017) proposed a novel X-ray probe technique based on stimulated X-ray Raman spectroscopy (SXRS) to directly observe the passage of a molecule through a conical intersection. Their simulations demonstrated that SXRS can provide unique insights into the coupled nuclear and electronic dynamics at these critical points in the potential energy landscape. The application of ultrafast X-ray probes to study conical intersections has led to significant advances in our understanding of photochemical reactions. Curchod and Martinez (2018) reviewed recent progress in this field, emphasizing the importance of combining experimental and theoretical approaches to elucidate the complex dynamics at conical intersections. They highlighted several case studies where ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has provided new insights into photochemical mechanisms, including the photoisomerization of retinal and the photodissociation of diatomic molecules. While XFELs have been at the forefront of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, other sources have also contributed to the field. Pertot et al. (2017) demonstrated the use of high-harmonic generation (HHG) sources to perform attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, enabling the observation of electron dynamics on even shorter timescales. This technique complements XFEL-based methods and extends the temporal resolution of X-ray probes into the attosecond regime. The development of new experimental techniques and data analysis methods has been crucial for extracting meaningful information from ultrafast X-ray experiments. Kirrander et al. (2016) proposed a method for analyzing time-resolved X-ray scattering data to reconstruct molecular movies of photochemical reactions. Their approach combines experimental data with quantum molecular dynamics simulations to provide a detailed picture of the structural changes occurring during a reaction. Looking to the future, there are several exciting prospects for ultrafast X-ray probes in the study of conical intersections and photochemistry. Santra et al. (2017) discussed the potential of using coherent nonlinear X-ray spectroscopy to probe valence electron dynamics during photochemical reactions. This technique could provide even more detailed information about the electronic structure changes associated with the passage through conical intersections. In conclusion, ultrafast X-ray probes have revolutionized our ability to study elementary molecular events, particularly those involving conical intersections. The combination of femtosecond temporal resolution, atomic spatial resolution, and element specificity offered by these techniques has provided unprecedented insights into photochemical processes. As X-ray sources continue to improve and new experimental and theoretical methods are developed, we can expect further advances in our understanding of ultrafast photochemistry and the role of conical intersections in determining molecular functionalities.", "References": [{"title": "X-ray free-electron lasers: from dreams to reality", "authors": "Claudio Pellegrini, Agostino Marinelli, Sven Reiche", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "88", "first page": "015006", "last page": "015006", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015006"}, {"title": "Imaging Molecular Motion: Femtosecond X-Ray Scattering of an Electrocyclic Chemical Reaction", "authors": "Michael P.
