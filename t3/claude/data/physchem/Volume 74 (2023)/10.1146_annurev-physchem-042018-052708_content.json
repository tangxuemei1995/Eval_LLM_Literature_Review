{"Literature Review": "The formation of stable glasses (SGs) through physical vapor deposition (PVD) has emerged as a fascinating area of research in materials science and condensed matter physics. This process, which is mediated by surfaces, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to produce glasses with exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as unique anisotropic packing structures. These properties are not typically achievable through conventional glass formation methods, such as melt quenching. The surface-mediated formation of SGs is primarily controlled by two key deposition parameters: the deposition temperature and rate. Ediger et al. (2008) demonstrated that depositing organic molecules at temperatures around 0.85 times the glass transition temperature (Tg) resulted in glasses with enhanced stability and density. This finding opened up new avenues for exploring the relationship between deposition conditions and the resulting glass properties. One of the most intriguing aspects of SGs formed through PVD is their enhanced thermodynamic stability. Swallen et al. (2007) reported that vapor-deposited glasses of indomethacin exhibited a heat capacity jump at Tg that was significantly smaller than that of ordinary glasses, indicating a lower fictive temperature and higher thermodynamic stability. This enhanced stability has been attributed to the ability of surface molecules to explore a wider range of configurations during deposition, effectively allowing the system to achieve a lower energy state. The kinetic stability of PVD glasses is another remarkable property that sets them apart from conventional glasses. Kearns et al. (2010) observed that some vapor-deposited organic glasses could persist for hours at temperatures above their conventional Tg without showing signs of transformation to the supercooled liquid state. This exceptional kinetic stability has important implications for potential applications in areas such as organic electronics and pharmaceuticals, where long-term stability is crucial. The anisotropic packing structure of SGs formed through PVD is a unique feature that has attracted considerable attention. Dawson et al. (2011) used ellipsometry to reveal that vapor-deposited glasses of organic molecules often exhibit molecular orientation that depends on the deposition temperature. This structural anisotropy can lead to interesting optical and mechanical properties that are not observed in isotropic glasses. The chemical structure and composition of the glass former play a significant role in determining the properties of the resulting SGs. Gujral et al. (2015) investigated a series of organic molecules and found that those with more degrees of freedom tended to form more stable glasses through PVD. This suggests that molecular flexibility may be an important factor in achieving high stability during surface-mediated glass formation. The enhanced surface mobility of molecules during PVD is believed to be a key factor in the formation of SGs. Sepúlveda et al. (2012) used nanocalorimetry to study the surface dynamics of thin glassy films and found evidence for a highly mobile surface layer with a thickness of several nanometers. This enhanced mobility allows molecules at the surface to explore a wider range of configurations and achieve lower energy states during deposition. The lower glass transition temperature at the surface of glasses has been observed in various studies. Fakhraai and Forrest (2008) used ellipsometry to measure the Tg of thin polystyrene films and found that the surface Tg was significantly lower than the bulk value. This reduced Tg at the surface is thought to contribute to the enhanced mobility and configurational sampling during SG formation. The enhanced aging rate of the interfacial region in PVD glasses is another important aspect of their formation and properties. Priestley et al. (2009) used fluorescence measurements to study the physical aging of polymer glasses and found that the aging rate near interfaces was significantly higher than in the bulk. This enhanced aging at interfaces may contribute to the rapid achievement of high stability in vapor-deposited glasses. Despite the significant progress made in understanding surface-mediated SG formation, several key gaps in our knowledge remain. The exact mechanisms by which surface dynamics facilitate the formation of highly stable structures are not fully understood. Additionally, the relationship between molecular structure and the ability to form stable glasses through PVD requires further investigation. Future research in this field will likely focus on developing a more comprehensive understanding of glass surface dynamics and their effect on the SG formation process. In conclusion, the surface-mediated formation of stable glasses through physical vapor deposition represents a significant advance in our ability to create materials with exceptional properties. The interplay between deposition parameters, molecular structure, and surface dynamics gives rise to glasses with enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as unique anisotropic structures. As our understanding of this process continues to grow, it is likely to lead to new applications and insights in materials science and condensed matter physics.", "References": [{"title": "How far can we push the stability of glasses?", "authors": "Mark D.
