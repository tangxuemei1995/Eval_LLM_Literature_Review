{"Literature Review": "Molecular organic aggregates have garnered significant attention in the field of optoelectronics due to their unique light-driven phenomena and potential applications in various devices. Understanding and modeling these processes is crucial for the development of new materials and the optimization of optoelectronic devices. This literature review aims to explore the current state of research in modeling excited states of molecular organic aggregates for optoelectronics applications.One of the fundamental aspects of modeling excited states in molecular aggregates is the use of atomistic models. These models provide a detailed description of the molecular structure and interactions, allowing for accurate predictions of electronic and optical properties. Beljonne et al. (2013) demonstrated the importance of considering both intra- and intermolecular interactions in their study of singlet fission in pentacene dimers, highlighting the need for comprehensive atomistic models to capture the full complexity of excited-state dynamics.Excited-state dynamics play a crucial role in determining the performance of optoelectronic devices. Various approaches have been developed to model these dynamics, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and ab initio methods. Zimmerman et al. (2011) employed TD-DFT to investigate the excited-state dynamics of pentacene dimers, providing insights into the mechanism of singlet fission. Their work emphasized the importance of considering both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in modeling excited-state processes.Conical intersections have emerged as key facilitators of internal conversion in molecular aggregates. These regions of the potential energy surface where electronic states become degenerate play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of nonradiative decay pathways. Levine and Martínez (2007) provided a comprehensive review of the role of conical intersections in photochemistry, highlighting their importance in understanding excited-state dynamics and energy transfer processes in molecular systems.Exciton models have proven to be valuable tools for describing excited states in molecular aggregates. These models can be broadly categorized into Frenkel excitons, which describe localized excitations, and charge transfer excitons, which involve the separation of charges between molecules. Spano (2010) presented a detailed analysis of exciton models in J-aggregates and H-aggregates, demonstrating their utility in predicting optical properties and energy transfer processes in molecular assemblies.The choice of electronic structure methods and algorithms is critical for accurately modeling excited-state dynamics. Advances in computational power have enabled the use of more sophisticated methods, such as multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approaches. Marian (2012) provided a comprehensive review of these methods, discussing their strengths and limitations in modeling excited states of organic molecules and aggregates.Internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and reverse intersystem crossing are important processes that determine the fate of excited states in molecular aggregates. Modeling these processes requires careful consideration of the coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Penfold et al. (2018) reviewed recent advances in modeling these processes, highlighting the importance of considering both static and dynamic effects in predicting transition rates.Singlet fission has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to increase the efficiency of solar cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. Modeling this process requires a detailed understanding of the electronic structure and dynamics of molecular aggregates. Smith and Michl (2010) provided a comprehensive review of singlet fission, discussing both experimental observations and theoretical models that have contributed to our understanding of this phenomenon.Triplet-triplet annihilation is another important process in molecular aggregates, particularly in the context of photon upconversion. Modeling this process requires consideration of both electronic and spin degrees of freedom. Gray et al. (2017) reviewed recent advances in modeling triplet-triplet annihilation, highlighting the importance of considering both intra- and intermolecular interactions in predicting upconversion efficiencies.Dexter and Förster energy transfer mechanisms play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of energy transport in molecular aggregates. These processes are particularly important in the context of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics. Scholes (2003) provided a comprehensive review of energy transfer mechanisms in molecular systems, discussing the theoretical foundations and experimental observations of both Dexter and Förster processes.In conclusion, modeling excited states of molecular organic aggregates for optoelectronics applications requires a multifaceted approach that considers atomistic models, excited-state dynamics, and various energy transfer and decay mechanisms. Advances in computational methods and experimental techniques have greatly enhanced our understanding of these processes, paving the way for the design of more efficient optoelectronic devices. Future research in this field will likely focus on developing more accurate and computationally efficient models that can bridge the gap between atomistic simulations and macroscopic device performance.", "References": [{"title": "Singlet Fission in Pentacene Dimers", "authors": "David Beljonne, Hiroki Yamagata, Jui Fen Chang, Frank C.
