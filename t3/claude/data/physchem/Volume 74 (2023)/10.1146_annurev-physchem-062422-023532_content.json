{"Literature Review": "The study of many-body effects in aqueous systems has become increasingly important in recent years, as researchers strive to develop more accurate and efficient models for complex molecular interactions. This literature review focuses on the synergies between interaction analysis techniques and force field development, with a particular emphasis on aqueous systems.Interaction analysis techniques, such as the many-body expansion (MBE), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), and energy decomposition analysis (EDA), have proven to be invaluable tools for understanding the intricacies of molecular interactions. The MBE, in particular, has a rich history dating back to the 1950s, when it was first introduced by Axilrod and Teller to study three-body dispersion interactions in rare gases [1]. Since then, the MBE has been extended and refined to address a wide range of molecular systems, including water clusters and bulk water.One of the key insights provided by the MBE is the emergence of nonadditivities from Hamiltonians containing strictly pairwise-additive interactions. This phenomenon was elegantly demonstrated by Stillinger in his seminal work on water potentials [2]. The realization that many-body effects play a crucial role in accurately describing molecular interactions has led to significant advancements in force field development.Traditional force fields, such as the popular TIP3P and SPC/E models for water, rely on pairwise-additive potentials and struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular interactions in aqueous systems [3]. To address these limitations, researchers have turned to ab initio-based force fields that explicitly incorporate many-body effects. These advanced force fields generally employ one or more of the following strategies:1. Parameterization of distributed multipoles: This approach, exemplified by the AMOEBA force field developed by Ponder and colleagues, uses atomic multipoles to represent the electrostatic interactions more accurately than traditional point charges [4]. By including higher-order multipoles, AMOEBA can capture some of the many-body effects that arise from polarization and charge transfer.2. Explicit fitting of the MBE: Force fields such as MB-pol, developed by Paesani and co-workers, directly fit the individual terms of the MBE to high-level ab initio calculations [5]. This approach allows for a systematic incorporation of two-body, three-body, and higher-order interactions, resulting in a highly accurate description of water properties across different phases and thermodynamic conditions.3. Inclusion of many-atom features in neural networks: Machine learning approaches, particularly neural network potentials, have gained popularity in recent years. These methods can implicitly capture many-body effects by incorporating information from multiple atoms in their input features. The ANI family of potentials, developed by Roitberg and colleagues, is a prime example of this approach [6].4. Coarse-graining of many-body terms into effective two-body potentials: This strategy, employed in force fields like the E3B model by Skinner and co-workers, aims to capture the essence of many-body interactions while maintaining computational efficiency [7]. By incorporating three-body effects into an effective two-body potential, E3B strikes a balance between accuracy and computational cost.The synergy between interaction analysis techniques and force field development has led to significant improvements in the accuracy of molecular simulations. For instance, the MB-pol force field has demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting the properties of liquid water, ice, and the air-water interface [8]. Similarly, the AMOEBA force field has shown excellent performance in modeling the structural and thermodynamic properties of water across a wide range of temperatures and pressures [9].In addition to their role in force field development, interaction analysis techniques have also found applications in improving the accuracy and efficiency of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The MBE, in particular, has been used to develop fragment-based approaches that can significantly reduce the computational cost of AIMD simulations while maintaining high accuracy [10].Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the field of many-body effects in aqueous systems. One ongoing area of research is the development of more efficient algorithms for evaluating many-body terms, as the computational cost of these calculations can become prohibitive for large systems. Additionally, there is a need for improved methods to capture long-range many-body effects, which can be particularly important in heterogeneous systems such as the air-water interface or biomolecular environments.In conclusion, the study of many-body effects in aqueous systems has benefited greatly from the synergy between interaction analysis techniques and force field development. As our understanding of these complex interactions continues to grow, we can expect further improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of molecular simulations, leading to new insights into the behavior of water and aqueous solutions across a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science.", "References": [{"title": "Three‐Body Interactions between Rare Gas Atoms", "authors": "B.
