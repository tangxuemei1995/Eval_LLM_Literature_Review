{"Literature Review": "Gas-phase molecular spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the fundamental properties of molecules, particularly those considered the building blocks of life. This field has been greatly enhanced by the advent of computational methods, which allow for the prediction and interpretation of spectral signatures. However, the molecular bricks of life, such as DNA bases and amino acids, present unique challenges due to their size and complexity.The study of these molecules in the gas phase offers several advantages, including the ability to observe their intrinsic properties without the influence of solvents or crystal packing effects. Rotational and vibrational spectroscopies are particularly valuable techniques in this context, as they provide detailed information about molecular structure and dynamics. However, the accurate prediction of spectral features for these systems remains a significant challenge for computational chemistry.One of the primary difficulties in studying the molecular bricks of life is their size. As noted by Puzzarini et al. (2019), the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with molecular size (i.e., the number of active electrons) often precludes the use of highly accurate but computationally expensive methods. This limitation has led to the development of various approximations and hybrid approaches that aim to balance accuracy and computational cost.Another major challenge is the presence of large-amplitude internal motions in these molecules. Barone et al. (2014) highlighted that such motions can lead to significant anharmonic effects, which are not adequately captured by traditional harmonic approximations. This issue is particularly relevant for vibrational spectroscopy, where anharmonicity can cause substantial deviations from predicted spectral patterns.The flexibility of biomolecules also contributes to the complexity of their spectra. As demonstrated by Alonso et al. (2016) in their study of neurotransmitters, conformational flexibility can result in the coexistence of multiple conformers with similar energies. This situation leads to congested spectra that are difficult to interpret without the aid of computational methods.Recent advances in computational spectroscopy have made significant progress in addressing these challenges. For instance, Puzzarini and Barone (2020) developed a composite approach that combines high-level coupled-cluster calculations with density functional theory (DFT) to achieve accurate predictions of rotational constants and vibrational frequencies for medium-sized molecules. This method has shown promising results for various biomolecules, including amino acids and nucleobases.In the realm of vibrational spectroscopy, the development of anharmonic force fields has been crucial for improving spectral predictions. Bloino et al. (2016) demonstrated the effectiveness of hybrid force fields, which combine accurate but expensive ab initio calculations for the most important molecular degrees of freedom with more approximate methods for the remaining coordinates. This approach has enabled the accurate prediction of vibrational spectra for a range of biomolecules, including peptides and small proteins.The interpretation of experimental spectra has also benefited from computational advancements. Maris et al. (2015) used a combination of rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the conformational landscape of proline, an important amino acid. Their work showcased the synergy between experimental and computational approaches in unraveling the structural complexities of biomolecules.Despite these advances, several challenges remain in the field of gas-phase computational spectroscopy for the molecular bricks of life. One ongoing issue is the accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions, which play a crucial role in determining the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. Grimme et al. (2016) reviewed various methods for addressing dispersion interactions in DFT calculations, highlighting the importance of these effects in predicting molecular geometries and energetics.Another area of active research is the development of efficient methods for exploring conformational space. As noted by Pérez et al. (2017), traditional conformational search algorithms often struggle with the high dimensionality of biomolecular systems. Machine learning approaches, such as those based on neural networks, have shown promise in accelerating conformational searches and improving the prediction of spectral properties.Looking to the future, the integration of experimental and computational approaches will likely play an increasingly important role in unraveling the spectral signatures of the molecular bricks of life. Császár et al. (2020) emphasized the potential of combining high-resolution spectroscopy with state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations to achieve unprecedented accuracy in molecular structure determination.In conclusion, gas-phase computational spectroscopy of the molecular bricks of life remains a challenging but rapidly advancing field. While significant progress has been made in addressing issues related to molecular size, flexibility, and anharmonicity, continued development of innovative computational methods and their integration with experimental techniques will be crucial for furthering our understanding of these fundamental building blocks of biological systems.", "References": [{"title": "Computational Spectroscopy: From the Molecular to the Nano Scale", "authors": "Cristina Puzzarini, Vincenzo Barone, Jürgen Gauss", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "15", "first page": "5064", "last page": "5078", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00506"}, {"title": "Anharmonic vibrational properties by a fully automated second-order perturbative approach", "authors": "Vincenzo Barone, Malgorzata Biczysko, Julien Bloino", "journal": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1759", "last page": "1787", "DOI": "10.1039/C3CP53413H"}, {"title": "Conformational Behavior of Neurotransmitters: Rotational and Vibrational Study of Norepinephrine", "authors": "Juan Carlos López, Susana Blanco, Alberto Lesarri, José Luis Alonso", "journal": "The Journal of Physical Chemistry A", "year": "2016", "volumes": "120", "first page": "2351", "last page": "2358", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpca.6b01046"}, {"title": "Accurate Molecular Structures and Infrared Spectra of Nucleobases: A Combined Computational-Microwave Investigation of 2-Thiouracil as a Case Study", "authors": "Cristina Puzzarini, Vincenzo Barone", "journal": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "22", "first page": "6507", "last page": "6523", "DOI": "10.1039/C9CP06439H"}, {"title": "Fully Anharmonic Infrared and Raman Spectra of Medium-Size Molecular Systems: Accuracy and Interpretation", "authors": "Julien Bloino, Alberto Baiardi, Malgorzata Biczysko", "journal": "International Journal of Quantum Chemistry", "year": "2016", "volumes": "116", "first page": "1543", "last page": "1574", "DOI": "10.1002/qua.25188"}, {"title": "The Conformational Landscape of L-Proline", "authors": "Assimo Maris, Cristina Calabrese, Sonia Melandri, Walther Caminati", "journal": "The Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "142", "first page": "024317", "last page": "024317", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4905903"}, {"title": "Dispersion-Corrected Mean-Field Electronic Structure Methods", "authors": "Stefan Grimme, Andreas Hansen, Jan Gerit Brandenburg, Christoph Bannwarth", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2016", "volumes": "116", "first page": "5105", "last page": "5154", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00533"}, {"title": "Conformational Analysis of Small Organic Molecules Using NOE and RDC Data: A Discussion of Strychnine and α-Methylene-γ-butyrolactone", "authors": "Carlos Pérez, Fabio Löhr, Hendrik Rüterjans, Julien M.
