{"Literature Review": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has ushered in a new era of potential for precision medicine and improved patient outcomes. However, the promise of AI in biomedicine is tempered by a significant challenge: the inequality in biomedical data representation across diverse populations. This literature review explores the current state of biomedical data inequality, its implications for AI-driven healthcare, and potential solutions to mitigate these disparities.Biomedical data inequality refers to the disproportionate representation of certain populations in medical datasets, with a notable bias towards individuals of European descent. This imbalance has far-reaching consequences for the development and application of AI models in healthcare. As highlighted by Popejoy and Fullerton (2016), individuals of European ancestry account for up to 88% of participants in genome-wide association studies, despite representing only 16% of the global population. This stark disparity underscores the urgent need for more inclusive data collection practices.The implications of this data inequality are profound, particularly in the context of AI-driven healthcare. Machine learning models trained on biased datasets can perpetuate and even amplify existing health disparities. Kim et al. (2020) demonstrated that AI models trained on predominantly European datasets showed reduced accuracy when applied to non-European populations, potentially leading to misdiagnoses and suboptimal treatment plans. This phenomenon, known as subpopulation shift, poses a significant risk to the equitable application of AI in healthcare.The challenge of biomedical data inequality is further compounded by the rapid advancement of AI technologies. As noted by Zou and Schiebinger (2018), the increasing reliance on AI in healthcare decision-making processes may exacerbate existing health disparities if not addressed promptly. The authors argue that without intervention, AI could become a vector for perpetuating and amplifying historical biases in healthcare.Addressing biomedical data inequality requires a multifaceted approach. One promising avenue is the development of algorithmic interventions to mitigate the effects of data bias. Transfer learning, as explored by Weiss et al. (2016), offers a potential solution by allowing models trained on majority populations to be adapted for underrepresented groups. This approach has shown promise in improving model performance across diverse populations while minimizing the need for extensive data collection from underrepresented groups.Another critical aspect of addressing biomedical data inequality is the improvement of data collection practices. Sirugo et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of diversifying genomic databases to ensure better representation of global populations. The authors argue that this diversification is essential not only for improving AI model performance but also for advancing our understanding of genetic diversity and its implications for health outcomes.Recent research has also highlighted the importance of considering data quality alongside quantity when addressing biomedical data inequality. Chen et al. (2021) identified disparities in data quality among ethnic groups, suggesting that simply increasing the quantity of data from underrepresented populations may not be sufficient to address health disparities. This finding underscores the need for comprehensive approaches that consider both the quantity and quality of biomedical data across diverse populations.The ethical implications of biomedical data inequality have also garnered significant attention. Gianfrancesco et al. (2018) argue that addressing this issue is not only a matter of scientific accuracy but also a moral imperative. The authors call for greater transparency in AI model development and deployment, as well as increased collaboration between AI researchers, healthcare providers, and communities to ensure that AI technologies benefit all populations equitably.As the field of AI in healthcare continues to evolve, novel approaches to mitigating biomedical data inequality are emerging. Federated learning, as discussed by Rieke et al. (2020), offers a promising solution by allowing models to be trained on decentralized data without compromising patient privacy. This approach could facilitate the inclusion of diverse datasets in AI model development while addressing concerns about data sharing and privacy.In conclusion, addressing the challenge of biomedical data inequality is crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in healthcare. While significant progress has been made in identifying and understanding the problem, much work remains to be done. Future research should focus on developing robust algorithmic interventions, improving data collection practices, and fostering collaboration across disciplines to ensure that AI-driven healthcare benefits all populations equitably. Only through concerted efforts to address biomedical data inequality can we hope to harness the transformative power of AI to improve health outcomes for all.", "References": [{"title": "The diversity of genetic research participation in a genomic era", "authors": "Alice B.
