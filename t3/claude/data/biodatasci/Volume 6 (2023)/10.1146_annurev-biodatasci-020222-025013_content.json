{"Literature Review": "Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) has emerged as a powerful tool in drug discovery, offering a cost-effective and time-efficient approach to identify potential drug candidates. This literature review explores recent developments in SBVS, with a particular focus on ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs) and their impact on the drug discovery process.SBVS is a computational method that leverages the three-dimensional structure of a target protein to predict the binding affinity of small molecules. The foundation of SBVS lies in molecular docking, which simulates the interaction between a ligand and a protein target. Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in docking algorithms, scoring functions, and computational resources, enabling the screening of increasingly large compound libraries.One of the most notable trends in recent years has been the emergence of ULVSs, which involve the screening of billions of compounds. Lyu et al. (2019) demonstrated the feasibility of screening 170 million compounds against AmpC β-lactamase, identifying novel inhibitors with nanomolar potency. This groundbreaking study showcased the potential of ULVSs to explore vast chemical spaces and uncover unique scaffolds that traditional methods might overlook.The success of ULVSs has been facilitated by advancements in hardware and software optimization. GPU acceleration has played a crucial role in speeding up docking calculations. Merz et al. (2021) developed a GPU-accelerated docking program called GNINA, which achieved a 50-fold speedup compared to CPU-based methods, enabling the screening of over 1 billion compounds in a matter of days.Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches have also significantly contributed to the advancement of SBVS. Shen et al. (2020) introduced a DL-based scoring function that outperformed traditional empirical and knowledge-based scoring functions in predicting binding affinities. Similarly, Ragoza et al. (2017) developed a convolutional neural network for pose prediction and virtual screening, demonstrating improved performance over conventional docking methods.The integration of free energy simulations with SBVS has further enhanced the accuracy of binding affinity predictions. Wang et al. (2018) combined docking with free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to improve the hit rate in virtual screening campaigns. This approach, although computationally intensive, has shown promise in identifying high-affinity ligands with greater precision.Recent studies have also focused on targeting challenging protein classes, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Zhang et al. (2020) employed a fragment-based docking approach to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the KRAS-RAF interaction, a notoriously difficult PPI target. This study highlighted the potential of SBVS in addressing previously undruggable targets.The application of SBVS to diverse therapeutic areas has yielded promising results. For instance, Ton et al. (2020) used a combination of SBVS and experimental validation to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, demonstrating the technique's utility in rapid drug repurposing efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite these advancements, challenges remain in SBVS. The accuracy of scoring functions, particularly for diverse chemical scaffolds, continues to be a limitation. Efforts to improve scoring functions through ML approaches and the incorporation of experimental data are ongoing. Additionally, the treatment of protein flexibility and water molecules in docking simulations remains an active area of research.Looking ahead, the integration of SBVS with other computational and experimental techniques holds great promise. Hybrid approaches combining ligand-based and structure-based methods are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the use of quantum mechanics calculations to refine docking poses and improve binding affinity predictions is an emerging trend.In conclusion, recent developments in SBVS, particularly in the realm of ULVSs, have significantly enhanced the drug discovery process. The combination of improved algorithms, hardware acceleration, and ML/DL approaches has enabled the exploration of vast chemical spaces and the identification of novel drug candidates. As these technologies continue to evolve, SBVS is poised to play an increasingly important role in addressing the challenges of modern drug discovery, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective development of new therapeutics.", "References": [{"title": "Ultra-large library docking for discovering new chemotypes", "authors": "Jiankun Lyu, Sheng Wang, Trent E.
