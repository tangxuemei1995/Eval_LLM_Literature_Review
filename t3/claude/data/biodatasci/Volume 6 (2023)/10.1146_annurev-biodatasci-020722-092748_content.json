{"Literature Review": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with risk assessment playing a crucial role in early detection and personalized treatment strategies. This literature review aims to explore the current state of breast cancer risk assessment, focusing on the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance predictive accuracy and inform clinical decision-making.Traditionally, breast density has been recognized as a dominant risk factor for breast cancer, as evidenced by numerous studies. McCormack and dos Santos Silva (2006) conducted a meta-analysis demonstrating that women with high breast density have a 4-6 times higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to those with low breast density. However, the limitations of breast density as a sole predictor have become increasingly apparent, prompting researchers to investigate more comprehensive approaches.Recent advancements in radiomics have opened new avenues for risk assessment. Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images, providing a more nuanced characterization of breast parenchymal patterns. Gastounioti et al. (2018) demonstrated that radiomic features derived from mammograms could improve risk prediction beyond traditional breast density measures. Their study showed that combining radiomic features with established risk factors resulted in a significant increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.62 to 0.73.Parallel to developments in imaging biomarkers, molecular factors have emerged as powerful tools for risk stratification. High-penetrance gene mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, have long been associated with increased breast cancer risk. Kuchenbaecker et al. (2017) reported that BRCA1 mutation carriers have a 72% cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by age 80, while BRCA2 carriers have a 69% risk. However, these high-penetrance mutations account for only a small proportion of breast cancer cases.The focus has shifted towards exploring combinations of low-penetrance gene mutations, leading to the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS). Mavaddat et al. (2019) conducted a large-scale study involving 94,075 breast cancer cases and 75,017 controls, demonstrating that PRS could effectively stratify breast cancer risk in women of European ancestry. They found that women in the highest 1% of the PRS distribution had a 4.37-fold increased risk compared to those at average risk.While imaging and molecular biomarkers have individually shown promise in improving risk assessment, the integration of these approaches represents a frontier in breast cancer research. Li et al. (2018) conducted one of the first studies combining radiomic features with genetic information. They demonstrated that a model incorporating both radiomic and genetic features outperformed models using either approach alone, achieving an AUC of 0.85 compared to 0.78 for radiomics alone and 0.72 for genetic factors alone.Building on this concept, Brentnall et al. (2020) developed a comprehensive risk model that incorporated mammographic density, PRS, and classical risk factors. Their model showed improved discriminatory accuracy, with an AUC of 0.65 compared to 0.62 for a model using only classical risk factors. This study highlighted the potential for integrating multiple biomarker types to enhance risk prediction.The integration of molecular and radiomic features not only improves risk assessment but also holds promise for personalized screening and prevention strategies. Pashayan et al. (2018) explored the potential of risk-stratified screening based on combined genetic and mammographic risk assessment. They found that such an approach could reduce overdiagnosis while maintaining the benefits of screening programs.Despite these advancements, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical practice. Standardization of radiomic feature extraction and analysis across different imaging platforms and institutions is crucial for reproducibility. Additionally, the generalizability of genetic risk scores across diverse populations requires further investigation, as most studies have focused on women of European ancestry.In conclusion, the combination of molecular and radiomic features represents a promising approach to enhance breast cancer risk assessment. By integrating these complementary biomarkers, researchers and clinicians can develop more accurate and personalized risk prediction models. Future research should focus on large-scale validation studies, standardization of methodologies, and exploration of additional biomarkers to further refine risk assessment strategies. As the field progresses, these integrated approaches have the potential to revolutionize breast cancer screening, prevention, and treatment paradigms, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of breast cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Mammographic density and breast cancer risk: current understanding and future prospects", "authors": "Valerie A.
