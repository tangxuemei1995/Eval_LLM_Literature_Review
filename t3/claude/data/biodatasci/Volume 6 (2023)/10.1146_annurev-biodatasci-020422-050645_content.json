{"Literature Review": "Single-cell multiomics has emerged as a powerful approach to unravel the complexity of biological systems at unprecedented resolution. This field combines multiple high-throughput technologies to measure various molecular features within individual cells, providing a comprehensive view of cellular heterogeneity and function. The integration of these diverse data types offers unique insights into the intricate relationships between different layers of cellular regulation.The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression heterogeneity within cell populations. Macosko et al. (2015) introduced Drop-seq, a groundbreaking method that enabled the profiling of thousands of individual cells simultaneously, paving the way for large-scale transcriptomic studies. Building upon this foundation, researchers have developed technologies to measure additional molecular modalities at the single-cell level, including genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial information.Genomic profiling at the single-cell level has allowed researchers to investigate cellular heterogeneity in terms of DNA mutations, copy number variations, and structural alterations. Guo et al. (2017) developed a method called single-cell CNV sequencing (scCNV-seq) to detect copy number variations in individual cells, revealing intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer samples. This approach has provided valuable insights into clonal evolution and tumor progression.Epigenomic profiling techniques have also been adapted for single-cell analysis. Buenrostro et al. (2015) introduced single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), which enables the mapping of chromatin accessibility landscapes in individual cells. This method has been instrumental in identifying cell type-specific regulatory elements and understanding the dynamics of gene regulation during cellular differentiation and development.Proteomic analysis at the single-cell level has been challenging due to the limited amount of protein material available from individual cells. However, Stoeckius et al. (2017) developed CITE-seq, a method that combines transcriptome profiling with protein quantification using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies. This approach allows for the simultaneous measurement of gene expression and protein levels in single cells, providing a more comprehensive view of cellular states.Spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful tool to study gene expression patterns while preserving tissue architecture. Ståhl et al. (2016) introduced a method that combines histological imaging with spatially resolved RNA sequencing, enabling the mapping of gene expression profiles to specific locations within tissue sections. This technology has opened new avenues for investigating cellular interactions and tissue organization in complex biological systems.The integration of these diverse data types presents both opportunities and challenges. Computational methods for data integration have become crucial for extracting meaningful biological insights from multimodal single-cell datasets. Stuart et al. (2019) developed Seurat v3, a computational framework for integrating single-cell multiomics data across different modalities and experimental batches. This method has been widely adopted for analyzing and visualizing complex single-cell datasets.Another approach to data integration is the use of multi-view learning algorithms. Argelaguet et al. (2020) introduced MOFA+, a statistical framework for the integrative analysis of multi-omics data. This method can handle missing data and scale to large datasets, making it suitable for analyzing complex single-cell multiomics experiments.The integration of single-cell multiomics data has led to significant advances in our understanding of cellular biology. For instance, Cao et al. (2018) used an integrated approach combining scRNA-seq and single-cell DNA methylation profiling to study cellular heterogeneity during mouse gastrulation. Their analysis revealed novel cell types and lineage-specific epigenetic changes during early embryonic development.In the field of cancer research, single-cell multiomics has provided valuable insights into tumor heterogeneity and evolution. Puram et al. (2017) used integrated single-cell RNA-seq and copy number profiling to study head and neck cancer, revealing distinct cellular programs associated with metastasis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.As the field of single-cell multiomics continues to advance, new challenges and opportunities arise. Improving the throughput and accuracy of multimodal measurements, developing more sophisticated computational methods for data integration and interpretation, and addressing technical and biological noise remain active areas of research. Furthermore, the application of single-cell multiomics to complex biological systems, such as developmental processes, disease progression, and drug responses, holds great promise for advancing our understanding of cellular biology and developing new therapeutic strategies.In conclusion, single-cell multiomics represents a powerful approach for unraveling the complexity of biological systems at unprecedented resolution. The integration of diverse molecular measurements at the single-cell level provides a comprehensive view of cellular states and functions. As technologies and computational methods continue to evolve, single-cell multiomics is poised to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and drive new discoveries in basic and translational research.", "References": [{"title": "Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets", "authors": "Evan Z.
