{"Literature Review": "Circumbinary accretion, the process by which material accretes onto binary systems, has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging implications for various astrophysical phenomena. This review synthesizes recent findings on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, focusing on its impact on binary star formation and evolution, circumbinary planet formation and migration, and the evolution of massive binary black holes.One of the most striking features of circumbinary accretion is its highly variable nature. Muñoz and Lai (2016) demonstrated that the accretion rate is modulated at either the binary orbital period (Pb) or approximately 5Pb, depending on the binary eccentricity (eb) and mass ratio (qb). This variability has important consequences for the observable properties of accreting binary systems and can potentially serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying circumbinary disks.The inner region of circumbinary disks often develops a coherent eccentric structure, as shown by Thun et al. (2017). This eccentricity can significantly influence the accretion process and affect various physical phenomena occurring within the disk. For instance, Kley et al. (2019) found that the eccentric disk structure can impact the migration of planets forming within the circumbinary environment, potentially explaining the observed orbital configurations of some circumbinary planetary systems.The long-term evolution of binary systems undergoing circumbinary accretion has been a subject of intense study. Contrary to earlier expectations, Muñoz et al. (2019) discovered that circumbinary accretion does not always lead to binary orbital decay. Instead, the secular orbital evolution depends on a complex interplay between the binary parameters (eb and qb) and the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas. This finding has profound implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of close binary systems, including massive black hole binaries in galactic nuclei.Another intriguing aspect of circumbinary accretion is the behavior of misaligned disks. Martin and Lubow (2017) showed that for low-eccentricity binaries, a misaligned disk tends to evolve towards coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. However, Zanazzi and Lai (2018) demonstrated that when the binary eccentricity is significant, the disk can evolve towards a 'polar alignment,' where the disk plane is perpendicular to the binary orbital plane. These findings have important implications for the formation and dynamics of circumbinary planets in misaligned systems.The study of circumbinary accretion has also shed light on the formation and evolution of massive black hole binaries. Tang et al. (2017) investigated the accretion onto supermassive black hole binaries and found that the circumbinary disk can significantly influence the binary's orbital evolution and the electromagnetic signatures of these systems. This work has important implications for future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers.Recent observations of protoplanetary disks have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of circumbinary accretion in young stellar systems. For example, Kennedy et al. (2019) reported the discovery of a highly misaligned circumbinary disk around the young binary system HD 98800, providing observational support for the theoretical predictions of disk misalignment in eccentric binary systems.A particularly intriguing scenario involves binaries embedded in larger accretion disks, such as those found in active galactic nuclei (AGN). McKernan et al. (2018) proposed that stellar-mass black hole binaries within AGN disks could experience accelerated mergers due to the interaction with the surrounding gas. This mechanism could potentially explain the unexpectedly high merger rates of black hole binaries observed by gravitational wave detectors.The study of circumbinary accretion continues to evolve rapidly, with new observations and theoretical advancements constantly refining our understanding of these complex systems. Future work will likely focus on developing more sophisticated models of circumbinary disk dynamics, incorporating additional physical processes such as magnetohydrodynamics and radiative transfer. Moreover, upcoming observational facilities, such as the next generation of large telescopes and space-based gravitational wave detectors, promise to provide unprecedented insights into the nature of circumbinary accretion across a wide range of astrophysical scales.In conclusion, the study of circumbinary accretion has emerged as a crucial area of research in modern astrophysics, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of binary star formation and evolution, planet formation, and the cosmic history of massive black holes. As our theoretical models become more sophisticated and our observational capabilities continue to improve, we can expect further exciting discoveries in this dynamic field of study.", "References": [{"title": "Accretion into the central cavity of a circumbinary disc", "authors": "Diego J.
