{"Literature Review": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers has revolutionized our understanding of the galactic environment and the dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System. These objects, formed outside our cosmic neighborhood but observed passing through it, provide a unique opportunity to study the composition and characteristics of extrasolar material. The first two confirmed interstellar interlopers, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have sparked intense scientific interest due to their unexpected and divergent properties.1I/'Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, was the first recognized interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. Its name, which means 'scout' or 'messenger' in Hawaiian, reflects its nature as a harbinger of a new class of celestial objects. 'Oumuamua appeared as an unresolved, asteroid-like body with an unusually elongated shape and a lack of observable cometary activity. This absence of a coma or tail, typically associated with comets, initially led researchers to classify it as an asteroid. However, its trajectory revealed non-gravitational acceleration, suggesting outgassing or other unknown mechanisms at play.In contrast, 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, exhibited more familiar cometary characteristics. It displayed a prominent coma and tail, indicating active sublimation of volatile materials. Spectroscopic observations revealed the presence of common cometary species such as CN, C2, and O (1D), suggesting a composition similar to Solar System comets. The divergent nature of these two objects has raised intriguing questions about the diversity of interstellar bodies and the processes that shape them.The detection of these interlopers has profound implications for our understanding of the galactic environment. Estimates suggest a number density of approximately 0.1 AU^-3 for such objects, which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply the existence of 10^25 to 10^26 similar bodies in the Milky Way. This vast population of interstellar objects represents a previously unknown component of our galaxy, offering new insights into the dynamics of planetary system formation and evolution.The origin of these interstellar visitors is a subject of ongoing debate. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that they formed within the protoplanetary disks of young stars and were subsequently ejected through gravitational interactions with giant planets or passing stars. This scenario is supported by numerical simulations of planet formation and migration, which predict the ejection of a significant number of planetesimals and comets during the early stages of planetary system evolution.However, alternative theories have been proposed to explain the unique characteristics of 'Oumuamua. Some researchers have suggested that it could be a fragment of a larger body disrupted by tidal forces during a close encounter with a star or planet. Others have proposed more exotic origins, including the possibility of artificial construction, although such hypotheses remain highly speculative and lack substantial evidence.The study of interstellar interlopers presents significant observational challenges due to their brief passages through our Solar System and their typically small sizes. Advanced survey telescopes, such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are expected to dramatically increase our ability to detect and characterize these objects. Future missions dedicated to intercepting and studying interstellar objects in situ have also been proposed, which could provide unprecedented insights into their composition and structure.The discovery of interstellar interlopers has opened up new avenues for research in planetary science, astrobiology, and galactic dynamics. These objects serve as natural probes of the interstellar medium, carrying information about the chemical and physical conditions in different regions of the galaxy. By studying their composition, we may gain insights into the diversity of planetary system architectures and the processes that shape them.Furthermore, the potential for these objects to transport organic material between star systems has implications for the distribution of life's building blocks throughout the galaxy. While the probability of panspermia – the transfer of life between planets via interstellar objects – remains low, the exchange of complex organic molecules could play a role in seeding the ingredients for life across vast distances.As our understanding of interstellar interlopers grows, so too does our appreciation for the dynamic and interconnected nature of our galactic environment. These cosmic wanderers challenge our preconceptions about the boundaries of planetary systems and highlight the importance of considering the broader galactic context in our studies of planetary formation and evolution. Future discoveries in this field promise to further expand our cosmic perspective and deepen our understanding of our place in the universe.", "References": [{"title": "The natural history of 'Oumuamua", "authors": "Matthew M.
