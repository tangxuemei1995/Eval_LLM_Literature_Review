{"Literature Review": "The study of quasars at cosmic dawn has emerged as a crucial field in understanding the early universe, providing invaluable insights into the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), galaxy formation, and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). This literature review synthesizes recent findings and advancements in this rapidly evolving area of research.The discovery of high-redshift quasars has been a remarkable achievement in observational astronomy. Bañados et al. (2018) reported the detection of ULAS J1342+0928, a quasar at z = 7.54, which pushed the quasar redshift frontier to unprecedented limits. This discovery, along with others, has allowed researchers to probe the universe when it was less than 5% of its current age. The number density of luminous quasars at high redshifts has been found to decline exponentially, as demonstrated by Jiang et al. (2016) in their survey of z ~ 6 quasars. This trend suggests that the earliest quasars likely emerged around z ~ 10, providing a temporal constraint on the formation of the first SMBHs.One of the most intriguing aspects of high-redshift quasars is the presence of billion-solar-mass black holes in the early universe. Wu et al. (2015) reported the discovery of SDSS J0100+2802, a quasar at z = 6.3 with a black hole mass of 12 billion solar masses. The existence of such massive black holes less than a billion years after the Big Bang poses significant challenges to our understanding of black hole formation and growth. Theoretical models, such as those proposed by Inayoshi et al. (2020), suggest that a combination of massive early black hole seeds and highly efficient, sustained accretion is necessary to explain these observations.The rapid growth of SMBHs in the early universe is accompanied by intense star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies. Venemans et al. (2017) used ALMA observations to study the host galaxy of a z = 7.54 quasar, revealing significant [CII] emission indicative of ongoing star formation. Interestingly, Decarli et al. (2018) found that the dynamical masses of high-redshift quasar host galaxies are typically lower than what would be expected based on the local BH-galaxy scaling relations. This discrepancy suggests that SMBHs in the early universe may have grown faster than their host galaxies, challenging our understanding of co-evolution between black holes and galaxies.The study of high-redshift quasars has also provided crucial insights into the epoch of reionization. Becker et al. (2015) used quasar absorption spectra to probe the ionization state of the IGM, finding evidence for the completion of reionization by z ~ 6. However, subsequent studies have revealed significant spatial variations in the ionization state of the IGM. Bosman et al. (2018) analyzed a large sample of z > 5.7 quasar spectra and found substantial fluctuations in the Lyman-α forest opacity, suggesting a patchy and extended reionization process.The chemical enrichment of the early universe can also be probed through quasar absorption line studies. D'Odorico et al. (2013) used high-resolution spectra of z ~ 6 quasars to study the metal content of the IGM, finding evidence for widespread metal enrichment even at these early epochs. More recently, Meyer et al. (2019) used a sample of z > 6.5 quasars to study the evolution of metal absorption lines, providing constraints on the ionization and enrichment history of the circumgalactic medium during the EoR.The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of high-redshift quasars provide important clues about the physical conditions in the early universe. Shen et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive study of quasar SEDs across a wide redshift range and found no strong evolution in the average SED shape. This result suggests a rapid buildup of the active galactic nucleus environment in the early universe, with physical conditions similar to those in lower-redshift quasars.In conclusion, the study of quasars at cosmic dawn has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. These observations have revealed the existence of billion-solar-mass black holes in the first billion years of cosmic history, provided insights into the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies, and shed light on the process of cosmic reionization. As observational capabilities continue to improve, particularly with the advent of next-generation telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, we can expect further breakthroughs in our understanding of the earliest quasars and their role in shaping the universe we observe today.", "References": [{"title": "An 800-million-solar-mass black hole in a significantly neutral Universe at a redshift of 7.5", "authors": "Eduardo Bañados, Bram P.
