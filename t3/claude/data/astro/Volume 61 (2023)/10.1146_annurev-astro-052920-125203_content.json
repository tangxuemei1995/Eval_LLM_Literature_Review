{"Literature Review": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) has emerged as a crucial component in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. This vast, multiphase gaseous region surrounding galaxies plays a pivotal role in regulating the flow of matter and energy between galaxies and the intergalactic medium. Over the past decade, significant advancements in observational techniques and computational capabilities have revolutionized our comprehension of the key physical processes governing the CGM.One of the fundamental aspects of CGM physics is the interplay between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. Voit et al. (2017) demonstrated that the thermal state of the CGM is largely determined by the competition between these two processes. When cooling times exceed the free-fall time, the gas remains hot, with temperatures approaching the virial temperature of the halo. Conversely, rapid cooling leads to the formation of cold gas structures with temperatures around 10^4 K. This dichotomy has profound implications for the overall structure and dynamics of the CGM.The role of gas inflows and outflows in shaping the CGM cannot be overstated. Cosmological simulations by Nelson et al. (2019) revealed that large-scale structure plays a crucial role in channeling cold gas streams into galactic halos, providing not only mass but also angular momentum. These cold flows are particularly important in the early universe and for lower-mass halos. Simultaneously, galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback and active galactic nuclei (AGN) inject energy, mass, and metals into the CGM, as shown by the high-resolution simulations of Muratov et al. (2015).The multiphase nature of the CGM is a key feature that has garnered significant attention. Werk et al. (2014) provided observational evidence for the coexistence of hot and cold gas phases in the CGM of L* galaxies. The interaction between these phases is governed by complex physical processes, including turbulent mixing and radiative cooling. McCourt et al. (2018) proposed the 'fog' model, suggesting that the cold phase of the CGM consists of a myriad of small, dense cloudlets that form through thermal instabilities and fragmentation.The role of magnetic fields in the CGM has been a subject of intense study. Ji et al. (2018) demonstrated that magnetic fields can significantly alter the dynamics of cold clouds in hot galactic winds, potentially enhancing their survival and altering their trajectories. Furthermore, van de Voort et al. (2021) showed that magnetic fields can suppress thermal conduction between hot and cold phases, thereby affecting the overall energy balance and phase structure of the CGM.Cosmic rays have emerged as another important component in CGM physics. Simulations by Buck et al. (2020) indicated that cosmic ray pressure support can significantly alter the structure of galactic halos, potentially explaining observed CGM properties that are challenging to reproduce with purely thermal models. However, the exact mechanisms of cosmic ray transport and their interaction with the thermal gas remain areas of active research and debate.The impact of satellite galaxies on the CGM has gained increasing recognition. Observations by Johnson et al. (2015) revealed that the CGM of massive galaxies is significantly influenced by satellite galaxies through processes such as ram pressure stripping and satellite outflows. This highlights the importance of considering the entire galactic ecosystem when studying CGM properties.Recent high-resolution simulations have shed light on the small-scale structure of the CGM. Sparre et al. (2019) demonstrated that a broad spectrum of cold gas structures, ranging from parsec to kiloparsec scales, can arise from the interplay between fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation processes. These findings underscore the importance of resolving small-scale physics in order to accurately model the global properties of the CGM.Despite these advancements, several key questions remain open for future investigation. The mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics is not fully understood, particularly in terms of how small-scale turbulence and mixing processes affect the global distribution and kinematics of CGM gas. Additionally, the precise mechanisms by which the CGM influences galaxy evolution, including its role in quenching star formation and shaping galactic morphology, require further elucidation.In conclusion, our understanding of the key physical processes in the CGM has advanced significantly in recent years, revealing a complex, multiphase medium shaped by a variety of physical processes operating across a wide range of scales. Future progress will likely come from a combination of higher-resolution simulations, more sensitive observations, and improved theoretical models that can bridge the gap between microphysics and galactic-scale phenomena.", "References": [{"title": "The Physics of the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "G.
