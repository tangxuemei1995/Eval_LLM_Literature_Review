{"Literature Review": "Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and their chemical composition plays a crucial role in shaping the characteristics of emerging planetary systems. This literature review explores the current understanding of protoplanetary disk chemistry, focusing on the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P, and their implications for planet formation.The chemical composition of protoplanetary disks is influenced by both inherited material from the parent molecular cloud and in situ chemical processes. Öberg et al. (2011) demonstrated that the C/O ratio in different disk regions can vary significantly due to the sequential freeze-out of major volatile carriers, affecting the composition of forming planets. This concept was further developed by Eistrup et al. (2016), who showed that disk chemistry evolves over time, potentially altering the initial elemental ratios inherited from the interstellar medium.The distribution of volatile elements in protoplanetary disks is not uniform. Schwarz et al. (2018) observed that the CO abundance in disks is often depleted compared to interstellar values, suggesting that carbon is sequestered into other species or larger bodies. This depletion can have significant implications for planet formation, as it affects the availability of carbon for incorporation into planetary atmospheres and surfaces.Nitrogen chemistry in disks has been the subject of several studies. Cleeves et al. (2018) used ALMA observations to detect N2H+ in the TW Hya disk, providing insights into the nitrogen reservoir and ionization structure. Their findings suggest that N2 is a major nitrogen carrier in the disk midplane, which has implications for the nitrogen content of forming planets.The role of sulfur in protoplanetary disk chemistry has been investigated by Dutrey et al. (2011), who detected several sulfur-bearing molecules in disks around T Tauri stars. Their observations indicate that sulfur chemistry is active in these environments and may play a role in the formation of prebiotic molecules.Phosphorus, although less abundant, is an essential element for life as we know it. Jiménez-Escobar and Muñoz Caro (2011) studied the photo-desorption of phosphorus-bearing molecules from interstellar ice analogs, providing insights into how phosphorus might be released into the gas phase in protoplanetary disks.The chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks is closely linked to their physical structure and dynamics. Henning and Semenov (2013) reviewed the complex interplay between disk physics and chemistry, highlighting how processes such as turbulent mixing, dust growth, and radial drift can significantly affect chemical abundances and distributions.Recent advancements in observational techniques have greatly enhanced our understanding of disk chemistry. Öberg et al. (2015) used ALMA to map the distribution of complex organic molecules in the disk around MWC 480, demonstrating the presence of large organic molecules in the planet-forming regions of disks. Such observations provide crucial insights into the organic inventory available for incorporation into forming planets.The chemical composition of protoplanetary disks has direct implications for the composition of forming planets. Cridland et al. (2016) developed models linking disk chemistry to the atmospheric composition of giant planets, showing how the local disk environment during planet formation can influence the final planetary composition.Understanding disk chemistry is also essential for interpreting observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Madhusudhan et al. (2014) discussed how the C/O ratio in hot Jupiter atmospheres could be used to constrain their formation locations within the protoplanetary disk, highlighting the connection between disk chemistry and exoplanet characteristics.In conclusion, the study of protoplanetary disk chemistry is a rapidly evolving field that combines theoretical modeling, laboratory experiments, and astronomical observations. The complex interplay between physical, chemical, and dynamical processes in disks presents challenges for modeling but also offers opportunities to develop chemical tracers for different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation. As our understanding of disk chemistry continues to improve, it will provide valuable insights into the diversity of planetary systems observed in the universe.", "References": [{"title": "CO Depletion in Protoplanetary Disks: A Unified Picture", "authors": "Kamber R.
