{"Literature Review": "The formation and evolution of the first stars, known as Population III (Pop III) stars, represent a crucial phase in the early universe's history. These stars, formed from pristine, metal-free gas, played a pivotal role in shaping the cosmic landscape and set the stage for subsequent generations of stars and galaxies. This literature review aims to synthesize current understanding of Pop III stars, their formation mechanisms, properties, and impact on the early universe.The formation of Pop III stars occurs in small dark matter halos at redshifts z ∼ 30 and below, as primordial gas cools and collapses under gravitational forces. Contrary to earlier beliefs of isolated massive star formation, recent studies suggest that primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation, leading to the formation of small clusters of Pop III stars. Stacy and Bromm (2013) demonstrated through high-resolution simulations that these clusters typically contain 5-10 stars with a wide range of masses. This finding challenges the long-held notion of Pop III stars being exclusively massive.The mass distribution of Pop III stars is a subject of ongoing research and debate. While early models predicted a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), more recent work suggests a broader mass range. Hirano et al. (2014) conducted a large set of radiation hydrodynamics simulations, finding that Pop III stars could have masses ranging from 10 to 1000 solar masses, with a logarithmically flat mass function. This diversity in stellar masses has significant implications for the impact of Pop III stars on their environment and subsequent stellar generations.Feedback processes from massive Pop III stars play a crucial role in regulating subsequent star formation. Ionizing radiation and supernova explosions from these stars can dramatically alter the surrounding medium, potentially suppressing or triggering further star formation. Whalen et al. (2008) showed that ionizing radiation from a single massive Pop III star can evaporate the gas in its host minihalo, delaying further star formation for up to 100 million years. However, the exact nature and extent of this feedback remain uncertain, particularly in the context of clustered star formation.In extreme conditions, such as in atomic cooling halos with virial temperatures above 10^4 K, supermassive Pop III stars can form. These stars, with masses reaching several 10^5 solar masses, have been proposed as potential seeds for the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars. Latif et al. (2013) demonstrated through cosmological simulations that under specific conditions of strong UV background and low molecular hydrogen abundance, direct collapse of gas can lead to the formation of these supermassive stars.Observational constraints on Pop III stars remain challenging due to their distant and transient nature. Direct detection of individual Pop III stars is beyond the capabilities of current telescopes. However, indirect methods offer promising avenues for constraining Pop III star formation and properties. The global 21-cm signal, which traces neutral hydrogen in the early universe, can provide insights into the impact of the first stars on cosmic reionization. Bowman et al. (2018) reported a potential detection of this signal, although the interpretation remains controversial.Gravitational waves offer another indirect probe of Pop III stars. The merger of compact objects formed from Pop III stars could produce detectable gravitational wave signals. Kinugawa et al. (2014) predicted that the detection rates of such mergers by advanced LIGO could constrain the Pop III initial mass function and star formation rate.Stellar archaeology, the study of metal-poor stars in the local universe, provides valuable constraints on both the low-mass and high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way's halo are thought to preserve the chemical signatures of the first supernovae. Ishigaki et al. (2018) analyzed a large sample of such stars and found evidence supporting the idea that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae.The transition from Pop III to Population II (Pop II) star formation marks a significant shift in cosmic history. This transition is driven by metal enrichment from the first supernovae, which fundamentally alters the cooling properties of gas and the resulting stellar populations. Wise et al. (2012) used adaptive mesh refinement simulations to show that this transition occurs at redshifts z ∼ 15-20, with Pop II stars dominating the cosmic star formation rate thereafter.In conclusion, our understanding of Pop III stars has evolved significantly in recent years, moving from a simple picture of isolated, extremely massive stars to a more nuanced view of clustered star formation with a diverse mass range. While direct observations remain elusive, indirect probes and theoretical models continue to refine our knowledge of these cosmic pioneers. Future advancements in observational capabilities and computational power promise to shed further light on the nature and impact of the first stars, helping to complete our picture of cosmic dawn.", "References": [{"title": "The First Stars: Formation of Binaries and Small Multiple Systems", "authors": "Athena Stacy, Volker Bromm", "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2013", "volumes": "785", "first page": "73", "last page": "73", "DOI": "10.1088/0004-637X/785/1/73"}, {"title": "One Hundred First Stars: Protostellar Evolution and the Final Masses", "authors": "Takashi Hosokawa, Kazuyuki Omukai, Naoki Yoshida, Harold W.
