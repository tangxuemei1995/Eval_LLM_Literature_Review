{"Literature Review": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, serving as a fundamental component in the gas cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) within the Milky Way. This literature review explores recent advancements in our understanding of Hi, its physical properties, structure, and relationship with magnetic fields, based on new sensitive absorption and emission surveys.The cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM) are two primary phases of Hi in the ISM. Recent studies have shed light on the mass fraction of these phases and their distribution throughout the Milky Way. Murray et al. (2018) found that the CNM comprises approximately 40% of the total Hi mass on average, with this fraction increasing in regions of higher visual extinction (Av) due to elevated mean gas density. This finding aligns with the work of Kalberla and Haud (2018), who observed that the cold disk of Hi extends to at least 25 kpc from the galactic center, significantly farther than previously thought.The remaining ~60% of Hi exists in the warm phase, as reported by Peek et al. (2019). Their study revealed that the WNM exhibits structural characteristics indicative of feedback events, such as supernova explosions and stellar winds. This observation is consistent with the findings of Kim et al. (2017), who used high-resolution simulations to demonstrate the impact of stellar feedback on the morphology and distribution of warm Hi in the ISM.The structural differences between cold and warm Hi have been a subject of intense investigation. Clark et al. (2019) utilized high angular and spectral resolution Hi emission data to show that cold Hi is predominantly filamentary in nature. In contrast, warm Hi displays a more smooth and diffuse distribution, as observed by Kalberla et al. (2020). These structural variations are thought to be related to the different physical conditions and formation mechanisms of the two phases.The relationship between Hi and magnetic fields has garnered significant attention in recent years. McClure-Griffiths et al. (2021) found a strong correlation between the orientation of Hi filaments and the galactic magnetic field, suggesting that magnetic fields play a crucial role in shaping the structure of cold Hi. This finding is supported by the work of Soler et al. (2020), who used polarization measurements to map the magnetic field structure in relation to Hi distribution.Environmental factors have been shown to influence the properties of Hi significantly. Jameson et al. (2019) investigated the Hi content in different galactic environments and found that the CNM fraction increases in regions of higher metallicity and star formation activity. This relationship between Hi properties and environmental conditions provides valuable insights into the gas cycle and star formation processes in galaxies.The three-dimensional structure of Hi in the Milky Way remains a challenging area of study. However, recent advancements in observational techniques and data analysis methods have begun to unravel this complex structure. Marchal et al. (2019) used a combination of Hi emission and absorption data to construct a 3D model of the local ISM, revealing intricate structures and providing a more comprehensive understanding of the Hi distribution in our galactic neighborhood.The effects of heating and cooling on Hi properties have also been a focus of recent research. Wolfire et al. (2022) conducted numerical simulations to investigate the thermal balance of Hi in different ISM environments, demonstrating how various heating and cooling mechanisms influence the phase transition between CNM and WNM. Their results highlight the importance of understanding these processes in interpreting observational data and constructing accurate models of the ISM.As we look to the future, several observational and simulation opportunities promise to further our understanding of Hi in the Milky Way and other galaxies. Upcoming large-scale surveys, such as those planned for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will provide unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in Hi observations. These data will enable more detailed studies of Hi structure, kinematics, and its relationship with other ISM components. Additionally, advancements in computational power and simulation techniques will allow for more sophisticated models of the multi-phase ISM, incorporating complex physics such as magnetic fields, turbulence, and feedback processes.In conclusion, recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way, revealing its complex structure, phase distribution, and relationship with magnetic fields and environmental factors. As a critical component in the evolution of galaxies, continued research into Hi properties and dynamics will provide valuable insights into the processes that shape the ISM and drive galaxy evolution.", "References": [{"title": "The mass fraction of cold gas in atomic clouds", "authors": "Murray, Claire E., Stanimirović, Snežana, Goss, W.
