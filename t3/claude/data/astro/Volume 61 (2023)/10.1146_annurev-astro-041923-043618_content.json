{"Literature Review": "The field of galaxy formation and evolution has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, largely due to advancements in hydrodynamical simulations within the ΛCDM cosmological framework. These simulations have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing researchers to model complex physical processes and their effects on galaxy populations with unprecedented detail and accuracy.One of the most significant achievements of modern hydrodynamical simulations is their ability to reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies. This success is crucial for understanding the large-scale structure of the universe and the role of dark matter in galaxy formation. For instance, the EAGLE simulation, as reported by Schaye et al. (2015), has demonstrated excellent agreement with observed galaxy clustering statistics across a wide range of scales.The distribution of key galaxy characteristics, such as mass, size, and star formation rate (SFR), has also been successfully replicated in recent simulations. The Illustris-TNG project, described by Pillepich et al. (2018), has shown remarkable consistency with observational data in reproducing the galaxy stellar mass function and size-mass relation across cosmic time. Similarly, the FIRE-2 simulations, as discussed by Hopkins et al. (2018), have made significant strides in modeling the star formation histories of galaxies, capturing the bursty nature of star formation in low-mass systems.Scaling relations connecting diverse galaxy properties to mass have been another area of success for hydrodynamical simulations. The ability to reproduce these relations is crucial for understanding the physical processes governing galaxy evolution. For example, Davé et al. (2019) demonstrated that the SIMBA simulations accurately capture the stellar mass-halo mass relation, as well as the mass-metallicity relation for both stars and gas.Despite these successes, several challenges remain in the field of galaxy formation simulations. One of the most pressing issues is the accurate modeling of circumgalactic gas. The properties and dynamics of this gas are critical for understanding galaxy evolution, as it serves as both a reservoir for future star formation and a record of past galactic outflows. However, as noted by Tumlinson et al. (2017), the predictions of different simulation suites often diverge significantly in this domain, highlighting the sensitivity of these results to the implemented subgrid models.The implementation of feedback processes remains a significant challenge in galaxy formation simulations. While feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating star formation and producing realistic galaxy populations, the exact mechanisms and their efficiencies are still subjects of debate. For instance, Weinberger et al. (2017) demonstrated the importance of AGN feedback in reproducing the observed galaxy color bimodality and quenching massive galaxies, but the details of how this feedback operates on small scales remain uncertain.Another ongoing challenge is the accurate modeling of low-mass galaxies. These systems are particularly sensitive to feedback processes and environmental effects, making them difficult to simulate accurately. While progress has been made in this area, as shown by the FIRE-2 simulations (Hopkins et al., 2018), discrepancies still exist between simulations and observations, particularly in terms of the abundance and properties of dwarf galaxies.The treatment of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in galaxy formation simulations is an emerging area of research that presents both opportunities and challenges. As discussed by Pakmor et al. (2020), the inclusion of these physical processes can significantly affect the properties of the circumgalactic medium and the regulation of star formation, but their implementation in large-scale simulations remains computationally challenging.Finally, the resolution limits of current simulations continue to pose challenges for modeling certain physical processes. While the resolution of state-of-the-art simulations has improved dramatically, many important physical processes occur on scales that remain unresolved. This necessitates the use of subgrid models, which introduce uncertainties and potential discrepancies between different simulation suites.In conclusion, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have made tremendous progress in recent years, successfully reproducing many observed properties of the galaxy population. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in modeling circumgalactic gas, implementing accurate feedback processes, and simulating low-mass galaxies. As computational power increases and our understanding of the underlying physics improves, future generations of simulations will undoubtedly continue to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution within the ΛCDM cosmological framework.", "References": [{"title": "The EAGLE project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments", "authors": "Joop Schaye, Robert A.
