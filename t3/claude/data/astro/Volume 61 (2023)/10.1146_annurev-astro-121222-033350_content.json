{"Literature Review": "The autobiographical account of a prominent Chinese astronomer and scientist provides a unique perspective on the development of astronomical research and international scientific cooperation in China during the latter half of the 20th century. This literature review aims to contextualize the author's experiences and contributions within the broader landscape of astronomical and geodynamic research, with a particular focus on the advancements made in China and the Asia-Pacific region.The author's career, spanning from the 1950s to the early 21st century, coincides with a period of significant growth in China's scientific capabilities and international engagement. This growth is reflected in the development of major astronomical facilities and research programs, as well as China's increasing participation in global scientific initiatives.One of the key areas highlighted in the autobiography is the establishment of a highly precise Universal Time system in China during the 1960s. This achievement can be seen as part of a global effort to improve timekeeping accuracy, which was crucial for various scientific and technological applications. As noted by Levine (2016), the development of atomic clocks and their integration into timekeeping systems revolutionized precision timekeeping during this period, enabling advancements in fields such as geodesy and astronomy.The author's involvement in the development of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) networks and satellite laser ranging research stations in China during the 1970s-1990s represents a significant contribution to the field of geodesy and Earth observation. These technologies have played a crucial role in improving our understanding of Earth's rotation, tectonic plate movements, and other geodynamic processes. As discussed by Schuh and Behrend (2012), VLBI has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining terrestrial and celestial reference frames, which are fundamental to many areas of astronomy and Earth sciences.The construction of the 65-m Radio Telescope in the early 21st century, as mentioned in the autobiography, marks a significant milestone in China's radio astronomy capabilities. This development can be seen in the context of a global trend towards larger and more sensitive radio telescopes, as exemplified by projects such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) (Dewdney et al., 2009). Such facilities are crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe, from studying distant galaxies to searching for extraterrestrial intelligence.The author's role in developing astro-geodynamics in China and advancing the Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program in the late 20th century reflects the growing recognition of the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in Earth and space sciences. This work aligns with global efforts to integrate astronomical and geophysical observations for a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's dynamics and its place in the solar system (Plag and Pearlman, 2009).The autobiography also highlights the author's significant contributions to international scientific cooperation, particularly through leadership roles in the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and as a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. This aspect of the author's career reflects the increasing globalization of astronomical research during the latter half of the 20th century. As discussed by Andersen et al. (2019), international collaboration has become increasingly important in astronomy, driven by the need for large-scale facilities and the benefits of sharing data and expertise across borders.The author's involvement in social activities for the benefit of women and children is noteworthy, as it reflects a growing awareness of the importance of diversity and inclusion in scientific fields. This aligns with broader efforts to address gender disparities in astronomy and other STEM fields, as discussed by Ivie and White (2015) in their study of women in physics and astronomy.The autobiographical account spans a period of significant technological and scientific advancements in astronomy and related fields. From the development of precise timekeeping systems to the construction of large-scale radio telescopes, these advancements have dramatically expanded our observational capabilities and deepened our understanding of the universe. As noted by Longair (2006), the latter half of the 20th century saw revolutionary changes in astronomy, driven by technological innovations and new theoretical insights.The author's career trajectory, from working at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory to holding leadership positions in international scientific organizations, mirrors the broader trend of China's increasing engagement with the global scientific community. This engagement has been particularly notable in the field of astronomy, where China has made significant investments in large-scale facilities and research programs in recent years (Su, 2013).In conclusion, this autobiographical account provides valuable insights into the development of astronomical and geodynamic research in China, as well as the country's increasing participation in international scientific collaborations. It offers a personal perspective on the technological and scientific advancements that have shaped modern astronomy, while also highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and international cooperation in addressing complex scientific challenges.", "References": [{"title": "The science of timekeeping", "authors": "Judah Levine", "journal": "American Journal of Physics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "84", "first page": "246", "last page": "264", "DOI": "10.1119/1.4938630"}, {"title": "VLBI geodesy: observations, analysis, and results", "authors": "Harald Schuh, Dirk Behrend", "journal": "Journal of Geodesy", "year": "2012", "volumes": "86", "first page": "1", "last page": "29", "DOI": "10.1007/s00190-011-0524-5"}, {"title": "The Square Kilometre Array", "authors": "Peter E.
