{"Literature Review": "Optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, pushing the boundaries of astronomical observations and enabling groundbreaking discoveries across various celestial phenomena. This literature review aims to explore the recent advances in O/IR interferometry, focusing on instrumental developments, observational capabilities, and scientific achievements.The field of O/IR interferometry has seen significant progress with the advent of advanced instruments and techniques. The GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has revolutionized the field by achieving unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. Gravity Collaboration et al. (2017) reported that GRAVITY can observe objects up to a thousand times fainter than previous interferometers, opening up new avenues for studying distant and dim celestial bodies. This remarkable sensitivity has been achieved through the combination of large 8-m telescopes, adaptive optics, and innovative fringe tracking techniques.Another notable advancement in O/IR interferometry is the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) array. As described by ten Brummelaar et al. (2015), CHARA routinely offers baselines up to 330 meters and can perform aperture synthesis using six 1-m telescopes. This capability has significantly enhanced the angular resolution and imaging capabilities of interferometric observations.The improved sensitivity and resolution of modern interferometers have led to groundbreaking results across various astronomical domains. In the study of the Galactic Center, GRAVITY has provided unprecedented insights into the behavior of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. Gravity Collaboration et al. (2018) reported the detection of orbital motions near the last stable orbit of the black hole, providing strong evidence for general relativity in the strong-field regime.Exoplanet research has also benefited greatly from these advancements. Lacour et al. (2019) demonstrated the capability of GRAVITY to directly detect and characterize exoplanets, achieving contrast ratios and angular resolutions previously thought impossible. This opens up new possibilities for studying the atmospheres and orbital dynamics of extrasolar planets.In the field of active galactic nuclei (AGN), O/IR interferometry has provided valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of these energetic objects. Gravity Collaboration et al. (2020) used GRAVITY to resolve the broad-line region of a quasar at cosmological distances, shedding light on the inner workings of these distant, powerful objects.Young stellar objects (YSOs) have been another area of significant progress. Kraus et al. (2020) utilized the VLTI to study the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, providing crucial information about planet formation processes and the early stages of stellar evolution.The technical advancements that have enabled these scientific breakthroughs are multifaceted. Single-mode beam combiners, capable of combining light from up to six telescopes, have played a crucial role in improving the quality and efficiency of interferometric observations. Monnier et al. (2014) discussed the development and implementation of these advanced beam combiners, highlighting their importance in achieving high-precision measurements.Image reconstruction techniques have also seen significant improvements, building upon earlier developments in radio interferometry. Baron et al. (2016) presented advanced algorithms for image reconstruction from optical interferometric data, enabling the creation of high-fidelity images from sparse interferometric measurements.The combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics, and fringe tracking has been instrumental in boosting the sensitivity of interferometers. Eisenhauer et al. (2011) described the principles and implementation of these techniques in the context of GRAVITY, emphasizing their role in achieving unprecedented sensitivity and precision.Looking to the future, further improvements in O/IR interferometry are on the horizon. The implementation of laser guide star adaptive optics is expected to provide another order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity and sky coverage. Wizinowich et al. (2006) discussed the principles and potential of laser guide star systems, which will enable interferometric observations of fainter targets and expand the observable regions of the sky.In conclusion, O/IR interferometry has experienced a renaissance in recent years, driven by instrumental advancements and innovative techniques. These developments have led to groundbreaking discoveries across various astronomical domains, from the Galactic Center to distant quasars. As the field continues to evolve, with improvements in sensitivity, resolution, and sky coverage, O/IR interferometry is poised to play an increasingly important role in our understanding of the universe.", "References": [{"title": "First light for GRAVITY: Phase referencing optical interferometry for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer", "authors": "Gravity Collaboration, Abuter, R., Accardo, M., Amorim, A., Anugu, N., Ávila, G., Azouaoui, N., Benisty, M., Berger, J.
