{"Literature Review": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing astronomical time series data over the past two decades. This surge in popularity can be attributed to the exponential growth in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain datasets in astronomy, coupled with the inherent flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and robustness of GPR.The foundation of GPR lies in its ability to model complex, stochastic signals without requiring explicit parametric forms. This non-parametric approach allows for the capture of intricate patterns and correlations in astronomical data that might be missed by traditional methods. As noted by Rasmussen and Williams (2006), GPs provide a principled, practical, and probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines.In the realm of exoplanet research, GPR has proven particularly valuable. Gibson et al. (2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of GPs in modeling correlated noise in exoplanet transit light curves, significantly improving the accuracy of planetary parameter estimates. This work paved the way for numerous applications in exoplanet detection and characterization, as exemplified by Haywood et al. (2014), who used GPs to disentangle stellar activity signals from planetary signals in radial velocity data.The versatility of GPR extends beyond exoplanet studies. In the field of active galactic nuclei (AGN), Kelly et al. (2014) employed GPs to model the variability of quasar light curves, providing insights into the physical processes driving AGN variability. Similarly, Foreman-Mackey et al. (2017) showcased the application of GPs in modeling stellar rotation periods and other time-variable phenomena in Kepler data.One of the key strengths of GPR is its ability to handle irregularly sampled data and account for measurement uncertainties, both of which are common challenges in astronomical time series. This capability was highlighted by Ambikasaran et al. (2015), who developed efficient algorithms for GPR with large datasets, making it applicable to modern astronomical surveys.The choice of kernel function is crucial in GPR, as it encodes our prior beliefs about the properties of the function being modeled. Astronomical applications have seen the use of various kernels, from simple squared exponential kernels to more complex, physically motivated kernels. For instance, Angus et al. (2018) introduced a kernel specifically designed for modeling stellar rotation signals, demonstrating how domain knowledge can be incorporated into GP models.Despite its advantages, GPR is not without challenges. The computational cost of GPR scales cubically with the number of data points, which can be prohibitive for large astronomical datasets. However, recent advancements in sparse GP approximations and structured kernel interpolation, as discussed by Gardner et al. (2018), have made GPR more tractable for big data applications.The interpretability of GP models is another area of ongoing research. While GPs provide flexible and accurate models, extracting physical insights from these models can be challenging. Work by Roberts et al. (2013) on automatic relevance determination in GP models has shown promise in this direction, allowing for the identification of important features in the data.In the context of time-domain astronomy, GPR has found applications in various subfields beyond exoplanets and AGN. For example, Lochner et al. (2016) used GPs for supernova light curve classification, while Boone (2019) applied them to the detection and characterization of optical transients. These applications highlight the adaptability of GPR to diverse astronomical phenomena.The ecosystem of open-source GP software packages has grown significantly, facilitating the adoption of GPR in astronomy. Libraries such as George (Ambikasaran et al., 2015), GPy (GPy, 2012), and celerite (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2017) have made GP modeling more accessible to astronomers, providing efficient implementations and user-friendly interfaces.Looking ahead, the role of GPR in astronomical time series analysis is likely to expand further. As astronomical surveys continue to generate larger and more complex datasets, the need for flexible, robust, and scalable analysis methods will only increase. Ongoing developments in GP theory, such as deep GPs (Damianou and Lawrence, 2013) and multi-output GPs (Alvarez et al., 2012), promise to extend the capabilities of GPR even further.In conclusion, Gaussian Process Regression has established itself as a valuable tool in the astronomer's toolkit for time-domain analysis. Its ability to model complex, stochastic processes while accounting for uncertainties makes it well-suited to the challenges of modern astronomical datasets. As the field continues to evolve, GPR is poised to play an increasingly important role in extracting scientific insights from the wealth of time-domain data in astronomy.", "References": [{"title": "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning", "authors": "Carl Edward Rasmussen, Christopher K.
