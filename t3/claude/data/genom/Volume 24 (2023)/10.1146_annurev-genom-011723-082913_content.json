{"Literature Review": "The SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin-remodeling complex plays a crucial role in neural crest cell development and has been implicated in various neural crest-derived diseases. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of the SWI/SNF complex's function in neural crest cell development and its involvement in related pathologies.The neural crest is a transient, multipotent cell population that gives rise to diverse cell types, including elements of the craniofacial skeleton, melanocytes, and components of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of chromatin remodeling in neural crest development, with particular emphasis on the SWI/SNF complex (Bajpai et al., 2010). The mammalian SWI/SNF complex exists in two main forms: BAF (Brg1-associated factors) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF), both of which are critical for neural crest specification during embryonic development.The BAF complex has been shown to play a crucial role in neural crest formation and migration. Weider and Wegner (2017) demonstrated that the BAF complex interacts with neural crest-specific transcription factors to regulate gene expression programs essential for neural crest development. Furthermore, Li et al. (2013) reported that the BAF complex is required for the expression of key neural crest specifier genes, such as Sox9 and Snail2, highlighting its importance in establishing neural crest identity.The PBAF complex, while less studied in the context of neural crest development, has also been implicated in this process. Hodges et al. (2018) found that PBAF is essential for the activation of neural crest-specific enhancers, suggesting a distinct but complementary role to the BAF complex in neural crest specification.Recent research has also shed light on the role of Schwann cell precursors, a neural crest-derived population, in development and disease. Furlan and Adameyko (2018) reviewed the multipotent nature of Schwann cell precursors and their contribution to various tissues, including melanocytes and parasympathetic neurons. This finding expands our understanding of neural crest-derived cell populations and their potential involvement in disease processes.The SWI/SNF complex has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of neural crest-derived tumors. Pathogenic variants in components of the BAF and PBAF complexes have been identified in various cancers, including those of neural crest origin. One of the most well-studied components is SMARCB1, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. Biegel et al. (2014) reported that loss of SMARCB1 is a hallmark of rhabdoid tumors, aggressive cancers that primarily affect young children.Transgenic mouse models have provided valuable insights into the temporal aspects of SWI/SNF-related tumorigenesis. Han et al. (2016) demonstrated that there is a critical early developmental window during which Smarcb1 inactivation leads to the formation of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors resembling human rhabdoid tumors. Interestingly, when Smarcb1 is inactivated later in development, additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes are required to drive the formation of more differentiated neoplasms.The role of the SWI/SNF complex in schwannoma development has also been a subject of recent investigation. Schwannomas are benign tumors of Schwann cell origin, often associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). While NF2 gene mutations are the primary driver of schwannoma formation, emerging evidence suggests that alterations in SWI/SNF complex components may contribute to tumor development. Kehrer-Sawatzki et al. (2020) reviewed the potential interactions between NF2 and SWI/SNF complex members in schwannoma pathogenesis, highlighting the complex interplay between these factors.The involvement of the SWI/SNF complex in neural crest-derived tumors extends beyond rhabdoid tumors and schwannomas. Shain and Pollack (2013) reported that mutations in SWI/SNF complex components are found in a significant proportion of melanomas, another neural crest-derived malignancy. This finding underscores the broader implications of SWI/SNF dysfunction in neural crest-related pathologies.In conclusion, the SWI/SNF complex plays a critical role in neural crest cell development and is implicated in various neural crest-derived diseases. The BAF and PBAF complexes contribute to neural crest specification and migration through their interactions with key transcription factors and enhancers. Pathogenic variants in SWI/SNF complex components, particularly SMARCB1, are associated with the development of aggressive pediatric tumors and may also contribute to the formation of more differentiated neoplasms in adults. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms by which SWI/SNF dysfunction leads to tumorigenesis and exploring potential therapeutic strategies targeting this complex in neural crest-derived cancers.", "References": [{"title": "An essential switch in subunit composition of a chromatin remodeling complex during neural development", "authors": "Ramesh Bajpai, Daria A.
