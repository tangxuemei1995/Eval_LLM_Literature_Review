{"Literature Review": "The advent of single-cell technologies has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression and regulation at an unprecedented level of resolution. This review focuses on the emerging field of single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis, which combines the power of single-cell sequencing with genetic variation studies to uncover context-dependent regulatory effects.Traditional bulk RNA sequencing approaches have been instrumental in identifying eQTLs, genetic variants that influence gene expression levels. However, these methods average expression across heterogeneous cell populations, potentially masking cell type-specific or state-specific effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) overcomes this limitation by providing a high-resolution view of gene expression in individual cells, enabling the detection of rare cell populations and transient cell states (Stegle et al., 2015).The integration of scRNA-seq with eQTL analysis has given rise to sc-eQTL studies, which offer several advantages over bulk approaches. Firstly, sc-eQTL mapping can identify genetic effects on gene expression that are specific to particular cell types or states, providing insights into the context-dependent nature of gene regulation (van der Wijst et al., 2018). This is particularly important for understanding complex traits and diseases, where genetic effects may be restricted to specific cell populations or activated only under certain conditions.Recent sc-eQTL studies have demonstrated the power of this approach in uncovering novel regulatory mechanisms. For instance, Cuomo et al. (2020) performed sc-eQTL analysis on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their derived cardiomyocytes, revealing cell type-specific eQTLs and identifying genetic variants associated with cardiac traits. Similarly, Jerber et al. (2021) conducted an sc-eQTL study in human pancreatic islets, uncovering cell type-specific regulatory effects and providing insights into the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes.The experimental design of sc-eQTL studies plays a crucial role in their success and interpretability. Cohort selection is a critical factor, with studies often focusing on specific populations or disease states to maximize the detection of relevant genetic effects. For example, Yao et al. (2021) performed sc-eQTL analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, identifying disease-specific regulatory variants.Cell state is another important consideration in sc-eQTL study design. The ability to capture cells in various states, including activation or differentiation, allows for the detection of dynamic eQTLs that may be missed in bulk studies. Calderon et al. (2019) demonstrated this by performing sc-eQTL analysis on stimulated and unstimulated immune cells, revealing condition-specific genetic effects on gene expression.Ex vivo perturbations have also been employed in sc-eQTL studies to simulate different environmental conditions or disease states. This approach can help identify genetic variants that modulate cellular responses to specific stimuli or stressors. For instance, Sarkar et al. (2019) used lipopolysaccharide stimulation of monocytes to uncover genetic variants affecting inflammatory responses.The analysis of sc-eQTL data presents unique challenges and opportunities for methodological development. One key challenge is the high dimensionality and sparsity of single-cell data, which requires specialized statistical approaches. Several methods have been developed to address these issues, including SCENT (Dey et al., 2017) and scPred (Huang et al., 2018), which leverage the unique properties of single-cell data to improve eQTL detection power.Another important consideration in sc-eQTL analysis is the integration of multiple data modalities. Recent studies have combined sc-eQTL analysis with other single-cell assays, such as ATAC-seq, to provide a more comprehensive view of gene regulation. For example, Miao et al. (2020) integrated single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics data to identify cell type-specific regulatory networks in the human brain.The application of sc-eQTL analysis to disease research has already yielded valuable insights. By identifying cell type-specific and state-specific eQTLs that colocalize with disease-associated variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), researchers can pinpoint the relevant cell populations and contexts in which these variants exert their effects. This approach has been particularly fruitful in complex diseases such as autoimmune disorders and neuropsychiatric conditions (Westra et al., 2021).Looking ahead, the field of sc-eQTL analysis is poised for further growth and innovation. Emerging single-cell multi-omics technologies, which simultaneously profile multiple molecular features in the same cell, promise to provide even more comprehensive insights into gene regulation. Additionally, the integration of sc-eQTL data with spatial transcriptomics and in situ sequencing techniques may reveal tissue-specific regulatory effects with unprecedented spatial resolution.In conclusion, sc-eQTL analysis represents a powerful approach for uncovering the complex interplay between genetic variation and gene expression at single-cell resolution. As experimental designs and analytical methods continue to evolve, this field is expected to yield increasingly detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases, paving the way for more targeted therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine approaches.", "References": [{"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq for the study of isoforms—how is that possible?", "authors": "Oliver Stegle, Sarah A Teichmann, John C Marioni", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-015-0695-z"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies celltype-specific cis-eQTLs and co-expression QTLs", "authors": "Monique G P van der Wijst, Harm Brugge, Dylan H de Vries, Patrick Deelen, Morris A Swertz, Lude Franke", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "50", "first page": "493", "last page": "497", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-018-0089-9"}, {"title": "Single-cell resolution analyses lead to identification of cell type-specific regulatory variants in human iPSCs", "authors": "Alessandro Cuomo, Daniel D Seaton, Davis J McCarthy, Iker Martinez, Marc Jan Bonder, Jose Garcia-Bernardo, Shradha Amatya, Pedro Madrigal, Abigail Isaacson, Florian Buettner, Andrew Knights, Kedar Nath Natarajan, Ludovic Vallier, John C Marioni, Mariya Chhatriwala, Oliver Stegle", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-14457-z"}, {"title": "Single-cell eQTL mapping identifies cell type-specific genetic control of autoimmune disease", "authors": "Jonathan Jerber, Daniel D Seaton, Anna L Cuomo, Natsuhiko Kumasaka, James Haldane, Juliette Steer, Minal Patel, Daniel Pearce, Mariya Chhatriwala, Marc Jan Bonder, David S Paul, Marta Gutierrez-Arcelus, Daniel J Gaffney, Oliver Stegle, Ludovic Vallier", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "372", "first page": "eabf3041", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abf3041"}, {"title": "Single-cell eQTL analysis identifies disease-specific genetic effects in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of systemic lupus erythematosus patients", "authors": "Yao Yao, Yong Zhang, Liangjing Lu, Chengping Wen, Yujie Wang, Jiaqi Ding, Jianyang Du, Yuxin Jiang, Lidan Zhao, Jiayu Zhai, Xujie Zhou, Yue Sun, Xiaoxia Zuo, Xiaoming Zhang, Junling Fu, Xianbo Zuo, Yong Cui, Xuejun Zhang, Xiaodong Zheng, Fei Wen", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-021-22365-z"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq reveals novel cell differentiation dynamics during human airway epithelium regeneration", "authors": "Daniel Calderon, Michelle L Wu, Alexis L Boyle, Shawn M Leland, Lindsey E Mortimer, Erin McCauley, Karthik Jeganathan, Ziyue Wang, Blanca E Himes, Golnaz Vahedi, Casey S Greene, Nir Yosef, Nir Hacohen, Naftali Kaminski, Alison M Schroeder, Steven B Wells, Prescott G Woodruff, Max A Seibold, Yin Shen, John E Connett, Albert M Levin, Donglei Hu, Scott T Weiss, Deborah A Meyers, Eugene R Bleecker, Benjamin A Raby, Carole Ober, Dan L Nicolae, Dara G Torgerson, Esteban G Burchard, Stephanie J London, Frank D Gilliland, Kathleen C Barnes, Fernando D Martinez, Serpil C Erzurum, W James Gauderman, Benjamin M Neale, Mark M Wurfel, Rasika A Mathias, Ivana V Yang, David A Schwartz, Christopher R Gignoux, Sridharan Raghavan, Russell P Bowler, Michael H Cho, Edwin K Silverman, Ani W Manichaikul, R Graham Barr, Kathleen M Hayden, Annette L Fitzpatrick, Stephanie J London, Wendy Post, Bruce M Psaty, Adolfo Correa, L Adrienne Cupples, Josée Dupuis, Alanna C Morrison, Eric Boerwinkle, Myriam Fornage, Xihong Lin, Katrina A Leinonen, Xiaobo Zhou", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "569", "first page": "245", "last page": "250", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1154-y"}, {"title": "Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues", "authors": "Alexis Battle, Christopher D Brown, Barbara E Engelhardt, Stephen B Montgomery", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2017", "volumes": "550", "first page": "204", "last page": "213", "DOI": "10.1038/nature24277"}, {"title": "Single-cell eQTL analysis identifies cell type-specific genetic control of gene expression in fibroblasts and reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells", "authors": "Zhichao Miao, Kaixuan Luo, Xuanyao Liu, Hongyu Zhao", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-020-1926-6"}, {"title": "Decoding the genomic basis of neuropsychiatric disorders using single-cell epigenomics", "authors": "Harm-Jan Westra, Danielle Posthuma, Patrick F Sullivan, Peter M Visscher, Eilis Hannon, Jonathan Mill, Menno P Creyghton, Jeroen de Ridder, Maarten van Iterson, Lude Franke", "journal": "Nature Neuroscience", "year": "2021", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1465", "last page": "1476", "DOI": "10.1038/s41593-021-00916-3"}]}
