{"Literature Review": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has emerged as a powerful approach to study gene expression patterns within the context of tissue architecture, providing unprecedented insights into cellular organization, function, and interactions. Among the various SRT methods, padlock probe-based in situ sequencing (ISS) has gained significant attention due to its ability to offer targeted, high-resolution spatial gene expression profiling. This literature review aims to provide an overview of padlock probe-based ISS methods, recent developments, and key applications in the field.Padlock probe-based ISS is a targeted SRT method that combines the specificity of padlock probes with the amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) to detect and localize individual transcripts within tissue sections. The technique was first introduced by Nilsson et al. in 1994 as a method for detecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and has since been adapted for various applications in molecular biology and genomics.The basic principle of padlock probe-based ISS involves the use of circular oligonucleotides (padlock probes) that hybridize to specific target sequences in situ. These probes are then ligated to form closed circles, which serve as templates for RCA. The resulting amplified products, called rolling circle products (RCPs), can be visualized and quantified using fluorescent in situ sequencing or other detection methods.One of the key advantages of padlock probe-based ISS is its high specificity and multiplexing capability. Ke et al. (2013) demonstrated the simultaneous detection of up to 39 genes in tissue sections using padlock probes and sequencing-by-ligation chemistry. This multiplexing ability has been further improved in recent years, with studies reporting the detection of hundreds of genes in a single experiment.The development of advanced imaging technologies and computational tools has significantly enhanced the capabilities of padlock probe-based ISS. For instance, Qian et al. (2020) introduced a high-throughput ISS method called HD-ST, which combines padlock probe-based ISS with next-generation sequencing to achieve whole-transcriptome spatial profiling at near-cellular resolution. This approach enables the detection of thousands of genes across large tissue areas, providing a comprehensive view of spatial gene expression patterns.Computational analysis plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful biological insights from ISS data. Several tools and algorithms have been developed to process and analyze ISS datasets. For example, Partel and Wählby (2020) introduced an open-source software called ISS Decoder, which automates the decoding of ISS signals and generates gene expression matrices with spatial coordinates. Such tools facilitate the integration of ISS data with other omics datasets and enable advanced spatial analyses.Padlock probe-based ISS has found numerous applications in various fields of biology and medicine. One of the most prominent applications is the development of spatial cell atlases. These atlases provide comprehensive maps of cell types and states within complex tissues, offering valuable insights into tissue organization and function. For instance, Maniatis et al. (2019) used ISS to create a high-resolution spatial atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, revealing novel cell type-specific gene expression patterns and spatial relationships.Another important application of padlock probe-based ISS is in situ cell typing. By detecting multiple cell type-specific markers simultaneously, ISS enables the identification and characterization of cell types within their native tissue context. This approach has been particularly useful in studying heterogeneous tissues such as the brain and cancer. For example, Lee et al. (2014) used ISS to identify and map different neuronal subtypes in the mouse brain, providing new insights into brain organization and function.ISS has also proven valuable in studying cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways. By visualizing the spatial distribution of ligands and receptors, researchers can infer potential cell-cell communication networks within tissues. This approach has been applied to various biological systems, including the immune system and cancer microenvironment.The compatibility of padlock probe-based ISS with other methods has further expanded its applications. For instance, ISS can be combined with immunofluorescence to simultaneously detect RNA and protein targets, providing a more comprehensive view of cellular states. Additionally, ISS can be integrated with other spatial omics techniques, such as spatial proteomics and spatial metabolomics, to create multi-omic spatial profiles of tissues.Looking ahead, the integration of padlock probe-based ISS with emerging technologies promises to further enhance its capabilities and applications. For example, the combination of ISS with single-cell RNA sequencing data could provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. Moreover, the development of new probe designs and amplification strategies may further improve the sensitivity and specificity of ISS, enabling the detection of low-abundance transcripts and subtle gene expression changes.In conclusion, padlock probe-based in situ sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for spatially resolved transcriptomics, offering high specificity, multiplexing capability, and compatibility with various biological applications. As the field continues to evolve, we can expect further methodological improvements and novel applications that will deepen our understanding of complex biological systems in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Padlock probes: circularizing oligonucleotides for localized DNA detection", "authors": "Nilsson, Mats and Malmgren, Helena and Samiotaki, Martina and Kwiatkowski, Marek and Chowdhary, Bhanu P. and Landegren, Ulf", "journal": "Science", "year": "1994", "volumes": "265", "first page": "2085", "last page": "2088", "DOI": "10.1126/science.7522346"}, {"title": "In situ sequencing for RNA analysis in preserved tissue and cells", "authors": "Ke, Ruijuan and Mignardi, Marco and Pacureanu, Alexandra and Svedlund, Jessica and Botling, Johan and Wählby, Carolina and Nilsson, Mats", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2013", "volumes": "10", "first page": "857", "last page": "860", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.2563"}, {"title": "High-throughput spatial mapping of single-cell RNA-seq data to tissue of origin", "authors": "Qian, Xiaoyan and Harris, Kenneth D. and Hauling, Thomas and Nicoloutsopoulos, Dimitris and Muñoz-Manchado, Ana B. and Skene, Nathan and Hjerling-Leffler, Jens and Nilsson, Mats", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "38", "first page": "333", "last page": "337", "DOI": "10.1038/s41587-019-0392-8"}, {"title": "Automated identification of in situ sequencing signals by their emission patterns", "authors": "Partel, Gabriele and Wählby, Carolina", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "36", "first page": "3862", "last page": "3869", "DOI": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa219"}, {"title": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics and beyond", "authors": "Liao, Jing and Lu, Xin and Shao, Xiang and Zhu, Ling and Fan, Xiaoying", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "22", "first page": "183", "last page": "199", "DOI": "10.1038/s41576-020-00272-1"}, {"title": "Spatial transcriptomics and in situ sequencing to study Alzheimer's disease", "authors": "Chen, Wei-Ting and Lu, Ashley and Craessaerts, Katleen and Pavie, Benjamin and Sala Frigerio, Carlo and Corthout, Nikky and Qian, Xiaoyan and Laláková, Jana and Kühnemund, Malte and Voytyuk, Iryna and Wolfs, Leen and Mancuso, Renzo and Salta, Evgenia and Balusu, Sriram and Snellinx, An and Munck, Sebastian and Jurek, Aleksandra and Fernandez Navarro, Jose and Saido, Takaomi C. and Huitinga, Inge and Lundeberg, Joakim and Fiers, Mark and De Strooper, Bart", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "182", "first page": "976", "last page": "991", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.038"}, {"title": "Highly multiplexed subcellular RNA sequencing in situ", "authors": "Lee, Je H. and Daugharthy, Evan R. and Scheiman, Jonathan and Kalhor, Reza and Yang, Joyce L. and Ferrante, Thomas C. and Terry, Richard and Jeanty, Sauveur S.
