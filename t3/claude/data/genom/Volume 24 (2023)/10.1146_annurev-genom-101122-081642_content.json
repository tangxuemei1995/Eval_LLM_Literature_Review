{"Literature Review": "The human genome contains five acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, and 22) that possess short arms (p-arms) with unique structural and functional characteristics. These p-arms are of particular interest due to their role in nucleolar organization and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) production. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the structure, function, and evolution of acrocentric chromosome p-arms, with a focus on their nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and associated genomic features.The NORs on acrocentric p-arms contain tandem arrays of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, which are transcribed to produce precursor rRNA molecules. These genes are organized in a homogeneous manner and are transcribed in a telomere-to-centromere direction (Floutsakou et al., 2013). The transcription and processing of rRNA, along with the assembly of ribosomal subunits, occur within the nucleolus, a distinct nuclear compartment visible under light microscopy (Pederson, 2011).Recent advancements in long-read sequencing technologies and genome assembly methods have significantly improved our understanding of acrocentric p-arm sequences. These developments have revealed that acrocentric p-arms range in size from 10.1 to 16.7 Mb, collectively accounting for approximately 2.2% of the human genome (Jain et al., 2018). This new information has allowed researchers to explore the genomic context of NORs and their potential functional implications.One of the key features of acrocentric p-arms is the presence of shared sequence elements bordering the rDNA arrays. These include distal junctions and proximal junctions, which are conserved among the five acrocentric chromosomes (van Sluis et al., 2019). The distal junctions, in particular, have shown evidence of functionality, suggesting a potential role in regulating rDNA transcription or nucleolar organization.Beyond the rDNA arrays and their flanking regions, acrocentric p-arms comprise a complex landscape of repetitive DNA elements. These include multiple classes of satellite DNA and segmental duplications, which contribute to the unique genomic architecture of these chromosomal regions (Miga et al., 2014). The presence of these repetitive elements has important implications for chromosome stability and evolution.One of the most intriguing aspects of acrocentric p-arms is their involvement in recombination events between heterologous chromosomes. This propensity for recombination is likely facilitated by the high degree of sequence similarity among the p-arms of different acrocentric chromosomes (Gibbons et al., 2015). Such recombination events can lead to structural variations and chromosomal rearrangements, including Robertsonian translocations.Robertsonian translocations are a type of chromosomal abnormality in which two acrocentric chromosomes fuse at or near their centromeres, resulting in a single chromosome with a long arm from each of the original chromosomes (Scriven et al., 2001). These translocations are relatively common in humans and can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of reproductive health and genetic counseling.The unique properties of acrocentric p-arms also extend to their chromatin structure and nuclear organization. These regions are typically associated with constitutive heterochromatin, characterized by dense packaging and transcriptional repression (Bersaglieri and Santoro, 2019). However, the active transcription of rDNA genes within the NORs presents an interesting paradox, suggesting a dynamic interplay between heterochromatic and euchromatic states in these regions.Recent studies have also explored the potential roles of acrocentric p-arms beyond rRNA production. For example, evidence suggests that these regions may serve as anchoring points for the organization of the nucleolus and contribute to the overall three-dimensional structure of the nucleus (Caudron-Herger et al., 2015). Additionally, the non-coding sequences within acrocentric p-arms may have regulatory functions that influence gene expression on other chromosomes or contribute to nuclear processes such as DNA repair and recombination.In conclusion, the p-arms of human acrocentric chromosomes represent a fascinating and complex genomic landscape that plays a crucial role in cellular function through rRNA production and nucleolar organization. Recent advances in sequencing and genomic analysis have provided new insights into the structure and evolution of these regions, revealing shared sequence elements, complex repetitive DNA landscapes, and unique recombination properties. Future research in this field will likely continue to uncover novel functions and regulatory mechanisms associated with acrocentric p-arms, furthering our understanding of nuclear organization and genome evolution.", "References": [{"title": "Human rDNA unit clusters are recombinational hotspots in cancer", "authors": "Ioulia Floutsakou, Saumya Agrawal, Tung-Tien Nguyen, Concetta Seoighe, Austen R.
