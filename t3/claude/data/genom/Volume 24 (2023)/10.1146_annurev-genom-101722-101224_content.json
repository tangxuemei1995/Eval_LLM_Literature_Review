{"Literature Review": "The discovery of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) and cell surface glycoRNAs has challenged the traditional view of RNA as a solely intracellular molecule. This literature review aims to explore the systems and mechanisms involved in RNA crossing membranes, with a focus on extracellular RNA and cell surface glycoRNAs.Extracellular RNAs have been identified in various biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. These exRNAs can be categorized into different types, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The presence of exRNAs in these fluids has sparked interest in their potential roles in intercellular communication and as biomarkers for various diseases.One of the primary mechanisms for RNA export is through extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles. Valadi et al. (2007) demonstrated that exosomes contain both mRNA and miRNA, which can be transferred to recipient cells and remain functional. This groundbreaking study highlighted the potential of exRNAs as mediators of cell-to-cell communication.The biogenesis of exRNAs involves complex cellular machinery. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) plays a crucial role in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the subsequent release of exosomes containing RNA cargo. Colombo et al. (2014) provided a comprehensive review of the molecular mechanisms involved in exosome biogenesis and secretion, emphasizing the importance of ESCRT-dependent and ESCRT-independent pathways.In addition to vesicle-mediated export, RNA can also cross membranes through specialized protein pores. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a well-studied example of such a structure, facilitating the bidirectional transport of RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Köhler and Hurt (2007) reviewed the mechanisms of mRNA export through the NPC, highlighting the role of various transport factors and adaptors in this process.The recent discovery of cell surface glycoRNAs by Flynn et al. (2021) has further expanded our understanding of extracellular RNA. These glycosylated RNA molecules are found on the cell surface and may play roles in cell-cell interactions and signaling. The presence of glycoRNAs raises questions about the mechanisms by which these molecules are transported to the cell surface and how they are anchored there.Several protein families have been implicated in RNA transport across membranes. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, for instance, has been shown to facilitate the export of specific RNA species. Kovalchuk et al. (2019) demonstrated that the ABCE1 protein is involved in the export of miRNAs in extracellular vesicles, suggesting a potential mechanism for selective RNA packaging and export.Another important player in RNA transport is the SID-1 protein, first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as a transmembrane protein required for systemic RNAi. Shih and Hunter (2011) reviewed the role of SID-1 in RNA transport, discussing its potential as a channel for dsRNA uptake and its implications for RNA-based therapeutics.The regulation of RNA export is a complex process involving various cellular factors. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in this regulation by interacting with specific RNA sequences and facilitating their transport. Müller-McNicoll and Neugebauer (2013) provided an overview of the diverse functions of RBPs in RNA export, highlighting their importance in determining the fate of different RNA species.The study of exRNAs and cell surface glycoRNAs has important implications for both basic science and clinical applications. ExRNAs have shown promise as biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, Schwarzenbach et al. (2014) reviewed the potential of circulating nucleic acids, including exRNAs, as biomarkers in cancer diagnostics and prognosis.Furthermore, the ability of exRNAs to mediate intercellular communication has opened up new avenues for therapeutic interventions. O'Brien et al. (2020) discussed the potential of engineered extracellular vesicles as delivery vehicles for RNA-based therapeutics, highlighting the advantages of this approach over traditional delivery methods.In conclusion, the study of RNA crossing membranes, particularly in the context of extracellular RNA and cell surface glycoRNAs, represents a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for our understanding of cellular biology and potential clinical applications. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms of RNA export, the regulation of this process, and the functional roles of different exRNA species in various biological contexts. Additionally, further investigation into the biogenesis and function of cell surface glycoRNAs may provide new insights into cell-cell communication and tissue organization.", "References": [{"title": "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells", "authors": "Hadi Valadi, Karin Ekström, Apostolos Bossios, Margareta Sjöstrand, James J.
