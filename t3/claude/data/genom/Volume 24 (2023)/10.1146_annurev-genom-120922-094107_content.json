{"Literature Review": "The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are crucial regulators of bone development and skeletal homeostasis. Recent advances in genetic research have revealed that mutations in genes associated with these pathways are responsible for a wide range of skeletal dysplasias, resulting in both short and tall stature phenotypes. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal dysplasias, focusing on their role in acromelic dysplasia, cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome, and Marfan syndrome.TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways are part of the TGF-β superfamily, which plays a vital role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the context of bone development, these pathways are essential for the regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast function, as well as cartilage formation and maintenance. Mutations in genes encoding TGF-β and BMP ligands, receptors, or downstream effectors can lead to dysregulation of these pathways, resulting in skeletal abnormalities (Wang et al., 2014).Acromelic dysplasia is a group of skeletal dysplasias characterized by short stature, short limbs, and hand and foot abnormalities. Recent studies have identified mutations in the LTBP3 gene, which encodes latent TGF-β binding protein 3, as a cause of acromelic dysplasia (Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al., 2019). LTBP3 is crucial for the proper secretion and activation of TGF-β, and its dysfunction leads to increased TGF-β signaling in the growth plate, resulting in impaired chondrocyte differentiation and longitudinal bone growth (Krejci et al., 2016).Another skeletal dysplasia associated with short stature is cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome (CSCF). This rare disorder is caused by mutations in the MAP3K7 gene, which encodes TAK1, a key mediator of both TGF-β and BMP signaling (Le Goff et al., 2016). Patients with CSCF exhibit short stature, cardiac defects, and distinctive facial features. Studies using patient-derived fibroblasts have shown that MAP3K7 mutations lead to impaired TAK1 activation and altered downstream signaling, resulting in abnormal skeletal development (Wade et al., 2018).On the other end of the spectrum, Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by tall stature, long limbs, and cardiovascular complications. Mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, are the primary cause of Marfan syndrome (Dietz et al., 1991). Fibrillin-1 is an essential component of extracellular microfibrils and plays a crucial role in regulating TGF-β bioavailability. In Marfan syndrome, FBN1 mutations lead to increased TGF-β signaling, resulting in excessive bone growth and other skeletal abnormalities (Neptune et al., 2003).Mouse models have been instrumental in elucidating the pathomolecular mechanisms underlying these skeletal dysplasias. For example, Ltbp3 knockout mice exhibit skeletal phenotypes similar to those observed in acromelic dysplasia patients, including short stature and craniofacial abnormalities (Dabovic et al., 2002). These models have provided valuable insights into the role of LTBP3 in regulating TGF-β signaling during skeletal development.Similarly, mouse models of Marfan syndrome have been crucial in understanding the role of fibrillin-1 in TGF-β regulation and skeletal growth. Fbn1 mutant mice display many of the skeletal and cardiovascular features observed in Marfan syndrome patients, and studies using these models have revealed that excessive TGF-β signaling is a key driver of the disease phenotype (Judge et al., 2004).Recent advances in our understanding of TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal dysplasias have opened up new avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. While no specific pharmacological treatments are currently available for these disorders, several promising approaches are being investigated. For instance, TGF-β neutralizing antibodies have shown potential in mitigating some of the skeletal and cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome in mouse models (Habashi et al., 2006).Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting specific components of the TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways are being explored as potential therapeutic agents. For example, losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker that indirectly inhibits TGF-β signaling, has shown promise in reducing aortic root dilation in Marfan syndrome patients (Lacro et al., 2014). However, its effects on skeletal manifestations remain to be fully elucidated.In conclusion, the TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways play crucial roles in skeletal development and homeostasis, and their dysregulation contributes to a wide range of skeletal dysplasias. Advances in genetic and molecular research have provided valuable insights into the pathomechanisms underlying these disorders, paving the way for the development of targeted therapies. Future research should focus on further elucidating the complex interplay between TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal development and exploring novel therapeutic approaches to address the skeletal manifestations of these disorders.", "References": [{"title": "TGF-β and BMP signaling in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation", "authors": "Guiqian Chen, Chuxia Deng, Yi-Ping Li", "journal": "International Journal of Biological Sciences", "year": "2012", "volumes": "8", "first page": "272", "last page": "288", "DOI": "10.7150/ijbs.2929"}, {"title": "Mutations in LTBP3 cause acromicric dysplasia and geleophysic dysplasia", "authors": "Reza Haji-Seyed-Javadi, Julie Decroocq, Carine Le Goff, Maryse Mallet, Genevieve Baujat, Martine Le Merrer, Valerie Cormier-Daire", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "104", "first page": "948", "last page": "954", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.03.012"}, {"title": "Activating mutations in MAP3K7 cause cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome", "authors": "Carine Le Goff, Elise Michot, Kim-Hanh Le Duc, Marlene Rio, Clarisse Baumann, Valerie Cormier-Daire", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "99", "first page": "1328", "last page": "1333", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.10.008"}, {"title": "Marfan syndrome caused by a recurrent de novo missense mutation in the fibrillin gene", "authors": "Harry C.
