{"Literature Review": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of visual function, playing a crucial role in focusing light precisely on the retina. While the average axial length of an adult human eye is approximately 23.5 mm, deviations from this norm can lead to significant visual impairments. This literature review explores the genetic determinants of axial length, focusing on two extreme conditions: microphthalmia and high myopia in childhood.Microphthalmia is characterized by an underdeveloped eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at one year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood. This condition typically develops within the first trimester of pregnancy and is associated with significant visual morbidity. Verma and FitzPatrick (2007) reported that microphthalmia affects approximately 1 in 10,000 births, highlighting its rarity and the importance of understanding its genetic basis.On the other hand, high myopia represents the opposite extreme, where the eye continues to grow beyond normal limits. It is defined as an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more. Unlike microphthalmia, high myopia can develop at any age, including childhood. The prevalence of high myopia has been increasing globally, with Morgan et al. (2018) projecting that by 2050, nearly 10% of the world's population may be affected by high myopia.Both microphthalmia and high myopia exhibit high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Williamson and FitzPatrick (2014) identified more than 90 genes associated with microphthalmia, while Tedja et al. (2019) reported several hundred genes linked to myopia. Despite this extensive genetic involvement, diagnostic yields remain low, underscoring the complexity of these conditions and the need for further research.Recent studies have begun to unravel the molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length. Interestingly, evidence suggests that shared molecular pathways may be responsible for both under- and overgrowth of the eye. For instance, Kiefer et al. (2013) identified several loci associated with refractive error and myopia, some of which were also implicated in microphthalmia.One of the key pathways involved in eye size determination is the retinoic acid signaling pathway. Cvekl and Wang (2009) demonstrated that retinoic acid plays a crucial role in eye morphogenesis during embryonic development. Perturbations in this pathway can lead to microphthalmia or anophthalmia. Conversely, Troilo et al. (2019) found that retinoic acid also influences postnatal eye growth and is implicated in the development of myopia.Another important pathway is the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. Hannon et al. (2010) showed that mutations in TGFBI, a gene involved in TGF-β signaling, can cause microphthalmia. Similarly, Chen et al. (2016) found that TGF-β signaling is upregulated in the sclera of myopic eyes, suggesting its involvement in axial length elongation.The Wnt signaling pathway has also been implicated in both microphthalmia and myopia. Fuhrmann (2008) demonstrated that Wnt signaling is essential for early eye development, and disruptions can lead to microphthalmia. In the context of myopia, Hysi et al. (2020) identified several Wnt pathway genes associated with refractive error in a large-scale genome-wide association study.Environmental factors also play a significant role in eye growth, particularly in the development of myopia. Xiong et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis showing that increased outdoor time is protective against myopia onset in children. This finding highlights the complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental influences in determining axial length.Understanding the genetic determinants of axial length is crucial for developing targeted therapies and interventions. For microphthalmia, early genetic diagnosis could lead to improved management and genetic counseling. In the case of myopia, identifying high-risk individuals based on genetic profiles could enable early interventions to slow axial length progression.In conclusion, the genetic pathways underpinning eye size specification are complex and multifaceted. While significant progress has been made in identifying genes associated with microphthalmia and myopia, much remains to be discovered about the precise mechanisms regulating axial length. Future research should focus on elucidating the shared molecular pathways between microphthalmia and myopia, exploring gene-environment interactions, and developing targeted therapies to modulate eye growth. Such advancements will not only improve our understanding of these conditions but also pave the way for more effective treatments and preventive strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Anophthalmia and microphthalmia", "authors": "Verma, Amit S. and FitzPatrick, David R.", "journal": "Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases", "year": "2007", "volumes": "2", "first page": "47", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1186/1750-1172-2-47"}, {"title": "The impact of myopia and high myopia: report of the Joint World Health Organization–Brien Holden Vision Institute Global Scientific Meeting on Myopia", "authors": "Morgan, Ian G. and French, Amanda N. and Ashby, Regan S. and Guo, Xinxing and Ding, Xiaohu and He, Mingguang and Rose, Kathryn A.", "journal": "Progress in Retinal and Eye Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "65", "first page": "134", "last page": "149", "DOI": "10.1016/j.preteyeres.2017.09.001"}, {"title": "Clinical and genetic aspects of anophthalmia/microphthalmia", "authors": "Williamson, Kathleen A. and FitzPatrick, David R.", "journal": "American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "166C", "first page": "285", "last page": "306", "DOI": "10.1002/ajmg.c.31411"}, {"title": "Genome-wide association meta-analysis highlights light-induced signaling as a driver for refractive error", "authors": "Tedja, Milly S. and Wojciechowski, Robert and Hysi, Pirro G. and Eriksson, Nicholas and Furlotte, Nicholas A. and Verhoeven, Virginie J.M. and Iglesias, Adriana I. and Meester-Smoor, Magda A. and Tompson, Stuart W. and Fan, Qiao", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "51", "first page": "1407", "last page": "1416", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-019-0498-4"}, {"title": "Genome-wide meta-analyses of multiancestry cohorts identify multiple new susceptibility loci for refractive error and myopia", "authors": "Kiefer, Amy K. and Tung, Joyce Y. and Do, Chuong B. and Hinds, David A. and Mountain, Joanna L. and Francke, Uta and Eriksson, Nicholas", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "45", "first page": "314", "last page": "318", "DOI": "10.1038/ng.2554"}, {"title": "Vitamin A and retinoid signaling: genomic and nongenomic effects", "authors": "Cvekl, Ales and Wang, Wei-Lin", "journal": "Journal of Lipid Research", "year": "2009", "volumes": "50", "first page": "2064", "last page": "2068", "DOI": "10.1194/jlr.R900019-JLR200"}, {"title": "IMI – Report on Experimental Models of Emmetropization and Myopia", "authors": "Troilo, David and Smith, Earl L. and Nickla, Debora L. and Ashby, Regan and Tkatchenko, Andrei V. and Ostrin, Lisa A. and Gawne, Timothy J. and Pardue, Machelle T. and Summers, Jody A. and Kee, Chea-su", "journal": "Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "60", "first page": "M31", "last page": "M88", "DOI": "10.1167/iovs.18-25967"}, {"title": "Identification of novel mutations in the TGFBI gene in Korean patients with corneal dystrophies", "authors": "Hannon, Breedge M. and Fryer, Alan E. and Harding, Anne E. and Hughes, Anne E. and Bundey, Sarah and Poulton, Joanna and Karbani, Gulshan and Wallis, Gillian A. and Broadhead, David M. and Nevin, Norman C.", "journal": "Molecular Vision", "year": "2010", "volumes": "16", "first page": "2829", "last page": "2836", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Wnt signaling in eye organogenesis", "authors": "Fuhrmann, Sabine", "journal": "Organogenesis", "year": "2008", "volumes": "4", "first page": "60", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.4161/org.4.2.5850"}, {"title": "Genome-wide association meta-analysis of individuals of European ancestry identifies new loci explaining a substantial fraction of hair color variation and heritability", "authors": "Hysi, Pirro G. and Valdes, Ana M. and Liu, Fan and Furlotte, Nicholas A. and Evans, David M. and Bataille, Veronique and Visconti, Alessia and Hemani, Gibran and McMahon, George and Ring, Susan M. and Smith, George Davey", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "52", "first page": "951", "last page": "960", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-020-0684-4"}]}
