{"Literature Review": "The transition to green technologies is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable development. However, this transition also raises important questions about environmental justice and equity. This literature review examines the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on the disparities in access, potential exacerbation of inequalities, and strategies for ensuring a just transition.Disparities in access to green technologies are a significant concern, both between and within countries. Sovacool et al. (2019) highlight that access to clean energy technologies is often limited by socioeconomic factors, with low-income communities and developing nations facing greater barriers. This disparity is not only a matter of affordability but also relates to infrastructure availability and technical knowledge. For instance, Carley and Konisky (2020) found that rural and low-income areas in the United States often lack the necessary infrastructure for electric vehicle charging, potentially excluding these communities from the benefits of transportation electrification.The energy transition, if not carefully managed, risks exacerbating existing inequalities. Bouzarovski and Simcock (2017) argue that the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure may disproportionately burden those excluded from new technologies, potentially leading to a 'energy divide.' This concern is echoed by Jenkins et al. (2016), who emphasize the need for policy frameworks that ensure the benefits and costs of the energy transition are equitably distributed.The interconnected nature of green technologies across different sectors presents both challenges and opportunities for environmental justice. Ürge-Vorsatz et al. (2018) discuss the increasing interdependencies between buildings, power systems, and transportation in the context of decarbonization. They argue that integrated policy design is crucial to avoid unintended consequences and maximize co-benefits across sectors. Similarly, Geels et al. (2017) emphasize the importance of system-wide approaches to sustainability transitions, considering social, technical, and institutional dimensions.Access to enabling technologies, such as the Internet and digital payment systems, is increasingly recognized as a prerequisite for equitable adoption of green technologies. Klinsky et al. (2017) argue that the digital divide can exacerbate energy injustices, as access to information and smart energy management systems becomes more critical. This highlights the need for policies that address multiple forms of infrastructure access simultaneously.In addressing environmental justice concerns, there is growing emphasis on focusing on access to services rather than specific technologies. Mattioli et al. (2020) argue for a shift in transportation policy from promoting car ownership to ensuring equitable access to mobility services. This approach aligns with broader concepts of energy justice, as outlined by McCauley et al. (2019), who advocate for recognitional, procedural, and distributional justice in energy systems.The role of data in designing and evaluating equitable technology deployment strategies is increasingly recognized. Bouzarovski and Tirado Herrero (2017) demonstrate the value of high-resolution data in identifying energy poverty hotspots and tailoring interventions. Similarly, Sareen et al. (2020) argue for the importance of comprehensive data collection and analysis in ensuring accountability in energy transitions.Despite these challenges, green technologies also offer opportunities to address long-standing environmental injustices. Hernández and Siegel (2019) discuss how community solar projects can provide clean energy access to low-income households and renters who might otherwise be excluded from solar adoption. Similarly, Mulvaney (2019) explores how the transition to renewable energy can be leveraged to address historical injustices associated with fossil fuel extraction and use.In conclusion, while green technologies have the potential to contribute significantly to sustainable development and climate change mitigation, their implications for environmental justice are complex and multifaceted. Ensuring a just transition requires careful policy design, integrated approaches across sectors, attention to enabling infrastructure, and a focus on equitable access to services rather than specific technologies. As the transition progresses, continued research and high-resolution data will be crucial in identifying and addressing environmental justice concerns.", "References": [{"title": "Decarbonisation and its discontents: A critical energy justice perspective on four low-carbon transitions", "authors": "Benjamin K.
