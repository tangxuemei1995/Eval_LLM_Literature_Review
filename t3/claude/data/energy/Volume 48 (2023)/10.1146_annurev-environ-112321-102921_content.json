{"Literature Review": "The building sector plays a crucial role in supporting human activities and well-being while simultaneously contributing significantly to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As the world grapples with the urgent need to address climate change and achieve sustainability targets, the importance of modeling low energy demand (LED) futures for buildings has become increasingly apparent. This literature review aims to explore the current state of building sector models and identify research needs to better assess transformations toward LED futures.Building sector models have evolved as essential tools for decision support in developing strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions. These models range from subnational to global scales and incorporate various factors influencing building energy consumption. Kavgic et al. (2010) provide a comprehensive review of bottom-up building stock models, highlighting their strengths in capturing technological details and policy impacts. However, they also note limitations in representing socio-behavioral aspects and future uncertainties.The ability of current models to assess the transformations required for LED futures is limited by several factors. Hong et al. (2016) emphasize the importance of integrating occupant behavior into building energy models, as human factors significantly influence energy consumption patterns. Their work demonstrates that incorporating occupant behavior can lead to more accurate predictions of building energy use and help identify effective energy-saving strategies.Infrastructural interventions play a crucial role in achieving LED futures. Lucon et al. (2014) discuss the potential of urban planning and design in reducing building energy demand through strategies such as compact city development and mixed-use zoning. However, many current building sector models struggle to adequately represent these urban-scale interventions and their impacts on energy demand.Technological advancements are key drivers of energy efficiency in buildings. Mathew et al. (2015) review emerging technologies for building energy efficiency, including advanced envelope materials, smart windows, and innovative HVAC systems. While many models incorporate technological improvements, there is a need for more dynamic representation of technology diffusion and its impact on energy demand.The integration of megatrends such as digitalization, sharing economy, and circular economy into building sector models presents both opportunities and challenges. Creutzig et al. (2018) explore the potential of digitalization in reducing energy demand across various sectors, including buildings. They highlight the need for models to capture the complex interactions between digital technologies, user behavior, and energy consumption patterns.The sharing economy has the potential to significantly impact building energy demand through practices such as co-living and co-working. However, Chen et al. (2020) note that current models often struggle to capture the nuanced effects of these emerging trends on energy consumption patterns and building utilization rates.Circular economy principles, including material efficiency and waste reduction, are increasingly recognized as important factors in reducing the life-cycle energy demand of buildings. Pomponi and Moncaster (2017) review the application of circular economy concepts in the built environment, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive modeling approaches that consider the entire building life cycle.Decent living standards (DLS) represent an important consideration in modeling LED futures for buildings. Rao and Min (2018) propose a framework for defining and quantifying DLS, which includes adequate housing and thermal comfort. Incorporating DLS into building sector models is crucial for ensuring that energy demand reductions do not compromise human well-being and quality of life.To address the limitations of current models and better assess LED transformations in buildings, several research needs emerge. First, there is a need for improved integration of socio-behavioral factors, including occupant behavior, cultural norms, and lifestyle changes. Second, models should better represent urban-scale infrastructural interventions and their impacts on building energy demand. Third, more dynamic representation of technology diffusion and its interaction with other factors is required.Furthermore, future models should aim to capture the complex interactions between megatrends and building energy demand. This includes developing methods to represent the impacts of digitalization, sharing economy practices, and circular economy principles on building energy use patterns.Finally, incorporating decent living standards into building sector models is essential for ensuring that LED futures are compatible with human well-being and social equity goals. This requires developing metrics and methodologies to quantify and model the relationship between energy demand and quality of life.In conclusion, while building sector models have made significant progress in supporting decision-making for energy demand reduction, there remain critical gaps in their ability to assess transformations toward LED futures. Addressing these research needs will enhance the capacity of models to inform effective strategies for achieving sustainability targets in the building sector.", "References": [{"title": "A review of bottom-up building stock models for energy consumption in the residential sector", "authors": "Miroslava Kavgic, Anna Mavrogianni, Dejan Mumovic, Alex Summerfield, Zarko Stevanovic, Maja Djurovic-Petrovic", "journal": "Building and Environment", "year": "2010", "volumes": "45", "first page": "1683", "last page": "1697", "DOI": "10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.01.021"}, {"title": "Occupant behavior in buildings: A systematic review of the literature related to energy consumption and occupant behavior", "authors": "Tianzhen Hong, Sarah C.
