{"Literature Review": "The attribution of extreme weather events to climate change has emerged as a critical area of research in recent years, providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between human-induced climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena. This literature review aims to explore the current state of knowledge in this field, highlighting key methodologies, findings, and challenges.The concept of event attribution in climate science has gained significant traction over the past decade. Stott et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive overview of the development of event attribution methods, emphasizing the importance of this field in connecting scientific understanding with real-world experiences of extreme weather. Their work underscores the growing ability of scientists to quantify the influence of human-induced climate change on specific extreme events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts.One of the primary approaches in event attribution is the use of probabilistic methods. Otto et al. (2018) demonstrate how these methods can be applied to assess the changing likelihood of extreme events under different climate scenarios. Their study on the 2017 European heatwave showed that climate change had made such events at least twice as likely to occur. This probabilistic approach has become a cornerstone in attribution studies, providing a quantitative measure of climate change's impact on extreme events.However, the field of event attribution is not without its challenges and debates. Trenberth et al. (2015) argue for a shift in perspective, suggesting that all extreme weather events are now occurring in a climate system that has been fundamentally altered by human activities. This viewpoint emphasizes the need to consider the thermodynamic changes in the atmosphere when attributing extreme events, rather than focusing solely on statistical probabilities.The integration of event attribution findings into policy and decision-making processes has been a significant development. Sippel et al. (2020) discuss how attribution studies have informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, providing crucial evidence of the present-day impacts of climate change. This integration highlights the growing relevance of attribution science in shaping climate policy and adaptation strategies.An important aspect of event attribution is its application across different types of extreme events. While heatwaves have been extensively studied, other events pose unique challenges. For instance, Diffenbaugh et al. (2017) examine the attribution of drought events, highlighting the complexities involved in assessing slow-onset phenomena that are influenced by multiple factors beyond temperature changes.The geographical disparity in attribution studies is a growing concern in the scientific community. Parker et al. (2017) highlight the lack of attribution studies in many regions of the Global South, where the impacts of climate change are often most severe. This gap raises important ethical questions about the equitable distribution of scientific resources and the potential implications for climate justice and adaptation policies in vulnerable regions.Methodological advancements continue to shape the field of event attribution. van Oldenborgh et al. (2021) discuss the development of rapid attribution techniques, which allow for near real-time analysis of extreme events. These methods have proven particularly valuable in communicating the links between climate change and ongoing extreme weather events to the public and policymakers.The integration of climate model simulations with observational data has been crucial in advancing attribution studies. Kirchmeier-Young et al. (2019) demonstrate how this approach can be used to assess changes in the likelihood and intensity of extreme events, providing a more comprehensive understanding of climate change impacts.As the field of event attribution matures, new questions and challenges emerge. Philip et al. (2020) explore the concept of compound events, where multiple extreme weather phenomena occur simultaneously or in close succession. Their work highlights the need for more sophisticated attribution methods to capture the complexity of these interrelated events and their cumulative impacts.In conclusion, the attribution of extreme events to climate change has evolved into a robust and influential field of study. It has significantly enhanced our understanding of the tangible impacts of climate change and has become an essential tool in climate communication and policy-making. However, challenges remain, particularly in addressing geographical disparities in attribution studies and in developing methods to assess complex, compound events. As climate change continues to alter the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the field of event attribution will undoubtedly play an increasingly crucial role in shaping our response to this global challenge.", "References": [{"title": "Attribution of extreme weather and climate-related events", "authors": "Peter A.
