{"Literature Review": "The concept of 'Great Green Walls' has captured the imagination of policymakers and environmentalists for decades as a potential solution to combat desertification and environmental degradation in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the reality of these ambitious projects often falls short of expectations, revealing a complex interplay of ecological, social, and economic factors. This literature review examines the history, implementation, and outcomes of major green wall initiatives, with a focus on the peri-Saharan programs and China's Three Norths Shelterbelt Program.The idea of using tree plantations to halt desert expansion can be traced back to the early 20th century. Stebbing's proposal in the 1930s to create a 'green wall' across Africa to stop the Sahara's southward expansion is often cited as one of the earliest formal articulations of this concept (Stebbing, 1935). However, this approach was based on a misunderstanding of desertification processes, which are now known to be more complex and not solely driven by desert encroachment (Reynolds et al., 2007).Despite evolving scientific understanding, the allure of green walls persisted. In the 1970s, Algeria launched its 'Green Dam' project, aiming to create a forest belt across the country's arid regions. This initiative, while ambitious, faced numerous challenges. Benzyane (2009) reported that by the early 2000s, only about 10% of the planned area had been afforested, with low survival rates of planted trees due to harsh climatic conditions and inadequate maintenance.The Great Green Wall initiative in sub-Saharan Africa, launched in 2007, represents a more recent and expansive attempt at creating a transcontinental barrier of vegetation. However, O'Connor and Ford (2014) found that progress has been slow, with only a small fraction of the planned area afforested by the early 2010s. They also highlighted the initiative's shift from a narrow focus on tree planting to a more holistic approach encompassing sustainable land management practices.China's Three Norths Shelterbelt Program, initiated in 1978, is perhaps the most extensive afforestation effort to date. Covering an area of 4,069,000 km², the program aims to combat desertification, soil erosion, and sandstorms. While some positive outcomes have been reported, such as reduced wind erosion in certain areas (Wang et al., 2010), the program has also faced criticism. Cao et al. (2011) argued that the large-scale planting of non-native tree species in arid and semi-arid regions has led to unintended consequences, including soil desiccation and groundwater depletion.The ecological impacts of these green wall initiatives are mixed and context-dependent. While some studies have shown localized benefits in terms of reduced wind erosion and improved soil stability (Yao et al., 2014), others have highlighted negative impacts on soil moisture and water resources. Zhang et al. (2016) found that afforestation in China's arid regions led to significant decreases in soil moisture, potentially exacerbating water scarcity issues.The choice of tree species plays a crucial role in the success and sustainability of these projects. Many initiatives have relied on fast-growing, non-native species to achieve rapid results. However, this approach often leads to the creation of vulnerable monocultures. Li et al. (2012) reported increased susceptibility to pests and diseases in poplar plantations in northern China, highlighting the risks associated with low biodiversity in afforestation projects.The social impacts of green wall initiatives are equally complex. While some projects have created employment opportunities and provided resources such as fuelwood, others have led to resource enclosures that negatively impact local communities, particularly pastoralists. Benjaminsen and Hiernaux (2019) documented cases in the Sahel where afforestation projects restricted access to traditional grazing lands, exacerbating conflicts between farmers and herders.Water scarcity is another critical issue associated with large-scale afforestation in arid regions. Feng et al. (2016) found that extensive tree plantations in northern China led to significant reductions in streamflow, potentially compromising water availability for both human use and ecosystem functioning.In conclusion, while the concept of great green walls continues to captivate policymakers and the public, the scientific evidence suggests a more nuanced reality. These initiatives have shown limited success in halting desertification and often come with significant ecological and social trade-offs. Moving forward, a more holistic and context-specific approach to dryland management is needed, one that considers local ecological conditions, indigenous knowledge, and the diverse needs of local communities. Future research should focus on developing sustainable land management practices that balance environmental rehabilitation with social equity and economic development in arid and semi-arid regions.", "References": [{"title": "The Encroaching Sahara", "authors": "Edward Percy Stebbing", "journal": "The Geographical Journal", "year": "1935", "volumes": "85", "first page": "506", "last page": "519", "DOI": "10.2307/1785870"}, {"title": "Global Desertification: Building a Science for Dryland Development", "authors": "James F.
