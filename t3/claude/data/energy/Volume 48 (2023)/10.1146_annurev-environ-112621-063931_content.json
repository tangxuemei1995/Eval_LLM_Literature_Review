{"Literature Review": "The urgent need for urban decarbonization to mitigate climate change has become increasingly apparent in recent years. However, the complex interplay between zero-carbon pathways and their impacts on well-being, health, social equity, and climate resilience (WHER outcomes) remains an area of active research. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of these nexus linkages and identify key knowledge gaps in the pursuit of sustainable urban transitions. Urban areas are responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with estimates suggesting that cities account for 70% of CO2 emissions from energy use (Seto et al., 2014). As such, urban decarbonization strategies play a crucial role in achieving global climate goals. However, the implementation of these strategies must be carefully considered to ensure that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities or compromise other aspects of urban sustainability. The concept of urban metabolism provides a useful framework for understanding the flows of energy, materials, and waste within cities (Kennedy et al., 2011). By applying this framework to the study of urban decarbonization, researchers can better understand the complex interactions between various urban systems and their impacts on WHER outcomes. The transboundary urban metabolism framework presented in the abstract builds upon this concept by focusing on seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, offering a more comprehensive approach to analyzing urban sustainability. Health co-benefits of urban decarbonization strategies have been well-documented in the literature. For instance, a study by Woodcock et al. (2009) found that policies promoting active transportation and reducing car use in urban areas could lead to significant reductions in both greenhouse gas emissions and the burden of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, research by Markandya et al. (2018) demonstrated that the health benefits of air pollution reduction resulting from climate change mitigation policies could offset the costs of implementation in many regions. While the evidence for health co-benefits is strong, the impacts of decarbonization on well-being are less clear. Some studies suggest that green spaces and sustainable urban design can improve mental health and overall quality of life (van den Berg et al., 2015). However, the relationship between decarbonization strategies and broader measures of well-being, such as life satisfaction and social cohesion, requires further investigation. The impact of urban decarbonization on climate resilience remains uncertain. While some strategies, such as green infrastructure and sustainable water management, may enhance resilience to climate-related risks (Demuzere et al., 2014), others may inadvertently increase vulnerability. For example, densification policies aimed at reducing transportation emissions could potentially increase urban heat island effects if not carefully implemented (Heaviside et al., 2017). Perhaps the most challenging aspect of urban decarbonization is ensuring that these transitions advance social equity. The abstract rightly emphasizes the need for intentional design to address distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects of equity. Previous research has shown that low-income and marginalized communities often bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards and may have limited access to the benefits of sustainability initiatives (Anguelovski et al., 2016). To address these issues, policymakers and urban planners must actively involve diverse stakeholders in the decision-making process and consider the potential distributional impacts of decarbonization strategies. The development of a new urban nexus science, as proposed in the abstract, is crucial for advancing our understanding of the complex interactions between decarbonization strategies and WHER outcomes. This approach calls for the integration of fine-scale data across multiple sectors and scales, as well as the consideration of various climate risks. Such a comprehensive framework would enable more accurate assessments of the potential co-benefits and trade-offs associated with different urban decarbonization pathways. To support this new urban nexus science, there is a need for advanced modeling techniques that can capture the multisector, multiscale, and multioutcome nature of urban systems. Agent-based models and integrated assessment models have shown promise in this regard, allowing researchers to simulate complex urban dynamics and explore the potential impacts of various policy interventions (Creutzig et al., 2019). In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the linkages between urban decarbonization and WHER outcomes, substantial knowledge gaps remain. Future research should focus on developing more comprehensive datasets and modeling approaches to better capture the complex interactions within urban systems. Additionally, there is a need for empirical studies that evaluate the long-term impacts of decarbonization strategies on well-being, equity, and resilience. By addressing these knowledge gaps and advancing the field of urban nexus science, researchers and policymakers can work towards achieving zero-carbon urban transitions that simultaneously promote health, climate resilience, and social equity.", "References": [{"title": "Human Settlements, Infrastructure, and Spatial Planning", "authors": "Karen C.
