{"Literature Review": "Energy justice and equity have emerged as critical considerations in the field of energy policy and research, reflecting a growing awareness of the social and ethical dimensions of energy systems. This literature review explores the development, application, and challenges of metrics for decision-making in energy justice.The concept of energy justice has evolved significantly over the past decade, with scholars such as Jenkins et al. (2016) proposing a framework that encompasses three core tenets: distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice. Distributive justice focuses on the equitable distribution of energy resources and burdens, procedural justice emphasizes fair and inclusive decision-making processes, and recognition justice addresses the acknowledgment of marginalized communities and their specific energy needs.As the field of energy justice has matured, there has been an increasing emphasis on developing quantifiable metrics to assess and guide policy decisions. Sovacool et al. (2017) argue that such metrics are essential for translating abstract concepts of justice into actionable policy recommendations. However, the development of comprehensive and universally applicable metrics remains a significant challenge due to the complex and context-dependent nature of energy justice issues.One prominent area of focus in energy justice metrics is the assessment of energy poverty and vulnerability. Nussbaumer et al. (2012) introduced the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI), which combines indicators of energy access, quality, and affordability to provide a holistic measure of energy deprivation. This approach has been influential in shaping subsequent efforts to quantify energy poverty, particularly in developing countries.Building on this work, Bouzarovski and Petrova (2015) proposed a more nuanced understanding of energy vulnerability, emphasizing the dynamic and multifaceted nature of energy deprivation. Their framework incorporates factors such as energy efficiency, affordability, flexibility, and needs, providing a more comprehensive basis for metric development.In the context of developed countries, researchers have focused on metrics that capture the distributional impacts of energy policies and transitions. Chapman et al. (2019) developed a set of indicators to assess the equity implications of low-carbon energy transitions, including measures of energy affordability, access to clean energy technologies, and the distribution of environmental burdens.The concept of energy justice has also been extended to encompass broader socioeconomic considerations. Carley et al. (2018) propose metrics that capture the wealth creation potential of energy systems, including indicators of job creation, local economic benefits, and community ownership of energy resources. These metrics reflect a growing recognition of the role that energy systems play in shaping economic opportunities and community resilience.Life cycle approaches have emerged as a valuable tool for assessing the full range of justice implications associated with energy systems. Heffron et al. (2018) advocate for the use of life cycle justice metrics that consider the entire energy value chain, from resource extraction to waste management. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the distributional impacts of energy systems across different spatial and temporal scales.At the international level, efforts have been made to develop comparative metrics that allow for cross-country analysis of energy justice. Mundaca et al. (2016) propose a set of indicators for assessing energy justice in the context of low-carbon energy transitions, including measures of energy access, affordability, and environmental sustainability. These metrics facilitate comparisons between countries and regions, highlighting disparities and best practices in energy justice.Despite the progress made in developing energy justice metrics, significant challenges and limitations remain. One key issue is the tension between the need for standardized, comparable metrics and the recognition of context-specific justice concerns. Bouzarovski and Simcock (2017) argue that overly rigid metrics may fail to capture the nuanced and locally specific nature of energy injustices, potentially leading to misguided policy interventions.Another challenge lies in the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches to energy justice assessment. While quantitative metrics offer the advantage of comparability and ease of use in decision-making processes, they may fail to capture important qualitative aspects of justice, such as cultural values and community perceptions. Jenkins et al. (2020) advocate for mixed-method approaches that combine quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments to provide a more holistic understanding of energy justice issues.The dynamic nature of energy systems and justice concerns also poses challenges for metric development. As energy technologies and societal values evolve, metrics must be continually updated and refined to remain relevant. This requires ongoing engagement with affected communities and stakeholders to ensure that metrics reflect changing priorities and concerns.In conclusion, the development of metrics for decision-making in energy justice represents a crucial step towards operationalizing energy equity principles in policy and practice. While significant progress has been made in developing a diverse range of metrics addressing various aspects of energy justice, challenges remain in terms of comprehensiveness, context-sensitivity, and adaptability. Future research should focus on refining existing metrics, developing new indicators that capture emerging justice concerns, and exploring innovative approaches to integrating quantitative and qualitative assessments of energy justice.", "References": [{"title": "Conceptualizing energy justice: Towards a comprehensive framework", "authors": "Kirsten Jenkins, Darren McCauley, Raphael Heffron, Hannes Stephan, Robert Rehner", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "92", "first page": "168", "last page": "176", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2016.01.024"}, {"title": "New frontiers and conceptual frameworks for energy justice", "authors": "Benjamin K.
