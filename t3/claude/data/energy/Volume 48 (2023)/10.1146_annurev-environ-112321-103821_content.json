{"Literature Review": "Over the past three decades, climate mitigation policies have become increasingly prevalent as the global community has recognized the urgent need to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their impact on climate change. This literature review aims to synthesize the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these policies in reducing emissions, influencing emission drivers, and promoting low-carbon technologies.The 1990s marked the beginning of climate mitigation efforts, with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established in 1992 and the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997 (Gupta et al., 2007). However, it was not until the 2000s that a significant proliferation of mitigation policies occurred, initially in a few frontrunner countries and later spreading globally. This expansion of policy initiatives coincided with a growing body of scientific evidence on the anthropogenic causes of climate change and its potential consequences (IPCC, 2014).One of the primary goals of climate mitigation policies has been to reduce GHG emissions. Several studies have attempted to quantify the impact of these policies on emission levels. Roelfsema et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive analysis of national climate policies and found that they have contributed to reducing global emissions by several billion tons of CO2eq per year compared to a scenario without such policies. Similarly, Eskander and Fankhauser (2020) examined the effectiveness of climate legislation in 133 countries and concluded that the adoption of climate laws led to an average reduction in annual CO2 emissions of 0.78% in the first three years and 1.79% after longer periods.Energy intensity, a key driver of emissions, has also been influenced by mitigation policies. Ang et al. (2017) analyzed the impact of energy efficiency policies in 20 OECD countries and found that these policies contributed to a significant reduction in energy intensity over the period 2000-2015. The study estimated that without these policies, energy consumption would have been 12% higher in 2015.Land use changes, particularly deforestation, have been another important focus of mitigation efforts. Busch and Ferretti-Gallon (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 117 studies on deforestation drivers and found that protected areas and payment for ecosystem services programs were consistently associated with reduced deforestation rates. For instance, Brazil's efforts to combat deforestation in the Amazon through a combination of protected areas, law enforcement, and economic incentives led to a 70% reduction in deforestation rates between 2005 and 2013 (Nepstad et al., 2014).The promotion of low-carbon technologies has been a crucial component of climate mitigation strategies. Policies supporting renewable energy deployment have been particularly effective in driving down costs and increasing capacity. Creutzig et al. (2017) analyzed the growth of solar photovoltaics (PV) and found that supportive policies, such as feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards, played a significant role in the rapid cost reductions and capacity expansions observed in the sector. Similarly, Kavlak et al. (2018) attributed 60% of the cost decline in PV modules between 1980 and 2012 to policies that stimulated market growth and supported research and development.Despite these positive impacts, it is important to note that global GHG emissions have continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate in recent years. This highlights the need for stronger and more comprehensive mitigation efforts. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, represents a significant step forward in global climate action, with 196 countries committing to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC, 2015). However, current national commitments under the agreement are insufficient to meet this goal, emphasizing the urgency of enhancing mitigation ambitions (Rogelj et al., 2016).The effectiveness of different policy instruments has varied across contexts. Carbon pricing, including carbon taxes and emissions trading systems, has been widely advocated as a cost-effective approach to emissions reduction. Empirical evidence suggests that these instruments have had a measurable impact on emissions in many jurisdictions. For example, Murray and Rivers (2015) found that British Columbia's carbon tax led to a 5-15% reduction in provincial emissions since its implementation in 2008.Regulatory approaches, such as energy efficiency standards and renewable energy mandates, have also played a crucial role in driving emissions reductions and technological innovation. Gillingham et al. (2006) reviewed the impact of appliance standards in the United States and estimated that they reduced residential energy consumption by about 2.5% in 2000, with projected savings of 6.8% by 2020.In conclusion, the empirical literature provides strong evidence that climate mitigation policies have had a discernible impact on GHG emissions, emission drivers, and low-carbon technologies over the past three decades. However, the scale and pace of these impacts have been insufficient to fully address the challenge of climate change. As we move forward, it is crucial to strengthen and expand mitigation efforts, drawing on the lessons learned from successful policy interventions. Additionally, there is a pressing need for more rigorous policy monitoring, evaluation, and learning to enhance the effectiveness of future climate action and improve our ability to attribute observed impacts to specific policy measures.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change 2014: synthesis report", "authors": "Rajendra K.
