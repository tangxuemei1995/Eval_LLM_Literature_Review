{"Literature Review": "The global commitment to protect 30% of land and sea areas by 2030, known as the '30×30' initiative, represents a critical juncture in conservation efforts. This ambitious target coincides with the increasing recognition of climate change as a major driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem transformation. As we approach this milestone, it is crucial to examine the evolution of Climate Change-Integrated Conservation Strategies (CCICS) and their potential to shape future conservation practices.The origins of CCICS can be traced back to the early 2000s, with seminal papers by Hannah et al. (2002) and Araújo et al. (2004) laying the groundwork for integrating climate change considerations into conservation planning. These works emphasized the need to anticipate and adapt to the impacts of climate change on species distributions and ecosystem functions. The urgency of this approach was further underscored by Thomas et al. (2004), who provided the first comprehensive estimates of extinction risk due to climate change, highlighting the potential for massive biodiversity loss in the absence of effective conservation measures.As the field of climate change biology evolved, several key concepts emerged to guide conservation strategies. The 'velocity of climate change,' introduced by Loarie et al. (2009), quantified the speed at which species would need to migrate to keep pace with shifting climate conditions. This concept has since become instrumental in identifying areas where species are most vulnerable to climate change and in designing conservation corridors to facilitate movement.Another significant development in CCICS has been the concept of 'assisted migration' or 'managed relocation,' as discussed by McLachlan et al. (2007). This controversial approach involves actively moving species to new habitats where they are more likely to survive under changing climate conditions. While debates continue regarding its ethical and ecological implications, assisted migration has gained traction as a potential tool in the conservation toolkit, particularly for species with limited dispersal abilities.Regional modeling of biodiversity change has become increasingly sophisticated, allowing for more accurate predictions of species range shifts and ecosystem transformations. Franklin et al. (2013) demonstrated the value of integrating multiple modeling approaches to improve projections of species distributions under climate change scenarios. These advancements have enabled conservationists to identify priority areas for protection and restoration more effectively.The expansion of protected areas to accommodate species range movements has become a cornerstone of climate-smart conservation planning. Hole et al. (2009) proposed a framework for designing protected area networks that account for both current and future species distributions, emphasizing the importance of connectivity between protected areas. This approach has been widely adopted and is now considered essential in the implementation of the 30×30 initiative.Managing productive landscapes to facilitate species movements has also gained prominence in CCICS. Kremen and Merenlender (2018) highlighted the importance of working lands conservation, emphasizing the need to integrate biodiversity-friendly practices into agricultural and forestry systems. This approach recognizes that protected areas alone are insufficient to address the challenges posed by climate change and that a more holistic landscape-level strategy is required.Despite these advancements, there remain significant gaps in both the theory and practice of CCICS. One notable area that requires further attention is regional coordination of conservation efforts. While the importance of transboundary conservation has been recognized (Vasilijević et al., 2015), the implementation of coordinated strategies to manage species on the move across their entire range remains challenging. Improving both the theoretical framework and practical application of regional coordination is crucial for effective climate change adaptation in conservation.Another critical consideration for future CCICS is the potential for non-linear climate trajectories. Most conservation planning to date has focused on scenarios of continuous warming. However, as noted by Trisos et al. (2020), the failure to meet emissions reduction targets may necessitate overshooting temperature goals followed by rapid cooling. This 'double transition' scenario presents unique challenges for biodiversity conservation and requires novel approaches to ensure ecosystem resilience.As we move towards the 30×30 target, it is clear that CCICS must continue to evolve and adapt. The integration of emerging technologies, such as remote sensing and artificial intelligence, offers new opportunities for monitoring and predicting ecosystem changes (Pettorelli et al., 2014). Additionally, the incorporation of social and economic factors into conservation planning will be crucial for ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of conservation efforts in a changing climate (Ban et al., 2013).In conclusion, the development of Climate Change-Integrated Conservation Strategies over the past two decades has significantly enhanced our ability to protect biodiversity in the face of global change. As we approach the 30×30 milestone, it is essential to build upon these foundations, addressing key gaps in regional coordination and preparing for potential non-linear climate trajectories. By doing so, we can work towards a more resilient and adaptive approach to conservation that safeguards biodiversity for future generations.", "References": [{"title": "Protected area needs in a changing climate", "authors": "Lee Hannah, Guy F.
