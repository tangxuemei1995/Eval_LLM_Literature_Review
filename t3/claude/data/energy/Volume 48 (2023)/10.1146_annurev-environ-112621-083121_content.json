{"Literature Review": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation efforts. This literature review explores the current understanding of soils as carbon stores and sinks, focusing on expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of transitions in SOC dynamics.SOC is a key component of soil health and fertility, influencing various ecosystem services. The spatial distribution of SOC is influenced by multiple factors, including climate, soil type, land cover, and profile depth. Lal (2004) estimated that soils contain approximately 1500 Gt of organic carbon in the top 1 meter, which is more than twice the amount stored in the atmosphere. This highlights the significant potential of soils in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.Climate plays a vital role in SOC dynamics, with temperature and precipitation being primary drivers. Davidson and Janssens (2006) demonstrated that temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition varies across different soil types and carbon pools. This relationship is complex, as warming can accelerate both carbon input through increased plant productivity and carbon loss through enhanced decomposition.Land use and land cover changes have substantial impacts on SOC stocks. Guo and Gifford (2002) conducted a meta-analysis showing that land-use changes from native forests to croplands or pastures generally lead to SOC losses, while afforestation of croplands can increase SOC stocks. These findings emphasize the importance of land management practices in SOC conservation and enhancement.The vertical distribution of SOC within soil profiles is another crucial aspect. Jobbágy and Jackson (2000) found that the proportion of SOC stored in deeper soil layers varies across ecosystems and is influenced by vegetation type and climate. This highlights the need to consider the entire soil profile when assessing SOC stocks and potential for carbon sequestration.Process-level understanding of SOC dynamics has advanced significantly in recent years. The Century model, developed by Parton et al. (1987), has been widely used to simulate SOC dynamics across various ecosystems and management practices. More recently, the Millennial model proposed by Abramoff et al. (2018) incorporates microbial processes and mineral interactions, providing a more mechanistic representation of SOC dynamics.Root turnover and litter decomposition are key processes influencing SOC formation and stabilization. Rasse et al. (2005) demonstrated that root-derived carbon contributes more to stable SOC pools than aboveground litter, emphasizing the importance of belowground processes in carbon sequestration.The concept of SOC saturation, introduced by Six et al. (2002), suggests that soils have a finite capacity to store organic carbon. This has important implications for carbon sequestration potential and the effectiveness of management practices aimed at increasing SOC stocks.While the importance of SOC in climate change mitigation has been recognized in policy frameworks, the effectiveness of proposed measures remains debated. Smith et al. (2008) reviewed various management practices for enhancing SOC sequestration in agricultural soils, highlighting the potential and limitations of different approaches.Implementing SOC-enhancing practices requires consideration of socioeconomic factors and stakeholder engagement. Lal (2016) emphasized the need for aligning SOC management with broader sustainable development goals and providing incentives for farmers to adopt carbon-sequestering practices.The prospects for SOC transitions depend on various factors, including technological advancements, policy support, and societal awareness. Paustian et al. (2016) proposed a framework for scaling up SOC sequestration efforts, emphasizing the need for improved monitoring, reporting, and verification systems.In conclusion, while soils have significant potential as carbon stores and sinks, realizing this potential requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes, patterns, and socioeconomic factors. Future research should focus on refining process-level understanding, improving modeling approaches, and developing effective strategies for implementing SOC-enhancing practices at scale. Additionally, aligning SOC management with national carbon accounting systems and engaging stakeholders across the supply chain will be crucial for successful transitions towards enhanced soil carbon sequestration.", "References": [{"title": "Soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change", "authors": "Rattan Lal", "journal": "Geoderma", "year": "2004", "volumes": "123", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.01.032"}, {"title": "Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change", "authors": "Eric A.
