{"Literature Review": "The global transition to renewable energy sources is a critical component in addressing climate change and environmental challenges. This literature review examines the technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity generation worldwide, focusing on various technologies including solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy.Technical potential, defined as the maximum electricity production achievable with current technologies considering geographical and technical limitations, varies significantly across different renewable sources. Utility-scale solar PV, CSP, onshore wind, and offshore wind demonstrate the highest technical potentials, exceeding 100 PWh/year according to multiple studies (Deng et al., 2015; Dupont et al., 2020). This substantial potential is attributed to the widespread availability of solar and wind resources globally, as well as technological advancements in energy conversion efficiencies.Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) show promising technical potentials above 10 PWh/year (Zhou et al., 2015). While hydropower has been a well-established renewable energy source for decades, geothermal and OTEC technologies are still evolving, with ongoing research aimed at improving their efficiency and applicability in diverse geological settings.Rooftop solar PV, wave energy, and tidal energy exhibit technical potentials exceeding 1 PWh/year (Hoogwijk and Graus, 2008). The distributed nature of rooftop solar PV makes it an attractive option for urban and suburban areas, while wave and tidal energy technologies are still in early stages of development but show promise for coastal regions.Salinity gradient energy, although less prominent, demonstrates a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year (Alvarez-Silva et al., 2016). This emerging technology harnesses the energy from the mixing of freshwater and saltwater, offering potential applications in estuarine environments.It is important to note that the reported technical potentials for each energy resource vary significantly across studies, often spanning several orders of magnitude. This variability can be attributed to differences in methodologies, assumptions, and data sources used by researchers. For instance, assessments of solar and wind potentials may differ based on the spatial resolution of resource data, assumptions about land availability, and projected technological improvements (Dupont et al., 2020).Economic potential, which considers the cost of renewable resources in addition to technical feasibility, has been less extensively studied on a global scale. However, available literature suggests that the economic potential of renewables is higher than current and projected near-future electricity demand (Jacobson et al., 2017). This finding is particularly significant as it indicates that renewable energy sources could theoretically meet global electricity needs in a cost-effective manner.The economic viability of different renewable technologies varies depending on factors such as resource quality, technology costs, and local market conditions. Solar PV and onshore wind have seen dramatic cost reductions in recent years, making them increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources in many regions (IRENA, 2019). Offshore wind and CSP technologies, while currently more expensive, are expected to become more economically viable as technology improves and economies of scale are realized.Feasible potential, which takes into account societal and environmental constraints, has been the least studied aspect of renewable energy potential. This concept acknowledges that not all technically or economically viable renewable energy projects can be implemented due to factors such as land use conflicts, environmental impacts, and public acceptance (Enevoldsen and Jacobson, 2021). For example, the development of large-scale hydropower projects may be limited by concerns over ecosystem disruption and displacement of local communities.While the ranges of technical, economic, and feasible potentials provide valuable insights into the magnitude of available renewable energy sources, they may not fully capture the challenges associated with large-scale renewable energy portfolios. Integration of variable renewable sources like solar and wind into existing power grids requires careful planning and investment in energy storage and transmission infrastructure (Brown et al., 2018).Furthermore, the spatial and temporal variability of renewable resources necessitates a diversified approach to energy generation. Combining different renewable technologies can help to balance supply and demand, but also introduces complexity in system design and operation (Zappa and van den Broek, 2018).In conclusion, the literature review reveals substantial technical potential for renewable electricity generation across various technologies, with economic potential also appearing promising. However, the realization of this potential will depend on overcoming technological, economic, and societal challenges. Future research should focus on refining estimates of feasible potential and addressing the practical aspects of large-scale renewable energy deployment to support the global transition to a sustainable energy future.", "References": [{"title": "Global potential for wind-generated electricity", "authors": "Xi Lu, Michael B.
