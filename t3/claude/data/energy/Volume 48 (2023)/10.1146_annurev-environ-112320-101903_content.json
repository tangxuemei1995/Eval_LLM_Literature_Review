{"Literature Review": "Climate change poses significant risks to coastal critical infrastructure, with potentially far-reaching consequences for communities, economies, and ecosystems worldwide. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the impacts of climate change on coastal critical infrastructure and the strategies for enhancing resilience.Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their proximity to the sea and their high population densities. According to Neumann et al. (2015), approximately 40% of the world's population lives within 100 km of the coast, and this percentage is expected to increase in the coming decades. This concentration of people and assets in coastal zones amplifies the potential consequences of climate-related hazards.One of the primary threats to coastal critical infrastructure is sea level rise (SLR). Nicholls et al. (2018) project that global mean sea level could rise by 0.43-0.84 m by 2100 under a high emissions scenario. This rise in sea level can lead to increased coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion, all of which can damage or disrupt critical infrastructure systems. For instance, Dawson et al. (2016) found that SLR could significantly increase the risk of flooding for coastal transportation networks in the United Kingdom, potentially leading to widespread disruptions in mobility and economic activity.Storm surges and extreme weather events represent another major threat to coastal critical infrastructure. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones in many regions, exacerbating the risk of storm surge flooding (Knutson et al., 2020). These events can cause extensive damage to infrastructure systems, as demonstrated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused widespread power outages and transportation disruptions along the U.S. East Coast (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014).The interconnectedness of critical infrastructure systems adds another layer of complexity to the challenge of climate resilience. Pescaroli and Alexander (2018) highlight the potential for cascading failures across interdependent infrastructure networks, where the failure of one system can trigger a chain reaction affecting multiple other systems. For example, power outages caused by flooding can disrupt water treatment facilities, telecommunications networks, and healthcare services, amplifying the overall impact of the initial event.To address these challenges, there is a growing emphasis on developing climate-resilient infrastructure. Hallegatte et al. (2019) define climate-resilient infrastructure as systems that can withstand, adapt to, and rapidly recover from climate-related disruptions. This approach involves integrating climate change projections into infrastructure planning, design, and operation.One key strategy for enhancing infrastructure resilience is the use of nature-based solutions. Temmerman et al. (2013) demonstrate how the restoration and conservation of coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and salt marshes, can provide natural protection against storm surges and sea level rise while offering additional ecosystem services. These nature-based approaches can complement traditional engineered solutions and potentially reduce the overall costs of climate adaptation.Another important aspect of building resilience is the development of robust risk assessment and management frameworks. Aerts et al. (2018) propose a comprehensive approach to coastal risk assessment that integrates climate projections, socioeconomic scenarios, and infrastructure vulnerability assessments. Such frameworks can help decision-makers prioritize adaptation investments and develop effective long-term strategies for managing coastal risks.The role of governance and policy in promoting climate-resilient infrastructure cannot be overstated. Biesbroek et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of mainstreaming climate change adaptation into existing planning and decision-making processes across different levels of government. This integration can help ensure that climate resilience is considered in all aspects of infrastructure development and management.While significant progress has been made in understanding the risks to coastal critical infrastructure from climate change, several knowledge gaps remain. There is a need for more detailed, localized assessments of climate impacts on specific infrastructure systems, as well as improved understanding of the complex interactions between different infrastructure networks. Additionally, further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies and to develop innovative solutions for enhancing infrastructure resilience.In conclusion, the risks to coastal critical infrastructure from climate change are substantial and multifaceted. Addressing these challenges will require a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach that combines robust scientific understanding, innovative engineering solutions, and effective governance frameworks. As coastal communities continue to grow and climate impacts intensify, the development of climate-resilient infrastructure will be crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and safety of coastal regions worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "Future coastal population growth and exposure to sea-level rise and coastal flooding - A global assessment", "authors": "Barbara Neumann, Athanasios T.
