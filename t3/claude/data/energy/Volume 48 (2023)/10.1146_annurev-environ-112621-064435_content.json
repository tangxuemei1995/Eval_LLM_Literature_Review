{"Literature Review": "The management and disposal of nuclear waste, particularly highly radioactive waste such as spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste, has been a persistent challenge for the United States for over four decades. Despite significant investments of time and resources, the nation has yet to implement a successful long-term solution. This literature review examines the critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have impeded progress in nuclear waste management, with a focus on the implications for present and future reactors and their fuel cycles.The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 established the foundation for the US nuclear waste management program. As noted by Carter et al. (2013), this legislation mandated the development of a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Act also created the Nuclear Waste Fund to finance the program through fees collected from nuclear power generators. However, the implementation of the NWPA has faced numerous challenges over the years.One of the primary obstacles has been the site selection process for a geologic repository. The 1987 amendments to the NWPA designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the sole site for characterization as a potential repository. This decision, as discussed by Macfarlane and Ewing (2006), was heavily criticized for being politically motivated rather than based on scientific merit. The subsequent decades saw intense opposition from Nevada state officials and residents, leading to protracted legal battles and delays in the licensing process.The regulatory framework for nuclear waste disposal has also evolved significantly since the NWPA's enactment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have developed standards and regulations for the long-term performance of a geologic repository. However, as pointed out by Metlay (2013), these regulations have been subject to multiple revisions and legal challenges, contributing to uncertainty in the licensing process.The concept of retrievability has emerged as a crucial consideration in nuclear waste management. Pescatore et al. (2012) highlight the importance of maintaining the ability to retrieve waste from a repository, both for safety reasons and to allow for potential future reuse of the materials. This requirement adds complexity to repository design and operation, potentially impacting the long-term safety case.The Standard Contract, established by the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1983, governs the relationship between the federal government and nuclear utilities regarding spent fuel management. As discussed by Holt (2015), the government's failure to begin accepting spent fuel by the 1998 deadline specified in the contract has resulted in numerous lawsuits and billions of dollars in liability payments to utilities.The development of advanced reactor technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs), presents new challenges and opportunities for nuclear waste management. Ramana and Mian (2014) argue that these new designs may produce spent fuel with different characteristics than those from conventional reactors, potentially requiring modifications to existing disposal plans.The fuel cycles associated with advanced reactors also warrant consideration. Wigeland et al. (2014) examine various fuel cycle options and their implications for waste management, noting that some advanced concepts may reduce waste volumes or radiotoxicity but could also introduce new challenges in terms of waste forms and handling requirements.The current situation, where spent fuel remains stored at reactor sites awaiting permanent disposal, raises concerns about safety and security. Alvarez et al. (2003) highlight the risks associated with prolonged on-site storage, particularly in densely packed spent fuel pools, and advocate for expedited transfer to dry cask storage.International experiences in nuclear waste management offer valuable lessons for the US program. Metlay (2016) compares the approaches of various countries, noting that successful programs often involve transparent decision-making processes and meaningful stakeholder engagement.Looking forward, several key steps are required to address the challenges in the US nuclear waste management program. First, there is a need for a clear and consistent national policy that enjoys broad political support. This policy should be based on scientific and technical merit rather than political expediency. Second, the regulatory framework should be reviewed and updated to account for advances in scientific understanding and emerging technologies. Third, meaningful engagement with stakeholders, including affected communities, is crucial for building trust and acceptance of waste management solutions.In conclusion, the US legal and regulatory framework for nuclear waste management has evolved significantly over the past four decades, but persistent challenges remain. As the nation considers the deployment of advanced reactor technologies and associated fuel cycles, it is imperative to address these longstanding issues to ensure the safe and effective management of nuclear waste for present and future generations.", "References": [{"title": "Nuclear Waste Management in the United States: The Illusion of Safety", "authors": "Luther J.
