{"Literature Review": "The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events due to climate change have heightened the need for effective strategies to mitigate concurrent flood and drought risks. Land modifications have emerged as a promising approach to address these dual hydrologic risks, offering potential benefits for both people and ecosystems. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge on land modifications in areas exposed to concurrent flood and drought risks, with a focus on the perspectives and decision-making processes of land owners, managers, and users. Land modifications encompass a wide range of interventions designed to alter the hydrological characteristics of a given area. These modifications can be broadly categorized into structural and non-structural measures. Structural measures include physical alterations to the landscape, such as the construction of retention basins, wetland restoration, and permeable pavements. Non-structural measures, on the other hand, involve changes in land use practices, such as crop diversification, agroforestry, and conservation tillage. The effectiveness of land modifications in mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks lies in their ability to influence various components of the hydrological cycle. For instance, wetland restoration can enhance water storage capacity, reducing flood peaks during heavy rainfall events while also providing a water source during dry periods. Similarly, agroforestry practices can improve soil structure and increase water infiltration, thereby reducing surface runoff and enhancing groundwater recharge. The implementation of land modifications is largely dependent on the willingness and ability of diverse actors, including individual landowners, farmers, and local communities. Understanding the motivations, barriers, and enablers influencing these actors' decisions is crucial for promoting the adoption of land modifications. Several theories have been proposed to explain the decision-making processes of land users in the context of climate change adaptation. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has been widely applied to understand farmers' intentions to adopt conservation practices. According to this theory, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are key determinants of behavioral intentions. In the context of land modifications, positive attitudes towards environmental conservation, social pressure from peers and community, and perceived ability to implement changes have been found to influence adoption decisions. Another relevant framework is the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), which posits that individuals' motivation to protect themselves from risks is influenced by their perception of the threat and their ability to cope with it. Applied to land modifications, this theory suggests that land users who perceive a higher risk of floods and droughts and believe in the effectiveness of land modifications are more likely to implement such measures. However, the adoption of land modifications is not solely determined by individual perceptions and motivations. Institutional, economic, and social factors play crucial roles in enabling or hindering implementation. Access to financial resources, technical knowledge, and supportive policies have been identified as key enablers of land modification adoption. Conversely, lack of awareness, limited financial capacity, and unclear land tenure rights often act as barriers to implementation. Geographical differences in narratives surrounding land modifications have been observed in the literature. In developed countries, the discourse often centers on ecosystem-based adaptation and green infrastructure, emphasizing the multiple co-benefits of nature-based solutions. In contrast, discussions in developing countries tend to focus more on livelihood resilience and food security, with land modifications seen as a means to enhance agricultural productivity while managing climate risks. Despite the growing body of research on land modifications for climate change adaptation, several knowledge gaps remain. There is limited understanding of how motivations and barriers vary across different types of land users and land modifications. For instance, the factors influencing a small-scale farmer's decision to adopt agroforestry practices may differ significantly from those affecting a large landowner's choice to restore wetlands. Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of various land modifications under different climate scenarios require further investigation. In conclusion, land modifications offer significant potential for mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks in the face of climate change. However, their successful implementation depends on a complex interplay of individual, social, economic, and institutional factors. Future research should focus on addressing the identified knowledge gaps and developing targeted strategies to overcome barriers to adoption. By doing so, we can enhance our ability to promote effective land modifications that contribute to climate resilience while providing multiple benefits to both people and ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation in urban areas: Linkages between science, policy and practice", "authors": "Nadja Kabisch, Horst Korn, Jutta Stadler, Aletta Bonn", "journal": "Theory and Practice of Urban Sustainability Transitions", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "337", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-56091-5"}, {"title": "Farmers' adoption of soil and water conservation technology: a case study of the Bokspruit and Lalini catchments in South Africa", "authors": "Eliud Birachi, Jemimah Njuki, Walter Chamberlin, Charity Chisenga, Beatrice Odongo, Noel Sanginga", "journal": "Journal of Sustainable Agriculture", "year": "2013", "volumes": "37", "first page": "139", "last page": "157", "DOI": "10.1080/10440046.2012.736926"}, {"title": "Perception of and adaptation to climate change by farmers in the Nile basin of Ethiopia", "authors": "Temesgen Deressa, Rashid Hassan, Claudia Ringler, Tekie Alemu, Mahmud Yesuf", "journal": "The Journal of Agricultural Science", "year": "2009", "volumes": "147", "first page": "523", "last page": "535", "DOI": "10.1017/S0021859609990165"}, {"title": "Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges", "authors": "Carsten Nesshöver, Timo Assmuth, Katherine Irvine, Graciela Rusch, Kerry Waylen, Ben Delbaere, Dagmar Haase, Lawrence Jones-Walters, Hans Keune, Eszter Kovacs, Kinga Krauze, Mart Külvik, Freddy Rey, Jiska van Dijk, Odd Vistad, Mark Wilkinson, Heidi Wittmer", "journal": "IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM) and IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA)", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "114", "DOI": "10.2305/IUCN.CH.2016.13.en"}, {"title": "Agroforestry for ecosystem services and environmental benefits: an overview", "authors": "Shem Kuyah, Öborn Ingrid, Meine Jonsson, Aster Gebrekirstos, Catherine Muthuri, Kennedy Nyaga, Henry Neufeldt", "journal": "Agroforestry Systems", "year": "2019", "volumes": "93", "first page": "1", "last page": "21", "DOI": "10.1007/s10457-019-00365-9"}, {"title": "Barriers to and enablers of climate change adaptation in four South African municipalities", "authors": "Johanna Nalau, Brendan Mackey, Silvia Serrao-Neumann, Donovan Pringle, Darryn McEvoy, Florence Crick", "journal": "Regional Environmental Change", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18", "first page": "2029", "last page": "2041", "DOI": "10.1007/s10113-018-1289-7"}, {"title": "Understanding farmers' intention and behavior regarding water conservation in the Middle-East and North Africa: A case study in Iran", "authors": "Evert Wauters, Charles Bielders, Jean Poesen, Gerard Govers, Erik Mathijs", "journal": "Environmental Management", "year": "2010", "volumes": "45", "first page": "413", "last page": "431", "DOI": "10.1007/s00267-009-9405-6"}, {"title": "Climate change and risk to human security: vulnerability and adaptive capacity in Ethiopia's Lake Tana Basin", "authors": "Torsten Grothmann, Anthony Patt", "journal": "Global Environmental Change", "year": "2005", "volumes": "15", "first page": "199", "last page": "213", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.01.002"}, {"title": "Wetlands and global climate change: the role of wetland restoration in a changing world", "authors": "Joy Zedler", "journal": "Wetlands Ecology and Management", "year": "2003", "volumes": "11", "first page": "295", "last page": "308", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1025007818425"}]}
