{"Literature Review": "Environmental decision-making has become increasingly complex in recent years, particularly in the face of growing polarization within societies worldwide. This literature review examines the impact of polarization on environmental decision-making processes and explores potential strategies to mitigate its negative consequences.Polarization is a multifaceted phenomenon that extends beyond mere differences in opinion. It involves the divergence of groups in both actual and perceived differences in viewpoints, often accompanied by negative attitudes towards opposing groups (McCright et al., 2014). In the context of environmental issues, polarization can significantly hinder the collaborative efforts required to address collective action problems effectively.The extent of polarization among citizens, particularly regarding environmental issues, has been a subject of debate. Contrary to popular belief, some studies suggest that the current situation may not be as severe as often portrayed in media and public discourse. For instance, Druckman and McGrath (2019) found that while there is evidence of polarization on certain environmental topics, such as climate change, the overall public opinion on many environmental issues remains relatively stable and less polarized than commonly assumed.However, the dynamics of polarization are complex and subject to rapid changes due to the coevolution of individual views, network interactions, and social media influence. Bail et al. (2018) demonstrated that exposure to opposing viewpoints on social media can sometimes increase polarization rather than reduce it, highlighting the intricate nature of opinion formation in the digital age.Climate change, in particular, has emerged as a highly polarized environmental issue in many countries. McCright and Dunlap (2011) observed that in the United States, political ideology and party affiliation have become strong predictors of climate change beliefs and policy preferences. This polarization can impede the implementation of effective climate policies and hinder international cooperation on global environmental challenges.The impact of polarization on environmental decision-making is multifaceted. Firstly, it can lead to gridlock in policy-making processes, as opposing groups become less willing to compromise or find common ground (Javeline, 2014). Secondly, polarization can undermine public trust in scientific institutions and expert knowledge, which are crucial for informed environmental decision-making (Hmielowski et al., 2014). Lastly, it can exacerbate the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to environmental issues, further complicating efforts to build consensus and implement evidence-based policies (van der Linden et al., 2017).Despite these challenges, research has identified several promising strategies for preventing or reducing the negative consequences of polarization in environmental decision-making. One approach involves framing environmental issues in ways that resonate with diverse value systems and ideological perspectives. Feinberg and Willer (2013) found that reframing environmental messages in terms of moral values associated with different political orientations can increase their persuasiveness across ideological divides.Another effective strategy is to focus on local and tangible environmental issues that directly affect communities. Howe et al. (2015) demonstrated that emphasizing local impacts of climate change can increase public engagement and reduce polarization by making the issue more personally relevant and less abstract.Deliberative democracy approaches, such as citizens' assemblies and participatory budgeting, have also shown promise in bridging divides and fostering constructive dialogue on environmental issues. Fishkin et al. (2018) found that deliberative processes can lead to more informed and less polarized opinions on complex policy issues, including environmental challenges.Education and science communication play crucial roles in addressing polarization. Enhancing scientific literacy and critical thinking skills can help individuals better evaluate environmental information and resist misinformation (Drummond and Fischhoff, 2017). Additionally, improving the communication of scientific uncertainty and consensus can increase public trust in environmental science and reduce polarization on contentious issues (van der Linden et al., 2015).Lastly, fostering intergroup contact and collaboration on shared environmental goals can help reduce negative attitudes between opposing groups and promote more constructive dialogue. Pearson et al. (2018) found that emphasizing common environmental values and shared local identities can help bridge ideological divides and facilitate cooperation on environmental initiatives.In conclusion, while polarization poses significant challenges to environmental decision-making, research suggests that there are effective interventions available to mitigate its negative impacts. By employing a combination of strategies, including reframing issues, focusing on local impacts, promoting deliberative processes, enhancing science communication, and fostering intergroup collaboration, it may be possible to create more inclusive and effective environmental decision-making processes in the face of societal polarization.", "References": [{"title": "The polarizing impact of science literacy and numeracy on perceived climate change risks", "authors": "Dan M.
