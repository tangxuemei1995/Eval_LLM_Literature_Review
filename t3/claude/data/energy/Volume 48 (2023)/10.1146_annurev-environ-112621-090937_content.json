{"Literature Review": "Fungi represent a vast and diverse kingdom of life, playing crucial roles in ecosystems worldwide and significantly impacting human activities. Despite their importance, our understanding of fungal diversity, distribution, and conservation remains limited. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge and highlights key areas for future research in fungal biodiversity.Fungal diversity has been a subject of intense debate among mycologists. Early estimates suggested the existence of 1.5 million fungal species (Hawksworth, 1991). However, recent studies employing advanced molecular techniques and environmental sampling methods have led to revised estimates. Tedersoo et al. (2014) proposed a global fungal diversity of 3.8 million species based on high-throughput sequencing data from soil samples. In contrast, Hawksworth and Lücking (2017) suggested a more conservative estimate of 2.2 to 3.8 million species. The current consensus, as presented in our study, places the estimate at 2-3 million species, with a best estimate of 2.5 million.The vast majority of fungal species remain undescribed, with only about 150,000 species formally named and classified (Kirk et al., 2008). This knowledge gap presents a significant challenge for biodiversity research and conservation efforts. To address this issue, there is a growing movement to recognize species known only from DNA data, as proposed by Lücking et al. (2020). This approach, while controversial, could significantly accelerate the process of documenting fungal diversity.Understanding the global distribution of fungi is crucial for biodiversity research and conservation planning. Recent studies have shed light on global patterns of fungal diversity. Tedersoo et al. (2014) found that fungal diversity is highest in temperate regions, contrary to the latitudinal diversity gradient observed in many other taxonomic groups. However, Větrovský et al. (2019) suggested that tropical regions may harbor higher fungal diversity when considering the ratio of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to plant species.Our updated global map of fungal richness highlights both tropical and temperate ecoregions as hotspots of fungal diversity. This finding underscores the importance of considering multiple metrics when assessing biodiversity patterns. The fungus:plant ratio, as proposed by Hawksworth (1991) and refined by Hawksworth and Lücking (2017), remains a valuable tool for estimating fungal diversity in understudied regions.Conservation of fungi has historically been neglected compared to other taxonomic groups. This oversight is particularly concerning given the critical ecological roles fungi play and their potential vulnerability to environmental changes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, a global standard for assessing species extinction risk, included only 56 fungal species as of 2015 (Dahlberg and Mueller, 2011). Recent efforts have increased this number, but fungi remain severely underrepresented.To address this gap, we call for increased Red List assessments of fungal species. This process requires not only more extensive sampling and taxonomic work but also the development of appropriate criteria for assessing fungal species. Traditional conservation metrics designed for animals and plants may not always be suitable for fungi, given their unique life histories and ecological roles (Dahlberg et al., 2010).In situ conservation strategies for fungi are crucial but challenging due to the cryptic nature of many species. Protected area networks designed primarily for plants and animals may not adequately capture fungal diversity. Therefore, there is a need for fungal-specific conservation planning. This could involve identifying and protecting areas of high fungal endemism or diversity, as well as considering fungal communities in ecosystem management plans (Heilmann-Clausen et al., 2015).Ex situ conservation approaches, such as culture collections and spore banks, offer complementary strategies for fungal conservation. These methods are particularly valuable for preserving rare or threatened species and for maintaining genetic diversity. However, many fungal species are difficult or impossible to cultivate, highlighting the need for advanced preservation techniques and continued in situ conservation efforts (Griffith et al., 2020).As we push the frontiers of biodiversity research, fungi emerge as a critical yet understudied component of global biodiversity. The challenges in estimating fungal diversity, mapping their distribution, and ensuring their conservation are substantial but not insurmountable. Large-scale sampling campaigns, coupled with advanced molecular techniques and improved data sharing, offer promising avenues for advancing our understanding of fungal biodiversity.In conclusion, fungi represent the next frontier in biodiversity research. Their vast diversity, complex distribution patterns, and critical ecological roles make them both challenging and fascinating subjects of study. By addressing the knowledge gaps in fungal diversity, distribution, and conservation, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of global biodiversity and improve our ability to manage and protect ecosystems in the face of global change.", "References": [{"title": "Fungal biodiversity: what do we know?
