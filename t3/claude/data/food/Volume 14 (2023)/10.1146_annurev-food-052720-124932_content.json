{"Literature Review": "Meat consumption has been a significant part of human diet for millennia, providing essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals. However, the processing and storage of meat can lead to various molecular changes in its proteins, which can significantly impact its quality and nutritional value. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of these molecular changes and their consequences on meat quality and human health.Protein oxidation is one of the primary molecular changes that occur during meat processing and storage. Lund et al. (2011) reported that protein oxidation can lead to the formation of carbonyl compounds, which can alter the structure and functionality of meat proteins. These changes can result in decreased water-holding capacity, tenderness, and overall sensory quality of meat products. Furthermore, Estévez (2011) found that protein oxidation can lead to the loss of essential amino acids, potentially reducing the nutritional value of meat.The Maillard reaction, a complex series of chemical reactions between reducing sugars and amino acids, is another significant molecular change that occurs during meat processing, particularly during cooking. According to Tamanna and Mahmood (2015), while the Maillard reaction contributes to the desirable flavor and color of cooked meat, it can also lead to the formation of potentially harmful compounds such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These AGEs have been associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.Protein cross-linking is another molecular change that can occur during meat processing and storage. Xiong (2000) demonstrated that protein cross-linking can lead to decreased protein solubility and digestibility, potentially reducing the bioavailability of meat proteins. This process can be accelerated by various factors, including heat treatment, oxidative stress, and the presence of certain additives used in meat processing.The impact of these molecular changes on the nutritional value of meat is a subject of ongoing research. Bax et al. (2013) found that the digestibility of meat proteins can be affected by processing methods, with some techniques leading to improved digestibility while others may decrease it. For instance, mild heat treatment can increase protein digestibility by denaturing proteins and making them more accessible to digestive enzymes. However, excessive heat treatment can lead to the formation of protein aggregates that are resistant to digestion.The bioavailability of meat proteins is another crucial aspect affected by molecular changes during processing. Rémond et al. (2007) reported that the rate of protein digestion and absorption can be influenced by the structural changes induced by processing. For example, the formation of protein-lipid complexes during cooking can slow down protein digestion, potentially affecting the postprandial protein anabolism.While meat remains an excellent source of high-quality protein, there are potential health risks associated with high meat intake, particularly processed meats. Micha et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, finding that processed meat consumption was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus. These risks may be partly attributed to the molecular changes that occur during meat processing, such as the formation of nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.To mitigate these risks and preserve the nutritional quality of meat, various preventive strategies have been explored. Zhang et al. (2017) investigated the use of natural antioxidants, such as plant extracts and essential oils, to inhibit protein oxidation in meat products. Their findings suggested that these natural compounds could effectively reduce oxidative changes and preserve the quality of meat during processing and storage.Another approach to maintaining meat quality and nutritional value is through modified atmosphere packaging. McMillin (2008) reviewed various packaging technologies and their effects on meat quality, concluding that appropriate packaging methods can significantly extend shelf life and preserve the nutritional properties of meat products.In conclusion, the molecular changes of meat proteins during processing have significant implications for both meat quality and nutritional value. While some changes can enhance desirable sensory attributes, others may lead to decreased nutritional value and potential health risks. Understanding these molecular changes is crucial for developing improved processing techniques and preventive strategies to ensure the production of high-quality, nutritious meat products. Future research should focus on optimizing processing methods to minimize detrimental changes while maintaining or enhancing the beneficial aspects of meat consumption.", "References": [{"title": "Protein oxidation in muscle foods: A review", "authors": "Marianne N.
