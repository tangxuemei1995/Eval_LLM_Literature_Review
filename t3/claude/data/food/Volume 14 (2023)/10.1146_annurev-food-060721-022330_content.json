{"Literature Review": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) surfaces have emerged as a promising solution to combat bacterial contamination in various industries, including food processing and packaging. These surfaces utilize physical mechanisms to inactivate bacteria, offering a biocide-free alternative to traditional antimicrobial approaches. This literature review aims to explore the mechanisms, nanofabrication techniques, and potential applications of MB surfaces in the food industry.The concept of MB surfaces is rooted in biomimicry, drawing inspiration from natural structures such as cicada wings and dragonfly wings. Ivanova et al. (2012) first reported the bactericidal properties of cicada wings, demonstrating their ability to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells through physical contact. This discovery sparked interest in developing synthetic surfaces with similar properties, leading to extensive research in the field of MB surfaces.The primary mechanism of action for MB surfaces involves the physical rupture of bacterial cell membranes upon contact with nanoscale surface features. Linklater et al. (2017) proposed that the bactericidal effect is due to the stretching and subsequent rupture of the bacterial cell envelope when it settles on the nanopattern. The researchers found that the effectiveness of MB surfaces depends on various factors, including the height, spacing, and aspect ratio of the nanostructures.Further investigations by Jenkins et al. (2020) revealed that the bactericidal efficiency of MB surfaces is influenced by the mechanical properties of both the surface and the bacterial cells. They demonstrated that stiffer nanostructures were more effective in rupturing bacterial membranes, while softer materials showed reduced bactericidal activity. This finding highlights the importance of material selection in designing effective MB surfaces for food-related applications.Nanofabrication techniques play a crucial role in the development of MB surfaces. Jaggessar et al. (2018) reviewed various methods for creating nanopatterns, including lithography, etching, and self-assembly processes. Among these, reactive ion etching (RIE) has emerged as a popular technique due to its ability to create high-aspect-ratio nanostructures on a variety of substrates. However, the scalability and cost-effectiveness of these methods remain challenges for widespread industrial adoption.To address these challenges, researchers have explored more economical and scalable fabrication approaches. For instance, Bhadra et al. (2015) developed a simple and cost-effective method to create MB surfaces using a hydrothermal process. This technique allows for the growth of nanostructures on various materials, including stainless steel, which is commonly used in food processing equipment.The potential applications of MB surfaces in the food industry are vast. Feng et al. (2020) investigated the use of MB surfaces in food packaging materials, demonstrating their ability to reduce bacterial contamination and extend the shelf life of perishable foods. The researchers found that MB-treated packaging materials significantly reduced the growth of foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes, highlighting the potential of these surfaces in improving food safety.In food processing environments, MB surfaces could be applied to equipment and work surfaces to prevent biofilm formation and reduce the risk of cross-contamination. Hasan et al. (2018) demonstrated the effectiveness of MB surfaces in preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on stainless steel surfaces, which are commonly used in food processing facilities. This application could potentially reduce the need for harsh chemical cleaners and sanitizers, leading to more sustainable and environmentally friendly food production practices.Despite the promising results, several challenges need to be addressed before MB surfaces can be widely adopted in the food industry. Durability is a key concern, as the nanostructures must withstand the harsh conditions often encountered in food processing environments, including high temperatures, mechanical stress, and exposure to cleaning agents. Tripathy et al. (2017) investigated the durability of MB surfaces under various conditions and found that some nanopatterns were susceptible to degradation over time, highlighting the need for more robust designs.Another challenge is the potential for MB surfaces to affect the sensory properties of food products. While the nanoscale features are unlikely to directly impact taste or texture, there is a need for comprehensive studies to ensure that these surfaces do not inadvertently alter food quality or introduce undesirable compounds into the food supply chain.In conclusion, MB surfaces offer a promising approach to combating bacterial contamination in the food industry. The biocide-free nature of these surfaces addresses concerns about antimicrobial resistance and chemical residues in food products. However, further research is needed to optimize the design and fabrication of MB surfaces for specific food-related applications, improve their durability, and ensure their safety and efficacy in real-world conditions. As the field continues to advance, MB surfaces have the potential to revolutionize food safety practices and contribute to the development of more sustainable food processing and packaging technologies.", "References": [{"title": "Natural bactericidal surfaces: mechanical rupture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells by cicada wings", "authors": "Elena P.
