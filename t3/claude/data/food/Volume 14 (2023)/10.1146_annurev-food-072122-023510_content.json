{"Literature Review": "Starch, a ubiquitous and renewable biopolymer, plays a crucial role in human nutrition and serves as a vital raw material for the food industry. However, native starches often exhibit limitations in industrial applications, necessitating structural modifications to enhance their functionality. In recent years, enzymatic approaches for structuring starch have gained significant attention due to their environmentally friendly nature and ability to produce clean-label starches with improved behavioral characteristics. The molecular structure of starch, primarily composed of amylose and amylopectin, significantly influences its physicochemical properties and functionality. Amylose, a linear polymer of α-1,4-linked glucose units, contributes to gel formation and retrogradation, while amylopectin, a highly branched polymer with α-1,6 linkages, affects swelling and pasting properties. Understanding these structure-function relationships is crucial for developing targeted enzymatic modification strategies. Enzymatic modification of starch offers several advantages over traditional chemical methods, including higher specificity, milder reaction conditions, and reduced formation of undesirable by-products. Glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases are two main classes of enzymes employed in starch structuring. These enzymes can alter the molecular structure of starch through various mechanisms, such as hydrolysis, transglycosylation, and branching, resulting in starches with tailored functionalities. Branching enzymes (BEs) have emerged as powerful tools for modifying starch structure. These enzymes catalyze the formation of α-1,6 branch points by cleaving α-1,4 linkages and transferring the cleaved oligosaccharides to form new branches. The action of BEs can significantly alter the branching pattern and chain length distribution of amylopectin, leading to changes in starch properties such as gelatinization temperature, viscosity, and retrogradation behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of BEs in producing slowly digestible and resistant starches, which have applications in functional foods and as dietary fiber sources. Amylomaltases, also known as 4-α-glucanotransferases, have gained attention for their ability to modify starch structure through intramolecular transglycosylation reactions. These enzymes can rearrange the α-1,4 linkages within starch molecules, leading to changes in chain length distribution and branching patterns. Amylomaltase-treated starches have shown improved freeze-thaw stability and reduced retrogradation, making them suitable for various food applications, including frozen foods and bakery products. The discovery of novel starch-active enzymes has expanded the toolbox for enzymatic starch modification. GH70 α-transglycosylases, originally found in lactic acid bacteria, have shown remarkable potential in producing unique starch structures. These enzymes can catalyze the formation of α-1,6 linkages using maltodextrins as substrates, resulting in highly branched α-glucans with distinct properties. The products of GH70 α-transglycosylases have potential applications as prebiotics and fat replacers in food formulations. Amylosucrases represent another class of enzymes with promising applications in starch modification. These enzymes catalyze the synthesis of α-1,4-linked glucans using sucrose as a substrate, allowing for the production of amylose-like polymers with controlled molecular weight and branching degree. Amylosucrase-modified starches have shown improved gelation properties and resistance to enzymatic digestion, making them suitable for use in functional foods and as fat replacers. Maltogenic amylases, cyclomaltodextrinases, and neopullulanases belong to a group of enzymes known as maltogenic α-amylases. These enzymes exhibit both hydrolytic and transglycosylation activities, allowing for the production of various maltooligosaccharides and cyclic dextrins. The products of these enzymes have found applications in the food industry as sweeteners, bulking agents, and texture modifiers. The development of multifunctional starch-active enzymes has opened up new possibilities for starch modification. These enzymes combine multiple catalytic activities, such as hydrolysis and transglycosylation, in a single protein, allowing for more efficient and controlled modification of starch structure. For example, engineered chimeric enzymes combining the catalytic domains of different starch-active enzymes have been developed to produce starches with unique properties. Recent advances in protein engineering and directed evolution techniques have enabled the development of enzymes with improved catalytic properties and substrate specificities. These engineered enzymes offer greater control over the modification process and allow for the production of starches with tailored functionalities. For instance, engineered branching enzymes with altered chain transfer preferences have been used to produce starches with specific branch chain length distributions, resulting in improved functional properties. The application of enzymatically modified starches extends beyond the food industry. In the pharmaceutical sector, enzymatically produced resistant starches have shown potential as excipients for controlled drug delivery systems. In the paper and textile industries, modified starches with improved film-forming and adhesive properties have found applications as coating and sizing agents. As research in this field continues to advance, there is a growing need for a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships of enzymatically modified starches. This knowledge will be crucial for developing targeted modification strategies and predicting the functional properties of the resulting starches. Additionally, the development of in situ enzymatic modification techniques and continuous processing methods will be essential for scaling up these processes for industrial applications. In conclusion, enzymatic approaches for structuring starch offer a promising avenue for producing clean-label starches with improved functionalities. The diverse range of starch-active enzymes available, coupled with advances in protein engineering and process optimization, provides a powerful toolkit for tailoring starch properties to meet specific industrial needs. As our understanding of enzyme-starch interactions continues to grow, we can expect to see the development of novel starch-based materials with enhanced functionalities and expanded applications across various industries.", "References": [{"title": "Structural features of starch granules II: Morphological and structural characterization of B-type barley starch granules", "authors": "Eric Bertoft", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2017", "volumes": "168", "first page": "292", "last page": "300", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.03.053"}, {"title": "Starch-acting enzymes and their applications", "authors": "Marc J.
