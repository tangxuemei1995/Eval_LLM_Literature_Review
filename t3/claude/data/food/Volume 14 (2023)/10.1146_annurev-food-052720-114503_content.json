{"Literature Review": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have gained significant attention in recent years due to their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. These complex carbohydrates have emerged as promising ingredients in functional foods, offering numerous health benefits, particularly for intestinal health. This literature review aims to explore the enzymatic production of various nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, their prebiotic effects, and their applications in the food industry.Enzymatic production has become the preferred method for synthesizing nondigestible functional oligosaccharides due to its ability to control the structure and composition of the reaction products. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are among the most widely studied and commercially available prebiotics. Torres et al. (2010) reported that GOS can be produced through the transgalactosylation activity of β-galactosidases, using lactose as a substrate. The authors highlighted that the enzyme source, reaction conditions, and substrate concentration significantly influence the yield and composition of GOS.Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) have also gained attention for their prebiotic potential. Aachary and Prapulla (2011) reviewed various enzymatic methods for XOS production, including the use of xylanases from different microbial sources. They noted that XOS exhibit excellent stability under acidic conditions, making them suitable for incorporation into a wide range of food products.Manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) are another class of functional oligosaccharides with promising prebiotic properties. Charalampopoulos and Rastall (2012) discussed the enzymatic synthesis of MOS using mannanases and the potential of these oligosaccharides in modulating the gut microbiota. The authors emphasized the need for further research to optimize MOS production and elucidate their specific health benefits.Chito-oligosaccharides (COS) have attracted interest due to their unique biological activities. Zou et al. (2016) reviewed the enzymatic production of COS using chitinases and chitosanases, highlighting the potential of these oligosaccharides as prebiotics and their antimicrobial properties. The authors noted that COS could be valuable ingredients in functional foods and nutraceuticals.Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have gained attention for their role in infant nutrition and health. Bode (2012) discussed the complex structures of HMOs and their potential benefits beyond prebiotic effects, including protection against pathogens and support for brain development. The author highlighted the challenges in producing HMOs through enzymatic methods and the need for further research to develop cost-effective production strategies.The prebiotic activities of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been extensively studied. Gibson et al. (2017) provided a comprehensive review of the definition and criteria for prebiotics, emphasizing their ability to selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial gut bacteria. The authors discussed the evidence supporting the prebiotic effects of various oligosaccharides and their potential to improve host health.The impact of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides on intestinal health has been a subject of numerous studies. Slavin (2013) reviewed the effects of various prebiotics on gut health, including their ability to increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, modulate the immune system, and improve mineral absorption. The author highlighted the potential of prebiotics in preventing and managing various gastrointestinal disorders.The applications of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides in the food industry have expanded rapidly. Rastall (2010) discussed the technological properties of various prebiotics and their use in food formulations. The author noted that oligosaccharides could improve the texture, mouthfeel, and stability of food products while providing health benefits to consumers.Recent advances in the production and application of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have opened up new possibilities for developing functional foods. Mano et al. (2018) reviewed the current trends in prebiotic research, including the development of novel oligosaccharides and their potential synergistic effects with probiotics. The authors emphasized the importance of understanding the structure-function relationships of prebiotics to optimize their health benefits.In conclusion, nondigestible functional oligosaccharides represent a promising class of ingredients for improving intestinal health and developing functional foods. Enzymatic production methods have enabled the synthesis of various oligosaccharides with controlled structures and compositions. The prebiotic effects of these compounds, along with their technological properties, make them valuable ingredients in the food industry. As research in this field continues to advance, it is expected that new applications and health benefits of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides will be discovered, further expanding their potential in promoting human health through functional foods.", "References": [{"title": "Galacto-oligosaccharides: Production, properties, applications, and significance as prebiotics", "authors": "David F.
