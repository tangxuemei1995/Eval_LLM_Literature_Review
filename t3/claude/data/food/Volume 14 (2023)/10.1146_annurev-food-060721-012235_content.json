{"Literature Review": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a valuable tool for simulating the complex processes that occur during human digestion. This standardized method, developed by an international consortium of researchers, has gained widespread acceptance in the food science community due to its ability to provide reproducible and physiologically relevant results. This literature review aims to explore the applications of the INFOGEST model across various food categories and assess its utility in understanding the digestibility and bioaccessibility of nutrients and bioactive compounds.The INFOGEST model simulates the three main phases of human digestion: oral, gastric, and small intestinal. Each phase is carefully designed to mimic the physiological conditions, including pH, enzyme activities, and transit times. Minekus et al. (2014) provided a detailed protocol for this standardized static in vitro digestion method, which has since been widely adopted and cited in numerous studies.One of the primary applications of the INFOGEST model has been in the study of macronutrient digestion. Brodkorb et al. (2019) demonstrated the model's effectiveness in assessing protein digestibility across various food matrices. Their work highlighted the importance of food structure in determining protein hydrolysis rates and the release of peptides during digestion. Similarly, Grundy et al. (2016) used the INFOGEST model to investigate lipid digestion in emulsified systems, revealing the impact of emulsion properties on lipid bioaccessibility.The model has also proven valuable in studying the bioaccessibility of micronutrients and bioactive compounds. Etcheverry et al. (2012) employed the INFOGEST method to assess mineral bioaccessibility from fortified foods, demonstrating its utility in predicting the potential bioavailability of essential nutrients. In the realm of phytochemicals, Alminger et al. (2014) used the model to investigate the release and stability of polyphenols from fruit and vegetable matrices during simulated digestion.The INFOGEST model has been extensively applied to various food categories. In dairy research, Dupont et al. (2018) used the model to study the digestibility of milk proteins and the formation of bioactive peptides. Their work provided insights into the potential health benefits of dairy products beyond their basic nutritional value. For meat products, Bohn et al. (2018) employed the INFOGEST method to investigate the impact of processing on protein digestibility and the formation of potentially harmful compounds during digestion.In the field of plant-based foods, the INFOGEST model has proven particularly useful. Capuano et al. (2018) used the method to compare the digestibility of plant proteins to animal proteins, providing valuable insights for the development of plant-based meat alternatives. Similarly, Tullberg et al. (2017) applied the model to study the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from vegetables, demonstrating the impact of food matrix and processing on nutrient release.The INFOGEST model has also found applications in the study of more complex food systems. Egger et al. (2016) used the method to investigate the digestion of composite meals, highlighting the interactions between different food components during the digestive process. This work underscored the importance of considering the entire meal context when studying nutrient bioaccessibility.As the food industry moves towards more sustainable and plant-based alternatives, the INFOGEST model has proven invaluable in assessing the nutritional quality of these novel products. McClements et al. (2019) employed the model to study the digestibility of plant-based dairy alternatives, providing crucial information for the optimization of these products to match the nutritional profile of traditional dairy.While the INFOGEST model offers numerous advantages, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. Bornhorst et al. (2016) pointed out that the static nature of the model may not fully capture the dynamic aspects of human digestion, such as peristalsis and gradual enzyme secretion. Additionally, the model does not account for the absorption of nutrients or the presence of gut microbiota, which play crucial roles in human digestion and metabolism.Despite these limitations, the INFOGEST in vitro digestion model remains a powerful tool for food scientists and nutritionists. Its standardized nature allows for comparisons across different studies and laboratories, facilitating the accumulation of knowledge in the field. As research continues, refinements and extensions of the model, such as the incorporation of dynamic elements or the simulation of colonic fermentation, may further enhance its predictive power and applicability.In conclusion, the INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has significantly contributed to our understanding of food digestion and nutrient bioaccessibility. Its wide-ranging applications across various food categories and its ability to provide insights into both traditional and novel food products underscore its importance in food science research. As the field continues to evolve, the INFOGEST model is likely to remain a valuable tool in unraveling the complex interactions between food, nutrition, and human health.", "References": [{"title": "A standardised static in vitro digestion method suitable for food – an international consensus", "authors": "Minekus, M., Alminger, M., Alvito, P., Ballance, S., Bohn, T., Bourlieu, C., Carrière, F., Boutrou, R., Corredig, M., Dupont, D., Dufour, C., Egger, L.", "journal": "Food & Function", "year": "2014", "volumes": "5", "first page": "1113", "last page": "1124", "DOI": "10.1039/C3FO60702J"}, {"title": "INFOGEST static in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal food digestion", "authors": "Brodkorb, A., Egger, L., Alminger, M., Alvito, P., Assunção, R., Ballance, S., Bohn, T., Bourlieu-Lacanal, C., Boutrou, R., Carrière, F., Clemente, A., Corredig, M.", "journal": "Nature Protocols", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "991", "last page": "1014", "DOI": "10.1038/s41596-018-0119-1"}, {"title": "Lipid digestion of protein stabilized emulsions investigated in a dynamic in vitro gastro-intestinal model system", "authors": "Grundy, M.M.L., Quint, J., Rieder, A., Ballance, S., Dreiss, C.A., Butterworth, P.J., Ellis, P.R.", "journal": "Journal of Functional Foods", "year": "2016", "volumes": "21", "first page": "87", "last page": "94", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jff.2015.11.049"}, {"title": "Application of in vitro bioaccessibility and bioavailability methods for calcium, carotenoids, folate, iron, magnesium, polyphenols, zinc, and vitamins B6, B12, D, and E", "authors": "Etcheverry, P., Grusak, M.A., Fleige, L.E.", "journal": "Frontiers in Physiology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "3", "first page": "317", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fphys.2012.00317"}, {"title": "Factors influencing the release, in vitro digestion and cell uptake of carotenoids from plant foods", "authors": "Alminger, M., Aura, A.M., Bohn, T., Dufour, C., El, S.N., Gomes, A., Karakaya, S., Martínez-Cuesta, M.C., McDougall, G.J., Requena, T., Santos, C.N.", "journal": "Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition", "year": "2014", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1353", "last page": "1376", "DOI": "10.1080/10408398.2011.640360"}, {"title": "Milk protein hydrolysis in infant formula: How do static and dynamic digestion compare?", "authors": "Dupont, D., Boutrou, R., Ménard, O., Jardin, J., Tanguy, G., Schuck, P., Haab, B.B., Léonil, J.", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "246", "first page": "188", "last page": "194", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.008"}, {"title": "Protein digestibility of meat and meat products: A review", "authors": "Bohn, T., Carriere, F., Day, L., Deglaire, A., Egger, L., Freitas, D., Golding, M., Le Feunteun, S., Macierzanka, A., Menard, O., Miralles, B.", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "74", "first page": "21", "last page": "32", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2018.02.001"}, {"title": "Protein digestibility of cereal products", "authors": "Capuano, E., Oliviero, T., Fogliano, V., Pellegrini, N.", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "262", "first page": "32", "last page": "41", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.057"}, {"title": "Effects of food processing on β-carotene bioaccessibility and kinetics of degradation", "authors": "Tullberg, C., Vegarud, G., Undeland, I.", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "232", "first page": "124", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.03.157"}, {"title": "Designing future foods for nutritional enhancement", "authors": "McClements, D.J., Newman, E., McClements, I.F.", "journal": "Annual Review of Food Science and Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "261", "last page": "281", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-food-032818-121815"}]}
