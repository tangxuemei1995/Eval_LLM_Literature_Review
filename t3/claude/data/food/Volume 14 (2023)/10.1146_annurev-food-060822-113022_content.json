{"Literature Review": "The intersection of plant genetics, metabolomics, and human nutrition has emerged as a promising field for addressing global health challenges. This literature review explores the potential of leveraging genebank collections and advanced analytical techniques to enhance the nutritional quality of crops, with a focus on metabolic signatures and their implications for human health. Genebank collections represent a vast and largely untapped resource of genetic diversity in crop species. These collections, maintained by various institutions worldwide, contain thousands of accessions of cultivated crops and their wild relatives. Traditionally, these resources have been primarily utilized for breeding programs aimed at improving yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, recent advances in genomics and metabolomics have opened new avenues for exploring the nutritional potential of these collections. The concept of 'hidden hunger' has gained prominence in recent years, referring to micronutrient deficiencies that persist even when caloric intake is sufficient. This phenomenon is partly attributed to the historical focus of plant breeding on yield improvement, often at the expense of nutritional quality. Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of small molecules in biological systems, has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the nutritional profiles of crops. The integration of genomics and metabolomics has further accelerated the discovery of genetic determinants underlying metabolic traits. The application of these techniques to diverse crop species has yielded promising results. While these studies demonstrate the potential of mining genebank collections for nutritional traits, challenges remain in translating these findings into improved crop varieties. It is important to note that while enhancing the levels of beneficial compounds is a primary goal, attention must also be paid to potential antinutrients. The potential of genebank-derived metabolic signatures extends beyond staple crops. In conclusion, the integration of metabolomics with genebank resources represents a powerful approach for enhancing the nutritional quality of crops. This strategy complements transgenic and gene editing approaches, offering a means to harness natural genetic variation for improving human health through diet. As research in this field progresses, it holds the promise of addressing hidden hunger and contributing to global food security and nutrition.", "References": [{"title": "Plant metabolomics: from holistic hope, to hype, to hot topic", "authors": "Alisdair R.
