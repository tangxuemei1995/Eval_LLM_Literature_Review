{"Literature Review": "The food industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact while addressing global challenges such as food shortages and rising energy costs. This literature review explores the concept of mild fractionation as a more sustainable approach to producing food ingredients, focusing on its environmental benefits, functional properties, and challenges.Traditionally, food ingredient production has relied on extensive wet processing methods to achieve high purities. However, these processes are associated with significant environmental impacts, primarily due to the energy-intensive steps of protein precipitation and dehydration. Boye and Arcand (2013) reported that conventional wet processing methods can consume up to 15-20 kWh of energy per kilogram of protein produced, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives.Milder wet processing methods have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional techniques. These approaches often exclude low pH-driven separation and instead utilize salt precipitation or water-only extraction. Schutyser et al. (2015) demonstrated that mild aqueous fractionation of pea proteins could reduce energy consumption by up to 50% compared to traditional methods while maintaining comparable protein yields. Similarly, Pelgrom et al. (2015) found that using mild conditions for lupin protein extraction resulted in a 30% reduction in water usage and a 40% decrease in energy consumption.Dry fractionation techniques, such as air classification and electrostatic separation, represent another category of mild processing methods. These approaches eliminate the need for drying steps, further reducing energy requirements. Schutyser and van der Goot (2011) reported that dry fractionation of pea flour could achieve protein concentrations of up to 55% while consuming only 0.1-0.2 kWh/kg, a fraction of the energy required for wet processing methods. Xing et al. (2018) demonstrated that electrostatic separation could effectively fractionate wheat bran, producing protein-rich and fiber-rich fractions with minimal energy input.One of the key advantages of milder fractionation methods is the enhanced functional properties of the resulting ingredients. Geerts et al. (2017) observed that mildly extracted pea proteins exhibited better solubility, emulsifying properties, and foam stability compared to their conventionally processed counterparts. This improvement in functionality is attributed to the preservation of native protein structures during mild processing. Jiang et al. (2020) reported similar findings for quinoa proteins, noting that mild extraction conditions resulted in superior gelling and water-holding capacities.The environmental benefits of mild fractionation extend beyond energy and water savings. Smetana et al. (2018) conducted a life cycle assessment comparing conventional and mild fractionation methods for various plant proteins. Their results showed that mild processing could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% and decrease land use by 40-60% compared to traditional techniques. These findings underscore the significant potential of mild fractionation in improving the overall sustainability of food ingredient production.Despite the numerous advantages, mild fractionation methods face certain challenges. One of the primary concerns is the presence of antinutritional factors in less refined ingredients. Shi et al. (2017) noted that mildly processed legume proteins often retained higher levels of phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors compared to their extensively refined counterparts. Additionally, off-flavors can be more pronounced in mildly fractionated ingredients, potentially limiting their application in certain food products. Ochoa-Rivas et al. (2017) reported that mildly extracted chia proteins exhibited stronger bitter and beany flavors compared to conventionally processed samples.To address these challenges, researchers are exploring innovative approaches. For instance, Agarwal et al. (2019) demonstrated that combining mild fractionation with enzymatic treatment could effectively reduce antinutritional factors in pea proteins while maintaining the benefits of mild processing. Similarly, Lam et al. (2018) showed that strategic blending of mildly fractionated ingredients could mitigate off-flavors while leveraging their enhanced functional properties.In conclusion, mild fractionation represents a promising approach to producing more sustainable food ingredients. By focusing on desired functionality rather than absolute purity, these methods offer significant reductions in energy consumption, water usage, and overall environmental impact. While challenges remain, particularly regarding antinutritional factors and off-flavors, ongoing research and development efforts are addressing these issues. As the food industry continues to prioritize sustainability, the trend towards mildly refined ingredients is likely to accelerate, driving innovation in both processing technologies and product formulations.", "References": [{"title": "Plant-based proteins: A review on physicochemical, functional and nutritional properties", "authors": "Joyce I.
