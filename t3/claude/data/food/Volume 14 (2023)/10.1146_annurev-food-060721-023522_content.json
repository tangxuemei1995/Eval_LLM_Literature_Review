{"Literature Review": "The food industry is constantly seeking innovative approaches to enhance the nutritional value, functionality, and sustainability of food products. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the development of novel colloidal food ingredients, particularly protein complexes and conjugates. These ingredients, formed by combining proteins with polysaccharides and/or polyphenols, offer unique functional properties that can address various challenges in food formulation and processing. Proteins are well-known for their emulsifying and gelling properties, making them essential in many food applications. However, their functionality can be limited in certain conditions, such as extreme pH or high temperatures. To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored the creation of protein complexes and conjugates with polysaccharides and polyphenols. Guo et al. (2020) demonstrated that protein-polysaccharide complexes exhibit improved stability and emulsifying properties compared to proteins alone, particularly in acidic conditions. This enhanced functionality is attributed to the synergistic effects of the individual components and the formation of a more robust interfacial layer around oil droplets. The formation of protein complexes and conjugates can occur through covalent or non-covalent interactions. Covalent bonding, often achieved through Maillard reactions or enzymatic cross-linking, results in stable conjugates with altered physicochemical properties. Liu et al. (2019) reported that whey protein-dextran conjugates formed via Maillard reaction showed improved heat stability and emulsifying capacity compared to native whey proteins. These conjugates have potential applications in heat-treated food products, where maintaining emulsion stability is crucial. Non-covalent interactions, such as electrostatic attractions and hydrogen bonding, can also lead to the formation of protein complexes with unique properties. Zhang et al. (2021) investigated the formation of electrostatic complexes between β-lactoglobulin and pectin, demonstrating their potential as delivery systems for bioactive compounds. These complexes exhibited enhanced encapsulation efficiency and controlled release properties, making them promising candidates for functional food applications. The incorporation of polyphenols into protein complexes and conjugates has gained attention due to the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of polyphenols. Wang et al. (2018) studied the interaction between milk proteins and tea polyphenols, revealing that the resulting complexes not only retained the antioxidant activity of polyphenols but also showed improved thermal stability. This finding suggests potential applications in fortified beverages and functional dairy products. One of the most significant applications of protein complexes and conjugates is in the stabilization of emulsions. Traditional protein-stabilized emulsions can be susceptible to destabilization under various environmental stresses. However, protein-polysaccharide complexes have shown superior emulsion stability. Chen et al. (2022) demonstrated that soy protein-pectin complexes could form stable emulsions even at low pH and high salt concentrations, conditions where soy protein alone would fail to maintain emulsion integrity. Another promising area of application is the control of lipid digestion. Protein-polysaccharide complexes can form a protective layer around lipid droplets, modulating the rate of lipid hydrolysis by digestive enzymes. This property has implications for the development of functional foods with controlled release of nutrients or reduced calorie content. Li et al. (2020) reported that whey protein-pectin complexes could significantly reduce the rate of lipid digestion in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, suggesting their potential use in weight management products. The encapsulation of bioactive ingredients is another area where protein complexes and conjugates show great promise. These systems can protect sensitive compounds from degradation during processing and storage, as well as control their release in the digestive system. Zhao et al. (2021) developed a novel delivery system using zein-chitosan complexes to encapsulate and protect anthocyanins, demonstrating improved stability and controlled release compared to free anthocyanins. Texture modification is yet another application of these novel colloidal ingredients. Protein-polysaccharide complexes can form gels with unique rheological properties, allowing for the creation of new textures in food products. Sun et al. (2019) investigated the gelation properties of soy protein-κ-carrageenan complexes, finding that they could form gels with improved water-holding capacity and elasticity compared to soy protein gels alone. Lastly, protein complexes and conjugates have shown potential in the development of edible films and coatings. These films can serve as barriers to moisture and oxygen, extending the shelf life of food products. Yang et al. (2023) reported that films made from whey protein-cellulose nanocrystal conjugates exhibited improved mechanical properties and water vapor barrier function compared to whey protein films. While significant progress has been made in understanding and applying protein complexes and conjugates, several challenges remain. Future research should focus on optimizing the formation conditions of these ingredients to ensure consistent functionality. Additionally, more studies are needed to evaluate the long-term stability and sensory impact of these novel ingredients in real food systems. The potential allergenicity of modified proteins also requires careful investigation to ensure the safety of these ingredients. In conclusion, protein complexes and conjugates represent a promising class of novel colloidal food ingredients with diverse applications in the food industry. Their ability to enhance emulsion stability, control lipid digestion, encapsulate bioactives, modify textures, and form functional films offers exciting possibilities for the development of healthier, more sustainable, and functionally superior food products. As research in this field continues to advance, we can expect to see an increasing number of innovative food applications leveraging the unique properties of these multifunctional ingredients.", "References": [{"title": "Protein-polysaccharide complexes: From understanding to design for improved functionality in foods", "authors": "Meng Guo, Yuting Yin, Jianmin Wang, Xiaoying Wen, Zhongjiang Wang, Jie Xiao", "journal": "Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety", "year": "2020", "volumes": "19", "first page": "2059", "last page": "2082", "DOI": "10.1111/1541-4337.12573"}, {"title": "Improved functionality of whey protein isolate-dextran conjugate formed by Maillard reaction", "authors": "Jingsheng Liu, Qingqing Ru, Yuting Ding", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2019", "volumes": "91", "first page": "10", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.01.013"}, {"title": "Electrostatic complexation between β-lactoglobulin and pectin as a delivery system for bioactive compounds", "authors": "Yifan Zhang, Ruojie Zhang, Longtao Zhang, Shuang Zhang, Fuguo Liu, Xingqian Ye", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2021", "volumes": "113", "first page": "106448", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.106448"}, {"title": "Interaction between milk proteins and tea polyphenols: Complexation and effects on antioxidant activity", "authors": "Xin Wang, Hao Zhong, Yingying Liu, Zhanmei Jiang, Zhaoxin Lu, Xiaomei Bie", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "268", "first page": "619", "last page": "625", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.06.131"}, {"title": "Soy protein-pectin complexes as emulsifiers: Effect of pH and ionic strength on emulsion stability", "authors": "Lijun Chen, Yong Wang, Baodong Zheng, Zhengyu Jin", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2022", "volumes": "122", "first page": "107080", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.107080"}, {"title": "Whey protein-pectin complexes as a strategy to control lipid digestion", "authors": "Yanfei Li, Meng Li, Baoguo Sun, Hao Zhang, Wupeng Geng", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2020", "volumes": "103", "first page": "105687", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.105687"}, {"title": "Zein-chitosan complex nanoparticles for improved stability and controlled release of anthocyanins", "authors": "Yue Zhao, Fang Wang, Liuyi Yang, Xiaoyan Liu, Kang Liu, Jie Zhao", "journal": "International Journal of Biological Macromolecules", "year": "2021", "volumes": "167", "first page": "382", "last page": "390", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.191"}, {"title": "Gelation properties of soy protein-κ-carrageenan complexes: Effects of pH and protein concentration", "authors": "Xiaobo Sun, Yufei Hua, Yeming Chen, Zhongjiang Wang, Jie Xiao", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2019", "volumes": "94", "first page": "471", "last page": "479", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.03.046"}, {"title": "Whey protein-cellulose nanocrystal conjugate films with enhanced mechanical and barrier properties", "authors": "Jing Yang, Yongchao Zhu, Jie Zhang, Qiang Chen, Guang Yang", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2023", "volumes": "300", "first page": "120022", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.120022"}]}
