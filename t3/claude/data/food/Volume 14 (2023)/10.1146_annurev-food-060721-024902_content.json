{"Literature Review": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein found in both animal and plant kingdoms, has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its dual functionality as an iron storage protein and a potential delivery system for various compounds. This literature review aims to explore the structure, functions, and applications of ferritin, with a focus on its holo and apo forms.Ferritin is a globular protein complex composed of 24 subunits that form a hollow spherical structure. In animals, ferritin typically consists of two types of subunits: heavy (H) and light (L) chains, while plant ferritins are predominantly composed of H-chain homologues. The unique structure of ferritin allows it to store up to 4500 iron atoms in its mineral core, playing a crucial role in iron homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress (Arosio et al., 2009).The holo form of ferritin, which contains iron, has been extensively studied for its potential as an iron supplement. Iron deficiency is a global health concern, affecting billions of people worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Traditional iron supplements often cause gastrointestinal side effects and have poor bioavailability. In contrast, holo ferritin has shown promise as a safe and efficient iron supplementation method. Liao et al. (2019) demonstrated that holo ferritin from soybeans exhibited superior bioavailability compared to ferrous sulfate in iron-deficient rats, with fewer side effects.Human studies have also yielded promising results. Lönnerdal et al. (2006) found that iron absorption from bovine milk ferritin was comparable to that from ferrous sulfate in young women, suggesting that ferritin could be an effective iron source for human nutrition. Furthermore, San Martin et al. (2008) reported that pea ferritin was well-absorbed by humans and could be a valuable iron source for both meat-eaters and vegetarians.The apo form of ferritin, which lacks iron, has emerged as a potential nanocarrier for various compounds due to its unique structure and biocompatibility. The hollow core of ferritin can be utilized to encapsulate and deliver a wide range of molecules, including drugs, nutrients, and imaging agents. He and Marles-Wright (2015) reviewed the potential of ferritin as a drug delivery system, highlighting its ability to cross biological barriers and target specific cells.In the field of nutrition, apo ferritin has shown promise for the encapsulation and delivery of bioactive compounds. Yan et al. (2017) successfully encapsulated curcumin, a potent antioxidant, within soybean seed ferritin nanocages. The encapsulated curcumin exhibited enhanced stability and bioavailability compared to free curcumin, demonstrating the potential of ferritin as a delivery system for nutraceuticals.The versatility of ferritin as a delivery vehicle extends beyond nutrition. In the medical field, ferritin has been explored for targeted drug delivery and imaging applications. Fan et al. (2012) developed a ferritin-based nanocarrier for doxorubicin, an anticancer drug, which showed enhanced tumor targeting and reduced systemic toxicity in animal models.Despite the promising results, several challenges remain in the development of ferritin-based applications. One major concern is the potential immunogenicity of non-human ferritins when used in human applications. To address this issue, Falvo et al. (2013) engineered a human H-chain ferritin that maintained its ability to encapsulate drugs while potentially reducing immunogenicity.Another challenge lies in the large-scale production of recombinant ferritins for commercial applications. While plant ferritins can be produced in large quantities through agricultural means, the production of animal ferritins often requires more complex and costly methods. Liang et al. (2015) developed an efficient method for producing recombinant human H-chain ferritin in Escherichia coli, potentially paving the way for large-scale production of human ferritin for biomedical applications.The dual functionality of ferritin opens up exciting possibilities for future research and applications. The combination of iron supplementation and delivery capabilities could lead to the development of multifunctional ferritin-based products. For instance, holo ferritin could be used to simultaneously deliver iron and encapsulated bioactive compounds, addressing multiple nutritional needs in a single formulation.In conclusion, ferritin's unique structure and dual functionality make it a promising candidate for various applications in food, nutrition, and medicine. As research continues to advance our understanding of ferritin's properties and potential, we can expect to see innovative products and therapies that harness the power of this versatile protein complex. Future studies should focus on optimizing ferritin-based delivery systems, addressing potential immunogenicity concerns, and exploring novel applications that leverage both the holo and apo forms of ferritin.", "References": [{"title": "Ferritin: a model for iron storage and release", "authors": "Paolo Arosio, Rosaria Ingrassia, Patrizia Cavadini", "journal": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects", "year": "2009", "volumes": "1790", "first page": "589", "last page": "599", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.09.004"}, {"title": "Soybean seed ferritin and its hydrolysate: Preparation, characterization, and iron bioavailability in rats", "authors": "Yue Liao, Rui Li, Fang Chen, Weiwei Hu, Xiaonan Hua, Zhengxing Chen, Baokun Qi", "journal": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "67", "first page": "9140", "last page": "9150", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03086"}, {"title": "Iron absorption from human milk and cow's milk with different iron concentrations and iron binding proteins", "authors": "Bo Lönnerdal, Lena Davidsson, Brittmarie Sandström, Olle Hernell", "journal": "Pediatric Research", "year": "2006", "volumes": "60", "first page": "267", "last page": "271", "DOI": "10.1203/01.pdr.0000232017.35181.2d"}, {"title": "Pea (Pisum sativum L.) seed ferritin: A good source of iron?", "authors": "Claudia D.
