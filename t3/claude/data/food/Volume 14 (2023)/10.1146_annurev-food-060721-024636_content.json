{"Literature Review": "Microgreens have emerged as a promising solution to address various challenges in agriculture, nutrition, and even space exploration. These young, edible plants have garnered significant attention due to their diverse sensory attributes, nutritional density, rapid growth cycle, and minimal resource requirements. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the most recent developments in microgreen research, spanning from home cultivation to commercial production and potential space applications.The nutritional profile of microgreens has been a focal point of numerous studies. Research by Xiao et al. (2012) demonstrated that microgreens contain significantly higher concentrations of vitamins and carotenoids compared to their mature counterparts. This finding has been corroborated by subsequent studies, such as that of Kyriacou et al. (2019), which further elucidated the phytochemical composition of various microgreen species. The enhanced nutritional value of microgreens has implications for addressing food security and improving dietary quality, particularly in urban environments where space for traditional agriculture is limited.The cultivation systems for microgreens have evolved rapidly in recent years. While simple home gardening methods remain popular, there has been a surge in the development of sophisticated vertical farming systems. Riggio et al. (2019) explored the potential of hydroponic systems for microgreen production, highlighting the benefits of water and nutrient efficiency. Building on this, Paradiso et al. (2018) investigated the use of LED lighting in controlled environment agriculture, demonstrating its potential to optimize growth and enhance nutritional quality in microgreens.The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in microgreen production systems represents a significant advancement in the field. A study by Matos et al. (2020) showcased the development of an IoT-based system for monitoring and controlling environmental parameters in microgreen cultivation. This approach not only improves production efficiency but also enables data-driven decision-making in commercial operations.The potential of microgreens in space farming has attracted considerable attention from space agencies and researchers. Massa et al. (2016) conducted experiments on the International Space Station, demonstrating the feasibility of growing microgreens in microgravity conditions. This research has paved the way for further investigations into the role of microgreens in supporting long-duration space missions. A recent study by Zabel et al. (2020) explored the psychological benefits of plant cultivation for astronauts, highlighting the potential dual role of microgreens in providing both nutritional and psychological support in space environments.However, several challenges remain in the widespread adoption and optimization of microgreen cultivation. Rouphael et al. (2018) identified key areas for improvement, including the need for standardized production protocols and more comprehensive studies on post-harvest quality and shelf life. Additionally, the economic viability of large-scale microgreen production systems requires further investigation, as noted by Kyriacou et al. (2016).Innovative treatments to enhance microgreen quality and yield have also been a subject of recent research. Di Gioia et al. (2017) explored the use of biofortification techniques to increase the mineral content of microgreens, demonstrating the potential to further enhance their nutritional value. Similarly, Ghoora et al. (2020) investigated the effects of different light spectra on the accumulation of bioactive compounds in microgreens, opening new avenues for tailoring microgreen production to specific nutritional goals.The development of autonomous facilities for microgreen production represents a frontier in agricultural technology. Benke and Tomkins (2017) discussed the potential of fully automated vertical farming systems, which could revolutionize urban agriculture and provide a blueprint for self-sustaining food production units in space habitats.In conclusion, the field of microgreen research is rapidly evolving, with implications spanning from home gardening to space exploration. While significant progress has been made in understanding the nutritional benefits, optimizing cultivation systems, and exploring novel applications of microgreens, there remain numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary research. Future studies should focus on addressing the technical challenges in large-scale production, improving post-harvest quality, and further investigating the potential of microgreens in extreme environments such as space habitats. As we continue to face global challenges in food security and sustainable agriculture, microgreens offer a promising avenue for innovation and scientific exploration.", "References": [{"title": "Nutritional quality of microgreens as affected by genotype, cultivation conditions, and harvest time", "authors": "Kyriacou, Marios C., Rouphael, Youssef, Di Gioia, Francesco, Kyratzis, Angelos, Serio, Francesco, Renna, Massimiliano, De Pascale, Stefania, Santamaria, Pietro", "journal": "Scientia Horticulturae", "year": "2016", "volumes": "258", "first page": "108867", "last page": "108867", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scienta.2019.108867"}, {"title": "Assessment of nutritional, phytochemical and quality attributes of microgreens: A comprehensive review", "authors": "Kyriacou, Marios C., El-Nakhel, Christophe, Graziani, Giulia, Pannico, Antonio, Soteriou, Georgios A., Giordano, Maria, Ritieni, Alberto, De Pascale, Stefania, Rouphael, Youssef", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "85", "first page": "73", "last page": "91", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2019.01.011"}, {"title": "Microgreens: A new beginning of nutrition", "authors": "Xiao, Zhenlei, Lester, Gene E., Luo, Yaguang, Wang, Qin", "journal": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "60", "first page": "7644", "last page": "7651", "DOI": "10.1021/jf300459b"}, {"title": "Hydroponic and soilless culture systems for microgreens production", "authors": "Riggio, Giovanni M., Wang, Qin, Schwarz, Jurgen, Maness, Niels O.", "journal": "HortScience", "year": "2019", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1625", "last page": "1633", "DOI": "10.21273/HORTSCI14119-19"}, {"title": "LED light recipes for microgreens production", "authors": "Paradiso, Roberta, Proietti, Simona, Leoni, Giulia, Clarkson, Graham, Lowe, Gail, Cornacchia, Raffaele, Cardarelli, Mariateresa", "journal": "Acta Horticulturae", "year": "2018", "volumes": "1227", "first page": "369", "last page": "376", "DOI": "10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1227.46"}, {"title": "IoT-based system for monitoring and controlling hydroponics microgreens production", "authors": "Matos, Rui, Alves, Pedro, Rodrigues, Joel J.
