{"Literature Review": "The field of biotechnology has opened up new avenues for addressing the growing global demand for food lipids, both in terms of quantity and quality. This literature review explores recent advances in metabolic engineering and enzymatic modification of lipids, highlighting the opportunities and challenges in developing future food lipids. Metabolic engineering of plants and microorganisms has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing lipid production and tailoring lipid profiles. In plants, efforts have focused on increasing oil content in seeds and expanding oil production to vegetative tissues. Xu and Shanklin (2016) reported significant progress in redirecting carbon flux towards triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in leaves, demonstrating the potential for creating 'oil crops' from non-seed tissues. Similarly, Vanhercke et al. (2019) achieved remarkable increases in leaf oil content through the simultaneous expression of multiple genes involved in TAG biosynthesis and storage. Microalgae and oleaginous yeasts have garnered attention as alternative lipid sources due to their rapid growth rates and ability to accumulate high levels of lipids. Metabolic engineering strategies in these organisms have aimed at enhancing lipid productivity and modifying fatty acid profiles. For instance, Wang et al. (2018) successfully increased lipid content in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica by overexpressing key enzymes in the TAG biosynthesis pathway and knocking out competing pathways. In microalgae, Ajjawi et al. (2017) employed a multi-gene engineering approach to boost lipid production in Nannochloropsis gaditana, achieving a 2-fold increase in lipid content without compromising growth. The production of novel and nutritionally enhanced lipids has been another focus of metabolic engineering efforts. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been successfully produced in transgenic oilseed crops. Petrie et al. (2020) reported the development of canola lines producing high levels of DHA, demonstrating the feasibility of creating land-based sources of these important omega-3 fatty acids. While metabolic engineering has shown great promise, challenges remain in translating laboratory successes to field-scale production. Issues such as yield drag, unintended metabolic consequences, and regulatory hurdles need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of engineered lipid-producing organisms (Napier et al., 2019). Complementing metabolic engineering approaches, enzymatic modification of lipids has emerged as a powerful strategy for creating functional lipids with enhanced nutritional properties. Lipases, in particular, have been extensively employed in the production of structured lipids. Zhao et al. (2020) reviewed recent advances in the enzymatic synthesis of human milk fat substitutes, highlighting the potential of this approach in developing infant formulas that more closely mimic the composition and structure of human milk fat. Diacylglycerols (DAGs) have gained attention as functional lipids due to their potential health benefits, including improved lipid metabolism and reduced body fat accumulation. Oh et al. (2017) reported on the enzymatic production of DAG-rich oils from various vegetable oils, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of lipase-catalyzed processes for DAG synthesis. Structured triacylglycerols, particularly those with medium-chain fatty acids at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions and long-chain fatty acids at the sn-2 position (MLM-type), have been of interest for their unique nutritional properties. Xu et al. (2018) described novel lipase engineering strategies for improving the specificity and efficiency of MLM-type structured lipid synthesis, paving the way for large-scale production of these functional lipids. Phospholipids represent another class of lipids with significant potential for modification to enhance their functional properties. Enzymatic approaches have been developed to produce structured phospholipids with improved bioavailability and specific health benefits. Guo et al. (2021) reviewed recent progress in the enzymatic modification of phospholipids, highlighting the potential of these structured lipids in food and nutraceutical applications. While enzymatic modification offers numerous advantages, including high specificity and mild reaction conditions, challenges remain in scaling up these processes and reducing production costs. Additionally, the development of more efficient and stable enzymes through protein engineering is an active area of research aimed at improving the economic viability of enzymatic lipid modification (Bornscheuer, 2018). In conclusion, biotechnology offers tremendous opportunities for addressing the challenges of future food lipid production and quality. Metabolic engineering approaches have demonstrated the potential to increase lipid yields and produce novel lipids in both plants and microorganisms. Enzymatic modification strategies complement these efforts by enabling the production of structured lipids with enhanced nutritional properties. However, significant challenges remain in scaling up these technologies, addressing regulatory concerns, and improving cost-effectiveness. Future research efforts should focus on integrating metabolic engineering and enzymatic modification approaches, as well as exploring new lipid sources and production systems to meet the growing global demand for nutritious and sustainable food lipids.", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic engineering of plants to produce nutritional lipids", "authors": "Johnathan A.
