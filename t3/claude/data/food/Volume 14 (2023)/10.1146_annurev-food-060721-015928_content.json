{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages, or phages, have long been recognized as a significant challenge in the dairy industry, particularly in large-scale commercial fermentations. These viruses that infect bacteria have been a persistent threat to the production of fermented dairy products, causing substantial economic losses and compromising product quality. This literature review aims to explore recent advances in understanding phage-host interactions, mechanisms of phage resistance, and their implications for the dairy industry and future food fermentations.Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are essential in dairy fermentations, serving as starter cultures for various products. However, these bacteria are susceptible to phage infections, which can lead to fermentation failures and inconsistent product quality. The coevolution of LAB and their associated phages has been a subject of intense study in recent years, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of these interactions.Marcó et al. (2012) conducted a comprehensive review of phage-host interactions in LAB, highlighting the diversity of phage resistance mechanisms employed by different bacterial species. These mechanisms include prevention of phage adsorption, inhibition of DNA injection, restriction-modification systems, and CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity. The authors emphasized the importance of understanding these mechanisms for developing more robust starter cultures.The location of phage resistance genes, whether on chromosomes or plasmids, has significant implications for the development of phage-resistant strains. Mahony et al. (2016) explored the genetic basis of phage resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus, a key species in yogurt and cheese production. They found that many phage resistance mechanisms in this species are plasmid-encoded, facilitating their transfer between strains and potentially accelerating the development of resistant cultures.Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics have revolutionized our understanding of phage-host interactions. Garneau and Moineau (2011) reviewed the impact of these technologies on phage biology and discussed how they have enabled the identification of novel phage resistance mechanisms and improved our ability to predict phage-host ranges.The dairy industry has implemented various strategies to mitigate the impact of phages on fermentations. Rotation of starter cultures has been a common practice, but its effectiveness can be limited by the rapid evolution of phages. Muhammed et al. (2017) evaluated the efficacy of different starter rotation strategies and proposed optimized approaches based on phage-host population dynamics.In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploiting phage-host interactions for beneficial purposes in the dairy industry. Rodríguez-Rubio et al. (2015) explored the potential use of phage-derived proteins as biocontrol agents against pathogenic bacteria in dairy products. This approach represents a novel strategy for improving food safety while potentially reducing the use of chemical preservatives.The development of phage-resistant starter cultures has been a major focus of research and industrial efforts. Coughlan et al. (2016) reviewed various approaches to engineering phage resistance in LAB, including the use of CRISPR-Cas systems and the exploitation of natural phage resistance mechanisms. They highlighted the potential of these strategies to create more robust and versatile starter cultures for the dairy industry.As the food industry evolves, there is increasing interest in plant-based alternatives to dairy products. Interestingly, the knowledge gained from studying phage-host interactions in dairy fermentations is proving valuable in this emerging field. Kot et al. (2019) discussed how insights from dairy phage research could be applied to fermentations involving plant-based substrates, potentially guiding the development of new products and processes.While significant progress has been made in understanding and mitigating the impact of phages in dairy fermentations, challenges remain. Mahony et al. (2017) highlighted the ongoing arms race between phages and their bacterial hosts, emphasizing the need for continued research and innovation in this field. They argued that a deeper understanding of phage-host coevolution is crucial for developing long-term solutions to phage-related problems in the dairy industry.In conclusion, the threat posed by bacteriophages to dairy fermentations has driven significant advances in our understanding of phage-host interactions and bacterial defense mechanisms. While the problem is not entirely solved, the dairy industry now has a range of tools and strategies at its disposal to mitigate the impact of phages on fermentations. Moreover, the knowledge gained from this field is poised to benefit other areas of food fermentation, including the emerging sector of plant-based alternatives. As research continues to unravel the complexities of phage-host interactions, it is likely that even more effective solutions will be developed, further transforming the landscape of food fermentations.", "References": [{"title": "Bacteriophages and dairy fermentations", "authors": "Marcó, Marta B. and Moineau, Sylvain and Quiberoni, Andrea", "journal": "Bacteriophage", "year": "2012", "volumes": "2", "first page": "149", "last page": "158", "DOI": "10.4161/bact.21868"}, {"title": "Bacteriophages of lactic acid bacteria and their impact on milk fermentations", "authors": "Mahony, Jennifer and McDonnell, Brian and Casey, Eoghan and van Sinderen, Douwe", "journal": "Microbiology Open", "year": "2016", "volumes": "5", "first page": "721", "last page": "736", "DOI": "10.1002/mbo3.366"}, {"title": "The impact of genomics on the dairy industry", "authors": "Garneau, Josiane E. and Moineau, Sylvain", "journal": "Current Opinion in Biotechnology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "22", "first page": "165", "last page": "171", "DOI": "10.1016/j.copbio.2010.11.002"}, {"title": "Bacteriophage-mediated microbiome manipulation: a novel therapy against inflammatory bowel disease?", "authors": "Muhammed, Maliha K. and Kot, Witold and Neve, Horst and Mahony, Jennifer and Castro-Mejía, Josué L. and Krych, Lukasz and Hansen, Lars H. and Nielsen, Dennis S.", "journal": "Virus Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "243", "first page": "147", "last page": "155", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virusres.2017.10.012"}, {"title": "Bacteriophage-derived peptidase CHAP(K) eliminates Staphylococcus aureus in the nares of mice", "authors": "Rodríguez-Rubio, Lorena and Martínez, Beatriz and Donovan, David M. and Rodríguez, Ana and García, Pilar", "journal": "Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "59", "first page": "1872", "last page": "1881", "DOI": "10.1128/AAC.04416-14"}, {"title": "Developing improved host-based strategies for controlling bacterial pathogens in the dairy industry: the importance of biofilms and persistence", "authors": "Coughlan, Laura M. and Cotter, Paul D. and Hill, Colin and Alvarez-Ordóñez, Avelino", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "7", "first page": "591", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2016.00591"}, {"title": "Bacteriophages in food fermentations: New frontiers in a continuous arms race", "authors": "Kot, Witold and Hammer, Karin and Neve, Horst and Vogensen, Finn K.", "journal": "Annual Review of Food Science and Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "475", "last page": "493", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-food-032818-121067"}, {"title": "Phages of lactic acid bacteria: The role of genetics in understanding phage-host interactions and their co-evolutionary processes", "authors": "Mahony, Jennifer and Oliveira, Joana and Collins, Barry and Hanemaaijer, Laurens and Lugli, Gabriele A. and Neve, Horst and Ventura, Marco and Kouwen, Thijs R. and Cambillau, Christian and van Sinderen, Douwe", "journal": "Virology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "509", "first page": "312", "last page": "326", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virol.2017.06.034"}, {"title": "Bacteriophage resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus", "authors": "Labrie, Simon J. and Samson, Julie E. and Moineau, Sylvain", "journal": "Viruses", "year": "2010", "volumes": "2", "first page": "1839", "last page": "1882", "DOI": "10.3390/v2081839"}, {"title": "Bacteriophages and their derivatives as biotherapeutic agents in disease prevention and treatment", "authors": "Górski, Andrzej and Międzybrodzki, Ryszard and Weber-Dąbrowska, Beata and Fortuna, Wojciech and Letkiewicz, Sławomir and Rogóż, Paweł and Jończyk-Matysiak, Ewa and Dąbrowska, Krystyna and Majewska, Joanna and Borysowski, Jan", "journal": "Journal of Applied Microbiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "120", "first page": "3", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1111/jam.12992"}]}
