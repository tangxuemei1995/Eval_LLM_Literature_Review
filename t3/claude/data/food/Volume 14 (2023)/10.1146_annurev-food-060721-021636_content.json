{"Literature Review": "Lipid oxidation is a major concern in food systems, particularly in oil-in-water emulsions containing polyunsaturated lipids. These emulsions are prone to oxidation, which can lead to the formation of off-flavors, reduced nutritional value, and potentially harmful compounds. The oil-water interface plays a crucial role in the initiation and propagation of lipid oxidation, making it a prime target for antioxidant strategies. This literature review focuses on recent advances in targeting phenolic antioxidants to the interfacial region of emulsions to enhance their effectiveness in preventing lipid oxidation.Phenolic compounds are well-known for their antioxidant properties, but their effectiveness in emulsion systems is often limited by their poor solubility in the oil phase and their tendency to partition into the aqueous phase. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various strategies to enhance the interfacial activity of phenolic antioxidants.One approach involves the lipophilization of phenolic acids to create amphiphilic molecules known as phenolipids. Laguerre et al. (2009) demonstrated that esterifying chlorogenic acid with alkyl chains of varying lengths could significantly improve its antioxidant activity in emulsions. They observed a non-linear relationship between alkyl chain length and antioxidant effectiveness, with medium-chain phenolipids showing optimal performance. This 'cut-off' effect has been attributed to the balance between interfacial anchoring and mobility of the antioxidant molecules.Building on this concept, Gonzalez et al. (2015) investigated the impact of phenolipid structure on their antioxidant activity in emulsions. They found that the position of esterification and the nature of the lipophilic moiety could significantly influence the interfacial behavior and antioxidant efficiency of phenolipids. These findings highlight the importance of molecular design in optimizing the performance of interfacial antioxidants.Another promising strategy involves the functionalization of biopolymer emulsifiers with phenolic compounds. Guo et al. (2017) explored the covalent attachment of chlorogenic acid to whey protein isolate, creating a novel emulsifier with enhanced antioxidant properties. The resulting conjugates showed improved emulsion stability and oxidative stability compared to systems stabilized by native whey proteins or physical mixtures of proteins and chlorogenic acid.Non-covalent interactions between phenolics and biopolymers have also been investigated as a means of targeting antioxidants to the interface. Zhu et al. (2019) demonstrated that electrostatic complexation between cationic chitosan and anionic phenolic compounds could effectively localize antioxidants at the oil-water interface, leading to improved oxidative stability of emulsions.The use of Pickering particles as antioxidant carriers represents another innovative approach to interfacial antioxidant delivery. Zhao et al. (2018) developed chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles loaded with tea polyphenols as Pickering emulsifiers. These particles not only stabilized the emulsions through a Pickering mechanism but also provided a sustained release of antioxidants at the interface, resulting in enhanced oxidative stability.Similarly, Xiao et al. (2020) investigated the use of zein-epigallocatechin gallate complex particles as Pickering stabilizers for oil-in-water emulsions. The incorporation of the phenolic compound into the particle structure led to improved antioxidant activity compared to systems where the antioxidant was simply dispersed in the aqueous phase.While these strategies have shown promising results in model systems, their application in real food emulsions presents additional challenges. Factors such as pH, ionic strength, and the presence of other food components can significantly influence the behavior and effectiveness of interfacial antioxidants. Jacobsen et al. (2019) reviewed the complexities of lipid oxidation in food emulsions and highlighted the need for a multifaceted approach to antioxidant protection, combining interfacial engineering with other strategies such as metal chelation and oxygen scavenging.Moreover, the potential impact of these novel antioxidant delivery systems on the sensory properties and consumer acceptance of food products must be carefully considered. Skowyra et al. (2014) evaluated the sensory attributes of emulsions stabilized by protein-phenolic conjugates and found that while oxidative stability was improved, there were noticeable changes in flavor and texture that could affect consumer perception.In conclusion, targeting phenolic antioxidants to the oil-water interface of emulsions represents a promising strategy for enhancing oxidative stability in food systems. The development of phenolipids, functionalized biopolymer emulsifiers, and antioxidant-loaded Pickering particles has demonstrated the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of natural antioxidants in emulsions. However, further research is needed to optimize these systems for specific food applications, taking into account the complex interplay between interfacial phenomena, oxidation kinetics, and sensory properties. As our understanding of these interactions deepens, we can expect to see the development of more effective and tailored antioxidant strategies for food emulsions, ultimately leading to healthier and more stable food products.", "References": [{"title": "Antioxidant properties of chlorogenic acid and its alkyl esters in stripped corn oil in combination with phospholipids and/or water", "authors": "Mathieu Laguerre, Luis J.
