{"Literature Review": "The urgent need for global decarbonization to mitigate climate change has sparked intense research interest in the social impacts of transitioning away from fossil fuels. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge on the social dimensions of supply-side decarbonization, highlighting key findings and identifying areas for future research.The interconnectedness of fossil fuels and modern society has been a longstanding, if often implicit, concern in sociology. As Urry (2014) argues, the development of carbon-intensive energy systems has profoundly shaped social structures, cultural practices, and economic systems. The impending transition away from these systems is likely to have equally far-reaching consequences, necessitating a deeper understanding of the social impacts of decarbonization.One crucial area of research focuses on the effects of fossil fuel phase-out on communities historically dependent on extraction industries. Carley et al. (2018) highlight the potential for economic disruption and social dislocation in these areas, emphasizing the need for targeted policies to support affected workers and communities. Similarly, Haggerty et al. (2018) examine the challenges faced by coal-dependent communities in the western United States, noting the importance of proactive planning and diversification strategies to mitigate negative impacts.The concept of a 'just transition' has emerged as a framework for addressing these concerns. Stevis and Felli (2015) trace the evolution of this concept, which originated in the labor movement and has since been adopted by environmental justice advocates and policymakers. They argue that a just transition must go beyond job creation to address broader issues of social equity and community resilience.Research on renewable energy deployment has also revealed complex social dynamics. While renewables are often framed as universally beneficial, studies have shown that their implementation can generate conflicts and inequalities. For instance, Yenneti et al. (2016) examine the social justice implications of large-scale solar energy projects in India, highlighting issues of land acquisition and displacement of marginalized communities.The spatial dimensions of energy transitions have received increasing attention. Bridge et al. (2013) argue that the shift to renewables will necessitate significant changes in energy geographies, with implications for regional development, land use, and spatial justice. This perspective underscores the need for place-based approaches to energy transition planning.Gender dimensions of energy transitions have also emerged as an important area of study. Pearl-Martinez and Stephens (2016) highlight the potential for renewable energy deployment to advance gender equality, while also noting the risk of reproducing existing gender inequalities if not carefully managed.The role of public perception and social acceptance in facilitating or hindering decarbonization efforts has been widely recognized. Wüstenhagen et al. (2007) provide a comprehensive review of research on social acceptance of renewable energy technologies, identifying key factors influencing public attitudes and proposing strategies for enhancing acceptance.Governance and policy frameworks play a crucial role in shaping the social outcomes of decarbonization. Newell and Mulvaney (2013) examine the political economy of 'clean energy' transitions, arguing for the need to address power imbalances and ensure democratic participation in decision-making processes.Finally, recent scholarship has begun to explore the cultural dimensions of energy transitions. Sovacool (2016) argues for the importance of understanding energy cultures and the ways in which deeply ingrained social practices and cultural norms may facilitate or impede decarbonization efforts.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization, many challenges remain. Future research should focus on developing more integrated approaches that consider the complex interplay between technological, economic, and social factors. Additionally, there is a need for more comparative studies to understand how different contexts shape transition outcomes. As the urgency of climate action intensifies, sociological insights into the human dimensions of decarbonization will be crucial for informing effective and equitable policy responses.", "References": [{"title": "Societies beyond oil: Oil dregs and social futures", "authors": "John Urry", "journal": "Zed Books", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.5040/9781350219786"}, {"title": "Adaptation, culture, and the energy transition in American coal country", "authors": "Sanya Carley, Tom P.
