{"Literature Review": "The study of cross-border politics, particularly focusing on diasporic mobilization and state responses, has emerged as a significant area of research in recent decades. This literature review aims to synthesize key findings and conceptual developments in this field, highlighting the complex interplay between diaspora communities, their countries of origin, and host nations.The transnational turn in social sciences, which began approximately four decades ago, has been instrumental in reshaping our understanding of cross-border political dynamics. Scholars like Glick Schiller et al. (1992) were among the first to propose a transnational framework for studying migration, emphasizing the ongoing connections migrants maintain with their homelands. This perspective challenged the traditional assimilation model and paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of immigrant experiences and political engagement.One of the central themes in the literature is the political nature of cross-border movements and how it influences diasporic mobilization. Østergaard-Nielsen (2003) argues that the political context in both home and host countries significantly shapes the opportunities and constraints for diaspora political engagement. This dual embeddedness of diaspora communities in two or more polities creates unique dynamics of political participation and identity formation.The types of cross-border political activities undertaken by diaspora communities have been a focus of numerous studies. Levitt and Glick Schiller (2004) propose a typology of transnational political practices, ranging from occasional participation in homeland politics to sustained, institutionalized forms of engagement. These activities can include voting in homeland elections, lobbying host country governments on issues related to the homeland, and participating in protest movements.Home state policies towards their diasporas have also received considerable scholarly attention. Gamlen (2014) introduces the concept of 'diaspora engagement policies,' highlighting how states actively seek to maintain connections with their emigrant populations for various political and economic reasons. These policies can range from extending voting rights to emigrants to creating dedicated government institutions for diaspora affairs.The role of technology in facilitating cross-border political mobilization is another important strand in the literature. Brinkerhoff (2009) examines how digital technologies enable diaspora communities to maintain ties with their homelands and engage in transnational political activities more effectively. Social media platforms, in particular, have emerged as crucial tools for diaspora political mobilization and information dissemination.Scholars have also explored the impact of diaspora political mobilization on international relations and conflict resolution. Adamson (2006) argues that diaspora communities can act as both peace-makers and conflict-entrepreneurs in their homelands, depending on the political context and their own interests. This dual potential of diasporas highlights the complex role they play in shaping global politics.The relationship between diaspora politics and nationalism has been another area of scholarly inquiry. Conversi (2012) examines how long-distance nationalism among diaspora communities can influence political dynamics in both home and host countries. This research underscores the enduring power of national identities in shaping political behavior across borders.Recent literature has also begun to address the changing geopolitical landscape and its implications for cross-border politics. Koinova (2018) explores how the rise of non-Western powers and the increasing multipolarity of the global order are reshaping diaspora politics and state responses. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of existing theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches in the field.The intersection of diaspora politics with issues of security and terrorism has gained prominence in the post-9/11 era. Baser (2015) examines how diaspora communities navigate the complex terrain of securitization and how states balance engagement with their diasporas against perceived security risks.In conclusion, the literature on cross-border politics, diasporic mobilization, and state responses has grown significantly since the transnational turn in social sciences. It has provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics. However, as the global political landscape continues to evolve, there is a need for ongoing research to address emerging challenges and opportunities in this field. Future studies should focus on the impact of rising populism, climate change-induced migration, and the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cross-border political mobilization and state responses.", "References": [{"title": "Towards a Transnational Perspective on Migration: Race, Class, Ethnicity, and Nationalism Reconsidered", "authors": "Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, Cristina Blanc-Szanton", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "year": "1992", "volumes": "645", "first page": "1", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb33484.x"}, {"title": "The politics of migrants' transnational political practices", "authors": "Eva Østergaard-Nielsen", "journal": "International Migration Review", "year": "2003", "volumes": "37", "first page": "760", "last page": "786", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00157.x"}, {"title": "Conceptualizing Simultaneity: A Transnational Social Field Perspective on Society", "authors": "Peggy Levitt, Nina Glick Schiller", "journal": "International Migration Review", "year": "2004", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1002", "last page": "1039", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1747-7379.2004.tb00227.x"}, {"title": "The Emigration State and the Modern Geopolitical Imagination", "authors": "Alan Gamlen", "journal": "Political Geography", "year": "2014", "volumes": "39", "first page": "16", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1016/j.polgeo.2013.12.003"}, {"title": "Digital Diasporas: Identity and Transnational Engagement", "authors": "Jennifer M.
