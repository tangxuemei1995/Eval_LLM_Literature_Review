{"Literature Review": "Land inequality in the United States is a complex and multifaceted issue that extends far beyond the conventional understanding of private property regimes. This literature review explores the diverse cultural, legal, and material forms of land ownership and control, as well as the resulting inequalities that emerge from these various systems.Traditionally, sociological studies outside of Indigenous research have tended to view land in the United States through the lens of a firmly established private property system, where land is primarily treated as a commodity subject to individual control (Blomley, 2004). However, recent scholarship has begun to challenge this oversimplified perspective, revealing a more nuanced and contingent reality of land ownership and use in the country.The dominant narrative of land as private property is deeply rooted in state law and related ideologies, which often present themselves as a unitary, coherent, and all-encompassing force (Singer, 2000). This hegemonic power has shaped much of the discourse surrounding land rights and ownership in the United States. Nevertheless, a growing body of research suggests that land takes on diverse forms and meanings beyond this narrow conception.One key area of focus in recent literature is the exploration of various land tenures. Scholars have identified multiple forms of land ownership and control that coexist within the United States, ranging from traditional private property to communal and public lands (Freyfogle, 2003). These different tenure systems often reflect historical, cultural, and legal contexts specific to particular regions or communities. For instance, research on Indigenous land rights has highlighted the persistence of traditional forms of land stewardship that challenge the dominant private property paradigm (Deloria & Lytle, 1984).Land regulations represent another crucial aspect of the complex landscape of land relations in the United States. Zoning laws, environmental regulations, and land-use policies all play significant roles in shaping how land is accessed, used, and controlled (Fischel, 2015). These regulatory frameworks can both reinforce existing inequalities and create opportunities for more equitable land distribution and use. For example, studies have shown how urban planning policies can either exacerbate or mitigate spatial segregation and unequal access to resources (Rothstein, 2017).The intersection of social identities with land ownership and control is a particularly fertile area of research in understanding land inequalities. Race, class, gender, and other social categories significantly influence individuals' and communities' relationships with land (Harris, 1993). Historical processes such as settler colonialism, slavery, and discriminatory housing policies have created enduring patterns of land inequality that continue to shape contemporary social landscapes (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014).Recent scholarship has also emphasized the role of marginalized groups in asserting their rights to land access, security, and meaning. This body of work highlights how communities resist and challenge dominant land regimes through various strategies, including legal action, social movements, and alternative land-use practices (Safransky, 2018). For instance, research on urban agriculture and community land trusts has shown how marginalized communities can create new forms of land tenure and use that prioritize collective well-being over individual profit (White, 2011).The environmental dimension of land inequality has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the context of climate change and environmental justice. Studies have shown how environmental hazards and benefits are unequally distributed across different social groups, often reflecting and reinforcing existing patterns of land inequality (Bullard, 2000). This research highlights the need for a more holistic understanding of land that incorporates ecological considerations alongside social and economic factors.In conclusion, the literature on land inequalities in the United States reveals a complex and dynamic landscape that goes beyond the simplistic notion of land as a commodity under individual control. By examining diverse land tenures, regulatory frameworks, and social identities, researchers have uncovered multiple forms of land relations that both perpetuate and challenge existing inequalities. This more nuanced understanding of land opens up new avenues for addressing persistent disparities and imagining more equitable and sustainable relationships with the land.", "References": [{"title": "Unsettling the City: Urban Land and the Politics of Property", "authors": "Nicholas Blomley", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2004", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203499801"}, {"title": "Entitlement: The Paradoxes of Property", "authors": "Joseph William Singer", "journal": "Yale University Press", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Land We Share: Private Property and the Common Good", "authors": "Eric T.
