{"Literature Review": "The study of social contexts and their impacts on children's outcomes has been a longstanding area of interest in social science research. Two primary contexts that have received significant attention are neighborhoods and schools. Historically, these contexts have been studied separately, with robust literatures developing around each. However, a growing body of research acknowledges the interconnected nature of these contexts and seeks to examine them jointly. This literature review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on neighborhood-school structures and their combined effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other well-being outcomes.Neighborhood effects research has consistently demonstrated that the characteristics of the areas in which children grow up can significantly influence their life outcomes. For instance, Sampson et al. (2002) found that neighborhood disadvantage was associated with lower verbal ability in children, even after controlling for family-level factors. Similarly, Chetty et al. (2016) showed that children who moved to lower-poverty neighborhoods at younger ages had better long-term outcomes in terms of college attendance and earnings.Parallel to neighborhood effects research, school effects studies have highlighted the crucial role of educational institutions in shaping children's trajectories. Coleman et al. (1966) pioneered this field with their seminal report on educational opportunity, which sparked decades of research on school quality and student outcomes. More recent work by Hanushek et al. (2014) has demonstrated that teacher quality within schools can have substantial impacts on students' long-term economic outcomes.As researchers began to recognize the interplay between neighborhoods and schools, a new wave of studies emerged that sought to disentangle their relative impacts. Wodtke and Parbst (2017) used counterfactual models to estimate the joint effects of neighborhood and school quality on high school graduation rates, finding that both contexts had significant, independent effects. Similarly, Owens (2010) examined how neighborhood and school socioeconomic composition jointly influenced college enrollment, concluding that both factors played important roles.However, the tendency to frame research questions in terms of which context matters more – neighborhoods or schools – has been critiqued by some scholars. Sharkey and Faber (2014) argue that this approach oversimplifies the complex relationships between these contexts and may lead to misguided policy recommendations. Instead, they propose a more nuanced understanding of how neighborhoods and schools interact and mutually reinforce each other.This call for a more integrated approach aligns with research on neighborhood and school selection processes. Families often choose neighborhoods and schools simultaneously, with school quality being a key factor in residential decisions. Tiebout (1956) first proposed the idea that households \"vote with their feet\" by moving to areas that provide their desired bundle of public goods, including schools. More recent work by Hoxby (2000) has shown how school choice programs can influence patterns of residential segregation.The cyclical relationship between neighborhoods and schools is further illuminated by research on segregation processes. Reardon and Owens (2014) demonstrate how racial and economic segregation in neighborhoods contributes to school segregation, which in turn reinforces residential patterns. This mutual constitution of neighborhoods and schools suggests that studying these contexts in isolation may miss important dynamics that shape children's opportunities and outcomes.Recognizing these complex interrelationships, we propose a reorientation of contextual effects research towards the study of local neighborhood-school structures. This approach would consider how families choose neighborhoods and schools, how these choices aggregate to create patterns of segregation, and how neighborhoods and schools mutually constitute each other over time. Such a framework could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which social contexts influence children's outcomes.This reorientation has implications for both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects and research on contextual selection and segregation. For the former, it suggests the need for more sophisticated methodological approaches that can account for the endogeneity of neighborhood and school selection. Multilevel structural equation modeling, as employed by Brännström (2008), offers one promising avenue for capturing these complex relationships.For studies of contextual selection and segregation, a focus on neighborhood-school structures highlights the importance of considering both residential and educational choices simultaneously. This could involve examining how school choice policies interact with housing markets to shape patterns of segregation, as explored by Saporito and Sohoni (2007).In conclusion, the joint study of neighborhoods and schools represents a crucial frontier in social context research. By moving beyond the question of which matters more and towards a more integrated understanding of neighborhood-school structures, researchers can gain deeper insights into the processes that shape children's opportunities and outcomes. This approach has the potential to inform more effective policies aimed at reducing inequalities and improving children's life chances across diverse contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Neighborhoods and academic achievement: Results from the Moving to Opportunity experiment", "authors": "Lawrence F.
