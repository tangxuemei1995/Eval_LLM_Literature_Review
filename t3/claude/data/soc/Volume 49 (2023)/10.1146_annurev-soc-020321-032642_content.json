{"Literature Review": "The concept of 'diverging destinies' has emerged as a powerful framework for understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic disparities, family behaviors, and intergenerational inequality. While this framework has been widely applied in Western contexts, its relevance and applicability to East Asian societies remain understudied. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and their impact on children's well-being in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with a focus on how the diverging destinies framework can inform our understanding of family change and inequality in these contexts.The diverging destinies framework, initially proposed by McLanahan (2004), posits that socioeconomic disparities in family behaviors, such as marriage, divorce, and childbearing patterns, contribute to widening inequalities among children. In Western societies, this framework has been instrumental in explaining how changes in family structure and parental resources affect children's life chances. However, the applicability of this framework to East Asian contexts requires careful consideration of the unique cultural, social, and economic factors that shape family dynamics in these societies.One key aspect of East Asian family systems is the highly asymmetric gender division of labor. Raymo et al. (2015) highlight that despite rapid economic development and increased female education, traditional gender roles persist in many East Asian countries. This persistence of gender inequality within families may have significant implications for the diverging destinies framework, as it affects patterns of family formation, dissolution, and investment in children.The strong emphasis on family investment in children is another crucial factor in East Asian societies. Heckman and Yi (2012) demonstrate that Chinese parents, regardless of socioeconomic status, place a high value on their children's education and are willing to make substantial investments in human capital development. This cultural emphasis on education may mitigate some of the negative effects of socioeconomic disparities on children's outcomes, as predicted by the diverging destinies framework.Limited public support for families is a common feature across East Asian welfare regimes. Esping-Andersen (1997) argues that East Asian welfare states are characterized by a strong reliance on family and market-based solutions, with minimal state intervention. This limited public support may exacerbate the impact of socioeconomic disparities on family behaviors and children's outcomes, potentially amplifying the diverging destinies effect.In the context of mainland China, research by Zhang and Xie (2019) reveals growing socioeconomic disparities in family behaviors, particularly in terms of marriage timing and fertility. They find that highly educated women are more likely to delay marriage and childbearing, which aligns with patterns observed in Western societies. However, the implications of these trends for children's well-being may differ due to China's unique social and policy context, including the legacy of the one-child policy.Japan presents a somewhat different picture, as documented by Raymo et al. (2019). While socioeconomic disparities in family behaviors exist, they are less pronounced than in Western societies. However, the persistent low fertility rate and increasing proportion of never-married individuals pose unique challenges for understanding diverging destinies in the Japanese context.South Korea, as studied by Park and Lee (2017), demonstrates clear socioeconomic gradients in family behaviors, particularly in terms of marriage and fertility. The authors find that highly educated women are more likely to delay or forgo marriage and childbearing, potentially leading to diverging destinies for children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.In Taiwan, research by Yu and Kuo (2016) indicates that while socioeconomic disparities in family behaviors exist, they are moderated by strong family ties and intergenerational support. This finding suggests that the impact of diverging destinies may be buffered by cultural factors that promote family solidarity.A comparative study by Frejka et al. (2010) across East Asian societies reveals common trends in family behaviors, including delayed marriage, increased singlehood, and very low fertility rates. These trends are more pronounced among highly educated individuals, suggesting a potential for diverging destinies. However, the authors caution against direct application of Western frameworks, emphasizing the need to consider East Asian cultural and institutional contexts.The limited empirical evaluations of the diverging destinies framework in East Asia highlight the need for more research in this area. While socioeconomic disparities in family behaviors are evident across East Asian societies, their implications for children's well-being and intergenerational inequality may differ from Western contexts due to unique cultural, social, and policy factors.In conclusion, while the diverging destinies framework provides a valuable starting point for understanding family change and inequality in East Asia, its application requires careful consideration of the region's distinct characteristics. Future research should focus on developing culturally sensitive adaptations of the framework that account for the highly asymmetric gender division of labor, strong emphasis on family investment in children, and limited public support for families in East Asian societies. Such research will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how socioeconomic disparities in family behaviors shape children's life chances in these rapidly changing societies.", "References": [{"title": "Diverging destinies: How children are faring under the second demographic transition", "authors": "Sara McLanahan", "journal": "Demography", "year": "2004", "volumes": "41", "first page": "607", "last page": "627", "DOI": "10.1353/dem.2004.0033"}, {"title": "Marriage and family in East Asia: Continuity and change", "authors": "James M.
