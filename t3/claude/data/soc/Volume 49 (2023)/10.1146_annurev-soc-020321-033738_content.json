{"Literature Review": "Ethnomethodology, a sociological approach introduced by Harold Garfinkel in the 1960s, has had a profound impact on the study of social interaction and the organization of everyday life. This literature review examines the development, key concepts, and diverse applications of ethnomethodology since its inception, highlighting its contributions to various fields of social research.Garfinkel's ethnomethodology emerged as a critique of prevailing sociological theories, particularly Talcott Parsons' structural functionalism. While drawing inspiration from Alfred Sch√ºtz's phenomenology and Max Weber's interpretive sociology, Garfinkel sought to understand how social order is produced and maintained through the mundane activities of everyday life (Rawls, 2002). Central to ethnomethodology is the concept of 'reflexivity,' which posits that people's actions simultaneously describe and constitute social reality (Heritage, 1984).One of the key contributions of ethnomethodology has been its focus on the problem of contextuality. Garfinkel drew upon Karl Mannheim's 'documentary method of interpretation' to explore how people make sense of their social world by treating observed events as 'documents' or evidence of underlying patterns (Garfinkel, 1967). This approach has been particularly influential in the study of how people navigate and construct meaning in various social contexts.Conversation Analysis (CA), developed by Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff, and Gail Jefferson, emerged as a distinct but related field to ethnomethodology. CA focuses on the detailed analysis of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction, examining how social actions are accomplished through talk (Sidnell & Stivers, 2013). This approach has revolutionized our understanding of social interaction, revealing the intricate organization of turn-taking, repair, and sequence organization in conversation.Another significant offshoot of ethnomethodology is Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA), which examines how people use categories to make sense of the social world and organize their interactions (Hester & Eglin, 1997). MCA has been particularly useful in studying how social identities are constructed and negotiated in everyday life, including issues related to race, gender, and other minoritized groups.Ethnomethodology has also made substantial contributions to the study of institutions and organizations. Studies in this area have examined how institutional realities are produced through the everyday practices of organizational members (Boden, 1994). Workplace studies, in particular, have revealed the complex ways in which work is accomplished through situated practices and the use of technology (Luff et al., 2000).The concept of 'instructed action,' introduced by Garfinkel, has been influential in studies of science, technology, and professional practice. This approach examines how people follow instructions and rules in various settings, revealing the complex interpretive work involved in seemingly straightforward tasks (Lynch, 1993). Such studies have provided valuable insights into the nature of scientific practice, technological use, and professional expertise.Ethnomethodology has also made significant contributions to the study of social problems and deviance. By focusing on how people categorize and make sense of 'problematic' behaviors, ethnomethodological studies have challenged traditional approaches to deviance and social control (Wieder, 1974). This perspective has been particularly influential in studies of mental illness, crime, and other forms of social marginalization.In the field of law and legal studies, ethnomethodology has provided valuable insights into the production of legal facts and the negotiation of justice in courtroom interactions (Atkinson & Drew, 1979). These studies have revealed the complex interactional work involved in legal proceedings and have implications for understanding the nature of legal reasoning and decision-making.Ethnomethodology's concern with the conduct of social sciences has led to critical examinations of research practices themselves. Studies have explored how coding is done in qualitative research, how surveys are conducted, and how standardization is achieved in scientific practice (Cicourel, 1964). This reflexive approach to social scientific methods has contributed to ongoing debates about the nature of sociological knowledge and the relationship between theory and method.Despite its significant contributions, ethnomethodology has faced criticism for its perceived lack of generalizability and its focus on micro-level interactions at the expense of broader social structures. However, proponents argue that by revealing the intricate details of social order production, ethnomethodology provides a crucial foundation for understanding larger social phenomena (Maynard & Clayman, 1991).In conclusion, ethnomethodology has left a lasting legacy on sociological research, spawning numerous subfields and innovative research programs. Its emphasis on the detailed examination of everyday practices has provided valuable insights into the organization of social life across various domains. As social interaction increasingly occurs in digital spaces and new forms of technology mediate human relationships, ethnomethodology's tools and perspectives continue to offer valuable approaches for understanding the evolving nature of social order in the 21st century.", "References": [{"title": "Ethnomethodology's Program: Working Out Durkheim's Aphorism", "authors": "Anne Warfield Rawls", "journal": "Rowman & Littlefield Publishers", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4615-0859-4"}, {"title": "Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology", "authors": "John Heritage", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "1984", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Studies in Ethnomethodology", "authors": "Harold Garfinkel", "journal": "Prentice-Hall", "year": "1967", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Handbook of Conversation Analysis", "authors": "Jack Sidnell, Tanya Stivers", "journal": "Wiley-Blackwell", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/9781118325001"}, {"title": "Culture in Action: Studies in Membership Categorization Analysis", "authors": "Stephen Hester, Peter Eglin", "journal": "University Press of America", "year": "1997", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Action of Organizational Talk", "authors": "Deirdre Boden", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "1994", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Workplace Studies: Recovering Work Practice and Informing System Design", "authors": "Paul Luff, Jon Hindmarsh, Christian Heath", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511628122"}, {"title": "Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science", "authors": "Michael Lynch", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "1993", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511625473"}, {"title": "Language and Social Reality: The Case of Telling the Convict Code", "authors": "D.
