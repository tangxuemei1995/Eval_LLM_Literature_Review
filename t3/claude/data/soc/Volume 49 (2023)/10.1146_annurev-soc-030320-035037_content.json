{"Literature Review": "The legitimacy of science has become a critical concern in the face of global challenges such as the ongoing pandemic and the climate crisis. This literature review examines the complex interplay between science, culture, and society, focusing on the internal and external threats to scientific legitimacy in the early twenty-first century.Internal threats to scientific legitimacy have been extensively studied in recent years. One of the most pressing issues is scientific fraud, which undermines the credibility of research findings. Fanelli (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of surveys on scientific misconduct, revealing that a significant proportion of scientists admit to engaging in questionable research practices. This problem is compounded by the replication crisis, where many published scientific findings fail to be reproduced in subsequent studies. Ioannidis (2005) famously argued that most published research findings are false, highlighting the need for improved research methods and reporting practices.The diffusion and equitability of scientific knowledge present another internal challenge. Larivière et al. (2015) demonstrated that scientific publishing is dominated by a small number of large commercial publishers, potentially limiting access to research findings. This concentration of power in scientific communication can exacerbate existing inequalities in the scientific community and hinder the democratization of knowledge.Disciplinary fragmentation is another internal threat to scientific legitimacy. As scientific fields become increasingly specialized, communication between disciplines becomes more challenging. Jacobs and Frickel (2009) argue that while interdisciplinarity is often touted as a solution, it faces significant institutional and cultural barriers within academia.The overproduction of scientific literature is also a growing concern. Bornmann and Mutz (2015) found that the number of scientific publications has been doubling approximately every nine years, raising questions about quality control and the ability of researchers to keep up with the latest findings in their fields.External threats to scientific legitimacy are equally significant and often intertwined with broader societal issues. Political polarization has become a major challenge to scientific consensus on critical issues such as climate change and vaccine efficacy. Drummond and Fischhoff (2017) found that political ideology is a strong predictor of beliefs about scientific topics, suggesting that scientific communication must contend with deeply held political identities.The rise of authoritarianism in various parts of the world poses another external threat to scientific legitimacy. Gieryn (1999) argues that the boundaries between science and non-science are constantly negotiated in the public sphere, and authoritarian regimes often seek to control or manipulate scientific discourse for political ends.Religious beliefs can also conflict with scientific findings, particularly in areas such as evolution and stem cell research. Evans (2011) explores the complex relationship between religion and science, noting that while conflict is not inevitable, certain religious beliefs can lead to rejection of scientific consensus.The rapid advancement of information technology has transformed the way scientific information is disseminated and consumed. While this has democratized access to knowledge, it has also facilitated the spread of misinformation. Vosoughi et al. (2018) found that false news spreads more rapidly and widely on social media than true news, posing a significant challenge to scientific communication.Economic factors also play a crucial role in shaping scientific legitimacy. Mirowski (2011) argues that the increasing commercialization of science, particularly in universities, has led to a shift in research priorities and potentially compromised scientific integrity.The field of sociology, while well-positioned to study these issues, faces its own legitimacy challenges. Burawoy (2005) calls for a 'public sociology' that engages more directly with societal issues, but this approach has been met with skepticism from some within the discipline.In conclusion, the legitimacy of science faces numerous internal and external threats in the twenty-first century. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from within the scientific community, as well as broader societal engagement with scientific issues. As global crises continue to underscore the importance of scientific knowledge and expertise, maintaining and strengthening the legitimacy of science remains a critical task for researchers, policymakers, and the public alike.", "References": [{"title": "How many scientists fabricate and falsify research?
