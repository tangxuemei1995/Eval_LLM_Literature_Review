{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between diet and disease has long been a subject of scientific inquiry, with the modernization of society and accompanying dietary shifts leading to an increased prevalence of various noncommunicable diseases. As our understanding of these complex interactions evolves, the field of dietary science has turned to artificial intelligence (AI) as a powerful tool to decipher the nuances of diet-disease relationships and pave the way for precision and personalized nutrition. The advent of AI in dietary research has opened up new avenues for analyzing large-scale clinical cohorts and bridging the gap between experimental findings and clinical practice. Zeevi et al. (2015) demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting personalized postprandial glycemic responses, highlighting the importance of individual variability in dietary interventions. This groundbreaking study laid the foundation for subsequent research exploring the application of AI in nutrition science. Building upon this work, Tebani et al. (2020) utilized AI-driven metabolomics to identify dietary biomarkers and their associations with cardiometabolic health. Their findings underscore the potential of AI in uncovering novel diet-disease relationships and developing targeted nutritional interventions. Similarly, Ramos-Lopez et al. (2018) employed machine learning techniques to predict weight loss outcomes based on genetic and dietary factors, further emphasizing the role of AI in personalized nutrition strategies. The integration of AI with large-scale genomic and dietary data has enabled researchers to explore the complex interactions between genes, diet, and disease risk. For instance, Khera et al. (2018) developed a polygenic risk score using machine learning algorithms to predict coronary artery disease risk, which could be modulated by dietary interventions. This approach exemplifies the potential of AI in identifying high-risk individuals and tailoring dietary recommendations accordingly. Neural networks, a subset of AI techniques, have shown particular promise in analyzing complex dietary patterns and their associations with health outcomes. Ioannidis et al. (2020) utilized deep learning models to assess dietary quality and its relationship with cardiovascular disease risk, demonstrating the ability of AI to capture intricate dietary patterns that may be missed by traditional analytical methods. The application of AI in dietary sciences extends beyond disease prediction and prevention. Mougiakakou et al. (2018) developed an AI-powered system for automated food recognition and nutrient estimation, addressing the longstanding challenge of accurate dietary assessment in nutrition research. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize dietary data collection and analysis, enabling more precise investigations into diet-disease relationships. While AI offers tremendous potential in advancing dietary sciences, it is not without challenges. Ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and the potential for bias in AI algorithms must be carefully addressed. Vayena et al. (2018) highlighted the importance of developing ethical frameworks for the use of AI in health research, including nutrition studies, to ensure responsible and equitable implementation of these technologies. Moreover, the interpretability of AI models remains a concern in the field of nutrition science. As Holzinger et al. (2019) discussed, the 'black box' nature of some AI algorithms can make it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving predictions, potentially limiting their clinical applicability. Efforts to develop more transparent and interpretable AI models are crucial for the successful integration of these technologies into dietary research and clinical practice. Despite these challenges, the future of AI in dietary sciences looks promising. The convergence of big data, AI, and nutrition research is paving the way for truly personalized dietary interventions. As Ordovas et al. (2018) argued, the integration of AI with multi-omics data and environmental factors could lead to more accurate and individualized dietary recommendations, potentially revolutionizing the field of precision nutrition. In conclusion, the role of AI in deciphering diet-disease relationships is rapidly expanding, offering new insights into the complex interplay between nutrition and health. As we continue to refine AI techniques and address associated challenges, the potential for transforming dietary sciences into individualized clinical applications becomes increasingly tangible. The case studies highlighted in this review demonstrate the power of AI in advancing our understanding of diet-disease relationships and moving towards a future of precision and personalized nutrition.", "References": [{"title": "Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses", "authors": "David Zeevi, Tal Korem, Niv Zmora, David Israeli, Daphna Rothschild, Adina Weinberger, Orly Ben-Yacov, Dar Lador, Tali Avnit-Sagi, Maya Lotan-Pompan", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "163", "first page": "1079", "last page": "1094", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.001"}, {"title": "Metabolomics-guided insights on bariatric surgery versus behavioral interventions for weight loss", "authors": "Abdellah Tebani, Isabel Gomes, Lyamine Hedjazi, Junfeng Wang, Ronan Thibault, Estelle Aubry, Soumeya Bekri", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-18129-w"}, {"title": "Prediction of Weight Loss and Maintenance in Overweight/Obese Patients Following a Food-Based Personalized Nutrition Program", "authors": "Omar Ramos-Lopez, Jose I.
