{"Literature Review": "The concept of nutrition security has emerged as a critical area of focus in public health and food policy, extending beyond the well-established notion of food security. While food security primarily concerns access to sufficient food, nutrition security encompasses the broader goal of ensuring access to nutritionally adequate and balanced diets that promote optimal health outcomes. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of nutrition security, its relationship to food security, and the importance of its assessment and monitoring in the United States. Food security has been extensively studied and monitored in the United States, with the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) playing a pivotal role in data collection and research (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2020). However, the concept of nutrition security is relatively new and lacks a standardized definition or measurement tool. This gap in understanding presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers and policymakers alike. The relationship between food security and nutrition security is complex and multifaceted. While food security is a necessary precondition for nutrition security, it does not guarantee it. Studies have shown that food-secure households may still experience poor diet quality and nutritional outcomes due to various factors, including food choices, nutritional knowledge, and environmental influences (Mozaffarian et al., 2018). Conversely, some food-insecure households may prioritize nutritional quality despite limited resources, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of these concepts. A key aspect of nutrition security is the emphasis on healthy diets. Research has consistently demonstrated the importance of dietary quality in preventing chronic diseases and promoting overall health (Afshin et al., 2019). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide evidence-based recommendations for healthy eating patterns, but adherence to these guidelines varies widely across the population (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Factors influencing dietary choices include socioeconomic status, food environment, cultural preferences, and nutrition education (Story et al., 2008). Nutritional status, another crucial component of nutrition security, encompasses various physiological indicators of health and well-being. These include anthropometric measures (e.g., body mass index, waist circumference), biochemical markers (e.g., serum nutrient levels), and clinical assessments of nutrient deficiencies or excesses (Gibson, 2005). Monitoring these indicators at the population level provides valuable insights into the overall nutritional health of the nation and helps identify vulnerable groups requiring targeted interventions. The assessment and monitoring of nutrition security present unique challenges due to its multidimensional nature. While food security can be measured using validated tools such as the USDA's Household Food Security Survey Module, no such standardized measure exists for nutrition security (Gundersen and Ziliak, 2015). Developing comprehensive and reliable assessment tools for nutrition security will require interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of diverse data sources. One promising approach to assessing nutrition security is the use of dietary quality indices, such as the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI). These indices provide a quantitative measure of adherence to dietary guidelines and have been associated with various health outcomes (Schwingshackl and Hoffmann, 2015). However, they may not capture all aspects of nutrition security, such as the stability of access to healthy foods over time or the cultural appropriateness of diets. The importance of monitoring nutrition security cannot be overstated. Regular assessment allows for the identification of trends, disparities, and emerging issues in population nutrition. This information is crucial for informing policy decisions, designing targeted interventions, and evaluating the effectiveness of existing programs (Pérez-Escamilla and Segall-Corrêa, 2008). Moreover, monitoring nutrition security can help in addressing health inequities by identifying vulnerable populations and allocating resources more effectively. As research on nutrition security progresses, several key areas warrant further investigation. These include the development of validated measurement tools, exploration of the social and environmental determinants of nutrition security, and examination of the long-term health and economic impacts of nutrition insecurity. Additionally, studies investigating the effectiveness of various interventions in promoting nutrition security, such as nutrition education programs, food assistance policies, and environmental modifications, will be crucial in informing evidence-based strategies. In conclusion, the concept of nutrition security represents an important evolution in our understanding of the relationship between food, nutrition, and health. While building upon the established framework of food security, nutrition security emphasizes the quality and adequacy of diets in promoting optimal health outcomes. The development of a standardized conceptual framework and measurement tools for nutrition security is essential for advancing research, policy, and practice in this field. By prioritizing the assessment and monitoring of nutrition security, the United States can take significant strides towards improving population health and reducing nutrition-related disparities.", "References": [{"title": "Household Food Security in the United States in 2019", "authors": "Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Matthew P.
