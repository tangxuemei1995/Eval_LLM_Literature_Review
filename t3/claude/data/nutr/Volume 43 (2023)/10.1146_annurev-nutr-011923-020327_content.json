{"Literature Review": "Dietary supplements (DS) have become an integral part of many individuals' nutritional intake, with their use widespread across various populations. As such, understanding the role of dietary supplements in health and disease has become increasingly important in nutritional research. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the best methods to measure DS use accurately. This literature review aims to explore the current state of research on DS assessment methods, their validity, and reproducibility, while highlighting the major gaps in our understanding.The importance of precise dietary assessment in nutritional research cannot be overstated. It is crucial for accurate exposure classification when studying the relationship between diet and health outcomes. With DS use becoming more prevalent, it has become a considerable source of nutrients for many individuals. However, the assessment of DS use presents unique challenges that are distinct from traditional dietary assessment methods.Several studies have attempted to compare different methods of measuring DS use, including product inventories, questionnaires, and 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR). Thompson et al. (2015) conducted a comprehensive review of DS assessment methods and found that each approach has its strengths and limitations. They noted that while questionnaires are often more practical for large-scale studies, they may not capture the full range of supplements consumed or provide accurate information on dosage.The validity of DS assessment methods is a critical concern in nutritional research. Interestingly, there is no established gold standard for validating DS use, which complicates the evaluation of different assessment tools. In a study by Patterson et al. (2010), they compared a self-administered questionnaire with a detailed in-person interview and found good agreement for commonly used supplements. However, they also noted discrepancies in reporting less frequently used supplements, highlighting the need for more comprehensive assessment tools.Reproducibility of DS assessment methods is another crucial factor to consider. Satia et al. (2003) examined the reproducibility of a self-administered questionnaire over a two-year period and found acceptable consistency for commonly used supplements. However, they observed lower reproducibility for less frequently used supplements, suggesting that the stability of DS use patterns over time may vary depending on the type of supplement.The inventory method has shown promise in capturing more accurate information on nutrient amounts from supplements. Bailey et al. (2013) compared the inventory method with 24HR and found that the inventory approach provided more detailed and accurate information on supplement ingredients and dosages. However, they also noted that the inventory method is more time-consuming and may not be feasible for large-scale studies.One of the major gaps in our understanding of DS assessment relates to the measurement of actual nutrient intake from supplements. Millen et al. (2016) highlighted the challenges in accurately quantifying nutrient intake from DS, particularly when considering variations in product formulations and individual adherence to recommended dosages. They emphasized the need for more sophisticated methods to capture these nuances in DS use.Another significant gap in the literature is the lack of studies examining the validity and reproducibility of DS assessment methods in diverse populations. Most of the existing research has been conducted in predominantly white, middle-class populations in the United States. Burnett-Hartman et al. (2009) pointed out the need for more research on DS use patterns and assessment methods in minority and low-income populations, where DS use may differ significantly from the general population.The integration of DS assessment into broader dietary assessment methods presents another challenge. Subar et al. (2013) discussed the complexities of incorporating DS information into total nutrient intake estimates, particularly when using methods like food frequency questionnaires or 24HR. They emphasized the need for more research on how to best combine information from different assessment tools to provide a comprehensive picture of nutrient intake from both food and supplements.The rapid evolution of the DS market also poses challenges for assessment methods. New products are constantly being introduced, and existing products may change their formulations. Dwyer et al. (2018) highlighted the need for more dynamic and frequently updated assessment tools that can keep pace with these changes in the DS landscape.In conclusion, while progress has been made in understanding DS assessment methods, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. The lack of a gold standard for validation, challenges in capturing accurate nutrient intake information, limited research in diverse populations, and the dynamic nature of the DS market all contribute to these gaps. Future research should focus on developing more comprehensive and adaptable assessment tools, validating these tools across diverse populations, and exploring innovative methods to integrate DS information into overall dietary assessment. Only through addressing these gaps can we hope to gain a more complete understanding of DS use in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Dietary supplement use in the United States, 2003â€“2006", "authors": "Regan L.
