{"Literature Review": "Osteocalcin, a protein primarily secreted by osteoblasts, has emerged as a multifaceted hormone with far-reaching effects on various physiological processes. This literature review aims to explore the diverse functions of osteocalcin, with a particular focus on its role in energy metabolism, while also touching upon its other significant functions.Osteocalcin was initially identified as a bone-specific protein involved in bone mineralization. However, groundbreaking research by Lee et al. (2007) revealed that osteocalcin also functions as an endocrine hormone, regulating glucose homeostasis and fat mass. This discovery opened up a new field of research exploring the endocrine functions of bone.The regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin has been extensively studied. Ferron et al. (2010) demonstrated that osteocalcin improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice. The hormone acts on pancreatic β-cells to promote insulin secretion and on adipose tissue to enhance insulin sensitivity. Moreover, osteocalcin has been shown to increase energy expenditure and reduce fat mass, suggesting a potential role in obesity prevention (Ferron et al., 2012).The molecular mechanisms underlying osteocalcin's metabolic effects have been elucidated in recent years. Wei et al. (2014) identified GPRC6A as the osteocalcin receptor in pancreatic β-cells and showed that osteocalcin binding to this receptor activates a cAMP-dependent pathway, leading to increased insulin secretion. In adipose tissue, osteocalcin has been found to promote adiponectin expression, an adipokine known for its insulin-sensitizing effects (Oury et al., 2011).Interestingly, the endocrine functions of osteocalcin are primarily mediated by its undercarboxylated form. Ferron et al. (2015) demonstrated that the acid environment of bone resorption lacunae promotes the decarboxylation of osteocalcin, enabling its release into the circulation and subsequent hormonal actions. This finding highlights the importance of bone remodeling in regulating osteocalcin's endocrine functions.Beyond energy metabolism, osteocalcin has been implicated in various other physiological processes. Oury et al. (2013) revealed a surprising role for osteocalcin in male fertility. The hormone was found to regulate testosterone production in Leydig cells of the testes, thereby influencing male reproductive function. This discovery further expanded the concept of bone as an endocrine organ.Recent studies have also uncovered a role for osteocalcin in brain function and behavior. Khrimian et al. (2017) demonstrated that osteocalcin crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to neurons in the brainstem, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The hormone was found to promote neurotransmitter synthesis, enhance memory, and reduce anxiety-like behavior in mice. These findings suggest a potential link between bone health and cognitive function.The influence of osteocalcin extends to muscle function and exercise capacity. Mera et al. (2016) showed that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is necessary for adaptation to exercise in mice. The hormone was found to promote nutrient uptake and utilization in muscle cells, thereby enhancing exercise capacity. This discovery provides a molecular basis for the well-established link between bone health and physical activity.Osteocalcin has also been implicated in the acute stress response. Berger et al. (2019) demonstrated that acute stress triggers a rapid rise in circulating osteocalcin levels, which in turn promotes the release of glutamate in the brain. This mechanism was found to be necessary for the adaptive behavioral and physiological responses to acute stress, revealing a novel function of osteocalcin in stress management.The diverse functions of osteocalcin raise questions about its evolutionary significance. Karsenty and Olson (2016) proposed a unifying hypothesis suggesting that the endocrine functions of osteocalcin evolved as an adaptive mechanism to combat acute danger. They argue that the ability of osteocalcin to rapidly mobilize energy, enhance physical performance, and modulate brain function would have provided a survival advantage in threatening situations.In conclusion, the discovery of osteocalcin as a multifaceted hormone has revolutionized our understanding of bone biology and revealed unexpected connections between skeletal physiology and various other physiological systems. From regulating energy metabolism to influencing brain function and stress responses, osteocalcin emerges as a key player in maintaining whole-body homeostasis. Future research will undoubtedly continue to unravel the complex functions of this remarkable bone-derived hormone, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for metabolic, neurological, and bone disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Endocrine regulation of energy metabolism by the skeleton", "authors": "Na Kyung Lee, Hideaki Sowa, Eiichi Hinoi, Mathieu Ferron, Jong Deok Ahn, Cyrille Confavreux, Romain Dacquin, Patrick J.
