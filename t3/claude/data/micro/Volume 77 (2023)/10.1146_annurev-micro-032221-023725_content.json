{"Literature Review": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a fascinating physiological process that allows certain microorganisms to reduce or oxidize molecules and minerals beyond their cell surface. This capability has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in bioremediation, microbial fuel cells, and bioelectrochemical systems. The two most extensively studied bacterial genera exhibiting EET are Shewanella and Geobacter, which have become model organisms for understanding this unique respiratory process.The ability of Shewanella and Geobacter to couple their growth to the reduction of extracellular iron or manganese oxide minerals was first reported in the late 20th century (Lovley et al., 1987; Myers and Nealson, 1988). Since then, research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying EET, with significant progress made in understanding how electrons are transferred from the inner membrane to the outer surface of these bacteria.One of the key components in EET is the presence of c-type cytochromes, which are heme-containing proteins capable of accepting, holding, and donating electrons. In Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a model organism for studying EET, the Mtr pathway plays a crucial role in transferring electrons across the outer membrane (Shi et al., 2016). This pathway consists of a series of multiheme c-type cytochromes, including CymA, MtrA, MtrC, and OmcA, which form a chain that conducts electrons from the inner membrane to the cell surface (Breuer et al., 2015).Similarly, Geobacter sulfurreducens utilizes a network of c-type cytochromes for EET, with key players including the inner membrane-associated ImcH and CbcL, periplasmic PpcA, and outer membrane-associated OmcB, OmcE, and OmcS (Lovley, 2012). The arrangement and interactions of these cytochromes facilitate electron transfer across the cell envelope to external electron acceptors.While the mechanisms of electron transfer across the outer membrane have been well-characterized, recent research has revealed a more diverse and complex set of strategies for transferring electrons to distant acceptors. One such mechanism involves the use of electron shuttles, which are small molecules that can carry electrons between the cell surface and external electron acceptors. Shewanella species are known to secrete flavins, such as riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide, which can act as electron shuttles (Marsili et al., 2008). These flavins can enhance the rate of electron transfer to solid electron acceptors and may play a crucial role in long-range electron transfer.Another intriguing mechanism for long-range electron transfer is the production of electrically conductive pili, also known as nanowires. Geobacter species have been shown to produce these protein filaments, which can conduct electrons over distances of several micrometers (Reguera et al., 2005). These nanowires are composed of the PilA protein and are decorated with cytochromes, allowing for efficient electron transport along their length (Malvankar et al., 2011).Recent studies have also revealed the potential for interspecies electron transfer, where electrons can be transferred between different microbial species. This process, known as direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), has been observed in syntrophic communities involving Geobacter species (Summers et al., 2010). DIET allows for more efficient electron transfer compared to traditional syntrophic relationships that rely on the diffusion of metabolites.The ability of certain bacteria to transfer electrons to distant acceptors has significant implications for various environmental and biotechnological applications. In the field of bioremediation, EET-capable microorganisms can be used to reduce and immobilize toxic metal contaminants in soil and groundwater (Lovley et al., 1991). Additionally, the capacity for long-range electron transfer has been exploited in the development of microbial fuel cells, where bacteria can generate electricity by transferring electrons to an electrode (Logan et al., 2006).Furthermore, the study of EET has led to the discovery of cable bacteria, which are filamentous bacteria capable of conducting electrons over centimeter-scale distances (Pfeffer et al., 2012). These organisms have been found to play important roles in marine and freshwater sediments, coupling sulfide oxidation in deeper anoxic layers to oxygen reduction at the sediment surface.As research in this field continues to advance, new questions and challenges emerge. The exact mechanisms of long-range electron transfer, particularly in natural environments with complex mineral structures and microbial communities, remain to be fully elucidated. Additionally, the potential for engineering microorganisms with enhanced EET capabilities for specific applications is an area of active investigation.In conclusion, the study of extracellular electron transfer has revealed a remarkable diversity of mechanisms by which bacteria can transfer electrons beyond their outer membrane. From well-characterized pathways involving c-type cytochromes to more recently discovered mechanisms such as electron shuttles and conductive pili, these processes enable microorganisms to interact with their environment in unique ways. As our understanding of EET continues to grow, so too does the potential for harnessing this capability in various biotechnological and environmental applications.", "References": [{"title": "Dissimilatory Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction", "authors": "Derek R.
