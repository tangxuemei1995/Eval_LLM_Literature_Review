{"Literature Review": "The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. Among these, bacteriophages (phages) - viruses that infect bacteria - are the most abundant biological entities in the gut, outnumbering bacterial cells by an order of magnitude. The collective community of phages in the gut, known as the gut phageome, plays a crucial role in shaping the composition and function of the gut microbiome, thereby influencing human health and disease.Recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools have enabled researchers to delve deeper into the structure and dynamics of the gut phageome. Shkoporov and Hill (2019) provided a comprehensive overview of the gut virome, highlighting the predominance of tailed bacteriophages belonging to the order Caudovirales and the presence of crAss-like phages as the most abundant viral family in the human gut. This study emphasized the need for standardized methods in gut virome research to ensure comparability across different studies.One of the key factors affecting the composition of the gut phageome is age. Lim et al. (2020) demonstrated that the gut phageome undergoes significant changes during early life, with a shift from a highly dynamic and diverse community in infancy to a more stable and less diverse one in adulthood. This transition is closely linked to the maturation of the gut microbiome and the development of the immune system. The authors also noted that perturbations during this critical period could have long-lasting effects on gut health.Diet is another crucial factor influencing the gut phageome. Gogokhia et al. (2019) showed that dietary interventions can rapidly alter the composition of the gut phageome. They found that a high-fat diet led to an increase in the abundance of certain phage families, which in turn affected the bacterial community structure. This study highlighted the potential of using dietary interventions to modulate the gut phageome for therapeutic purposes.Geographical location has also been shown to impact the gut phageome composition. Guerin et al. (2018) conducted a large-scale study comparing the gut viromes of individuals from different countries and found significant variations in phage diversity and abundance across populations. These differences were attributed to a combination of factors, including diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures, underscoring the complex interplay between host, environment, and the gut phageome.The role of the gut phageome in human health and disease has been a subject of intense research in recent years. Clooney et al. (2019) reported alterations in the gut phageome composition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with an increase in the abundance of Caudovirales phages. They proposed that these changes could contribute to the dysbiosis observed in IBD and potentially exacerbate inflammation.Similarly, Zuo et al. (2019) found significant differences in the gut phageome of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to healthy controls. They observed an enrichment of certain phage taxa in IBS patients, which correlated with specific bacterial changes and symptom severity. This study suggested that phages could play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS by modulating the gut microbiome.In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), Nakatsu et al. (2018) reported distinct alterations in the gut virome of CRC patients. They identified specific phage signatures associated with different stages of CRC progression, suggesting the potential use of phageome profiles as biomarkers for CRC detection and prognosis.While these studies provide valuable insights into the role of the gut phageome in health and disease, it is important to note that the field faces several challenges. Sutton and Hill (2019) highlighted the lack of standardization in gut virome research as a major hurdle, leading to variations in reported results across studies. They emphasized the need for consistent sampling, sequencing, and bioinformatics protocols to ensure reproducibility and comparability of findings.Furthermore, Garmaeva et al. (2019) discussed the technical challenges in studying the gut phageome, including the difficulty in isolating and characterizing novel phages, the limited availability of reference genomes, and the complexity of phage-bacteria interactions. They proposed integrative approaches combining metagenomics, culturomics, and functional studies to overcome these limitations and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the gut phageome.In conclusion, the human gut phageome is a dynamic and complex ecosystem that plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health. Factors such as age, diet, and geography significantly influence its composition and function. While alterations in the gut phageome have been associated with various diseases, further research is needed to elucidate the causal relationships and potential therapeutic applications. Addressing the challenges of standardization and technical limitations will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the gut phageome and its impact on human health.", "References": [{"title": "The Human Gut Virome: A Multifaceted Majority", "authors": "Andrey N.
