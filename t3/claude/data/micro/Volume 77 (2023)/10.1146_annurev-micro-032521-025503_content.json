{"Literature Review": "The bacterial flagellum and injectisome are two remarkable nanomachines that play crucial roles in bacterial motility and pathogenesis, respectively. At the core of both structures lies a conserved export machinery known as the type III secretion system (T3SS). Recent advances in structural biology, particularly in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques, have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture and function of these complex systems.The bacterial flagellum, a rotary motor responsible for cellular motility, has been a subject of extensive research for decades. Its structure consists of three main parts: the basal body, the hook, and the filament. The basal body, embedded in the cell envelope, houses the T3SS export apparatus and the rotary motor. Recent cryo-EM studies have revealed the intricate details of the flagellar basal body at near-atomic resolution. For instance, Tan et al. (2021) reported the structure of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellar basal body, providing insights into the assembly and function of the C-ring, a crucial component for torque generation and directional switching.The injectisome, on the other hand, is a specialized T3SS found in various pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia. It functions as a molecular syringe, delivering effector proteins directly into host cells to modulate cellular processes and promote infection. Structurally, the injectisome shares similarities with the flagellar basal body but lacks the components required for motility. Instead, it possesses additional elements tailored for host cell interaction and effector translocation. A groundbreaking study by Hu et al. (2017) used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the native structure of the Salmonella T3SS injectisome in situ, revealing the organization of its components within the bacterial envelope.The core export apparatus of both the flagellum and injectisome consists of several conserved membrane proteins, including FlhA/SctV, FlhB/SctU, FliP/SctR, FliQ/SctS, and FliR/SctT. These proteins form an export gate complex that facilitates the passage of substrates through the inner membrane. Recent structural studies have provided valuable insights into the organization and function of this complex. For example, Kuhlen et al. (2018) determined the cryo-EM structure of the export gate complex from the Salmonella flagellar system, revealing a helical assembly of FliP subunits that forms the central pore of the complex.One of the most striking differences between the flagellum and injectisome lies in their cytoplasmic components. The flagellum possesses a C-ring composed of FliG, FliM, and FliY proteins, which play a crucial role in torque generation and directional switching. In contrast, the injectisome features a sorting platform consisting of SctQ, SctL, and SctK proteins, which are involved in substrate recognition and secretion regulation. Structural studies by Hu et al. (2015) and Bernal et al. (2019) have elucidated the architecture of these cytoplasmic components in both systems, highlighting their distinct functions.The evolutionary relationship between the flagellum and injectisome has been a subject of intense debate. It is generally believed that the injectisome evolved from the flagellum through a process of reductive evolution, losing motility-related components while acquiring specialized elements for host cell interaction. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses by Abby and Rocha (2012) have provided evidence supporting this hypothesis, tracing the evolutionary trajectory of T3SSs across diverse bacterial lineages.Recent structural studies have also shed light on the mechanisms of substrate recognition and secretion in T3SSs. The ATPase complex, composed of FliI/SctN (ATPase), FliH/SctL (stator), and FliJ/SctO (stalk), plays a crucial role in energizing the export process and unfolding substrates prior to secretion. Imada et al. (2016) reported the crystal structure of the Salmonella FliI-FliH complex, providing insights into the molecular basis of ATP hydrolysis and its coupling to protein export.The needle complex, a hallmark feature of the injectisome, has been the focus of numerous structural studies. Recent high-resolution cryo-EM structures, such as those reported by Hu et al. (2018) for the Salmonella SPI-1 needle complex, have revealed the intricate interactions between needle subunits and their assembly mechanism. These studies have also provided insights into the molecular basis of host cell sensing and the initiation of effector translocation.In conclusion, the recent advancements in cryo-EM and cryo-ET technologies have revolutionized our understanding of T3SSs in both the bacterial flagellum and injectisome. These structural insights, combined with functional studies, have illuminated the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial motility and pathogenesis. As research in this field continues to progress, we can anticipate further revelations about the structure, function, and evolution of these fascinating bacterial nanomachines, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting T3SSs in pathogenic bacteria.", "References": [{"title": "Structure of the native Salmonella T3SS injectisome in situ reveals a secretion-active state", "authors": "Bo Hu, Dustin R.
