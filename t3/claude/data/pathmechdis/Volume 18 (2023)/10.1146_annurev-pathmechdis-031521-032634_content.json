{"Literature Review": "Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. This condition affects approximately 1% of the global population and is characterized by a range of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. The immunobiology and pathogenesis of CD have been extensively studied, revealing a intricate interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune responses.At the core of CD pathogenesis lies the interaction between gluten peptides and the immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, particularly HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, play a crucial role in disease development. Sollid et al. (2012) demonstrated that these HLA molecules present modified gluten peptides to CD4+ T cells, initiating an adaptive immune response. This genetic association is so strong that approximately 95% of CD patients carry HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8, or both.The journey of gluten peptides from the gut lumen to the lamina propria is facilitated by increased intestinal permeability, a hallmark of CD. Fasano and Shea-Donohue (2005) proposed that gliadin, a component of gluten, induces the release of zonulin, a protein that regulates tight junctions between enterocytes. This leads to increased intestinal permeability, allowing gluten peptides to cross the epithelial barrier and interact with immune cells in the lamina propria.Once in the lamina propria, gluten peptides undergo deamidation by tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Dieterich et al. (1997) identified TG2 as the primary autoantigen in CD, demonstrating its ability to modify gluten peptides by converting specific glutamine residues to glutamic acid. This modification enhances the binding affinity of gluten peptides to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, amplifying the T cell response.The presentation of deamidated gluten peptides by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to CD4+ T cells in the context of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 is a critical step in CD pathogenesis. Qiao et al. (2005) showed that these gluten-specific T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which contribute to the intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy characteristic of CD.The adaptive immune response in CD also involves a significant B cell component. Di Niro et al. (2012) demonstrated that gluten-specific T cells provide help to B cells, leading to the production of antibodies against both gluten and TG2. These autoantibodies, particularly anti-TG2 IgA, serve as highly specific biomarkers for CD diagnosis and monitoring.The innate immune system also plays a crucial role in CD pathogenesis. Junker et al. (2012) identified specific peptide sequences in α-gliadin that can activate innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, through pattern recognition receptors. This innate immune activation contributes to the inflammatory milieu and may serve as an initial trigger for the adaptive immune response.Recent research has shed light on the potential role of the gut microbiome in CD pathogenesis. Verdu et al. (2015) reviewed evidence suggesting that alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function may influence gluten metabolism, intestinal permeability, and immune responses in CD. This emerging field of research opens new avenues for potential therapeutic interventions.The only current treatment for CD is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). While effective in most patients, adherence to a GFD can be challenging and may not lead to complete mucosal healing in all cases. Leffler et al. (2017) reviewed various non-dietary therapeutic approaches under investigation, including enzymes to degrade gluten, tight junction regulators to reduce intestinal permeability, and immunomodulators to suppress the gluten-specific immune response.Understanding the immunobiology and pathogenesis of CD has not only improved our ability to diagnose and manage the condition but has also provided insights into the complex interactions between dietary antigens, genetic susceptibility, and autoimmunity. As research in this field continues to advance, it holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and a deeper understanding of other autoimmune disorders.In conclusion, celiac disease represents a unique model of autoimmunity where the triggering environmental factor (gluten) is known, and the disease-specific autoantibodies (anti-TG2) are well-characterized. The intricate interplay between gluten peptides, HLA molecules, TG2, and both innate and adaptive immune responses forms the basis of CD pathogenesis. Ongoing research in this field continues to unravel the complexities of this disorder, paving the way for improved diagnostic tools and potential new therapies beyond the gluten-free diet.", "References": [{"title": "The immunogenetics of coeliac disease", "authors": "Ludvig M.
