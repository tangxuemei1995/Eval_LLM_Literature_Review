{"Literature Review": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease characterized by significant metabolic reprogramming, which plays a crucial role in its initiation, progression, and metastasis. This literature review aims to explore the intricate relationship between metabolism and CRC, focusing on intestinal stem cells (ISCs), dietary influences, genetic factors, and the tumor microenvironment.Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are widely recognized as the cell of origin for most CRCs. These cells possess unique metabolic properties that allow them to adapt to the dynamic intestinal environment. Barker et al. (2007) identified Lgr5+ cells as the primary ISCs responsible for intestinal epithelium renewal and potential CRC initiation. These cells exhibit high metabolic plasticity, allowing them to switch between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis depending on nutrient availability and cellular demands (Rodríguez-Colman et al., 2017).As ISCs progress through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, they undergo significant metabolic adaptations. Schell et al. (2017) demonstrated that early-stage adenomas display increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis, while advanced carcinomas show a more pronounced Warburg effect and enhanced lipid metabolism. These metabolic shifts are essential for supporting rapid proliferation and survival in nutrient-poor environments.Diet plays a crucial role in CRC development and progression. Numerous studies have linked specific dietary patterns to CRC risk. For instance, O'Keefe et al. (2015) showed that a high-fat, low-fiber Western diet promotes CRC development by altering gut microbiota composition and increasing inflammation. Conversely, a Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been associated with reduced CRC risk (Schwingshackl et al., 2017).The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key player in CRC metabolism. Tilg et al. (2018) reviewed the complex interactions between diet, gut microbiota, and CRC, highlighting how certain microbial metabolites can either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis. For example, short-chain fatty acids produced by fiber fermentation have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic effects (Bultman, 2017).Genetic alterations in key metabolic pathways are common in CRC. Mutations in the APC gene, found in up to 80% of sporadic CRCs, lead to aberrant Wnt signaling and increased glycolysis (Pate et al., 2014). Similarly, KRAS mutations, present in approximately 40% of CRCs, promote glutamine addiction and alter lipid metabolism (Yun et al., 2009). These genetic changes drive metabolic reprogramming, supporting tumor growth and survival.The tumor microenvironment (TME) in CRC is characterized by complex interactions between cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix. Metabolic crosstalk within the TME plays a crucial role in tumor progression. Carmona-Fontaine et al. (2017) demonstrated that hypoxic regions within tumors create metabolic gradients that influence immune cell function and promote immunosuppression. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts have been shown to support tumor growth by providing metabolic substrates to cancer cells (Lyssiotis and Kimmelman, 2017).Recent research has focused on targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in CRC for therapeutic purposes. Inhibition of key metabolic enzymes, such as glutaminase or fatty acid synthase, has shown promise in preclinical studies (Luengo et al., 2017). Moreover, combining metabolic inhibitors with standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy has emerged as a potential strategy to enhance treatment efficacy (Vernieri et al., 2016).The role of metabolism in CRC stem cells has gained increasing attention. Sánchez-Vega et al. (2019) demonstrated that CRC stem cells rely heavily on oxidative phosphorylation for survival and self-renewal. This finding suggests that targeting mitochondrial metabolism could be an effective approach to eliminate cancer stem cells and prevent tumor recurrence.In conclusion, the intricate relationship between metabolism and CRC involves multiple factors, including ISC biology, diet, genetics, and the tumor microenvironment. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for developing more effective prevention strategies and targeted therapies. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in CRC pathogenesis. This knowledge will pave the way for personalized metabolic interventions and improved patient outcomes in colorectal cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5", "authors": "Nick Barker, Johan H. van Es, Jeroen Kuipers, Pekka Kujala, Maaike van den Born, Miranda Cozijnsen, Andrea Haegebarth, Jeroen Korving, Harry Begthel, Peter J.
