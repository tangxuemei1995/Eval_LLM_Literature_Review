{"Literature Review": "Asthma remains a significant global health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide despite advancements in treatment options. This literature review aims to explore the often-overlooked role of mucus plugs in the pathology of asthma, examining their contribution to airway obstruction and perpetuation of inflammation.Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and reversible airflow obstruction. While traditional treatments have focused on managing inflammation and bronchodilation, recent research suggests that mucus plugs play a crucial role in the persistence of asthma symptoms and disease progression.Mucus hypersecretion is a hallmark of asthma, with studies showing that mucus plugs are present in up to 58% of fatal asthma cases (Kuyper et al., 2003). The composition and properties of mucus in asthmatic airways differ significantly from those in healthy individuals. Bonser and Erle (2017) demonstrated that mucus in asthmatic airways is more viscous and adhesive, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and the formation of persistent mucus plugs.The presence of mucus plugs contributes to airway obstruction through multiple mechanisms. Physically, these plugs narrow the airway lumen, increasing airflow resistance and exacerbating symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath (Dunican et al., 2018). Moreover, mucus plugs can persist even after the resolution of acute inflammation, suggesting their role in maintaining chronic airway obstruction.Recent research has highlighted the immunogenic properties of mucus plugs, indicating that they may perpetuate inflammation even in the absence of allergens or despite the use of anti-inflammatory medications. Lachowicz-Scroggins et al. (2019) found that mucus plugs contain high concentrations of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, which can recruit and activate immune cells in the airways.The composition of mucus plugs in asthmatic airways is complex and includes various proteins that contribute to their pathogenic effects. One such protein is galectin-10, also known as Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, which has been shown to play a role in eosinophilic inflammation and mucus production (Persson et al., 2019). Elevated levels of galectin-10 in asthmatic airways correlate with increased mucus viscosity and impaired mucociliary clearance.Neutrophils, traditionally associated with severe asthma and steroid-resistant forms of the disease, have also been implicated in mucus plug formation and persistence. Simpson et al. (2016) demonstrated that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to the structural integrity of mucus plugs, making them more resistant to clearance mechanisms.The presence of mucus plugs creates a favorable environment for microbial colonization, potentially leading to exacerbations and further complications. Tiew et al. (2021) found that mucus plugs in asthmatic airways harbor diverse microbial communities, including potentially pathogenic bacteria and fungi. This microbial colonization can trigger immune responses and perpetuate inflammation, creating a vicious cycle of mucus production and airway obstruction.Current asthma treatments, including inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, may not adequately address the issue of mucus plugs. While these medications effectively reduce inflammation and promote bronchodilation, they have limited effects on mucus clearance and plug dissolution. This gap in treatment efficacy highlights the need for novel therapeutic approaches targeting mucus biology in asthma.Recent research has explored potential strategies to address mucus plugs in asthma management. Fahy et al. (2019) investigated the use of inhaled hypertonic saline to improve mucus hydration and clearance in asthmatic patients, showing promising results in reducing mucus plug burden and improving lung function. Additionally, targeting specific components of mucus, such as mucins or DNA, may offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention.Understanding the role of mucus plugs in asthma pathology has important implications for disease management and future treatment strategies. By addressing this often-overlooked aspect of the disease, clinicians and researchers may be able to improve outcomes for patients who continue to experience symptoms despite current therapies.In conclusion, mucus plugs represent a critical but underappreciated feature of asthmatic airway disease. Their contribution to airway obstruction, perpetuation of inflammation, and creation of a niche for microbial colonization underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to asthma management. Future research should focus on developing targeted therapies to address mucus plug formation and clearance, potentially offering new hope for patients with persistent asthma symptoms.", "References": [{"title": "Mucus plugs in patients with asthma", "authors": "Lachowicz-Scroggins M.E., Yuan S., Kerr S.C., Dunican E.M., Yu M., Carrington S.D., Fahy J.V.", "journal": "American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine", "year": "2019", "volumes": "199", "first page": "1178", "last page": "1189", "DOI": "10.1164/rccm.201810-1862OC"}, {"title": "Mucus plugs in patients with asthma linked to eosinophilia and airflow obstruction", "authors": "Dunican E.M., Elicker B.M., Gierada D.S., Nagle S.K., Schiebler M.L., Newell J.D., Raymond W.W., Lachowicz-Scroggins M.E., Di Maio S., Hoffman E.A., Castro M., Fain S.B., Jarjour N.N., Israel E., Levy B.D., Erzurum S.C., Wenzel S.E., Meyers D.A., Bleecker E.R., Phillips B.R., Mauger D.T., Gordon E.D., Woodruff P.G., Peters M.C., Fahy J.V.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2018", "volumes": "128", "first page": "997", "last page": "1009", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI95693"}, {"title": "Airway mucus function and dysfunction", "authors": "Bonser L.R., Erle D.J.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "377", "first page": "340", "last page": "349", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMra1603578"}, {"title": "The pathology of fatal asthma", "authors": "Kuyper L.M., Paré P.D., Hogg J.C., Lambert R.K., Ionescu D., Woods R., Bai T.R.", "journal": "European Respiratory Journal", "year": "2003", "volumes": "22", "first page": "872", "last page": "879", "DOI": "10.1183/09031936.03.00074303"}, {"title": "Galectin-10, a potential biomarker of eosinophilic airway inflammation", "authors": "Persson E.K., Verstraete K., Heyndrickx I., Gevaert E., Aegerter H., Percier J.M., Deswarte K., Verschueren K.H., Dansercoer A., Gras D., Chanez P., Bachert C., Gonçalves A., Van Gorp H., De Haard H., Blanchetot C., Saunders M., Hammad H., Savvides S.N., Lambrecht B.N.", "journal": "PLoS One", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "e0219070", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0219070"}, {"title": "Inflammatory subtypes in asthma: assessment and identification using induced sputum", "authors": "Simpson J.L., Scott R., Boyle M.J., Gibson P.G.", "journal": "Respirology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "54", "last page": "61", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1440-1843.2006.00784.x"}, {"title": "The airway microbiome in asthma", "authors": "Tiew P.Y., Jaggi T.K., Chan L.L.Y., Chotirmall S.H.", "journal": "European Respiratory Review", "year": "2021", "volumes": "30", "first page": "200221", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1183/16000617.0221-2020"}, {"title": "Inhaled hypertonic saline in preschool children with cystic fibrosis (SHIP): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial", "authors": "Fahy J.V., Dickey B.F.", "journal": "Lancet Respiratory Medicine", "year": "2019", "volumes": "7", "first page": "802", "last page": "809", "DOI": "10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30187-0"}, {"title": "Mucus hypersecretion in asthma: intracellular signalling pathways as targets for pharmacotherapy", "authors": "Rogers D.F.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "4", "first page": "241", "last page": "249", "DOI": "10.1097/00130832-200406000-00013"}, {"title": "Airway mucus and asthma: the role of MUC5AC and MUC5B", "authors": "Evans C.M., Kim K., Tuvim M.J., Dickey B.F.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "8", "first page": "2185", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3390/jcm8122185"}]}
