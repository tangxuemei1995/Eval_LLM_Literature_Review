{"Literature Review": "The liver is a complex organ with a unique spatial organization that allows it to perform a wide array of metabolic functions efficiently. This spatial organization, known as liver zonation, is crucial for the proper functioning of the liver and has significant implications for liver pathophysiology. Recent advances in technology have provided new insights into the spatiotemporal aspects of liver zonation and its impact on various metabolic processes. Liver zonation refers to the heterogeneous distribution of metabolic functions across the hepatic lobule, the functional unit of the liver. This zonation is primarily divided into three zones: periportal (zone 1), midzonal (zone 2), and pericentral (zone 3). Each zone has distinct metabolic characteristics that contribute to the liver's overall function. The concept of liver zonation was first introduced by Jungermann and Sasse in 1978, and since then, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this phenomenon. One of the key regulators of liver zonation is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Benhamouche et al. (2006) demonstrated that β-catenin activation is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of pericentral gene expression. This finding was further supported by Planas-Paz et al. (2016), who showed that Wnt proteins secreted by endothelial cells in the central vein are responsible for creating a Wnt gradient across the lobule, thus driving zonation. The spatial organization of the liver is not only important for metabolic processes but also plays a critical role in detoxification. Hepatic detoxification enzymes, such as cytochrome P450s, are predominantly expressed in the pericentral zone. This localization is thought to be an adaptive mechanism to protect the liver from potential toxins entering through the portal vein. Braeuning et al. (2006) provided evidence for the zonal expression of various detoxification enzymes and their regulation by β-catenin signaling. In addition to spatial zonation, the liver also exhibits temporal zonation, which is closely linked to circadian rhythms. Reinke and Asher (2016) reviewed the intricate relationship between circadian clocks and liver metabolism, highlighting how the expression of many metabolic genes oscillates throughout the day. This temporal control allows the liver to anticipate and respond to daily fluctuations in nutrient availability and metabolic demands. The importance of spatiotemporal liver zonation becomes evident when examining liver pathophysiology. Disruptions in zonation patterns have been associated with various liver diseases. For instance, Torbenson et al. (2002) observed alterations in the zonal distribution of glutamine synthetase in patients with chronic hepatitis C, suggesting a link between zonation disruption and disease progression. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have also been linked to alterations in liver zonation. Kleiner et al. (2005) reported that the characteristic histological features of NASH, such as steatosis and inflammation, often show a zonal distribution. This observation highlights the potential role of zonation in the pathogenesis of metabolic liver diseases. The concept of liver zonation has important implications for drug metabolism and toxicity. Gebhardt and Matz-Soja (2014) reviewed how the zonal expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect drug efficacy and toxicity. This knowledge is crucial for developing more effective and safer pharmacological interventions, particularly in the field of chronopharmacology, which aims to optimize drug administration based on circadian rhythms. Recent technological advancements, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have provided unprecedented insights into the complexity of liver zonation. Halpern et al. (2017) used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a high-resolution spatial map of gene expression across the liver lobule, revealing previously unknown aspects of liver zonation. Understanding the spatiotemporal aspects of liver zonation is not only important for basic liver biology but also has significant clinical implications. For instance, Touboul et al. (2016) discussed how knowledge of liver zonation could be applied to improve liver tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches. In conclusion, spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation is a fundamental aspect of liver biology that plays a crucial role in maintaining liver function and homeostasis. Disruptions in this complex organization can lead to various liver pathologies and metabolic disorders. As our understanding of liver zonation continues to grow, it opens up new avenues for therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine approaches in liver disease management. Future research should focus on further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation and exploring how this knowledge can be translated into clinical applications.", "References": [{"title": "Apc tumor suppressor gene is the 'zonation-keeper' of mouse liver", "authors": "Sabine Benhamouche, Thomas Decaens, Cécile Godard, Régine Chambrey, David S.
