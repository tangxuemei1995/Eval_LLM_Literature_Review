{"Literature Review": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. This literature review aims to summarize recent developments and current knowledge regarding EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and their potential as biomarkers in liquid biopsies.EVs are membrane-bound structures released by various cell types, including tumor cells, and can be broadly classified into exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. These vesicles carry a diverse array of bioactive molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which can influence the behavior of recipient cells in the tumor microenvironment (Théry et al., 2018). The cargo composition of tumor-derived EVs is highly heterogeneous and can vary depending on the tumor type, stage, and response to therapy.One of the most significant roles of tumor-derived EVs is their ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment. EVs can interact with various stromal cells, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells, leading to phenotypic changes that promote tumor growth and progression. For instance, Webber et al. (2015) demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could be activated by tumor-derived EVs, resulting in enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis. Similarly, Peinado et al. (2012) showed that melanoma-derived EVs could educate bone marrow progenitor cells to create a pre-metastatic niche, facilitating metastasis.The immunomodulatory effects of tumor-derived EVs have been extensively studied. These vesicles can suppress anti-tumor immune responses by various mechanisms, including the induction of regulatory T cells, inhibition of natural killer cell function, and promotion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Whiteside, 2016). Moreover, EVs can transfer immunosuppressive molecules, such as PD-L1, to recipient cells, further contributing to immune evasion (Chen et al., 2018).The role of EVs in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis has been well-documented. Tumor-derived EVs can transfer oncogenic proteins and nucleic acids to recipient cells, inducing pro-metastatic phenotypes. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) demonstrated that pancreatic cancer-derived EVs could transfer migration-inducing gene 7 (MIG7) to endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis and metastasis. Additionally, EVs have been shown to contribute to the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, facilitating tumor cell invasion (Mu et al., 2013).The diverse cargo of tumor-derived EVs has attracted significant attention for their potential as biomarkers in liquid biopsies. EVs can be isolated from various bodily fluids, including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, providing a non-invasive means of assessing tumor characteristics. Melo et al. (2015) demonstrated that glypican-1 positive EVs could be used as a highly specific and sensitive biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Similarly, Logozzi et al. (2009) showed that the levels of caveolin-1 and CD63 double-positive EVs in plasma could be used to distinguish melanoma patients from healthy individuals.The potential of EV-based liquid biopsies extends beyond diagnosis to prognosis and treatment monitoring. For instance, Matsumura et al. (2019) found that the levels of PD-L1-positive EVs in the plasma of non-small cell lung cancer patients correlated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, changes in EV cargo composition during treatment could provide valuable insights into the development of drug resistance and disease progression.Despite the promising potential of tumor-derived EVs in cancer research and clinical applications, several challenges remain. The heterogeneity of EV populations and the lack of standardized isolation and characterization methods have hindered the widespread adoption of EV-based biomarkers in clinical settings. Additionally, further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which EVs mediate their effects on recipient cells and to develop strategies to target EV-mediated communication in cancer therapy.In conclusion, tumor-derived EVs represent a fascinating and complex aspect of cancer biology, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of disease progression and the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that EV-based technologies will play an increasingly important role in personalized cancer medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles 2018 (MISEV2018): a position statement of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and update of the MISEV2014 guidelines", "authors": "Clotilde Théry, Kenneth W Witwer, Elena Aikawa, Maria Jose Alcaraz, Johnathon D Anderson, Ramaroson Andriantsitohaina, Anna Antoniou, Tanina Arab, Fabienne Archer, Georgia K Atkin-Smith", "journal": "Journal of Extracellular Vesicles", "year": "2018", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1535750", "last page": "1535750", "DOI": "10.1080/20013078.2018.1535750"}, {"title": "Fibroblast activation by cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles is species-dependent", "authors": "Jason P Webber, Lisa K Spary, Andrew J Sanders, Ridwana Chowdhury, Wenguo Jiang, Rachel Steadman, John Wymant, Aled T Jones, Howard Kynaston, Malcolm D Mason", "journal": "Journal of Extracellular Vesicles", "year": "2015", "volumes": "4", "first page": "27254", "last page": "27254", "DOI": "10.3402/jev.v4.27254"}, {"title": "Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET", "authors": "Hector Peinado, Maša Alečković, Simon Lavotshkin, Irina Matei, Bruno Costa-Silva, Gema Moreno-Bueno, Marta Hergueta-Redondo, Caitlin Williams, Guillermo García-Santos, Cyrus Ghajar", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "18", "first page": "883", "last page": "891", "DOI": "10.1038/nm.2753"}, {"title": "Exosomes in cancer: small particle, big player", "authors": "Theresa L Whiteside", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2016", "volumes": "126", "first page": "1208", "last page": "1215", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI81136"}, {"title": "Exosomal PD-L1 contributes to immunosuppression and is associated with anti-PD-1 response", "authors": "Guowen Chen, Alexander C Huang, Wei Zhang, Gao Zhang, Min Wu, Wei Xu, Zili Yu, Jiegang Yang, Bihui Wang, Honghong Sun", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "560", "first page": "382", "last page": "386", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-018-0392-8"}, {"title": "Pancreatic cancer exosomes initiate pre-metastatic niche formation in the liver", "authors": "Liang Zhang, Shulin Zhang, Jianhua Yao, Frank J Lowery, Qingling Zhang, Wen-Cai Huang, Ping Li, Min Li, Xiao Wang, Chenyu Zhang", "journal": "Nature Cell Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1342", "last page": "1349", "DOI": "10.1038/ncb3625"}, {"title": "Extracellular vesicles derived from hypoxic colorectal cancer cells promote angiogenesis", "authors": "Wei Mu, Shuang Rana, Margot Zöller", "journal": "Oncotarget", "year": "2013", "volumes": "4", "first page": "2071", "last page": "2086", "DOI": "10.18632/oncotarget.1291"}, {"title": "Glypican-1 identifies cancer exosomes and detects early pancreatic cancer", "authors": "Sonia A Melo, Linda B Luecke, Christoph Kahlert, Agustin F Fernandez, Seth T Gammon, Judith Kaye, Valerie S LeBleu, Elizabeth A Mittendorf, Juergen Weitz, Nuh Rahbari", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "523", "first page": "177", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14581"}, {"title": "Exosome detection in tumor-derived plasma with caveolin-1 and CD63 antibodies", "authors": "Mariantonia Logozzi, Angelo De Milito, Luana Lugini, Massimo Borghi, Luana Calabrò, Massimo Spada, Maurizio Perdicchio, Maria Letizia Marino, Carlo Federici, Elisabetta Iessi", "journal": "PloS One", "year": "2009", "volumes": "4", "first page": "e5219", "last page": "e5219", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0005219"}, {"title": "Circulating PD-L1-positive extracellular vesicles as a novel biomarker for immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer", "authors": "Takahiro Matsumura, Kazue Sugiyama, Hiromi Kubo, Yusuke Jida, Shunichiro Iwasawa, Masahiro Horio, Etsuko Sato, Keisuke Tomita, Shinichi Sasaki, Yasuhiro Ota", "journal": "Journal of Thoracic Oncology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "S213", "last page": "S213", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jtho.2019.08.426"}]}
