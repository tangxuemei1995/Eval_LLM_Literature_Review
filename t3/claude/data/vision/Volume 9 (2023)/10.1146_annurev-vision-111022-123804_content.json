{"Literature Review": "The basal ganglia (BG) have long been recognized for their crucial role in motor control and value-based decision-making. However, recent research has begun to shed light on their involvement in visual perceptual decisions, particularly those based on uncertain visual evidence. This literature review aims to explore the contributions of the basal ganglia to visual perceptual decision-making, focusing on four key stations within the BG network: the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons.The striatum, as the primary input structure of the basal ganglia, has been implicated in various aspects of visual perceptual decision-making. Ding and Gold (2013) demonstrated that neurons in the caudate nucleus, a part of the striatum, exhibit decision-related activity during a motion discrimination task. Their findings suggest that the striatum may play a role in accumulating sensory evidence and forming perceptual decisions. Similarly, Yartsev et al. (2018) found that striatal activity reflects both the accumulation of evidence and the final decision outcome in a visual categorization task, further supporting the striatum's involvement in the decision-making process.The pallidum, consisting of the internal and external segments, has also been shown to contribute to visual perceptual decisions. A study by Siegel et al. (2015) revealed that neurons in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) encode decision-related information during a visual motion discrimination task. The authors proposed that the GPi might be involved in the evaluation and adjustment of decisions based on accumulated evidence. Furthermore, Bogacz and Gurney (2007) developed a computational model suggesting that the basal ganglia, including the pallidum, may implement an optimal decision-making algorithm known as the multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test.The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has emerged as a critical node in the basal ganglia network for visual perceptual decision-making. Zavala et al. (2014) demonstrated that STN activity is modulated during perceptual decision-making tasks, particularly when conflicting sensory information is present. Their findings suggest that the STN may play a role in adjusting decision thresholds and resolving conflict in perceptual decisions. Additionally, Frank et al. (2015) proposed a model in which the STN acts as a dynamic gate, modulating the flow of information through the basal ganglia based on decision uncertainty.Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in various aspects of decision-making, including visual perceptual decisions. Nomoto et al. (2010) found that dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta encode both the expected and actual outcomes of perceptual decisions in a visual motion discrimination task. This suggests that dopamine signaling may play a role in evaluating the accuracy of perceptual decisions and updating decision-making strategies. Moreover, Lak et al. (2020) demonstrated that dopamine neurons signal decision confidence and contribute to the formation of perceptual beliefs.The integration of these basal ganglia structures in visual perceptual decision-making has been explored through various experimental paradigms. Saccade-based tasks have been particularly informative, as they allow researchers to directly link neural activity to behavioral outcomes. Hikosaka et al. (2006) reviewed the role of the basal ganglia in saccade control and highlighted the involvement of the caudate nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata in saccade-related decision-making.Signal detection theory and sequential analysis have provided valuable frameworks for understanding the computational principles underlying visual perceptual decisions in the basal ganglia. Bogacz (2007) proposed that the cortico-basal ganglia circuit implements a statistical test for optimal decision-making, known as the sequential probability ratio test. This model has been supported by experimental evidence and has provided insights into how the basal ganglia may contribute to the speed-accuracy trade-off in perceptual decisions.Recent technological advancements have allowed for more precise manipulation and recording of basal ganglia activity during visual perceptual decision-making tasks. Optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques have enabled researchers to causally manipulate specific basal ganglia circuits and examine their effects on perceptual decisions. For instance, Tecuapetla et al. (2016) used optogenetics to demonstrate the differential roles of direct and indirect pathway neurons in the striatum during a visual discrimination task.In conclusion, the basal ganglia have emerged as important contributors to visual perceptual decision-making, extending beyond their traditional roles in motor control and value-based decisions. The striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons work in concert to support various aspects of the decision process, including evidence accumulation, conflict resolution, and outcome evaluation. Future research should continue to explore the specific computational mechanisms implemented by these structures and how they interact with cortical regions to support flexible and adaptive visual perceptual decisions.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the basal ganglia in habit formation", "authors": "Henry H.
