{"Literature Review": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a highly conserved subcortical structure that plays a crucial role in visual processing, attention, and orienting behaviors across various species. In primates, the SC has been extensively studied for its involvement in oculomotor control and saccade generation. However, recent research has shed light on its significant contributions to visual processing and active perception, challenging the traditional view of the SC as primarily a motor control structure.The anatomical organization of the primate SC provides a foundation for its diverse functions. Wurtz and Albano (1980) described the SC as a layered structure, with superficial layers receiving direct retinal input and deeper layers involved in multisensory integration and motor output. This layered organization allows for efficient processing of visual information and its translation into motor commands.The visual capabilities of the SC extend beyond simple light detection. Goldberg and Wurtz (1972) demonstrated that SC neurons in macaque monkeys respond selectively to visual stimuli, exhibiting preferences for specific stimulus features such as direction and velocity. These findings suggest that the SC is capable of complex visual pattern analysis, a notion further supported by more recent studies.White et al. (2017) provided evidence for the SC's role in higher-order visual processing, showing that SC neurons in macaques can discriminate between face and non-face stimuli. This surprising finding challenges the view that such complex visual processing is exclusive to cortical areas and highlights the SC's potential for sophisticated visual analysis.The SC's visual functions are not limited to passive processing. Krauzlis et al. (2013) proposed that the SC plays a critical role in visual attention and target selection. They demonstrated that inactivation of the SC in monkeys impaired their ability to select and attend to visual targets, even when no eye movements were required. This suggests that the SC's involvement in visual processing extends beyond its well-established role in oculomotor control.The integration of visual and motor functions within the SC is particularly relevant for active vision. Marino et al. (2015) showed that SC neurons in macaques exhibit predictive remapping of visual receptive fields before saccades, allowing for stable visual perception across eye movements. This finding underscores the SC's role in maintaining visual continuity during active exploration of the environment.The SC's contributions to active vision are further supported by its anatomical connections. Berman and Wurtz (2010) traced the pathways between the SC and various cortical areas, revealing extensive reciprocal connections with both early visual areas and higher-order regions involved in attention and decision-making. These connections place the SC in an ideal position to influence both bottom-up and top-down visual processing.Recent technological advances have allowed for more precise manipulation of SC activity in primates. Cavanaugh et al. (2016) used optogenetic techniques to selectively activate SC neurons in macaques, demonstrating that stimulation of specific SC subregions can bias visual attention and saccade target selection. This causal evidence strengthens the case for the SC's active role in visual processing and decision-making.The SC's visual functions are not limited to the processing of external stimuli. Hafed and Krauzlis (2010) showed that SC neurons in macaques are involved in the generation and maintenance of microsaccades, small fixational eye movements that play a crucial role in visual perception. This finding highlights the SC's involvement in fine-grained visual sampling and further emphasizes its importance in active vision.While much of our understanding of the primate SC comes from studies in macaques, recent work has begun to explore its functions in humans. Himmelbach et al. (2007) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate that the human SC is involved in both covert attention shifts and overt eye movements, suggesting a conservation of SC functions across primate species.In conclusion, the primate superior colliculus emerges as a multifaceted structure that goes beyond its classical role in oculomotor control. Its capacity for sophisticated visual processing, combined with its involvement in attention, target selection, and active vision, positions the SC as a critical node in the primate visual system. The anatomical and functional integration of visual and motor processes within the SC makes it an ideal substrate for adaptive behavior in complex environments. Future research will likely continue to uncover new aspects of the SC's visual functions and their relevance to primate behavior and cognition.", "References": [{"title": "Visual properties of neurons in a polysensory area in superior colliculus of the macaque", "authors": "Michael E.
