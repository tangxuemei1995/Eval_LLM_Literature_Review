{"Literature Review": "The emergence of novel viral pathogens and their potential to cause global health crises has become increasingly apparent in recent years, with the COVID-19 pandemic serving as a stark reminder of the need for comprehensive preparedness and management strategies. This literature review focuses on the ophthalmic manifestations of emerging viral infections, their epidemiology, and potential therapeutic approaches, with particular emphasis on pathogens identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as high-priority threats.The eye, as an immune-privileged site, can serve as a reservoir for viral pathogens and may play a crucial role in disease transmission and persistence. Seah and Agrawal (2020) highlighted the importance of understanding ocular involvement in COVID-19, noting that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in tear samples and conjunctival secretions of infected patients. This finding underscores the potential for ocular transmission and the need for appropriate protective measures among healthcare workers.Ebola virus disease (EVD), another WHO priority pathogen, has been shown to have significant ocular implications. Shantha et al. (2016) reported on the development of uveitis in EVD survivors, with some cases occurring months after the acute infection. This delayed onset of ocular manifestations emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up and monitoring of patients affected by emerging viral infections.The Zika virus outbreak in 2015-2016 brought attention to the devastating ocular effects of congenital infections. de Paula Freitas et al. (2016) described a range of ocular abnormalities in infants with congenital Zika syndrome, including macular alterations, optic nerve abnormalities, and chorioretinal atrophy. These findings highlight the potential for emerging viruses to cause severe and lasting damage to the visual system, particularly in vulnerable populations.Chikungunya virus, an arbovirus with epidemic potential, has been associated with various ocular manifestations. Mahendradas et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive review of ocular involvement in Chikungunya fever, reporting a spectrum of anterior and posterior segment pathologies, including anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis. The authors emphasized the need for ophthalmologists to be aware of these potential complications in endemic areas.The concept of viral persistence in ocular tissues has gained significant attention in recent years. Miner and Diamond (2017) reviewed the mechanisms by which viruses can establish long-term residence in the eye, discussing examples such as Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. This persistence can lead to chronic inflammation and delayed-onset ocular disease, presenting challenges for both diagnosis and treatment.In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have investigated the ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wu et al. (2020) reported on a cohort of patients with COVID-19, finding that 31.6% of patients had ocular symptoms, with conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and increased secretions being the most common presentations. These findings underscore the importance of considering ocular involvement in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.The potential for ocular transmission of emerging viruses has implications for infection control practices. Belser et al. (2013) reviewed the ocular tropism of respiratory viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses, highlighting the need for eye protection as part of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and the general public during outbreaks.Therapeutic approaches for emerging viral infections of the eye remain an active area of research. Mucker et al. (2019) investigated the use of antiviral therapies in animal models of Ebola virus-associated uveitis, demonstrating the potential efficacy of targeted treatments in managing ocular complications of emerging infections.The development of rapid diagnostic tools for detecting viral pathogens in ocular fluids is crucial for timely intervention and outbreak control. Tan et al. (2017) reviewed various molecular diagnostic techniques for viral uveitis, emphasizing the importance of accurate and efficient detection methods in managing ocular infections caused by emerging pathogens.In conclusion, the ophthalmic manifestations of emerging viral infections represent a significant public health concern, with implications for disease transmission, long-term sequelae, and healthcare practices. As global health threats continue to evolve, a comprehensive understanding of the ocular involvement in these infections is essential for effective preparedness, management, and therapeutic development. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms of viral persistence in ocular tissues, developing targeted therapies, and improving diagnostic capabilities to address the challenges posed by emerging pathogenic viral infections of the eye.", "References": [{"title": "Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 and the SARS-CoV-2 virus", "authors": "Ivan Seah, Rupesh Agrawal", "journal": "Current Opinion in Ophthalmology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "31", "first page": "435", "last page": "440", "DOI": "10.1097/ICU.0000000000000680"}, {"title": "Uveitis and Systemic Inflammatory Markers in Convalescent Phase of Ebola Virus Disease", "authors": "Jessica G.
