{"Literature Review": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in computer vision, achieving remarkable success in tasks such as object classification and segmentation. Their impressive performance has led researchers to consider whether DNNs could serve as adequate behavioral models of human visual perception, particularly in the domain of core object recognition. This literature review examines the current state of research on DNNs as models of human visual perception, focusing on their strengths, limitations, and potential as computational models of human core object recognition behavior.The success of DNNs in computer vision tasks has been well-documented. Krizhevsky et al. (2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in large-scale image classification, sparking a revolution in the field. Subsequent studies, such as He et al. (2016), have further improved DNN architectures, achieving human-level or even superhuman performance on various visual tasks. These achievements have naturally led researchers to explore the potential of DNNs as models of human visual perception.However, it is crucial to distinguish between DNNs as statistical tools and as computational models of human vision. Kriegeskorte and Douglas (2018) emphasize that while DNNs excel as statistical tools for solving visual tasks, their adequacy as models of human visual perception requires careful evaluation. This distinction is essential for understanding the limitations and potential of DNNs in vision science.One approach to assessing DNNs as models of human vision is to compare their performance and behavior with that of humans in various visual tasks. Rajalingham et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive study comparing DNNs and humans on a core object recognition task. They found that while DNNs achieved similar overall performance to humans, there were significant differences in the patterns of errors and confusions made by DNNs and humans. This suggests that DNNs may not fully capture the nuances of human visual processing.Another important aspect to consider is the robustness and generalization capabilities of DNNs compared to human vision. Geirhos et al. (2018) demonstrated that DNNs trained on ImageNet are biased towards recognizing texture rather than shape, unlike humans who prioritize shape. This finding highlights a fundamental difference in the visual strategies employed by DNNs and humans, raising questions about the adequacy of current DNNs as models of human vision.The interpretability of DNNs is another crucial factor in evaluating their potential as models of human vision. While DNNs can achieve high performance, understanding how they arrive at their decisions remains challenging. Efforts to improve the interpretability of DNNs, such as those by Zeiler and Fergus (2014), have provided some insights into the internal representations learned by these networks. However, the complexity of DNNs often makes it difficult to draw clear parallels with human visual processing.Despite these challenges, DNNs have provided valuable insights into human vision. For instance, Yamins et al. (2014) showed that the internal representations of DNNs trained on object recognition tasks bear similarities to the neural representations in the primate ventral visual stream. This suggests that DNNs may capture some aspects of biological visual processing, even if they do not fully replicate human visual perception.It is also important to note that the goals of DNNs in computer vision and as models of human vision may differ. While computer vision aims to achieve the best possible performance on specific tasks, models of human vision should aim to replicate human-like behavior, including errors and limitations. Battleday et al. (2020) argue that aligning the objectives of DNNs with those of human vision is crucial for developing more accurate models of human visual perception.The rapid progress in DNN research continues to narrow the gap between artificial and human vision. Recent advancements, such as self-supervised learning techniques explored by Chen et al. (2020), show promise in developing DNNs that learn more human-like representations without relying on large labeled datasets. These developments may lead to DNNs that better capture the essence of human visual perception.In conclusion, while DNNs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in computer vision tasks and have provided valuable insights into human visual processing, their adequacy as comprehensive models of human core object recognition behavior remains a subject of ongoing research. Current evidence suggests that DNNs are promising but not yet fully adequate models of human visual perception. Future research should focus on addressing the identified discrepancies between DNNs and human vision, improving the interpretability of DNNs, and aligning their objectives more closely with those of human visual perception. As the field progresses, it is likely that more sophisticated DNNs will emerge, potentially offering even better models of human visual cognition.", "References": [{"title": "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks", "authors": "Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E.
