{"Literature Review": "The study of visual fixations and eye movements has become increasingly important in understanding human perception, cognition, and behavior. This literature review explores recent advances in predicting where humans look, focusing on model evaluation, comparison, and the development of a unified framework for fixation prediction.Visual attention and eye movements play a crucial role in how we interact with our environment. As noted by Itti and Koch (2001), the human visual system is constantly bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information, necessitating selective attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant stimuli. This selective process is reflected in our eye movements, which provide valuable insights into both conscious and unconscious cognitive processes.The concept of visual saliency has been central to understanding and predicting fixations. Saliency refers to the distinct qualities of visual stimuli that attract attention and guide eye movements. Early computational models of saliency, such as the one proposed by Koch and Ullman (1985), laid the groundwork for predicting fixations based on bottom-up, stimulus-driven features. These models typically generate saliency maps, which represent the likelihood of fixation for each location in an image.However, as research progressed, it became clear that bottom-up saliency alone was insufficient to explain human fixation patterns. Torralba et al. (2006) demonstrated the importance of incorporating top-down, task-dependent factors in fixation prediction models. This led to the development of more sophisticated models that combine both bottom-up and top-down influences, as seen in the work of Judd et al. (2009).The advent of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the field of fixation prediction. Kümmerer et al. (2016) introduced DeepGaze, a deep neural network-based model that significantly outperformed traditional saliency models. This shift towards data-driven approaches has led to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, as evidenced by the success of subsequent models like SAM-ResNet (Cornia et al., 2018).Despite these advancements, comparing different fixation prediction models has remained challenging due to the lack of a standardized evaluation framework. Bylinskii et al. (2019) addressed this issue by proposing a comprehensive set of metrics for evaluating saliency models, including area under the ROC curve (AUC), normalized scanpath saliency (NSS), and information gain (IG). These metrics allow for more consistent and meaningful comparisons between models.The concept of information gain, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool for model evaluation and comparison. As discussed by Kümmerer et al. (2015), information gain provides a principled way to quantify the performance of probabilistic fixation prediction models. This approach allows for the comparison of models across different settings, such as static and dynamic stimuli, and even enables the evaluation of scanpath prediction models within the same framework.Recent research has also focused on developing unified frameworks for fixation prediction that can accommodate various types of models and stimuli. Wang et al. (2018) proposed a unified framework for saliency detection that integrates both bottom-up and top-down cues, demonstrating improved performance across multiple datasets. Similarly, Kümmerer et al. (2017) introduced a method for converting arbitrary saliency maps into probabilistic models, facilitating direct comparisons between different approaches.The field has also seen increased interest in understanding the relative contributions of different factors to fixation prediction. Henderson and Hayes (2017) investigated the roles of semantic and visual features in guiding attention, finding that both play important roles but with varying degrees of influence depending on the task and context. This line of research highlights the complexity of human visual attention and the need for models that can account for multiple influencing factors.Transfer learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve fixation prediction across different domains and tasks. Jetley et al. (2016) demonstrated that models trained on one dataset could be effectively fine-tuned for performance on another, suggesting the potential for more generalizable fixation prediction models.As the field continues to advance, there is growing recognition of the need for more informative benchmarking practices. Kümmerer et al. (2018) proposed methods for selecting the most informative stimuli for model comparison, potentially leading to more efficient and insightful evaluation procedures.In conclusion, the study of visual fixations and eye movements has made significant strides in recent years, driven by advancements in computational modeling, deep learning, and evaluation methodologies. The development of unified frameworks and standardized evaluation metrics has facilitated more meaningful comparisons between models and approaches. As research continues, we can expect further refinements in our ability to predict and understand the complex decision-making processes that guide human visual attention.", "References": [{"title": "A model of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis", "authors": "Laurent Itti, Christof Koch, Ernst Niebur", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": "1998", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1254", "last page": "1259", "DOI": "10.1109/34.730558"}, {"title": "Contextual guidance of eye movements and attention in real-world scenes: The role of global features in object search", "authors": "Antonio Torralba, Aude Oliva, Monica S.
