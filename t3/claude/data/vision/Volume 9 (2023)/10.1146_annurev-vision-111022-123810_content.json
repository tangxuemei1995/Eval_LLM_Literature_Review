{"Literature Review": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, which can lead to various complications, including visual dysfunction. While diabetic retinopathy (DR) has traditionally been viewed as a vascular disease, emerging evidence suggests that it should be considered a neurovascular disorder, with neuronal and visual dysfunction occurring before the onset of clinically detectable vascular changes.The retina, being an extension of the central nervous system, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of diabetes. Early studies focused primarily on vascular changes, but recent research has shed light on the neuronal components of diabetic visual dysfunction. This shift in perspective has important implications for both the understanding of disease progression and the development of potential therapeutic interventions.Human studies have provided valuable insights into the early stages of visual dysfunction in diabetes. Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, which measure the electrical responses of various retinal cell types, have consistently shown alterations in diabetic patients before the onset of clinically visible DR. Kern and Barber (2008) reported that diabetic patients without visible retinopathy exhibited reduced amplitudes and delayed implicit times in both a- and b-waves of the ERG, indicating dysfunction in both photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons.Contrast sensitivity, a measure of visual function that assesses the ability to distinguish between different levels of luminance, has also been found to be compromised in diabetic patients. A study by Sokol et al. (2015) demonstrated that individuals with type 1 diabetes, even those without clinically detectable retinopathy, showed significant reductions in contrast sensitivity compared to healthy controls. This finding suggests that subtle visual deficits may occur early in the disease process, potentially serving as an early marker of retinal dysfunction.Rodent models of diabetes have been instrumental in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of visual dysfunction. These models allow for more detailed investigations of retinal changes at cellular and molecular levels. Consistent with human studies, rodent models exhibit alterations in ERG responses early in the course of diabetes. For instance, Aung et al. (2013) observed reduced amplitudes of oscillatory potentials in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats as early as two weeks after diabetes induction, indicating inner retinal dysfunction.One of the key neuronal mechanisms implicated in diabetic visual dysfunction is the alteration of neurotransmitter signaling. Several studies have reported changes in both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in the diabetic retina. Gastinger et al. (2006) found a significant reduction in the number of GABAergic amacrine cells in the retinas of diabetic rats, suggesting a decrease in inhibitory signaling. This finding was further supported by electrophysiological studies demonstrating reduced evoked GABA release in the inner retina of diabetic animals (Fletcher et al., 2007).Conversely, glutamate signaling, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter system in the retina, appears to be enhanced in diabetes. Santiago et al. (2009) reported increased levels of extracellular glutamate in the retinas of diabetic rats, potentially due to impaired glutamate uptake by Müller glial cells. This excess glutamate can lead to excitotoxicity and contribute to neuronal damage in the diabetic retina.Dopaminergic signaling, which plays a crucial role in retinal light adaptation and contrast sensitivity, has also been shown to be affected in diabetes. Aung et al. (2014) observed a significant reduction in retinal dopamine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive amacrine cells in diabetic rats. This dopaminergic deficit may contribute to the contrast sensitivity impairments observed in both human patients and animal models of diabetes.The accumulating evidence of neuronal dysfunction in early diabetes has led to a paradigm shift in the approach to DR. Sohn et al. (2016) proposed a 'neurovascular unit' concept, emphasizing the intricate relationship between neurons, glia, and blood vessels in the retina. This integrated view suggests that early interventions targeting neuronal protection may be beneficial in preventing or delaying the progression of DR.Recent studies have explored potential neuroprotective strategies in diabetic retinopathy. For example, Hernández et al. (2013) demonstrated that administration of somatostatin analogues could prevent retinal neurodegeneration in diabetic rats, potentially by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity and promoting cell survival pathways. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2018) showed that targeting the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway could alleviate oxidative stress and protect retinal neurons in diabetic mice.In conclusion, the growing body of evidence from both human and rodent studies strongly supports the concept of DR as a neurovascular disease, with neuronal dysfunction preceding and potentially contributing to vascular changes. Understanding the specific neuronal mechanisms involved in early diabetic visual dysfunction, such as altered neurotransmitter signaling and oxidative stress, opens up new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Future research should focus on developing targeted neuroprotective strategies that can be implemented early in the disease course to preserve visual function and potentially prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy.", "References": [{"title": "Retinal neurodegeneration: early pathology in diabetes", "authors": "Timothy S.
