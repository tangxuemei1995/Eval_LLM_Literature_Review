{"Literature Review": "The field of extraocular photoreception has experienced significant growth in recent years, challenging long-held beliefs about light sensing in mammals. This review explores the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing physiology, with a focus on encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5) in mammals, particularly mice and humans.Opsins, a family of G protein-coupled receptors, have long been recognized as the primary light sensors in animals. While their function in visual processes is well-established, emerging research has revealed their crucial role in extraocular light sensing, which influences various physiological processes, including circadian rhythms and metabolism (Hankins et al., 2008).Historically, it was believed that mammals lacked extraocular light sensing capabilities. However, this notion has been overturned by recent discoveries. The identification of OPN3 and OPN5 as functional photoreceptors outside the eyes has opened new avenues for understanding light-dependent regulation of mammalian physiology (Kojima et al., 2011).OPN5, also known as neuropsin, has been shown to play a critical role in the photoentrainment of circadian clocks in the skin. Buhr et al. (2015) demonstrated that OPN5 in mouse skin is capable of resetting the circadian clock in response to light stimulation. This finding suggests that the skin possesses an intrinsic ability to sense light and adjust its biological rhythms accordingly, independent of the central circadian clock in the brain.Furthermore, OPN3 (encephalopsin) has been implicated in the acute light-dependent regulation of metabolic pathways. Nayak et al. (2020) reported that OPN3 mediates the effects of blue light on lipolysis in human adipocytes. This discovery highlights the potential impact of artificial lighting on human metabolic health and opens up new possibilities for light-based therapies in metabolic disorders.The role of extraocular photoreception extends beyond circadian rhythms and metabolism. Sikka et al. (2014) found that OPN4 (melanopsin) in blood vessels contributes to light-induced vasorelaxation, suggesting a direct link between light exposure and cardiovascular function. This finding underscores the pervasive influence of light on mammalian physiology beyond the visual system.Recent studies have also explored the evolutionary aspects of extraocular photoreception. Leung and Montell (2017) reviewed the diverse roles of opsins across different animal species, revealing that extraocular photoreception is an ancient and widespread phenomenon. This evolutionary perspective provides insights into the adaptive advantages conferred by light sensing mechanisms outside the eyes.The discovery of functional opsins in various tissues has led to investigations into their potential roles in human health and disease. Haltaufderhyde et al. (2015) detected the expression of multiple opsins in human epidermal keratinocytes, suggesting that the skin may serve as a complex light-sensing organ. This finding has implications for understanding the effects of light exposure on skin physiology and pathology, including photoaging and skin cancer.As research in this field progresses, the potential applications of extraocular photoreception in medicine and biotechnology are becoming apparent. Koyanagi and Terakita (2014) discussed the possibility of using opsins as optogenetic tools for controlling cellular functions with light. This approach could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for various disorders, including neurological and metabolic diseases.Despite these exciting developments, many questions remain unanswered. The exact mechanisms by which extraocular opsins transduce light signals and influence cellular processes are not fully understood. Additionally, the interplay between different opsins and their relative contributions to overall light sensing physiology require further investigation.In conclusion, the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing physiology represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of light's influence on mammalian biology. From circadian rhythm regulation to metabolic control and beyond, these photoreceptors are revealing the intricate ways in which light shapes our physiology. As research in this field continues to evolve, it promises to yield valuable insights into human health and disease, potentially leading to innovative light-based therapies and interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in primate retina signal colour and irradiance and project to the LGN", "authors": "Dennis M.
