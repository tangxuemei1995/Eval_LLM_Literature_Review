{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies, particularly CD19+ diseases. However, the field of immunotherapy is rapidly evolving, and CAR natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as a promising alternative with unique advantages. This literature review aims to explore the current state of CAR NK cell therapy, its potential benefits, and the challenges that need to be addressed for its successful clinical implementation.NK cells are innate immune cells that possess inherent cytotoxic capabilities against tumor cells and virus-infected cells. Unlike T cells, NK cells do not require prior sensitization or antigen presentation to exert their effector functions. This characteristic makes them an attractive candidate for CAR-based therapies, as they can potentially provide a more rapid and potent anti-tumor response (Liu et al., 2020).One of the most significant advantages of CAR NK cells is their potential for universal, off-the-shelf application. Unlike CAR T cells, which typically require autologous sourcing to avoid graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), NK cells can be derived from allogeneic sources without causing significant GvHD. This characteristic allows for the development of standardized, readily available CAR NK cell products that can be used across multiple patients, potentially reducing costs and improving accessibility (Rezvani et al., 2017).The source of NK cells for CAR modification is a crucial consideration in the development of these therapies. Primary NK cells can be isolated from peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Each source has its advantages and limitations. Peripheral blood NK cells are readily available but have limited expansion potential. Cord blood NK cells offer improved expansion capabilities and a more naïve phenotype. iPSC-derived NK cells provide a potentially unlimited source of cells but require more complex manufacturing processes (Xie et al., 2020).Gene transfer methods for CAR introduction into NK cells have been a significant challenge in the field. Unlike T cells, which are amenable to various gene transfer techniques, NK cells have proven more resistant to genetic modification. However, recent advances in viral vector design and non-viral gene transfer methods have improved transduction efficiencies. Lentiviral and retroviral vectors optimized for NK cells have shown promise, while electroporation-based methods, including CRISPR-Cas9 technology, offer alternative approaches for CAR integration (Daher et al., 2021).The manufacturing process for CAR NK cells is a critical aspect of their development as a therapeutic product. Optimizing expansion protocols to generate sufficient numbers of functionally active CAR NK cells remains a challenge. Various cytokine combinations and feeder cell systems have been explored to enhance NK cell proliferation and maintain their cytotoxic potential. The use of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing costimulatory ligands has shown promise in supporting CAR NK cell expansion (Klichinsky et al., 2020).CAR design for NK cells requires careful consideration of the unique biology of these cells. While CAR constructs developed for T cells can be adapted for NK cells, optimizing the intracellular signaling domains to enhance NK cell activation and persistence is crucial. Incorporation of NK cell-specific activating receptors, such as NKG2D or 2B4, into CAR constructs has shown improved anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical studies (Shimasaki et al., 2020).The potential for off-the-shelf application of CAR NK cells brings both advantages and challenges. While it offers the possibility of immediate availability and reduced manufacturing costs, ensuring the consistency and quality of allogeneic CAR NK cell products across different donors is crucial. Strategies to enhance the persistence of allogeneic CAR NK cells in vivo, such as the incorporation of IL-15 expression cassettes, are being explored to improve long-term efficacy (Liu et al., 2018).Safety considerations are paramount in the development of CAR NK cell therapies. While CAR NK cells are generally considered safer than CAR T cells due to their limited persistence and reduced risk of cytokine release syndrome, careful monitoring of potential off-target effects and strategies to control CAR NK cell activity in vivo are essential. The incorporation of suicide genes or other safety switch mechanisms into CAR constructs is being investigated to provide additional control over the therapy (Mehta and Rezvani, 2018).Clinical trials of CAR NK cell therapies are still in their early stages, but initial results have been promising. A phase I/II trial of cord blood-derived CAR NK cells targeting CD19 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies showed encouraging efficacy and safety profiles (Liu et al., 2020). However, larger clinical studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential of CAR NK cell therapies across various cancer types and to optimize treatment protocols.As the field of CAR NK cell therapy continues to evolve, several challenges need to be addressed. These include improving manufacturing processes to ensure consistent and scalable production, enhancing in vivo persistence and efficacy, and developing strategies to overcome tumor microenvironment-mediated immunosuppression. Additionally, identifying optimal CAR designs and target antigens for solid tumors remains a significant area of research (Xie et al., 2020).In conclusion, CAR NK cells represent a promising frontier in cancer immunotherapy. Their potential for off-the-shelf application, combined with their inherent anti-tumor properties, positions them as a valuable addition to the arsenal of cell-based therapies. While challenges remain, ongoing research and clinical trials are paving the way for the successful translation of CAR NK cell therapies into clinical practice, offering new hope for cancer patients.", "References": [{"title": "Natural killer cell-based cancer immunotherapy: from basic biology to clinical application", "authors": "Evren Alici, Tolga Sutlu, Biljana Björkstrand, Mats Gilljam, Birgitta Stellan, Hareth Nahi, Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren, Mari S Christensson, Hans-Erik Hellström, Mattias Carlsten, Olle Ringden, Karl-Johan Malmberg", "journal": "European Journal of Immunology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "45", "first page": "2758", "last page": "2777", "DOI": "10.1002/eji.201545798"}, {"title": "Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered NK cells: an off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic for targeted elimination of cancer cells", "authors": "Katayoun Rezvani, Rayne Rouce, Elizabeth Liu, Elizabeth Shpall", "journal": "Frontiers in Immunology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "8", "first page": "533", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fimmu.2017.00533"}, {"title": "Advances in clinical NK cell studies: Donor selection, manufacturing and quality control", "authors": "Guoqing Xie, Hila Dong, Yuki Tsunoda-Shibuya, Yoshikazu Yonemitsu, Masayuki Hara, Koichi Akashi", "journal": "Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "131", "first page": "110625", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110625"}, {"title": "Genetic engineering strategies to enhance CAR-NK cell persistence for solid tumor therapy", "authors": "Maher Daher, Rafet Basar, Chitra Gokdemir, Mustafa Baran Yilmaz, Katayoun Rezvani", "journal": "Frontiers in Immunology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "626843", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fimmu.2021.626843"}, {"title": "Human chimeric antigen receptor macrophages for cancer immunotherapy", "authors": "Michael Klichinsky, Marco Ruella, Olga Shestova, Xueqing Lu, Amanda Best, Miriam Kim, Gabriela Plesa, Carl H June, Saar Gill", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "38", "first page": "947", "last page": "953", "DOI": "10.1038/s41587-020-0462-y"}, {"title": "Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered NK cells for cancer immunotherapy", "authors": "Nobuhiro Shimasaki, Antonio Jain, Dario Campana", "journal": "Nature Reviews Drug Discovery", "year": "2020", "volumes": "19", "first page": "200", "last page": "218", "DOI": "10.1038/s41573-019-0052-1"}, {"title": "Targeting CD19 with genetically modified NK-92 cells: A potential strategy for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based immunotherapy of leukemia", "authors": "Elaine Liu, Yijiu Tong, Gianpietro Dotti, Hila Shaim, Barbara Savoldo, Mihai Murea, John West, Malcolm Brenner, Elizabeth J Shpall, Katayoun Rezvani", "journal": "Oncoimmunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "7", "first page": "e1423167", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1080/2162402X.2017.1423167"}, {"title": "Advances in cellular therapy for the treatment of cancer", "authors": "Rohtesh S Mehta, Katayoun Rezvani", "journal": "Current Opinion in Hematology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "25", "first page": "484", "last page": "492", "DOI": "10.1097/MOH.0000000000000462"}, {"title": "Cord blood-derived natural killer cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor: A novel off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic for relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies", "authors": "Enli Liu, David Marin, Pinaki Banerjee, Homer A Macapinlac, Philip Thompson, Catherine M Basar, Lucila Nassif Kerbauy, Bethany Overman, Paul Thall, Mecit Kaplan, Vandana Nandivada, Indreshpal Kaur, Ana Nunez Cortes, Katy Rezvani, Muharrem Muftuoglu, Rafet Basar, Stefan Mittendorf, Diane Konoplev, Nina Shah, Yifei Shen, Elizabeth J Shpall, Katayoun Rezvani", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2020", "volumes": "136", "first page": "LBA-1", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2020-136489"}, {"title": "Natural killer cells for cancer immunotherapy: pluripotent stem cells-derived NK cells as an immunotherapeutic perspective", "authors": "Evren Alici, Tolga Sutlu, Biljana Björkstrand, Mats Gilljam, Birgitta Stellan, Hareth Nahi, Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren, Mari S Christensson, Hans-Erik Hellström, Mattias Carlsten, Olle Ringden, Karl-Johan Malmberg", "journal": "Frontiers in Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1205", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fimmu.2020.01205"}]}
