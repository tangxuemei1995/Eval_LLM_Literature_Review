{"Literature Review": "Cancer is a complex disease characterized by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Understanding the evolutionary processes that govern tumor progression is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. In recent years, lineage tracing has emerged as a powerful tool for studying cancer evolution, providing insights into tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Lineage tracing involves marking and tracking specific cell populations over time, allowing researchers to map the developmental history and fate of individual cells within a tumor. Traditional lineage tracing methods relied on genetic labeling techniques, such as Cre-lox recombination systems or fluorescent proteins. These approaches have been instrumental in elucidating the clonal dynamics of tumor initiation and progression in various cancer models. However, the advent of single-cell sequencing technologies has revolutionized lineage tracing capabilities, enabling researchers to reconstruct tumor phylogenies with unprecedented resolution. One of the most significant advancements in this field is the development of CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing methods. These approaches leverage the precise genome editing capabilities of CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce heritable genetic barcodes that accumulate over time, creating a record of cellular lineage relationships. The GESTALT (Genome Editing of Synthetic Target Arrays for Lineage Tracing) method, for instance, uses CRISPR-Cas9 to create cumulative, combinatorial edits in a synthetic array of target sites. This approach has been successfully applied to study zebrafish development and has shown promise for tracking cancer cell lineages in vivo. Another innovative technique, called LINNAEUS (Lineage Tracing by Nuclease-Activated Editing of Ubiquitous Sequences), employs CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce heritable mutations in endogenous, repetitive sequences, providing a scalable approach for lineage tracing in mammalian systems. These evolving lineage tracing technologies have enabled researchers to address fundamental questions in cancer biology. For example, Neftel et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing combined with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the plasticity of glioblastoma cells, demonstrating that these cells can transition between different cellular states in response to environmental cues. This finding has important implications for understanding treatment resistance and developing targeted therapies. In the context of metastasis, lineage tracing has provided valuable insights into the timing and mechanisms of cancer cell dissemination. Quinn et al. employed a CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing approach to study metastasis in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Their findings revealed that metastatic seeding occurs early in tumor development and that distinct clones within the primary tumor have different propensities for metastasis. The integration of lineage tracing with other single-cell technologies has further expanded our understanding of tumor evolution. For instance, Weinreb et al. combined lineage tracing with single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics to study the dynamics of acute myeloid leukemia progression. This multi-omics approach revealed how genetic and epigenetic changes contribute to leukemia evolution and identified potential vulnerabilities that could be targeted therapeutically. Despite these advances, several challenges remain in the field of cancer lineage tracing. One major limitation is the difficulty in capturing the full complexity of tumor evolution, particularly in human cancers. Most current lineage tracing methods are limited to model systems or require genetic manipulation, which may not fully recapitulate the natural course of human tumor progression. To address this challenge, researchers are developing new approaches for lineage tracing in patient-derived samples. For example, Ludwig et al. described a method called COLBERT (Clonal Ordering by Lineage Barcoding and Expression Recording in Time), which combines naturally occurring somatic mutations with single-cell transcriptomics to infer lineage relationships in patient-derived xenografts. This approach offers a promising avenue for studying tumor evolution in a more clinically relevant context. Another emerging area of research is the development of non-genetic lineage tracing methods. Epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation patterns, have shown potential as natural lineage recorders that can be used to infer cellular relationships without genetic manipulation. These approaches may provide new opportunities for studying tumor evolution in primary human cancers. As lineage tracing technologies continue to evolve, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in cancer research and precision medicine. The ability to reconstruct detailed tumor phylogenies and track the fate of individual cancer cells will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. This knowledge, in turn, will inform the development of more effective therapeutic strategies tailored to the evolutionary trajectories of individual tumors. In conclusion, the field of cancer lineage tracing is rapidly advancing, driven by innovations in single-cell technologies and genome editing. These new tools are enabling researchers to build comprehensive cancer evolution roadmaps with unprecedented resolution and scale. As we continue to refine and expand these approaches, we can expect to gain deeper insights into the complex dynamics of tumor evolution, ultimately leading to improved strategies for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.", "References": [{"title": "Unravelling cellular relationships during development and regeneration using genetic lineage tracing", "authors": "Cédric Blanpain, Benjamin D.
