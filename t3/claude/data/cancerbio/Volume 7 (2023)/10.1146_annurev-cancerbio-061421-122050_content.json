{"Literature Review": "Fusion oncoproteins (FOs) resulting from chromosomal translocations have long been associated with aggressive cancers and poor patient outcomes. Recent advances in molecular biology and biophysics have revealed a novel mechanism by which many FOs exert their oncogenic effects: through the formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the role of phase-separated condensates in FO-driven cancers, focusing on two main classes of phase-separating FOs and their distinct mechanisms of action.The first class of phase-separating FOs forms nuclear condensates that alter chromatin biology and gene expression. One prominent example is the FET family of FOs, including FUS-CHOP in liposarcoma and EWSR1-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma. Chong et al. (2018) demonstrated that FUS-CHOP forms phase-separated condensates at specific genomic loci, leading to aberrant transcriptional activation. Similarly, Boulay et al. (2017) showed that EWSR1-FLI1 forms nuclear microenvironments enriched in transcriptional machinery, resulting in dysregulated gene expression patterns characteristic of Ewing sarcoma.The formation of these nuclear condensates is often facilitated by the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within the FO sequences. These IDRs, which lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, are prone to multivalent interactions that drive LLPS. Sabari et al. (2018) demonstrated that the activation domains of many transcription factors, including those found in FOs, are IDRs capable of forming phase-separated condensates at super-enhancers, leading to transcriptional activation.The second class of phase-separating FOs forms cytoplasmic condensates that promote aberrant signaling, particularly in the RAS/MAPK pathway. A notable example is the EML4-ALK fusion in non-small cell lung cancer. Lovly et al. (2017) showed that EML4-ALK forms cytoplasmic puncta through phase separation, leading to constitutive activation of ALK kinase and downstream signaling pathways. Similarly, Huang et al. (2019) demonstrated that the NPM1-ALK fusion in anaplastic large cell lymphoma forms liquid-like droplets in the cytoplasm, enhancing ALK signaling and promoting cell proliferation.The ability of these cytoplasmic FOs to undergo LLPS is often attributed to the presence of both IDRs and folded domains that synergistically interact to promote condensate formation. Nott et al. (2015) showed that multivalent interactions between folded domains and IDRs can drive the formation of membrane-less organelles, a principle that applies to many FOs.Interestingly, some FOs have been found to inhibit physiological LLPS in normal cells, thereby disrupting cellular functions. For example, Kwon et al. (2013) demonstrated that the PML-RARα fusion in acute promyelocytic leukemia disrupts the formation of normal PML nuclear bodies, which are phase-separated structures involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response and apoptosis.The sequence features commonly associated with LLPS have been found to be enriched in many FOs. These features include low complexity regions, repetitive motifs, and charged amino acid residues. Vernon et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive analysis of protein sequences and identified specific amino acid compositions and sequence patterns that promote LLPS. Many of these features are present in FOs, suggesting a potential evolutionary selection for phase separation properties in oncogenic fusions.Recent studies have also begun to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting phase-separated condensates in FO-driven cancers. Bracha et al. (2018) demonstrated that small molecules can be designed to disrupt the phase separation of FET family FOs, offering a novel approach to treating these aggressive cancers. Similarly, Boija et al. (2018) showed that modulating the material properties of transcriptional condensates could be a promising strategy for controlling gene expression in cancer cells.In conclusion, the discovery of phase-separated condensates as a key mechanism in FO-driven oncogenesis has opened up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating these aggressive cancers. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms by which LLPS contributes to oncogenic functions, identifying additional FOs that utilize phase separation, and developing targeted therapies that disrupt or modulate these condensates. As our understanding of the biophysical properties of FOs continues to grow, so too does the potential for innovative therapeutic approaches in the fight against FO-driven cancers.", "References": [{"title": "Phase separation drives aberrant chromatin looping and cancer development", "authors": "Shasha Chong, Claire Dugast-Darzacq, Zhe Liu, Peng Dong, Gina M.
