{"Literature Review": "The field of cancer immunotherapy has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with T cell-based therapies emerging as a promising approach to target tumor-specific neoantigens. This literature review focuses on the targeting of driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens using T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy, highlighting recent advances and challenges in this rapidly evolving area of research.Tumor-specific neoantigens, arising from somatic mutations in cancer cells, have been recognized as potent targets for T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. While most neoantigens are unique to individual patients (private), a subset of neoantigens, known as public neoantigens, are shared across patients and offer potential for off-the-shelf therapies. These public neoantigens often result from recurrent mutation hotspots in oncogenic drivers, tumor suppressors, or viral oncogenic proteins (Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015).One of the most extensively studied public neoantigens is mutant KRAS, which is present in approximately 30% of all human cancers. Tran et al. (2016) demonstrated the feasibility of targeting mutant KRAS using adoptively transferred T cells in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. This groundbreaking study paved the way for further investigations into KRAS-specific TCR-based therapies. Subsequently, Sim et al. (2020) reported the development of high-affinity TCRs targeting multiple KRAS mutations, showing promising results in preclinical models and highlighting the potential for broader application across various KRAS-mutant cancers.Another important public neoantigen target is mutant p53, which is found in over 50% of human cancers. Malekzadeh et al. (2019) identified and characterized TCRs specific for mutant p53 epitopes, demonstrating their ability to recognize and kill p53-mutant tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that targeting mutant p53 could have broad therapeutic implications across multiple cancer types.Viral oncogenic proteins represent another class of public neoantigens with significant therapeutic potential. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers, for instance, express viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are essential for maintaining the malignant phenotype. Draper et al. (2015) developed TCR-engineered T cells targeting HPV-16 E6, showing promising results in preclinical models of cervical cancer. More recently, Nagarsheth et al. (2021) reported on a phase I clinical trial using HPV-16 E7-specific TCR-T cells in patients with HPV-associated cancers, demonstrating the safety and potential efficacy of this approach.Despite these encouraging advances, several challenges remain in developing effective TCR-based therapies for solid tumors. One major obstacle is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which can impair T cell function and persistence. To address this, researchers have explored combination strategies, such as coupling TCR-T cell therapy with checkpoint inhibitors or other immunomodulatory agents. For example, Gros et al. (2019) demonstrated that combining neoantigen-specific TCR-T cells with PD-1 blockade enhanced antitumor efficacy in preclinical models of melanoma.Another challenge is the potential for on-target, off-tumor toxicity, particularly when targeting antigens that are not entirely tumor-specific. To mitigate this risk, various strategies have been developed, including the use of affinity-tuned TCRs and safety switch mechanisms. Roybal et al. (2016) described a synthetic Notch receptor system that allows for precise control of T cell activation, potentially improving the safety profile of engineered T cells.The issue of tumor heterogeneity and antigen loss also poses a significant challenge to TCR-based therapies. To address this, researchers have explored multi-antigen targeting approaches. Patel et al. (2019) demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously targeting multiple neoantigens using pooled TCR-engineered T cells, showing enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to single-antigen targeting in preclinical models.Recent technological advances have also contributed to the development of more effective TCR-based therapies. High-throughput screening methods, such as those described by Bentzen et al. (2018), have enabled the rapid identification and characterization of neoantigen-specific TCRs. Additionally, gene-editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 have facilitated the generation of more potent and persistent TCR-T cells. Eyquem et al. (2017) reported on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to insert a cancer-specific TCR into the endogenous TCR locus, resulting in enhanced antitumor activity in mouse models.In conclusion, targeting driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens using TCR-based cellular therapy represents a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. While significant progress has been made in identifying and targeting these shared antigens, challenges remain in achieving optimal efficacy and safety, particularly in solid tumors. Ongoing research focusing on combination strategies, multi-antigen targeting, and advanced engineering techniques holds promise for overcoming these obstacles and improving patient outcomes. As our understanding of tumor immunology and neoantigen biology continues to evolve, TCR-based therapies are likely to play an increasingly important role in the future of cancer treatment.", "References": [{"title": "Cancer neoantigens", "authors": "Ton N.
