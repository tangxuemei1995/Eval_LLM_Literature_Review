{"Literature Review": "Organoid models have emerged as a powerful tool in cancer research, offering a unique platform to study tumor biology and evaluate therapeutic responses in a three-dimensional context. These models have gained significant attention due to their ability to recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of tumors, providing insights that are not easily obtainable through traditional two-dimensional cell culture systems or animal models.The development of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) has further enhanced the potential of organoid technology in cancer research. PDOs are derived from patient tumor samples and can maintain the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the original tumor. This feature allows researchers to study individual patient tumors in vitro, opening new avenues for personalized medicine and drug screening. Sachs et al. demonstrated the utility of PDOs in predicting patient responses to various cancer therapies, highlighting their potential in guiding clinical decision-making.As cancer immunotherapy has gained prominence in recent years, there has been a growing need for organoid models that incorporate immune cells to better represent the tumor microenvironment. The tumor immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer progression and response to therapy, making it an important aspect to consider in preclinical models. To address this need, researchers have developed various organoid immune coculture methods, each with its own strengths and limitations.One approach to incorporating immune cells into organoid models involves using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. Dijkstra et al. developed a coculture system using PDOs and allogeneic PBMCs, demonstrating the feasibility of studying immune cell interactions with tumor cells in a 3D context. This method allows for the investigation of general immune responses but may not fully capture the patient-specific immune microenvironment.An alternative approach involves using autologous immune cells derived from the same patient as the tumor organoids. Neal et al. established a coculture system using PDOs and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from the same patient sample. This method provides a more accurate representation of the patient's tumor immune microenvironment and allows for the study of personalized immune responses.The types of immune cells maintained in organoid cocultures can vary depending on the specific research questions being addressed. T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, have been a primary focus due to their central role in anti-tumor immunity. Gonzalez-Exposito et al. developed a coculture system that specifically enriches for tumor-reactive T cells, enabling the study of T cell-mediated tumor cell killing in a patient-specific context.Other immune cell types, such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, have also been incorporated into organoid cocultures. Cattaneo et al. demonstrated the successful integration of NK cells into PDO cultures, providing insights into NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Similarly, Holokai et al. established a coculture system incorporating macrophages, highlighting the importance of studying tumor-associated macrophages in the context of the tumor microenvironment.The utility of organoid immune coculture systems extends beyond studying basic tumor-immune interactions. These models have proven valuable in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapies and identifying potential biomarkers of response. Yuki et al. used PDO-immune cell cocultures to assess the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, demonstrating the potential of these models in predicting patient responses to immunotherapy.In addition to immune cells, researchers have successfully incorporated other non-immune cell types into organoid cultures to better recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to play important roles in tumor progression and drug resistance. Öhlund et al. developed a coculture system incorporating CAFs and pancreatic cancer organoids, revealing insights into the interactions between these cell types and their impact on tumor growth.Endothelial cells have also been integrated into organoid models to study tumor angiogenesis and vascularization. Seano et al. established a vascularized organoid model that allows for the investigation of tumor-vessel interactions and the evaluation of anti-angiogenic therapies.As organoid technology continues to advance, researchers are exploring new ways to enhance the complexity and physiological relevance of these models. The incorporation of multiple cell types, including immune cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells, into a single organoid culture system represents a promising direction for future research. Such complex models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its impact on cancer progression and treatment response.In conclusion, the engineering of immune cells and other microenvironmental components into organoid models represents a significant advancement in cancer research. These coculture systems offer unique opportunities to study tumor-immune interactions, evaluate immunotherapies, and develop personalized treatment strategies. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely that organoid-based models will play an increasingly important role in bridging the gap between preclinical research and clinical applications in cancer therapy.", "References": [{"title": "Derivation of High-Purity Definitive Endoderm from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Using an Essential Surface Marker CXCR4", "authors": "Naoki Sato, Luc Meijer, Leandros Skaltsounis, Paul Greengard, Ali H.
