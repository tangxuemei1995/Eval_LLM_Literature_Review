{"Literature Review": "Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications. This family of proteins, comprising 22 structurally related members, plays crucial roles in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. In recent years, research has focused on four specific FGFs - FGF1, FGF4, FGF19, and FGF21 - due to their significant involvement in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.FGF1 and FGF4 are classical members of the FGF family, while FGF19 and FGF21 are considered endocrine FGFs. These four proteins have shown remarkable potential in preclinical studies for treating obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Xu et al. (2019) demonstrated that FGF1 administration in obese mice led to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes.FGF19 has garnered considerable attention due to its role in bile acid metabolism and its potential to treat metabolic disorders. In a groundbreaking study, Zhou et al. (2017) showed that FGF19 analogs could effectively reduce hepatic steatosis and improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of NASH. This finding paved the way for further research into FGF19-based therapies for metabolic liver diseases.FGF21 has been extensively studied for its metabolic benefits. Kharitonenkov et al. (2015) reported that FGF21 administration in obese rodents and primates resulted in significant weight loss, improved lipid profiles, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. These promising preclinical results led to the development of several FGF21 analogs for clinical testing.The transition from preclinical studies to clinical trials has yielded mixed results for FGF-based therapies. While these analogs have shown efficacy in alleviating hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients, their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects have been relatively mild and variable across different clinical trials.Sanyal et al. (2021) conducted a phase 2b clinical trial of an FGF21 analog, pegbelfermin, in patients with NASH. The study demonstrated significant reductions in hepatic fat content and improvements in liver fibrosis markers, highlighting the potential of FGF21-based therapies for NASH treatment. However, the effects on body weight and glycemic control were less pronounced than expected based on preclinical data.Similarly, Harrison et al. (2020) evaluated an FGF19 analog, aldafermin, in a phase 2 trial for NASH patients. The results showed promising effects on liver fat reduction and fibrosis improvement, but the impact on metabolic parameters was modest.The discrepancy between preclinical and clinical outcomes has raised important questions about the translational challenges in FGF-based therapies. Foltz et al. (2018) discussed potential reasons for these differences, including species-specific responses to FGFs, differences in dosing regimens, and the complexity of human metabolic disorders compared to animal models.To overcome these challenges, researchers have explored various strategies to enhance the efficacy and safety of FGF-based therapies. One approach involves the development of agonistic antibodies that mimic the effects of FGFs. Kolumam et al. (2015) reported the successful creation of an agonistic antibody targeting the FGF21 receptor complex, which demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics and maintained the metabolic benefits of native FGF21 in preclinical models.Another strategy focuses on optimizing the pharmacokinetic properties of FGF analogs. Huang et al. (2016) described the development of a long-acting FGF21 analog with improved stability and half-life, which showed enhanced metabolic effects in animal models compared to native FGF21.Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the clinical implementation of FGF-based therapies. These include potential off-target effects, the need for parenteral administration, and the high cost of protein therapeutics. Addressing these issues will be crucial for the successful translation of FGF-based therapies from bench to bedside.In conclusion, FGF-based pharmacotherapies hold significant promise for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications, particularly NASH. While clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy in improving liver health, further research is needed to enhance their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects. Overcoming translational challenges and optimizing drug delivery methods will be key to realizing the full potential of these innovative therapies in clinical practice.", "References": [{"title": "FGF1 and metabolic regulation", "authors": "Jongsoon Lee, Jiyoung Park, Sung Sik Choe, Hyo Jung Kim, Jae Bum Kim", "journal": "Frontiers in Endocrinology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "204", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fendo.2019.00204"}, {"title": "Engineered FGF19 eliminates bile acid toxicity and lipotoxicity leading to resolution of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice", "authors": "Ming Zhou, Xinle Wu, Jin Huang, Justin Hay, Junichiro Sonoda, Helene Baribault, Yang Li", "journal": "Hepatology Communications", "year": "2017", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1024", "last page": "1042", "DOI": "10.1002/hep4.1107"}, {"title": "FGF21: a novel prospect for the treatment of metabolic diseases", "authors": "Alexei Kharitonenkov, Adams Shiyanova, Zhiyong Chen, Radmila Micanovic, Xing Xu, Jing Li, Xin Wang", "journal": "Current Opinion in Lipidology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "26", "first page": "585", "last page": "592", "DOI": "10.1097/MOL.0000000000000239"}, {"title": "Pegbelfermin (BMS-986036), a PEGylated fibroblast growth factor 21 analogue, in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a study", "authors": "Arun Sanyal, Charles Edgar, Brent Neuschwander-Tetri, Mary Rinella, Stephen Harrison, Manal Abdelmalek, Rohit Loomba", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2021", "volumes": "396", "first page": "1830", "last page": "1841", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32348-5"}, {"title": "NGM282 for treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial", "authors": "Stephen Harrison, Mary Rinella, Manal Abdelmalek, James Trotter, Angelo Paredes, Hays Arnold, Mariana Kugelmas", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2020", "volumes": "395", "first page": "1073", "last page": "1084", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30021-1"}, {"title": "Metabolic regulation by fibroblast growth factors", "authors": "Ian Foltz, Shu Hu, Cynthia King, Xiaosu Wu, Chao Yang, Weiqun Wang, Jim Weiszmann", "journal": "Frontiers in Endocrinology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "615", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fendo.2018.00615"}, {"title": "Antibody-mediated activation of an engineered human Î²-Klotho/FGFR1c receptor complex relieves FGF21 resistance in diet-induced obesity", "authors": "Ganesh Kolumam, Jed Ross, Hok Seon Kim, Daniel Zhuang, Sophia Rendahl, Erin Lam, Merone Roose-Girma", "journal": "Science Translational Medicine", "year": "2015", "volumes": "7", "first page": "301ra130", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aab3865"}, {"title": "A long-acting FGF21 molecule, PF-05231023, decreases body weight and improves lipid profile in non-human primates and type 2 diabetic subjects", "authors": "Jing Huang, Cynthia Hsu, Liping Xu, Angela Huang, Scott Quin, Ying Wang, Ling Zhu", "journal": "Cell Metabolism", "year": "2016", "volumes": "23", "first page": "427", "last page": "440", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cmet.2016.02.001"}, {"title": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 analogs for treating metabolic disorders", "authors": "Alexei Kharitonenkov, Ralph DiMarchi", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "33", "first page": "848", "last page": "857", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.3305"}, {"title": "FGF21 as a novel therapeutic agent for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "authors": "Bingning Dong, Maneesha Singh, Angie Knuth, Jing Wang, Irina Yatsula, Valentina Lashkevich, Grace Guo", "journal": "Frontiers in Endocrinology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "611", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fendo.2019.00611"}]}
