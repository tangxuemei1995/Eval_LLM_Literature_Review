{"Literature Review": "The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), also known as GPR30, has emerged as a significant player in estrogen signaling, complementing the classical nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs) α and β. This literature review aims to explore the molecular pharmacology and therapeutic applications of GPER, highlighting its diverse roles in various physiological systems and potential implications for disease treatment. GPER was first identified in the late 1990s and has since been recognized as a membrane-bound estrogen receptor that mediates rapid, non-genomic effects of estrogens. Unlike the classical ERs, GPER activates multiple signaling cascades, including adenylyl cyclase, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (Prossnitz and Barton, 2011). This unique signaling profile has sparked interest in GPER as a potential therapeutic target for various conditions. In cancer biology, GPER has been implicated in both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects, depending on the cancer type and cellular context. For instance, in breast cancer, GPER activation has been associated with increased cell proliferation and migration (Santolla et al., 2012). However, in certain ovarian cancer cell lines, GPER activation has demonstrated anti-proliferative effects (Wang et al., 2013). These conflicting findings underscore the complexity of GPER signaling and the need for further research to elucidate its role in cancer progression and potential therapeutic interventions. Cardiovascular health is another area where GPER has shown promise. Studies have demonstrated that GPER activation can lead to vasodilation, reduced blood pressure, and cardioprotection (Deschamps and Murphy, 2009). For example, the GPER-selective agonist G-1 has been shown to improve cardiac function and reduce infarct size in animal models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (Deschamps et al., 2010). These findings suggest that GPER-targeted therapies could potentially be developed for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the realm of metabolic disorders, GPER has been implicated in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Activation of GPER has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in animal models of type 2 diabetes (Sharma and Prossnitz, 2011). Additionally, GPER signaling has been associated with reduced adipogenesis and improved lipid profiles, suggesting a potential role in obesity management (Davis et al., 2014). The immune system is another area where GPER has demonstrated significant effects. GPER activation has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses, potentially offering new avenues for treating autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. For instance, GPER agonists have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Blasko et al., 2009). The pharmacology of GPER is complex, with a diverse array of ligands capable of activating or inhibiting the receptor. Endogenous estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol, can activate GPER, albeit with lower affinity compared to the classical ERs. Interestingly, certain selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs), such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, respectively, have been shown to act as GPER agonists (Thomas et al., 2005). This dual activity has important implications for the use of these drugs in breast cancer treatment and highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of estrogen receptor pharmacology. The development of GPER-selective compounds has greatly advanced our understanding of the receptor's functions. The GPER-selective agonist G-1 and antagonist G15 have become valuable tools in delineating GPER-specific effects from those mediated by classical ERs (Bologa et al., 2006; Dennis et al., 2011). These compounds have facilitated the exploration of GPER's physiological roles and potential therapeutic applications. As research on GPER continues to evolve, several challenges and opportunities emerge. One key area is the development of more selective and potent GPER modulators with improved pharmacokinetic properties. Such compounds could serve as valuable research tools and potential therapeutic agents. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the tissue-specific effects of GPER activation is crucial for developing targeted therapies while minimizing potential side effects. In conclusion, GPER represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, metabolic syndromes, and inflammatory conditions. Its unique pharmacological profile and diverse physiological effects offer opportunities for developing novel treatment strategies. However, the complex interplay between GPER and classical ERs, as well as its tissue-specific effects, necessitate careful consideration in drug development efforts. As research in this field progresses, it is likely that GPER-targeted therapies will play an increasingly important role in personalized medicine approaches for estrogen-related disorders.", "References": [{"title": "G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and sex-specific metabolism", "authors": "Sharma G, Prossnitz ER", "journal": "Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "366", "first page": "223", "last page": "231", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mce.2011.06.019"}, {"title": "International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.
