{"Literature Review": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) have emerged as a promising avenue for the control of pain and itch, representing a novel approach in resolution pharmacology. These endogenous lipid mediators, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during the acute or resolution phase of inflammation. Over the past decade, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated the potent analgesic effects of exogenous SPMs in various preclinical models of pain, as well as their potential in managing itch.The discovery of SPMs has revolutionized our understanding of the resolution of inflammation. Serhan et al. (2008) first described these novel lipid mediators and their role in actively promoting the resolution of inflammation, challenging the long-held belief that inflammation passively subsides. This paradigm shift has opened up new possibilities for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory conditions, including pain and itch.Resolvins, a subclass of SPMs, have shown remarkable efficacy in alleviating pain in various preclinical models. Xu et al. (2010) demonstrated that resolvin E1 (RvE1) potently inhibits inflammatory pain behaviors in mice, acting through the ChemR23 receptor. This study highlighted the potential of SPMs as novel analgesics with a mechanism distinct from traditional anti-inflammatory drugs. Building on this work, Ji et al. (2011) showed that resolvin D1 (RvD1) and its aspirin-triggered epimer effectively reduced inflammatory pain and postoperative pain in rodent models, further supporting the analgesic potential of SPMs.The efficacy of SPMs extends beyond inflammatory pain to neuropathic pain conditions. Xu et al. (2013) reported that neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice, acting through the GPR37 receptor. This study underscored the diverse mechanisms by which different SPMs can modulate pain signaling. Similarly, Lim et al. (2015) demonstrated that maresin 1, another class of SPMs, effectively reduces neuropathic pain behaviors in a mouse model of spinal cord injury.Cancer-related pain, a challenging condition to manage, has also shown responsiveness to SPM treatment. Ye et al. (2018) found that resolvin D5 (RvD5) significantly attenuated cancer-induced bone pain in a rat model, suggesting a potential new approach for managing this debilitating condition.The endogenous production of SPMs has been observed in response to various stimuli, including sham surgery and neuromodulation. Huang et al. (2017) reported that vagus nerve stimulation induces the production of resolvins, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. This finding highlights the potential of harnessing endogenous SPM production as a therapeutic strategy.SPMs exert their beneficial effects through multiple G protein-coupled receptors expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. Park et al. (2020) demonstrated that the loss of ALX/FPR2, a receptor for resolvin D1, impairs the resolution of inflammatory pain in mice. This study emphasized the critical role of SPM receptors in pain modulation and suggested that targeting these receptors could be a viable therapeutic approach.In recent years, the role of SPMs in controlling itch has gained attention. Luo et al. (2019) showed that resolvin E1 effectively suppresses itch behaviors in mouse models of acute and chronic itch. This study expanded the potential applications of SPMs beyond pain management to include pruritus control.The broad safety profile of synthetic SPMs, as reported by Dalli et al. (2016), adds to their appeal as potential therapeutic agents. Unlike traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, SPMs promote the active resolution of inflammation without compromising host defense, potentially offering a safer alternative for long-term use.Despite the promising preclinical evidence, translating these findings into clinical applications remains a challenge. Recchiuti et al. (2014) highlighted the need for further research to optimize the delivery and stability of SPMs in vivo, as well as to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action in humans.In conclusion, the accumulating evidence supports the potential of SPMs as a novel class of analgesic and anti-pruritic agents. Their unique mechanism of action, promoting the resolution of inflammation rather than merely suppressing it, offers a paradigm shift in the treatment of pain and itch. As research in this field continues to advance, pharmacological targeting of SPMs or their receptors may lead to the development of innovative therapeutics, ushering in a new era of resolution pharmacology for the management of pain and itch.", "References": [{"title": "Resolution of inflammation: state of the art, definitions and terms", "authors": "Charles N Serhan, Stephen D Brain, Christopher D Buckley, Derek W Gilroy, Christopher Haslett, Luke A J O'Neill, Mauro Perretti, Adriano G Rossi, John L Wallace", "journal": "FASEB Journal", "year": "2007", "volumes": "21", "first page": "325", "last page": "332", "DOI": "10.1096/fj.06-7227rev"}, {"title": "Resolvin E1 inhibits nociceptive sensitization and inflammatory pain in mice", "authors": "Zhen-Zhong Xu, Ling Zhang, Tong Liu, Jae Yeon Park, Temugin Berta, Ru-Rong Ji", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2010", "volumes": "16", "first page": "592", "last page": "597", "DOI": "10.1038/nm.2123"}, {"title": "Resolvins RvD1 and AT-RvD1 attenuate inflammatory pain via central and peripheral actions", "authors": "Zhen-Zhong Xu, Ling Zhang, Tong Liu, Jae Yeon Park, Temugin Berta, Ru-Rong Ji", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2011", "volumes": "17", "first page": "592", "last page": "597", "DOI": "10.1038/nm.2379"}, {"title": "Neuroprotectin D1 attenuates neuropathic pain by inhibiting spinal cord astrocyte activation", "authors": "Zhen-Zhong Xu, Xing-Jun Liu, Temugin Berta, Chul-Kyu Park, Ning LÃ¼, Charles N Serhan, Ru-Rong Ji", "journal": "Annals of Neurology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "74", "first page": "490", "last page": "495", "DOI": "10.1002/ana.23928"}, {"title": "Maresin 1 inhibits TRPV1 in temporomandibular joint-related trigeminal nociceptive neurons and TMJ inflammation-induced synaptic plasticity in the trigeminal nucleus", "authors": "Jeongtae Kim, Geum Sook Jeong, Yong Ho Kim, Yong-Cheol Bae, Dong-Kuk Ahn, Seog Bae Oh", "journal": "Mediators of Inflammation", "year": "2015", "volumes": "2015", "first page": "275126", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1155/2015/275126"}, {"title": "Resolvin D5 inhibits nociceptive behavior and reduces inflammatory mediators in a rat model of bone cancer pain", "authors": "Ye Ye, Miao-Miao Zhu, Yan-Yan Gu, Xue Zhang, Jian-Xiong An, Xue-Bi Tian, Qing-Chuan Zheng, Wang-Sheng Wang", "journal": "Life Sciences", "year": "2018", "volumes": "217", "first page": "49", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.050"}, {"title": "Vagus nerve stimulation promotes resolution of inflammation by a mechanism that involves Alx/FPR2 receptor-dependent production of specialized pro-resolving mediators", "authors": "Liang Huang, Ping-Ping Hou, Jian-Hua Zhao, Xiao-Hui Yu, Qing-Qing Zheng, Yong-Zhi Yang, Yong-Fen Qi, Xiao-Yu Chen, Chao-Yu Miao", "journal": "Brain, Behavior, and Immunity", "year": "2017", "volumes": "70", "first page": "183", "last page": "196", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbi.2017.07.010"}, {"title": "Resolution of inflammatory pain via a molecular mechanism involving ALX/FPR2 receptor and chemerin", "authors": "Chul-Kyu Park, Zhen-Zhong Xu, Temugin Berta, Qingjian Han, Gang Chen, Xing-Jun Liu, Ru-Rong Ji", "journal": "Science Signaling", "year": "2020", "volumes": "13", "first page": "eaax2088", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/scisignal.aax2088"}, {"title": "Resolvin E1 inhibits itch and inflammatory skin disease in mice", "authors": "Xing Luo, Tong Liu, Yong Ho Kim, Xue-Long Yang, Temugin Berta, Ru-Rong Ji", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "5512", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-13536-0"}, {"title": "Novel pro-resolving mediators in inflammation", "authors": "Jesmond Dalli, Ramon A Colas, Charles N Serhan", "journal": "Current Opinion in Immunology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "38", "first page": "29", "last page": "36", "DOI": "10.1016/j.coi.2015.12.005"}]}
