{"Literature Review": "The field of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology has experienced significant growth and development over the past few decades, with groundbreaking discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of these compounds and their physiological roles. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the key advancements in this field, focusing on the major cannabinoids, endocannabinoids, and their pharmacological effects.The cannabis plant has been used for medicinal and recreational purposes for thousands of years, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that the active compounds responsible for its effects were isolated and characterized. In 1964, Raphael Mechoulam and his colleagues isolated and elucidated the structure of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis [1]. This discovery marked the beginning of modern cannabinoid research and paved the way for further investigations into the pharmacology of these compounds.Following the identification of THC, researchers began to explore the mechanisms by which cannabinoids exert their effects on the human body. In 1988, Devane et al. discovered the first cannabinoid receptor, CB1, in the rat brain [2]. This finding was soon followed by the identification of a second cannabinoid receptor, CB2, primarily expressed in immune cells [3]. The discovery of these receptors suggested the existence of endogenous ligands, which led to the identification of the first endocannabinoid, anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine), by Devane et al. in 1992 [4].The identification of anandamide was a significant milestone in the field, as it revealed the presence of an endogenous cannabinoid system in mammals. This discovery was followed by the isolation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in 1995, another major endocannabinoid [5]. These findings sparked intense research into the physiological roles of the endocannabinoid system and its potential as a therapeutic target.The endocannabinoid system has since been implicated in a wide range of physiological processes, including pain modulation, appetite regulation, mood, memory, and immune function. This has led to the development of numerous synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoid modulators as potential therapeutic agents for various conditions, such as chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy [6].In addition to THC, another important phytocannabinoid that has gained significant attention is cannabidiol (CBD). Unlike THC, CBD does not produce psychoactive effects and has shown promise in treating various medical conditions. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Epidiolex, a CBD-based medication, for the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy [7]. This marked a significant milestone in the medical use of cannabinoids and has spurred further research into the therapeutic potential of CBD and other non-psychoactive cannabinoids.Recent years have seen an increased interest in the study of minor cannabinoids and terpenes present in cannabis, as well as their potential synergistic effects, known as the 'entourage effect' [8]. This concept suggests that the combination of various cannabinoids and terpenes may produce more significant therapeutic effects than isolated compounds, highlighting the complexity of cannabis pharmacology.The endocannabinoid system has also been found to interact with other physiological systems, such as the immune system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This has led to investigations into the role of endocannabinoids in stress responses, inflammation, and neurological disorders [9]. Furthermore, the discovery of endocannabinoid-like compounds, such as palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide, has expanded our understanding of the broader 'endocannabinoidome' and its potential therapeutic applications [10].As research in this field continues to evolve, new challenges and opportunities emerge. The development of more selective and potent cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists, as well as modulators of endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation, holds promise for novel therapeutic approaches. Additionally, the ongoing legalization and decriminalization of cannabis in various countries have facilitated increased research into its potential medical applications and long-term effects.In conclusion, the field of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology has come a long way since the isolation of THC in the 1960s. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system and its wide-ranging physiological roles has opened up new avenues for therapeutic interventions. As research continues to unravel the complexities of this system and its interactions with other physiological processes, it is likely that we will see further advancements in the development of cannabinoid-based therapies and a deeper understanding of the role of endocannabinoids in human health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Isolation, Structure, and Partial Synthesis of an Active Constituent of Hashish", "authors": "Yechiel Gaoni, Raphael Mechoulam", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "1964", "volumes": "86", "first page": "1646", "last page": "1647", "DOI": "10.1021/ja01062a046"}, {"title": "Determination and characterization of a cannabinoid receptor in rat brain", "authors": "William A.
