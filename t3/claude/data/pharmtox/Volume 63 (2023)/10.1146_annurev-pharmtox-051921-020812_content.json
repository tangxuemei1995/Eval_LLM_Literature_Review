{"Literature Review": "Air pollution has emerged as a significant environmental health concern, with mounting evidence suggesting its detrimental effects on human health, particularly on the central nervous system (CNS). This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of air pollution-related neurotoxicity across the life span, focusing on its impact on neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter (PM), with ultrafine particles and PM2.5 being of particular concern due to their ability to penetrate deep into the respiratory system and potentially cross the blood-brain barrier. The composition of air pollution varies depending on the source and location, but typically includes a mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, metals, and other pollutants (Block et al., 2012).Epidemiological studies have increasingly linked air pollution exposure to various neurodevelopmental disorders. A study by Volk et al. (2013) found that prenatal and early-life exposure to traffic-related air pollution was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Similarly, Guxens et al. (2014) reported that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy was associated with delayed psychomotor development in children.The impact of air pollution on neurodevelopment is not limited to early life stages. A longitudinal study by Sunyer et al. (2015) demonstrated that children attending schools in areas with higher traffic-related air pollution had slower cognitive development compared to those in less polluted areas. These findings highlight the potential long-term consequences of air pollution exposure on cognitive function and brain development.In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, air pollution has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. A large-scale study by Chen et al. (2017) found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, Kioumourtzoglou et al. (2016) reported a significant association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and increased hospitalization rates for Parkinson's disease.The mechanisms underlying air pollution-related neurotoxicity are complex and multifaceted. One proposed pathway involves the induction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. (2008) demonstrated that children living in highly polluted areas exhibited increased levels of inflammatory markers in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting a direct link between air pollution exposure and neuroinflammation.Oxidative stress, another key mechanism in air pollution-related neurotoxicity, can lead to cellular damage and dysfunction. A study by Costa et al. (2014) showed that exposure to diesel exhaust particles, a common component of urban air pollution, induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in brain cells, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative processes.An emerging area of research focuses on the role of brain metal dyshomeostasis in air pollution-related neurotoxicity. Metals are common components of particulate matter, and their accumulation in the brain has been linked to various neurological disorders. A study by Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. (2013) found that children exposed to high levels of air pollution had elevated concentrations of metals, including iron and copper, in their brains, which could contribute to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.The vulnerability of the CNS to air pollution-related neurotoxicity likely reflects shared mechanisms across various neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. These shared mechanisms include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and metal dyshomeostasis, which can disrupt normal brain function and contribute to the progression of neurological disorders (Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas, 2009).While the evidence linking air pollution to neurotoxicity is compelling, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the specific components of air pollution responsible for these effects. Future research should focus on identifying the most harmful constituents of air pollution and elucidating their mechanisms of action. This knowledge will be crucial for developing targeted interventions and policies to mitigate the neurotoxic effects of air pollution.In conclusion, the growing body of evidence linking air pollution to neurotoxicity across the life span underscores the urgent need for improved air quality standards and public health interventions. By addressing this significant environmental health concern, we can potentially reduce the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions of people worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "Air pollution and brain health: Defining the research agenda", "authors": "Michelle L.
