{"Literature Review": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) have become an increasingly significant concern in the field of anesthesiology and surgery, particularly as the global population continues to age. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of age-related PND, focusing on experimental models, potential druggable targets, and clinical assessment methods.The aging population presents unique challenges in perioperative care, with a higher risk of developing cognitive impairments following surgical procedures. Monk et al. (2008) reported that elderly patients are at a significantly higher risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) compared to younger counterparts, with incidence rates of 41% at discharge and 12.7% at three months post-surgery in patients aged 60 and above. This highlights the urgent need for improved understanding and management of PND in older surgical patients.Experimental models have played a crucial role in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PND. Terrando et al. (2011) developed a mouse model of orthopedic surgery that demonstrated a causal relationship between postoperative neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Their findings revealed that surgery-induced systemic inflammation leads to disruption of the blood-brain barrier and subsequent neuroinflammation, resulting in cognitive impairment.Building on this work, Vacas et al. (2013) utilized a rat model to investigate the impact of isoflurane anesthesia on postoperative cognitive function. They found that isoflurane exposure alone could induce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits, particularly in aged animals. This study underscored the potential contribution of anesthetic agents to PND, especially in older patients.The role of neuroinflammation in PND has emerged as a central theme in recent research. Cibelli et al. (2010) demonstrated that peripheral surgery triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which can cross the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia in the hippocampus. This neuroinflammatory response was associated with impaired cognitive function in their mouse model.Identifying druggable targets within the neuroinflammatory cascade has become a focus for potential therapeutic interventions. Xu et al. (2014) investigated the efficacy of a TNF-α inhibitor, etanercept, in preventing surgery-induced cognitive decline in aged rats. Their results showed that preemptive administration of etanercept attenuated neuroinflammation and improved postoperative cognitive outcomes, suggesting a promising avenue for pharmacological intervention.Another potential target is the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Terrando et al. (2014) demonstrated that stimulation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) with a selective agonist reduced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive dysfunction. This finding highlights the potential of cholinergic modulation as a therapeutic strategy for PND.While animal models have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of PND, translating these findings to clinical practice remains a challenge. Evered et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive review of the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for perioperative neurocognitive disorders, proposing a standardized framework for future research and clinical practice. This work emphasizes the importance of accurate assessment and diagnosis in managing PND.In line with this, the development of rapid and sensitive cognitive assessment tools has gained attention. Culley et al. (2017) evaluated the use of a tablet-based cognitive screening tool for preoperative assessment of older surgical patients. Their study demonstrated the feasibility and potential clinical utility of such digital tools in identifying patients at risk for PND.The concept of perioperative brain health has emerged as a holistic approach to managing PND. Berger et al. (2018) proposed a multidisciplinary care pathway for optimizing cognitive outcomes in older surgical patients. This approach encompasses preoperative risk assessment, intraoperative management strategies, and postoperative cognitive monitoring and rehabilitation.In conclusion, age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders represent a significant challenge in modern surgical care. Experimental models have provided crucial insights into the pathogenic mechanisms, particularly the role of neuroinflammation. These findings have led to the identification of potential druggable targets, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and cholinergic receptors. However, translating these discoveries into effective clinical interventions remains an ongoing challenge. The development of standardized diagnostic criteria and rapid assessment tools shows promise in improving the identification and management of PND. Future research should focus on refining experimental models, exploring novel therapeutic targets, and developing evidence-based perioperative care pathways to optimize cognitive outcomes in older surgical patients.", "References": [{"title": "Long-term cognitive decline in older subjects was not attributable to noncardiac surgery or major illness", "authors": "Terri G.
