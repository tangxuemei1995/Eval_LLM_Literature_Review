{"Literature Review": "The global fight against HIV/AIDS has seen remarkable progress since the disease was first described in 1981. This literature review aims to explore the roadmap for achieving universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) and the challenges that remain in this endeavor.The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the mid-1990s marked a turning point in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As noted by Gulick et al. (1997), the advent of protease inhibitors and their combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors led to dramatic improvements in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. This breakthrough paved the way for the development of more potent, safer, and more convenient antiretroviral regimens.The global scale-up of ART access has been a major public health achievement. According to UNAIDS (2020), by the end of 2019, 25.4 million people living with HIV were accessing antiretroviral therapy globally. This represents a significant increase from just 7.7 million in 2010. The expansion of ART coverage has led to substantial reductions in HIV-related deaths and new infections worldwide.However, despite these advances, significant challenges remain in achieving universal ART coverage. Bekker et al. (2018) highlight that key populations, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, and transgender individuals, continue to face barriers in accessing HIV services due to stigma, discrimination, and criminalization. Addressing these structural barriers is crucial for reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, which aim for 90% of people living with HIV to know their status, 90% of those diagnosed to receive ART, and 90% of those on treatment to achieve viral suppression.Pediatric and adolescent HIV treatment presents unique challenges. Penazzato et al. (2018) emphasize the need for age-appropriate formulations and dosing of antiretrovirals for children and adolescents. They also stress the importance of addressing adherence issues specific to these age groups, such as disclosure of HIV status and transition from pediatric to adult care.As people living with HIV age, managing comorbidities becomes increasingly important. Guaraldi et al. (2019) discuss the complex interplay between HIV infection, long-term ART use, and age-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and neurocognitive disorders. They emphasize the need for integrated care models that address both HIV and non-HIV-related health concerns in aging populations.The development of long-acting antiretrovirals represents a promising advancement in both HIV treatment and prevention. Margolis et al. (2017) report on the efficacy of long-acting injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine in maintaining viral suppression in adults with HIV. These formulations, which can be administered monthly or every two months, have the potential to improve adherence and quality of life for people living with HIV.In the realm of HIV prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has emerged as a powerful tool. Grant et al. (2010) demonstrated the efficacy of daily oral tenofovir-emtricitabine in reducing HIV acquisition among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Subsequent studies have confirmed the effectiveness of PrEP in various populations, leading to its widespread recommendation as part of comprehensive HIV prevention strategies.Despite these advancements, significant gaps remain in achieving universal ART coverage. Havlir et al. (2020) emphasize the importance of differentiated service delivery models to reach underserved populations and improve retention in care. These approaches include community-based ART delivery, multi-month dispensing, and integration of HIV services with other health services.The COVID-19 pandemic has posed additional challenges to HIV service delivery. Jewell et al. (2020) modeled the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on HIV treatment and prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to maintain essential HIV services during health crises.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in expanding access to antiretroviral treatment globally, achieving universal coverage requires addressing persistent barriers to care, developing new treatment options, and adapting service delivery models to meet the diverse needs of people living with HIV. The roadmap to universal ART must prioritize reaching key and underserved populations, addressing the unique needs of children and adolescents, managing comorbidities in aging populations, and leveraging new technologies such as long-acting antiretrovirals. Continued investment in research, implementation science, and health systems strengthening will be crucial to realizing the goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic.", "References": [{"title": "Treatment with indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection and prior antiretroviral therapy", "authors": "Roy M.
