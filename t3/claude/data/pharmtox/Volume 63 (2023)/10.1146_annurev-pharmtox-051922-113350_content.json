{"Literature Review": "The concept of the exposome, introduced by Christopher Wild in 2005, encompasses the totality of environmental exposures an individual experiences throughout their lifetime. Within this framework, the chemical exposome specifically refers to the sum of all xenobiotics that humans encounter from conception onwards. This review focuses on the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, a critical period of susceptibility to environmental influences.During pregnancy and early infancy, the developing organism is particularly vulnerable to chemical exposures due to rapid growth, immature detoxification systems, and the potential for long-lasting effects on health and development. The placenta, once thought to be an impenetrable barrier, is now recognized as permeable to many environmental chemicals, allowing maternal exposures to reach the developing fetus (Needham et al., 2011).Human biomonitoring studies have revealed the presence of numerous synthetic chemicals in maternal and fetal tissues. For instance, Woodruff et al. (2011) detected multiple persistent organic pollutants (POPs), perfluorinated compounds, and phenols in 99-100% of pregnant women in the United States. Similarly, Arbuckle et al. (2013) found measurable levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates in the majority of Canadian pregnant women.While much attention has been given to synthetic chemicals, natural biotoxins also contribute significantly to the chemical exposome. Mycotoxins, produced by fungi, can contaminate food and have been detected in maternal and cord blood samples (Warth et al., 2016). Phytoestrogens, naturally occurring in plants, can cross the placenta and have been measured in amniotic fluid (Jarrell et al., 2012).The routes of exposure for infants and young children are diverse and include transplacental transfer, breastfeeding, inhalation, dermal absorption, and ingestion. As infants begin to explore their environment, hand-to-mouth behavior increases exposure to chemicals in household dust and consumer products. Moya et al. (2014) highlighted the importance of considering age-specific exposure patterns when assessing early-life chemical exposures.One of the challenges in understanding the early-life chemical exposome is the potential for mixture effects. Humans are rarely exposed to single chemicals in isolation, and there is growing evidence that chemical mixtures can have additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects. Kortenkamp (2014) reviewed the evidence for mixture effects and emphasized the need for more research on environmentally relevant mixtures, particularly during sensitive developmental periods.Advances in analytical chemistry have greatly expanded our ability to measure a wide range of chemicals in biological samples. High-resolution mass spectrometry techniques, such as those described by Rappaport et al. (2014), allow for the simultaneous detection of thousands of chemical features in blood or urine samples. These untargeted approaches have the potential to capture a more comprehensive picture of the chemical exposome, including previously unidentified exposures.To better understand maternal-fetal transfer of chemicals, various models have been developed. Ex vivo perfusion of human placentas allows for the study of chemical transfer under controlled conditions (Myllynen et al., 2015). In vitro models using placental cell lines or primary trophoblasts can provide insights into mechanisms of chemical transport and metabolism (Aengenheister et al., 2018). Animal models, while not perfect representations of human pregnancy, offer the advantage of studying long-term effects of prenatal exposures (Jiang et al., 2014).Despite these advances, significant data gaps remain in our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome. Large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics, including both synthetic and natural compounds, are lacking. Most biomonitoring studies focus on a limited number of chemicals, potentially missing important exposures. Additionally, there is a need for more longitudinal studies that follow individuals from prenatal life through childhood and beyond to assess the long-term health impacts of early-life exposures.To advance our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome, several recommendations can be made. First, there is a need for more comprehensive biomonitoring studies that include a wider range of chemicals, including emerging contaminants and natural toxins. Second, the development and validation of non-invasive sampling methods for infants and young children would facilitate larger and more representative studies. Third, integrating exposure data with 'omics' technologies (e.g., metabolomics, epigenomics) could provide insights into biological responses to chemical exposures. Finally, improved methods for assessing cumulative exposures and mixture effects are crucial for understanding the true impact of the chemical exposome on early-life health.In conclusion, the early-life chemical exposome represents a complex and dynamic landscape of exposures that can profoundly influence human development and long-term health. As our analytical capabilities continue to expand, so too must our approaches to studying and interpreting these exposures. By addressing current data gaps and developing more holistic assessment methods, we can better understand and potentially mitigate the impacts of chemical exposures during this critical period of life.", "References": [{"title": "Environmental chemicals in pregnant women in the United States: NHANES 2003–2004", "authors": "Tracey J.
