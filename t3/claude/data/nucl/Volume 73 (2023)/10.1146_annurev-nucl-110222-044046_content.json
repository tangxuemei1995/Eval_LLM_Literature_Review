{"Literature Review": "The study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons has become a cornerstone in particle physics, offering valuable insights into quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and providing stringent tests of the Standard Model (SM). This review focuses on recent progress in understanding these decays, emphasizing their importance in measuring decay constants, form factors, and testing fundamental principles such as lepton flavor universality.Leptonic decays of charmed mesons, particularly D+ → l+νl and Ds+ → l+νl, where l represents a lepton, have been subjects of intense study. These decays are theoretically clean and allow for precise determinations of decay constants, which are crucial inputs for various SM calculations. Recent lattice QCD calculations have significantly improved the precision of these constants. For instance, Bazavov et al. (2014) reported fD = 212.6 ± 0.6 MeV and fDs = 249.0 ± 0.3 MeV, with uncertainties below 0.5%. These results have been corroborated by experimental measurements, as shown by the BESIII collaboration (Ablikim et al., 2019), who reported fD = 203.8 ± 5.3 MeV.Semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons, such as D → πlν and D → Klν, provide access to form factors, which describe the hadronic structure in these transitions. These form factors are essential for determining elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, particularly |Vcd| and |Vcs|. Lattice QCD calculations have made significant strides in predicting these form factors with high precision. For example, Koponen et al. (2013) calculated the D → K form factor at zero momentum transfer with an uncertainty of just 1.5%.Experimental measurements of these semileptonic decays have also advanced considerably. The BESIII collaboration has been at the forefront of these efforts, leveraging their unique data sets collected near the D�D� threshold. Ablikim et al. (2018) reported the most precise measurements of the branching fractions for D0 → K-e+νe and D0 → π-e+νe, with relative uncertainties of 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively. These results, combined with theoretical form factors, led to the most precise determinations of |Vcs| and |Vcd| from D meson decays.The study of charmed baryon decays has gained momentum in recent years. While traditionally less explored than meson decays, semileptonic decays of Λc+, Ξc, and Ωc baryons offer unique opportunities to probe the heavy-quark to light-quark transition in the baryon sector. Theoretical predictions for these decays have improved, with lattice QCD calculations now available for Λc+ → n form factors (Meinel, 2017). On the experimental side, the Belle collaboration (Zupanc et al., 2014) provided the first absolute measurement of the Λc+ → pK-π+ branching fraction, which serves as a normalization mode for many Λc+ decay studies.Lepton flavor universality (LFU) is a fundamental principle of the SM, predicting equal coupling of gauge bosons to the three lepton generations. Tests of LFU in charmed hadron decays have become increasingly important, especially in light of hints of LFU violation in B meson decays. The ratio of decay rates Γ(D+ → τ+ντ)/Γ(D+ → μ+νμ) provides a clean test of LFU, as many theoretical uncertainties cancel in the ratio. Recent measurements by the BESIII collaboration (Ablikim et al., 2020) have found this ratio consistent with the SM prediction, albeit with large uncertainties.The precise determination of CKM matrix elements |Vcd| and |Vcs| from charmed hadron decays contributes to unitarity tests of the CKM matrix. These tests are crucial for probing the consistency of the SM and searching for hints of new physics. The current global fits show good agreement with unitarity, but there is still room for improvement in precision.Looking forward, the field of charmed hadron decays continues to evolve. The upcoming Belle II experiment promises to collect unprecedented amounts of data, which will allow for even more precise measurements of rare decay modes and angular distributions. Additionally, improvements in lattice QCD techniques are expected to further reduce theoretical uncertainties in form factor calculations.In conclusion, the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons has seen significant progress in recent years, both theoretically and experimentally. These advances have led to improved determinations of fundamental parameters of the SM and stringent tests of its predictions. As precision continues to improve, these decays will remain powerful probes of QCD and potential windows into physics beyond the Standard Model.", "References": [{"title": "Charmed meson decay constants from three-flavor lattice QCD", "authors": "A.
