{"Literature Review": "The study of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes from nearby astrophysical explosions has emerged as a fascinating field of research, bridging the gap between nuclear physics, astrophysics, and various Earth sciences. This literature review aims to explore the recent advancements in detecting and analyzing live radioisotopes on Earth and the Moon, their implications for our understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis, and their broader impact on multiple scientific disciplines.The detection of live radioisotopes in terrestrial and lunar samples has been made possible by significant improvements in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) techniques. Wallner et al. (2016) demonstrated the capability of AMS to measure extremely low concentrations of 60Fe in deep-sea ferromanganese crusts, providing evidence for two distinct pulses of this isotope about 2-3 and 6-8 million years ago. These findings were corroborated by Knie et al. (2004), who reported an excess of 60Fe in a deep-sea ferromanganese crust, suggesting a nearby supernova explosion approximately 2.8 million years ago.The presence of 60Fe in terrestrial samples has also been confirmed in other environments. Breitschwerdt et al. (2016) reported the detection of 60Fe in Antarctic snow, while Fimiani et al. (2016) found evidence of this isotope in lunar regolith samples. These discoveries have provided valuable insights into the transport and deposition mechanisms of supernova-produced material in the Solar System.In addition to 60Fe, the detection of other radioisotopes has further expanded our understanding of recent astrophysical events. Wallner et al. (2015) reported the first detection of live 244Pu in a deep-sea ferromanganese crust, providing strong evidence for a recent r-process nucleosynthesis event in the vicinity of the Solar System. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of heavy element production in the universe.The detection of these radioisotopes has profound implications for astrophysics, particularly in the field of supernova nucleosynthesis. Hotokezaka et al. (2015) explored the production of 60Fe in core-collapse supernovae and its implications for the nearby supernova hypothesis. Their work highlighted the importance of understanding the nucleosynthesis processes in different types of supernovae to interpret the observed radioisotope abundances accurately.The r-process, responsible for the production of heavy elements, has been a subject of intense study in light of these radioisotope detections. Côté et al. (2019) reviewed the various astrophysical sites proposed for r-process nucleosynthesis, including core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, and magnetorotational supernovae. The detection of live 244Pu on Earth provides crucial constraints on the frequency and yield of r-process events in the local universe.Beyond nucleosynthesis, the study of these radioisotopes has implications for our understanding of supernova dust production and interstellar medium dynamics. Fry et al. (2016) investigated the transport of 60Fe-bearing dust grains from supernovae to the Solar System, considering the effects of the Local Bubble – a region of hot, low-density plasma surrounding the Solar System. Their work highlighted the complex interplay between supernova ejecta, interstellar medium, and Solar System dynamics.The implications of these radioisotope studies extend far beyond nuclear physics and astrophysics. In the field of heliophysics, Frisch and Dwarkadas (2018) explored the potential effects of nearby supernovae on the heliosphere and interplanetary medium. Their work suggested that supernova blast waves could have significant impacts on the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere, with potential consequences for the Earth's space environment.In astrobiology, the detection of recent nearby supernovae has sparked interest in their potential effects on Earth's biosphere. Thomas et al. (2016) investigated the possible biological impacts of increased cosmic radiation from nearby supernovae, considering effects on climate, atmospheric chemistry, and mutation rates in organisms. This research highlights the potential link between astrophysical events and biological evolution on Earth.The study of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes has also contributed to geological sciences. Feige et al. (2018) used the 60Fe signal in deep-sea sediments to develop new dating techniques for marine sediments, demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of this research field.In conclusion, the detection and analysis of live radioisotopes from nearby astrophysical explosions have opened up new avenues of research across multiple scientific disciplines. From providing constraints on supernova nucleosynthesis and r-process events to offering insights into the dynamics of the local interstellar medium and potential impacts on Earth's biosphere, these studies continue to push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe and our place within it. As AMS techniques continue to improve and new samples are analyzed, we can expect further exciting discoveries in this field, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of recent galactic history and its effects on the Solar System.", "References": [{"title": "60Fe anomaly in a deep-sea manganese crust and implications for a nearby supernova source", "authors": "K.
