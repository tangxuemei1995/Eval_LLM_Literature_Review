{"Literature Review": "The study of nuclear interactions through the lens of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has been a subject of intense research in recent decades. One particularly intriguing approach involves examining the implications of large-N_c QCD for nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. This method, which considers the limit where the number of colors (N_c) in QCD becomes large, has provided valuable insights into the ordering and scaling of nuclear forces.The large-N_c expansion, first introduced by 't Hooft in 1974, has been a powerful tool in understanding various aspects of QCD [1]. In the context of nuclear physics, Witten's seminal work in 1979 laid the groundwork for applying large-N_c ideas to baryon-baryon interactions [2]. This approach has since been extended and refined by numerous researchers, offering a systematic way to organize and understand the hierarchy of nuclear forces.One of the key advantages of the large-N_c approach is its ability to provide a consistent power counting scheme for nuclear interactions. Kaplan and Savage demonstrated that the leading order NN potential in the large-N_c limit scales as N_c, while subleading contributions scale with lower powers of N_c [3]. This scaling behavior has important implications for the relative strengths of different components of the nuclear force.The large-N_c analysis has been particularly successful in explaining certain features of the NN interaction. For instance, it predicts the dominance of the central and spin-orbit components of the nuclear force over the tensor component at leading order in 1/N_c [4]. This prediction is in good agreement with phenomenological potentials and experimental data, providing support for the validity of the large-N_c approach.However, it is crucial to note that the application of large-N_c ideas to nuclear physics is not without challenges. As pointed out by Cohen and Hansen, there are potential pitfalls in naively applying large-N_c scaling to all aspects of nuclear interactions [5]. For example, the large-N_c limit does not always commute with other limits relevant to nuclear physics, such as the chiral limit or the non-relativistic limit. These issues necessitate careful consideration when interpreting large-N_c predictions.The large-N_c approach has also been extended to three-nucleon forces. Kaplan and Manohar showed that three-body forces are suppressed by 1/N_c relative to two-body forces in the large-N_c limit [6]. This suppression helps explain the empirical observation that three-nucleon forces, while important for precise calculations, are generally smaller than two-nucleon forces.An interesting application of large-N_c ideas is in the realm of weak and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions in nuclear systems. Phillips and Samart demonstrated that the large-N_c scaling can be used to organize weak interaction contributions to nuclear processes [7]. This approach has potential implications for understanding and constraining BSM physics through nuclear observables.The large-N_c analysis has also been applied to external currents in two-nucleon systems. Parreno et al. showed how electromagnetic and weak currents in the two-nucleon sector can be organized using large-N_c scaling [8]. This work has important implications for understanding nuclear responses to external probes and for calculations of electroweak processes in nuclei.Despite its successes, there remain open questions and challenges in the application of large-N_c ideas to nuclear physics. One ongoing debate concerns the precise nature of the large-N_c limit for nuclei – whether it should be taken with fixed baryon number or fixed baryon density [9]. The resolution of this question has implications for how large-N_c predictions are applied to finite nuclei and nuclear matter.Another area of active research is the interplay between large-N_c ideas and effective field theory approaches to nuclear physics. While both approaches aim to provide systematic expansions for nuclear observables, reconciling them in all cases remains a challenge. Work by Epelbaum et al. has made progress in this direction, but further research is needed to fully understand the connections between these approaches [10].In conclusion, the study of large-N_c QCD implications for NN interactions has provided valuable insights into the structure and hierarchy of nuclear forces. While challenges and open questions remain, this approach continues to be a fruitful area of research, offering a unique perspective on the complex world of nuclear interactions. As the field progresses, the interplay between large-N_c ideas, effective field theories, and experimental data promises to further deepen our understanding of nuclear physics from first principles.", "References": [{"title": "A planar diagram theory for strong interactions", "authors": "Gerard 't Hooft", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1974", "volumes": "72", "first page": "461", "last page": "473", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(74)90154-0"}, {"title": "Baryons in the 1/N expansion", "authors": "Edward Witten", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1979", "volumes": "160", "first page": "57", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(79)90232-3"}, {"title": "The Nucleon-Nucleon Interaction and Large N_c QCD", "authors": "David B.
