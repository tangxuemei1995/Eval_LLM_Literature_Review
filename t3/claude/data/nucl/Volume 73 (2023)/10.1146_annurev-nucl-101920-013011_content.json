{"Literature Review": "The search for long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has emerged as a crucial frontier in particle physics research, offering potential insights into fundamental questions and new physics beyond the Standard Model. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical motivations, experimental techniques, and challenges associated with LLP searches at the LHC.Theoretical motivations for LLP searches stem from various proposed extensions to the Standard Model. Curtin et al. (2019) highlight that LLPs can arise naturally in many well-motivated theories, including supersymmetry, hidden valley models, and theories addressing the hierarchy problem. These particles, characterized by their extended lifetimes compared to typical collision products, can provide unique signatures in particle detectors and offer a window into new physics phenomena.One of the primary reasons for the increasing interest in LLPs is their potential to address outstanding issues in particle physics. Alimena et al. (2020) discuss how LLPs could explain dark matter, neutrino masses, and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The authors emphasize that LLP searches complement traditional prompt decay searches, expanding the parameter space explored at the LHC and potentially uncovering physics that might be missed by conventional analyses.The experimental techniques employed in LLP searches are diverse and often require innovative approaches. Lee et al. (2018) provide an overview of the various detector subsystems utilized in these searches, including the inner tracker, calorimeters, and muon chambers. They highlight the importance of timing information and displaced vertex reconstruction in identifying LLP signatures. The authors also discuss the challenges associated with triggering on LLP events, as these particles may decay far from the interaction point or even outside the detector.One of the key experimental challenges in LLP searches is background estimation. Khachatryan et al. (2015) describe the methods used to estimate backgrounds in displaced vertex searches, emphasizing the importance of data-driven techniques. The authors highlight that conventional Monte Carlo simulations often struggle to accurately model the rare processes that can mimic LLP signatures, necessitating careful background estimation strategies.Signal efficiency estimation is another crucial aspect of LLP searches. Aaboud et al. (2019) discuss the complexities involved in determining signal efficiencies for LLP models, particularly when particles decay outside the detector volume. The authors emphasize the importance of detector simulations and validation studies to ensure accurate efficiency estimates across a wide range of LLP lifetimes and decay modes.The development of dedicated reconstruction algorithms has played a vital role in advancing LLP searches. Sirunyan et al. (2018) describe novel techniques for identifying displaced jets, which are characteristic of many LLP scenarios. These algorithms exploit the unique properties of LLP decays, such as their displacement from the primary vertex and unusual energy deposition patterns, to distinguish them from standard QCD jets.Machine learning techniques have also found increasing application in LLP searches. Nachman and Shih (2020) discuss the potential of deep learning algorithms to improve LLP identification and background rejection. The authors highlight the ability of these techniques to exploit subtle correlations in detector signals, potentially enhancing the sensitivity of LLP searches.Despite the challenges, LLP searches have already yielded important results and constraints on various theoretical models. Aad et al. (2020) report on a comprehensive search for long-lived neutral particles decaying in the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter, setting stringent limits on several benchmark scenarios. This study demonstrates the power of LLP searches to probe previously unexplored regions of parameter space.Looking to the future, Liu et al. (2019) discuss the prospects for LLP searches in upcoming LHC runs and potential future colliders. The authors emphasize the importance of continued detector upgrades and the development of new experimental techniques to fully exploit the discovery potential of LLP searches.In conclusion, the search for long-lived particles at the LHC represents a vibrant and promising area of research in particle physics. As experimental techniques continue to evolve and theoretical motivations expand, LLP searches are poised to play an increasingly important role in our quest to understand the fundamental nature of the universe. The unique challenges and opportunities presented by these searches underscore the need for continued collaboration between experimentalists and theorists in this exciting field.", "References": [{"title": "Long-Lived Particles at the Energy Frontier: The MATHUSLA Physics Case", "authors": "David Curtin, Marco Drewes, Matthew McCullough, Patrick Meade, Rabindra N.
