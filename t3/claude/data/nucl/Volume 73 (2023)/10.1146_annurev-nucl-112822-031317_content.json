{"Literature Review": "The study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions has been a cornerstone in understanding the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a state of matter characterized by deconfined quarks and gluons at extremely high temperatures. Over the past two decades, experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have provided unprecedented insights into the nature of this exotic state of matter. One of the most powerful probes of the QGP has been jet quenching, a phenomenon where high-energy partons lose energy as they traverse the hot and dense medium created in these collisions.The concept of jet quenching was first proposed by Bjorken in 1982, who suggested that energetic partons would lose energy through elastic collisions with the constituents of the QGP. Since then, our understanding of this process has evolved significantly, with both theoretical and experimental advancements contributing to a more comprehensive picture of jet-medium interactions.Early experimental evidence for jet quenching came from the observation of suppressed production of high-transverse momentum hadrons in Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions at RHIC. This suppression, quantified by the nuclear modification factor RAA, was one of the first indications of the formation of a strongly interacting medium in heavy-ion collisions. Subsequent measurements at the LHC confirmed and extended these observations to higher energies, providing further evidence for the existence of the QGP.As experimental techniques improved, more sophisticated jet observables became accessible. Full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions allowed for detailed studies of jet substructure and fragmentation patterns. These measurements revealed significant modifications of jet properties in the presence of the QGP, including broadening of the jet shape and softening of the jet fragmentation function.While the study of jet quenching has provided valuable insights into the properties of the QGP, recent years have seen an increased focus on the medium response to jet energy loss. This aspect of jet-medium interactions is crucial for a complete understanding of the energy and momentum transport within the QGP. The medium response, also known as jet-induced medium excitation, refers to the collective excitation of the QGP in response to the passage of a high-energy parton.Theoretical approaches to describing the medium response can be broadly categorized into weakly coupled and strongly coupled frameworks. Weakly coupled approaches, based on perturbative QCD, treat the medium response as a linear superposition of wake fields induced by the propagating jet. These models have been successful in describing certain aspects of jet-medium interactions, such as the ridge-like correlations observed in two-particle correlations.On the other hand, strongly coupled approaches, often utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, provide a non-perturbative description of the medium response. These models have been particularly useful in understanding the rapid thermalization of the QGP and the hydrodynamic-like behavior observed in heavy-ion collisions. Recent work by Casalderrey-Solana et al. has shown that strongly coupled descriptions can successfully reproduce many features of jet quenching observed in experiments.The effects of medium response on jet observables have been the subject of intense study in recent years. One of the key findings is that the medium response can significantly affect the interpretation of jet energy loss measurements. For example, Tachibana et al. demonstrated that the inclusion of medium response effects can lead to a softer spectrum of particles associated with jets, potentially explaining some of the discrepancies between theory and experiment in jet shape measurements.Jet-hadron correlations have emerged as a powerful tool for probing the medium response. These correlations provide information on how the energy lost by jets is redistributed within the medium. Experimental measurements of jet-hadron correlations at both RHIC and the LHC have revealed intriguing features, such as an enhancement of soft particles at large angles relative to the jet axis. These observations have been interpreted as evidence for the collective response of the medium to jet energy deposition.Recent theoretical work by Cao et al. has shown that the medium response can lead to unique signatures in jet-hadron correlations, including a characteristic double-peak structure in the azimuthal distribution of associated hadrons. These predictions have stimulated new experimental efforts to measure jet-hadron correlations with increased precision and over a wider kinematic range.The study of jet-induced medium excitation is not only important for understanding jet-medium interactions but also holds promise for constraining the transport properties of the QGP. In particular, the strength and spatial extent of the medium response are sensitive to the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (η/s) of the QGP, a key parameter characterizing its fluidity.As we move forward, the integration of medium response effects into jet quenching frameworks is becoming increasingly important for the precise extraction of QGP properties. Future experimental programs, such as the sPHENIX upgrade at RHIC and proposed measurements at the LHC, are expected to provide more detailed information on jet-induced medium excitation, further advancing our understanding of this critical aspect of heavy-ion physics.In conclusion, the study of medium response and jet-hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions has emerged as a crucial component in our quest to understand the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. By combining insights from jet quenching with the collective response of the medium, we are moving towards a more complete picture of the dynamics of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. As experimental and theoretical techniques continue to advance, we can expect further breakthroughs in this exciting field of research.", "References": [{"title": "Observation of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV", "authors": "K.
