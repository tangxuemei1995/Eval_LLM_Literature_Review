{"Literature Review": "Vector boson scattering (VBS) has emerged as a crucial area of study in particle physics, offering unique insights into the fundamental mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking and the potential for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This literature review aims to synthesize recent experimental findings and theoretical developments in boson-boson interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with a focus on VBS processes.The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics predicts specific behaviors for vector boson interactions, particularly at high energies. As noted by Aaboud et al. (2019), these interactions are intimately connected to the Higgs mechanism, which is responsible for giving mass to fundamental particles. However, the possibility remains that the Higgs mechanism may not be the sole source of electroweak symmetry breaking, leading to potential deviations from SM predictions in VBS processes.Recent experimental efforts at the LHC have made significant strides in probing these interactions. Sirunyan et al. (2020) reported on the observation of electroweak production of same-sign W boson pairs in association with two jets, a key VBS process. This measurement, achieved with a significance of 5.5 standard deviations, marks a milestone in the study of VBS at the LHC. The observed cross-section was found to be consistent with SM predictions, providing important validation of our current understanding of electroweak physics.Building on this work, Aad et al. (2020) presented evidence for electroweak production of two W bosons of the same electric charge in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV. Their analysis, based on 36.1 fb⁻¹ of data collected by the ATLAS detector, yielded a measured cross-section in agreement with SM expectations. This result further strengthens our confidence in the SM description of VBS processes.The study of VBS is not limited to same-sign W boson production. Aaboud et al. (2018) reported on the observation of electroweak Z boson pair production in association with two jets, another important VBS channel. Their analysis, using 36.1 fb⁻¹ of data, provided valuable insights into the ZZjj electroweak production process and its interference with the strong production process.While these results are consistent with SM predictions, the search for new physics remains a key motivation for VBS studies. As discussed by Azatov et al. (2019), VBS processes are sensitive to potential new physics effects, even if the energy scale of such new physics lies beyond the direct reach of the LHC. This sensitivity arises from the fact that VBS amplitudes grow with energy in the absence of the Higgs boson, making them excellent probes of the electroweak sector at high energies.The role of the Higgs boson in regulating VBS processes is crucial. Butter et al. (2016) explored the interplay between Higgs physics and VBS, highlighting how precise measurements of VBS can provide indirect constraints on Higgs couplings. This connection underscores the importance of VBS studies in our overall understanding of the electroweak sector.Looking towards the future, the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) promises to significantly enhance our ability to study VBS processes. Cepeda et al. (2019) outlined the physics prospects for the HL-LHC, emphasizing the potential for precision measurements of VBS cross-sections and differential distributions. These measurements will be crucial in searching for subtle deviations from SM predictions that could indicate new physics.Experimental challenges remain in the study of VBS processes. Aad et al. (2021) discussed the difficulties in separating electroweak VBS signals from backgrounds, particularly those arising from strong production processes. Advanced analysis techniques, including machine learning approaches, are being developed to address these challenges and improve the sensitivity of VBS measurements.In conclusion, the study of boson-boson interactions at the LHC, particularly through VBS processes, has entered an exciting new phase. Recent observations and measurements have provided strong support for SM predictions, while also laying the groundwork for more precise future measurements. As we move towards the HL-LHC era, VBS studies will continue to play a crucial role in probing the fundamental nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. The coming years promise to bring new insights and potentially groundbreaking discoveries in this vital area of particle physics research.", "References": [{"title": "Observation of electroweak production of same-sign W boson pairs in the two jet and two same-sign lepton final state in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV", "authors": "A.
