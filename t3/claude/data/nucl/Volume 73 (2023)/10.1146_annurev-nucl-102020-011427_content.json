{"Literature Review": "The top quark, discovered in 1995, has since been a focal point of particle physics research due to its unique properties and potential connections to physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This literature review explores various BSM scenarios where the top quark plays a central role, focusing on three main areas: stabilization of the weak scale, flavor models, and dark matter interactions.The hierarchy problem, which concerns the large discrepancy between the weak scale and the Planck scale, has been a driving force for BSM physics. Several models have been proposed to address this issue, with the top quark often playing a crucial role due to its large Yukawa coupling. One prominent example is supersymmetry (SUSY), where the top quark's superpartner, the stop, is particularly important for naturalness considerations [1]. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts that the stop should be relatively light to avoid fine-tuning, leading to extensive searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2].Another approach to the hierarchy problem is the concept of composite Higgs models, where the Higgs boson emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a new strong interaction. In these models, the top quark is often partially composite, mixing with vector-like fermions from the strong sector [3]. This partial compositeness can lead to distinctive phenomenology, including modified top quark couplings and the presence of top partners, which are actively searched for at the LHC [4].The flavor structure of the Standard Model, with its large mass hierarchies and mixing angles, remains a puzzle that many BSM theories attempt to explain. The top quark, with its exceptionally large mass compared to other fermions, often plays a special role in these flavor models. One approach is the concept of flavor symmetries, where the top quark is singled out as the only quark transforming non-trivially under a new symmetry group [5]. This can lead to specific patterns in the quark mass matrices and mixing angles, potentially explaining the observed flavor structure.Another flavor-related scenario is the idea of partial compositeness in the flavor sector. In these models, the degree of compositeness is correlated with the fermion masses, naturally explaining the large top quark mass [6]. This approach can lead to flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) involving the top quark, which are highly suppressed in the Standard Model but could be enhanced in these scenarios, providing potential experimental signatures [7].The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing questions in particle physics and cosmology. Interestingly, several models propose a connection between dark matter and the top quark. One possibility is that dark matter particles preferentially couple to top quarks, motivated by the idea that both might originate from the same BSM sector [8]. This scenario can lead to distinctive signatures in direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments, as well as at colliders.Top-philic dark matter models often predict mono-top signatures at hadron colliders, where a single top quark is produced in association with missing transverse energy [9]. These signatures have been searched for at the LHC, providing constraints on such models. Additionally, these scenarios can lead to enhanced annihilation of dark matter into top quark pairs, potentially observable in indirect detection experiments looking for high-energy neutrinos or gamma rays from dark matter annihilation [10].In conclusion, the top quark continues to be a key player in many BSM scenarios, from addressing fundamental questions like the hierarchy problem and flavor structure to potentially providing a window into the dark matter sector. While no clear signs of BSM physics have been observed yet, the unique properties of the top quark make it a promising avenue for future discoveries. Ongoing and future experiments at the LHC and beyond will continue to probe these scenarios, potentially uncovering new physics associated with the top quark.", "References": [{"title": "Natural SUSY endures", "authors": "Michele Papucci, Joshua T.
