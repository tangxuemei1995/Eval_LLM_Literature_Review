{"Literature Review": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been remarkably successful in describing fundamental interactions, but it fails to address several observed phenomena, such as dark matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. This has led to an ongoing search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In recent years, two areas of particular interest have emerged in the study of b and c quark decays: lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation and lepton flavor violation (LFV). These phenomena have garnered significant attention due to their potential to reveal new physics and challenge our understanding of fundamental particle interactions.Lepton flavor universality is a key prediction of the Standard Model, which posits that the three generations of leptons (electrons, muons, and taus) should interact with equal strength, differing only in their masses. However, recent experimental results have hinted at possible violations of this principle. Greljo et al. (2015) provided an early comprehensive analysis of LFU violation in B meson decays, highlighting the tension between SM predictions and experimental observations in ratios such as R(D) and R(D*).The LHCb collaboration has been at the forefront of these investigations, with several measurements suggesting deviations from LFU. Aaij et al. (2017) reported a significant discrepancy in the ratio R(K) = BR(B → Kμ+μ-) / BR(B → Ke+e-), which should be close to unity in the SM. This result, along with similar measurements in other B decay channels, has sparked intense theoretical and experimental interest in LFU violation.Buttazzo et al. (2017) proposed a unified explanation for the observed anomalies in b → sℓ+ℓ- and b → cτν transitions, suggesting the presence of new physics at the TeV scale. Their model, involving leptoquarks, provided a coherent framework to explain the various LFU-violating observables while satisfying other experimental constraints.The connection between LFU violation and LFV has been explored by several authors. Glashow et al. (2014) argued that any new physics explaining the LFU anomalies in B decays would likely also induce LFV processes at observable levels. This insight has motivated searches for LFV in both b and c decays, as well as in charged lepton decays.On the experimental front, searches for LFV have been conducted in various channels. The Belle collaboration (Huschle et al., 2015) performed a search for B → K(*)eμ decays, setting stringent upper limits on these LFV processes. Similarly, the BaBar collaboration (Lees et al., 2012) conducted searches for LFV in τ lepton decays, providing important constraints on BSM theories.Theoretical frameworks attempting to explain both LFU violation and LFV have been developed. Crivellin et al. (2018) proposed a model based on a gauged Lμ - Lτ symmetry, which could simultaneously address the B-physics anomalies and predict observable LFV effects. Their work highlighted the importance of considering multiple observables and the interplay between different flavor sectors.The role of charm quark decays in probing LFU and LFV has also gained attention. Fajfer et al. (2015) investigated the potential of rare charm decays to test lepton universality and search for LFV, emphasizing the complementarity of b and c decay studies in constraining new physics models.Recent experimental efforts have focused on improving the precision of LFU tests and expanding the search for LFV. The Belle II experiment, with its significantly larger dataset, is expected to provide crucial input in the coming years. Kou et al. (2019) outlined the physics program of Belle II, including its potential to clarify the nature of the observed anomalies and to search for rare LFV processes with unprecedented sensitivity.Looking ahead, the upgraded LHCb detector and the proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC) offer exciting prospects for flavor physics. Cerri et al. (2019) discussed the potential of these future experiments to definitively establish or rule out the current hints of new physics in b and c decays, as well as to explore new avenues for LFV searches.In conclusion, the study of LFU violation and LFV in b and c decays has emerged as a promising frontier in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The coherent set of measurements suggesting non-standard effects in LFU, coupled with theoretical arguments linking LFU to LFV, has energized both experimental and theoretical efforts in this field. With ongoing experiments and planned upgrades, the particle physics community is well-positioned to fully explore these phenomena and potentially uncover genuinely unexpected discoveries in the coming years.", "References": [{"title": "Lepton-Flavour Universality Violation in B-Meson Decays", "authors": "Aleksandra Greljo, Gino Isidori, David Marzocca", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "2015", "first page": "142", "last page": "142", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP07(2015)142"}, {"title": "Test of lepton universality with B0 → K*0ℓ+ℓ- decays", "authors": "R.
