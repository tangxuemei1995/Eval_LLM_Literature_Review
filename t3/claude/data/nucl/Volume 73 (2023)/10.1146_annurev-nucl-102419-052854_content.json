{"Literature Review": "The top quark, discovered in 1995 at Fermilab, has been a subject of intense study at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) since its inception. As the heaviest known elementary particle, the top quark plays a crucial role in our understanding of fundamental physics and serves as a window into potential new phenomena beyond the Standard Model (SM). This literature review aims to synthesize recent advancements in top quark physics at the LHC, focusing on precision measurements, associated production processes, and searches for new physics.One of the most significant achievements in top quark physics at the LHC has been the unprecedented precision in measuring its fundamental properties. Gao and Zhu (2018) reported that the top quark mass (mt) has been determined with a relative uncertainty of less than 0.5%, a remarkable improvement from earlier measurements. This precision is crucial for testing the internal consistency of the SM and constraining models of new physics.The strong coupling constant (αS) is another fundamental parameter that has been measured with increasing precision using top quark events. Czakon et al. (2019) demonstrated that αS can now be determined with a relative uncertainty of about 1.8% from top quark pair production cross-sections, providing a competitive measurement to other methods and contributing to the global average.The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element Vtb, which describes the coupling between top and bottom quarks, has also been measured with improved accuracy. Giammanco and Schwienhorst (2018) reviewed various methods for measuring Vtb, including single top quark production processes, showing that the relative uncertainty has been reduced to about 2%.The Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson (yt) is of particular interest due to its large value, close to unity. Sirunyan et al. (2020) reported on the direct measurement of yt through ttH production, achieving a relative uncertainty of about 10%. This measurement provides a crucial test of the SM Higgs mechanism and constrains models of new physics that modify the top-Higgs interaction.Associated production processes involving top quarks have emerged as powerful probes of the SM and potential new physics. Aaboud et al. (2019) presented measurements of top quark pair production in association with vector bosons (ttW and ttZ), which are sensitive to the top quark's electroweak couplings and provide constraints on effective field theory operators.The production of four top quarks (tttt) is a rare SM process that has recently been observed at the LHC. Sirunyan et al. (2019) reported evidence for this process, which is sensitive to the top quark Yukawa coupling and various beyond-SM scenarios, such as new heavy particles decaying to top quarks or modified top quark couplings.Searches for rare top quark decays have also been conducted at the LHC, probing potential new physics scenarios. Aaboud et al. (2018) presented searches for flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays of the top quark, such as t → qH and t → qZ, which are highly suppressed in the SM but could be enhanced in various new physics models.The precision of top quark measurements at the LHC has necessitated significant advancements in theoretical calculations. Czakon et al. (2017) provided state-of-the-art predictions for top quark pair production at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, including electroweak corrections, which are crucial for matching the experimental precision.Looking ahead, the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) promises to further improve the precision of top quark measurements and extend the reach of new physics searches. Azzi et al. (2019) presented projections for top quark physics at the HL-LHC, indicating that many measurements will become systematics-limited, emphasizing the need for improved theoretical predictions and experimental techniques.In conclusion, top quark physics at the LHC has entered an era of precision measurements, providing stringent tests of the SM and constraining various new physics scenarios. The interplay between experiment and theory has driven significant progress in our understanding of the top quark's properties and interactions. As the LHC continues to accumulate data and upgrades to higher luminosities, top quark physics will remain at the forefront of particle physics research, potentially uncovering new phenomena or further solidifying the SM as one of the most successful scientific theories to date.", "References": [{"title": "Top quark physics at the LHC", "authors": "Jun Gao, Hua Xing Zhu", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2018", "volumes": "783", "first page": "79", "last page": "84", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2018.06.023"}, {"title": "Top-quark pair hadroproduction at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD", "authors": "Michal Czakon, Paul Fiedler, David Heymes, Alexander Mitov", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "2017", "first page": "65", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP05(2017)065"}, {"title": "Determination of the strong coupling constant αs(mZ) from measurements of the total cross section for top-antitop quark production", "authors": "Michal Czakon, Andrea Ferroglia, David Heymes, Alexander Mitov, Ben D.
