{"Literature Review": "The detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils have become increasingly important in the fields of dark matter searches and neutrino physics. As experiments push the boundaries of sensitivity, accurate characterization of detector responses to these elusive signals is crucial for interpreting results and improving experimental designs. This literature review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding detection methods, calibration techniques, and challenges in the field of low-energy nuclear recoil measurements.Nuclear recoils are a key signature in both dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) experiments. Dark matter particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), are expected to produce nuclear recoils through elastic scattering with target nuclei [1]. Similarly, CEνNS events involve the coherent scattering of neutrinos off entire nuclei, resulting in low-energy nuclear recoils [2]. The ability to detect and accurately measure these recoils is therefore critical for advancing our understanding of both dark matter and neutrino physics.Various detection technologies have been developed to observe low-energy nuclear recoils. Cryogenic bolometers, such as those used in the CDMS and CRESST experiments, measure the temperature rise associated with particle interactions [3]. Noble liquid detectors, including xenon-based experiments like XENON1T and LUX, utilize both scintillation and ionization signals to identify nuclear recoils [4]. Bubble chambers, employed in experiments like PICO, rely on the nucleation of superheated liquids by nuclear recoils [5]. Each of these technologies presents unique advantages and challenges in the detection of low-energy events.Calibration of detector response to nuclear recoils is a complex task due to the low energies involved and the need to distinguish these events from electronic recoils. Neutron sources are commonly used for calibration, as neutrons can produce nuclear recoils similar to those expected from dark matter or neutrino interactions. Monoenergetic neutron beams, such as those produced by nuclear reactions or accelerator facilities, allow for precise energy-dependent calibrations [6]. However, these sources often require careful consideration of multiple scattering effects and background contributions.In situ calibration techniques have also been developed to address the challenges of low-energy nuclear recoil measurements. The use of radioactive sources that produce low-energy nuclear recoils, such as the decay of 210Pb to 206Pb, has been explored in some experiments [7]. Additionally, the development of pulsed neutron sources and associated particle tagging methods has enabled time-of-flight measurements, improving the precision of neutron-based calibrations [8].One of the primary challenges in nuclear recoil calibration is the accurate determination of the energy scale. The relationship between the observed signal (e.g., scintillation light or ionization) and the true recoil energy is often non-linear and depends on various factors, including the target material and the specific detection technology. Quenching factors, which describe the reduced light or charge yield for nuclear recoils compared to electronic recoils of the same energy, must be carefully measured and incorporated into calibration analyses [9].Background discrimination is another critical aspect of low-energy nuclear recoil experiments. Techniques such as pulse shape discrimination, which exploits differences in the time structure of scintillation signals between nuclear and electronic recoils, have been developed to improve signal-to-background ratios [10]. The effectiveness of these discrimination techniques must be thoroughly characterized through calibration measurements to ensure accurate interpretation of experimental results.As experiments push towards lower energy thresholds and larger target masses, new challenges emerge in the field of nuclear recoil calibration. The need for improved low-energy calibration sources, better understanding of detector response at very low energies, and more sophisticated analysis techniques to handle increased data volumes are all active areas of research. Additionally, the potential for neutrino-induced backgrounds in future dark matter experiments highlights the importance of precise CEνNS measurements and calibrations.Looking forward, advancements in nuclear recoil detection and calibration techniques may enable new physics opportunities. Improved sensitivity to low-energy recoils could allow for the exploration of alternative dark matter models, such as those involving lighter particles or different interaction mechanisms. In the field of neutrino physics, precise measurements of CEνNS could provide insights into nuclear structure and potentially probe physics beyond the Standard Model.In conclusion, the detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils remain critical challenges in dark matter and neutrino physics experiments. Continued development of detection technologies, calibration techniques, and analysis methods will be essential for pushing the boundaries of sensitivity and exploring new physics phenomena. As the field progresses, collaboration and standardization of calibration procedures across different experiments may become increasingly important to facilitate meaningful comparisons and advance our understanding of these fundamental particles and their interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Dark Matter Results from 54-Ton-Day Exposure of PandaX-II Experiment", "authors": "Xiangyi Cui, Abdusalam Abdukerim, Wei Chen, Xun Chen, Yunhua Chen, Binbin Dong, Deqing Fang, Changbo Fu, Karl Giboni, Franco Giuliani", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2017", "volumes": "119", "first page": "181302", "last page": "181302", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.181302"}, {"title": "Observation of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering", "authors": "D.
