{"Literature Review": "The gauge hierarchy problem has been a central focus in particle physics for decades, stemming from the apparent discrepancy between the weak scale and the Planck scale. This review explores recent innovative approaches to addressing this problem without necessitating new particles at the TeV scale, as traditional solutions have been challenged by experimental results.The hierarchy problem arises from the sensitivity of the Higgs boson mass to quantum corrections from high-energy scales. Bardeen (1995) proposed that the hierarchy problem might be an artifact of our theoretical framework, suggesting that scale invariance could protect the Higgs mass. This perspective has influenced subsequent research in the field.One of the most intriguing recent approaches is the relaxation mechanism, introduced by Graham et al. (2015). This mechanism proposes a dynamical solution where the Higgs mass evolves over time, settling at a small value at the minimum of its potential. The relaxation approach utilizes an axion-like field coupled to the Higgs, which scans the Higgs mass parameter during cosmic evolution. Espinosa et al. (2015) further developed this idea, exploring its implications for cosmology and particle physics.The historical approach to the hierarchy problem considers the role of cosmic history in determining the Higgs mass. Dvali and Vilenkin (2004) proposed that the observed Higgs mass could be a result of anthropic selection in a multiverse scenario. Building on this concept, Geller et al. (2018) investigated how details of inflation and reheating could influence the Higgs mass, potentially explaining its smallness without invoking new TeV-scale physics.Another promising avenue involves the use of conditional probability in addressing the hierarchy problem. Arkani-Hamed et al. (2016) proposed that the smallness of the cosmological constant and the Higgs mass might be correlated in the landscape of string theory vacua. This approach suggests that selecting for a small cosmological constant automatically favors vacua with a small Higgs mass.The N-naturalness framework, introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. (2016), provides a novel perspective on the hierarchy problem. This approach posits the existence of multiple copies of the Standard Model, with the observed universe emerging from the sector with the smallest Higgs mass. While not requiring new TeV-scale particles, it does introduce new physics at higher energy scales.Recent work by Giudice et al. (2019) has explored the possibility of addressing the hierarchy problem through cosmological relaxation in the context of clockwork models. This approach combines the relaxation mechanism with the clockwork framework, potentially offering a more robust solution to the hierarchy problem.The cosmological approach to the hierarchy problem has gained traction in recent years. Cheung and Pappadopulo (2017) proposed a model where the Higgs mass is determined by cosmological dynamics, potentially explaining its smallness without introducing new particles at the TeV scale. This work has sparked further research into the interplay between cosmology and particle physics in addressing fundamental questions.It is worth noting that these new approaches to the hierarchy problem are not without challenges. Critiques have been raised regarding the fine-tuning required in some of these models. For instance, Hook and Marques-Tavares (2018) pointed out potential issues with the relaxation mechanism, particularly in reconciling it with inflation.Despite these challenges, the pursuit of solutions to the hierarchy problem without TeV-scale new physics remains an active and exciting area of research. As experimental constraints on new particles at the TeV scale continue to tighten, these alternative approaches offer promising avenues for understanding the origin of the weak scale.In conclusion, the gauge hierarchy problem continues to drive innovation in theoretical physics. While traditional solutions involving TeV-scale new particles face experimental challenges, new approaches leveraging cosmological dynamics, relaxation mechanisms, and probabilistic arguments offer fresh perspectives. As the field progresses, it is likely that a combination of these ideas, along with future experimental results, will lead to a more complete understanding of the origin of mass scales in particle physics.", "References": [{"title": "Cosmological Relaxation of the Electroweak Scale", "authors": "Peter W.
