{"Literature Review": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has made significant strides in the field of neutrino physics, particularly in the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). This process, predicted by the Standard Model but only recently observed, has opened up new avenues for exploring fundamental physics and searching for phenomena beyond the Standard Model.CEvNS is a process in which a neutrino scatters off an entire atomic nucleus coherently, resulting in a small nuclear recoil. The cross-section for this interaction is relatively large compared to other neutrino interactions, but the low-energy nuclear recoils make it challenging to detect [1]. The SNS provides an ideal environment for studying CEvNS due to its intense, pulsed neutrino beam produced from pion decay at rest, which offers a well-characterized neutrino energy spectrum and timing structure [2].The COHERENT collaboration achieved a major breakthrough in 2017 with the first observation of CEvNS using a cesium iodide (CsI) scintillator detector [3]. This groundbreaking result confirmed a prediction made over four decades earlier and opened up new possibilities for probing nuclear structure, testing the Standard Model, and searching for new physics. The collaboration followed up this success with a second CEvNS measurement using a liquid argon (LAr) detector in 2020, further validating the theoretical predictions and expanding the range of target nuclei studied [4].These measurements have important implications for various areas of physics. In nuclear physics, CEvNS provides a new tool for probing neutron distributions in nuclei, complementing information obtained from other experimental techniques [5]. This is particularly relevant for understanding the equation of state of neutron-rich matter, which has implications for neutron star structure and heavy-ion collisions.In particle physics, precise measurements of CEvNS can be used to test the Standard Model and search for new physics. The weak mixing angle, a fundamental parameter of the electroweak theory, can be measured at low momentum transfer through CEvNS, providing a unique test of the running of this parameter [6]. Additionally, CEvNS is sensitive to various types of new physics, including non-standard neutrino interactions, sterile neutrinos, and dark matter mediators [7].The potential of CEvNS for dark matter searches is particularly intriguing. The same coherent scattering process that allows neutrinos to interact with nuclei could also enable the detection of light dark matter particles produced in accelerator experiments [8]. The SNS, with its high-intensity proton beam, could potentially produce sub-GeV dark matter particles that could be detected through their scattering in the COHERENT detectors.In astrophysics, CEvNS plays a crucial role in core-collapse supernovae, where it contributes to neutrino opacity and energy transfer. The ability to measure CEvNS cross-sections on various nuclei provides important input for supernova simulations and helps in interpreting future supernova neutrino signals [9]. Furthermore, the SNS neutrino source allows for the study of inelastic neutrino-nucleus interactions, which are relevant for understanding supernova neutrino detection and nucleosynthesis.Looking forward, the COHERENT collaboration has an ambitious program to expand its suite of detectors and explore new physics opportunities. Future detectors will target different nuclei, allowing for a more comprehensive study of the nuclear dependence of CEvNS and increased sensitivity to new physics effects. Improved detector technologies with lower energy thresholds and better background rejection will enable more precise measurements and extend the reach of searches for beyond-Standard Model physics [10].In conclusion, the COHERENT experiment at the SNS has ushered in a new era in neutrino physics with the observation of CEvNS. This achievement not only confirms a long-standing prediction of the Standard Model but also provides a powerful new tool for exploring fundamental physics at the intersection of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. As the experiment continues to collect data and improve its detectors, it promises to yield valuable insights into the nature of neutrinos, nuclear structure, and potentially, the existence of new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model.", "References": [{"title": "Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering", "authors": "D.
