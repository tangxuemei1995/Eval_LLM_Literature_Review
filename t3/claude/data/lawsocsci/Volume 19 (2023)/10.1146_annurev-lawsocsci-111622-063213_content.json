{"Literature Review": "The persistent challenge of bias and discrimination in society has led researchers to explore various strategies for debiasing people's minds and reducing discriminatory behaviors. However, the effectiveness of these interventions, particularly one-time debias trainings, has been called into question. This literature review examines the current state of research on debiasing interventions, the role of laws and policies in shaping biased thinking, and the potential for using legal and policy frameworks as tools for creating lasting changes in biases.Numerous studies have investigated the efficacy of debias trainings in reducing implicit biases and discriminatory behaviors. Lai et al. (2014) conducted a comprehensive review of 17 interventions aimed at reducing implicit racial preferences, finding that while some interventions were effective in the short term, their effects were generally fleeting. Similarly, Forscher et al. (2019) performed a meta-analysis of 492 studies on changing implicit bias, concluding that while interventions can produce small changes in implicit bias measures, these changes rarely translate into meaningful behavioral shifts.The limited effectiveness of one-time trainings can be attributed to the deeply ingrained nature of biases, which are shaped by broader societal structures. Reskin (2012) argues that organizational structures and practices play a crucial role in perpetuating workplace inequalities, suggesting that individual-level interventions alone may be insufficient. This perspective is supported by Bonilla-Silva (2015), who contends that racial inequality is maintained through systemic racism embedded in social institutions, rather than solely through individual prejudices.The role of laws and policies in creating and maintaining biased social structures has been well-documented. Rothstein (2017) provides a comprehensive analysis of how government policies, particularly in housing and education, have contributed to racial segregation and inequality in the United States. These structural inequalities, in turn, reinforce biased thinking and behavior. Massey and Denton (1993) demonstrate how residential segregation, often resulting from discriminatory policies, perpetuates racial inequality and limits intergroup contact, which is crucial for reducing prejudice.Intergroup contact theory, as proposed by Allport (1954) and further developed by Pettigrew and Tropp (2006), suggests that positive interactions between members of different groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the effectiveness of contact is contingent upon the conditions under which it occurs, including equal status, common goals, and institutional support. Laws and policies play a critical role in creating these conditions for positive intergroup contact.Given the limitations of individual-level interventions and the profound impact of structural factors on bias, researchers have begun to explore how laws and policies can be leveraged as debiasing social interventions. Paluck and Green (2009) review various prejudice reduction interventions, highlighting the potential of institutional and policy-level approaches. They argue that interventions targeting social norms and institutional practices may be more effective in producing lasting change than those focused solely on individual attitudes.The potential of laws and policies as debiasing tools is further supported by research on the expressive function of law. Sunstein (1996) argues that laws can shape social norms and behaviors by signaling societal values and expectations. This perspective suggests that well-crafted laws and policies could not only address structural inequalities but also influence individual attitudes and behaviors over time.Recent studies have begun to explore specific policy interventions aimed at reducing bias and discrimination. For example, Dobbin and Kalev (2016) examine the effectiveness of diversity policies in organizations, finding that policies that engage managers in solving diversity problems are more effective than mandatory diversity training. This research underscores the importance of designing interventions that address both individual and structural factors.While the potential of laws and policies as debiasing interventions is promising, challenges remain in their implementation and evaluation. Tankard and Paluck (2017) highlight the complexities of measuring the impact of policy changes on individual attitudes and behaviors, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies and diverse methodological approaches.In conclusion, the literature suggests that addressing bias and discrimination requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond individual-level interventions. Laws and policies play a crucial role in shaping the social structures that perpetuate biases, and they also hold potential as tools for creating lasting change. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating policy interventions that target both structural inequalities and individual attitudes, with the goal of cultivating more equitable and inclusive societies.", "References": [{"title": "Long-term reduction in implicit race bias: A prejudice habit-breaking intervention", "authors": "Patricia G.
