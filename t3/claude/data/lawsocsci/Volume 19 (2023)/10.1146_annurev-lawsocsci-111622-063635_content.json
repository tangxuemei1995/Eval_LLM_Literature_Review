{"Literature Review": "The intersection of authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China has garnered significant scholarly attention in recent years. This literature review explores three key questions surrounding this complex relationship, drawing on diverse perspectives and empirical research.The first question addresses the existence and nature of legality in China's Leninist single-party state. Scholars have approached this issue from various angles, resulting in a spectrum of interpretations. On one end, those who view the system primarily as a mechanism for order maintenance argue for the absence of legality. For instance, Minzner (2018) contends that China's legal system is primarily designed to uphold party control rather than establish rule of law. In contrast, scholars employing dual-state and instrumentalist views of law find evidence of partial legality. Peerenboom (2002) argues that China has developed a form of 'thin' rule of law, where legal institutions serve both to constrain and empower the state. At the other end of the spectrum, proponents of 'bare legality' argue for the existence of complete legality in China. Chen (2016) suggests that China has established a unique form of 'rule by law' that, while different from Western conceptions, still constitutes a form of legality.The second question explores whether authoritarian legality strengthens regime legitimacy in China. There is a general consensus among scholars that the Chinese state actively seeks legitimation through its embrace of authoritarian legality. Zhao (2017) argues that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has strategically used legal reforms to enhance its legitimacy and maintain social stability. However, the effectiveness of this strategy remains a subject of debate. Empirical research by Landry et al. (2010) suggests that citizens' perceptions of the legal system do indeed contribute to regime legitimacy, but the relationship is complex and varies across different segments of society.The third question addresses China's economic transition and the role of law in state capitalism. The traditional 'transition paradigm' that envisions a linear progression from plan to market has been increasingly challenged. Scholars like Milhaupt and Zheng (2015) argue that China's economic model is better understood as a form of state capitalism, where the government maintains significant control over key economic sectors while allowing market mechanisms to operate in others. This perspective highlights the importance of understanding the illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets in China.The role of law in this state capitalist system is multifaceted. On one hand, legal reforms have been crucial in facilitating market transactions and attracting foreign investment. Zhang (2016) demonstrates how the development of contract law has been instrumental in China's economic growth. On the other hand, the legal system also serves as a tool for maintaining state control over the economy. Chen and Deakin (2015) show how labor laws in China balance worker protection with the needs of state-led development.The concept of the 'dual state' is particularly relevant in understanding the role of law in China's authoritarian state capitalism. Fraenkel's (1941) original formulation of the dual state, applied to Nazi Germany, described a system where a 'normative state' of regular law coexisted with a 'prerogative state' of arbitrary power. In the Chinese context, Pils (2017) argues that this duality is manifested in the coexistence of formal legal institutions and extra-legal party mechanisms.The perpetuation of plan elements within China's market economy further reinforces state power. While China has moved away from a purely planned economy, elements of state planning persist, particularly in strategic sectors. Lin (2017) demonstrates how this selective retention of planning allows the state to guide economic development while maintaining political control.These dynamics help explain several key features of contemporary China, including regime resilience, economic growth, economic crises, and inequality. The flexibility afforded by the dual state and the strategic use of both market and plan elements have contributed to the CCP's ability to navigate challenges and maintain power. However, this system also creates tensions and contradictions that may pose long-term challenges for China's development.In conclusion, the literature on authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China reveals a complex and nuanced picture. While China has developed legal institutions and market mechanisms, these operate within a system that prioritizes party control and state interests. Understanding this unique configuration is crucial for comprehending China's political economy and its implications for global governance.", "References": [{"title": "End of an Era: How China's Authoritarian Revival is Undermining Its Rise", "authors": "Carl Minzner", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/oso/9780190672089.001.0001"}, {"title": "China's Long March toward Rule of Law", "authors": "Randall Peerenboom", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511493737"}, {"title": "The Law and Politics of Constitutional Reform and Democratization in Hong Kong", "authors": "Albert H.
