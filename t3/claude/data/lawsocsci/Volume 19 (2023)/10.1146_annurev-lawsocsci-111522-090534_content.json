{"Literature Review": "Vaccines have long been a subject of intense scrutiny in public health, law, and social sciences. This literature review explores the evolving landscape of vaccine research, highlighting the shift from instrumentalist approaches to more nuanced, interdisciplinary perspectives that consider the complex socio-legal and scientific contexts surrounding vaccination.Traditionally, research on vaccines in law and social sciences has been dominated by an instrumentalist approach, focusing primarily on promoting vaccine acceptance and overcoming hesitancy. Scholars such as Larson et al. (2014) have extensively studied vaccine hesitancy, attempting to identify factors that influence vaccine acceptance and develop strategies to increase uptake. However, despite these efforts, finding effective levers for behavioral change has remained challenging.The limitations of this instrumentalist approach have led to a growing interest in more constructivist perspectives. Feminist sociology and anthropology have made significant contributions to this shift. For instance, Reich (2014) conducted an ethnographic study that revealed how vaccine debates intersect with broader issues of parenting and social inequality. This research highlighted the complex ways in which vaccine decisions are embedded in larger social and cultural contexts, moving beyond simplistic notions of 'pro' or 'anti' vaccine stances.Anthropological approaches have also shed light on how vaccine debates can reinforce existing patterns of racism and colonialism. Leach and Fairhead (2007) explored how global vaccination campaigns in West Africa were perceived locally, uncovering tensions between international health initiatives and local understandings of health and illness. This work emphasized the importance of considering cultural and historical contexts when studying vaccine acceptance and implementation.The field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) has opened up new avenues for vaccine research by focusing on the materiality and movement of vaccines within complex networks. Brives et al. (2016) examined the global production and distribution of vaccines, highlighting how these processes are shaped by economic, political, and technological factors. This approach moves beyond individual-level analyses to consider the broader systems and structures that influence vaccine availability and uptake.However, applying STS approaches to vaccine research presents significant methodological challenges. Tracking the movement of vaccines through global networks requires innovative research designs and interdisciplinary collaboration. Hardon and Blume (2005) proposed a framework for studying vaccines as 'socio-technical ensembles,' emphasizing the need to consider both the technical aspects of vaccine development and the social contexts in which they are deployed.Despite these advancements, the majority of law and social science research on vaccines continues to adhere to instrumentalist conceptions of law in service of public health. This persistence raises important questions about the factors that constrain or enable scholars to move beyond this paradigm. Colgrove (2006) provided a historical perspective on the relationship between law and vaccination in the United States, demonstrating how legal frameworks have shaped vaccine policy and public perception over time.The reluctance to move away from instrumentalist approaches may be partly explained by the perceived urgency of public health concerns. Gostin (2008) argued for the importance of law as a tool for promoting public health, including vaccination. While this perspective has its merits, it may inadvertently limit the scope of vaccine research by focusing primarily on legal mechanisms for increasing vaccine uptake.However, some scholars have successfully integrated more critical perspectives into their work on vaccines and the law. For example, Attwell et al. (2018) examined how mandatory vaccination policies intersect with notions of parental rights and state authority, revealing the complex ethical and legal considerations at play in vaccine policy debates.Moving forward, there is a need for more interdisciplinary research that bridges the gap between instrumentalist and constructivist approaches to vaccine studies. Holmberg et al. (2017) proposed a framework for integrating insights from STS, public health, and legal studies to develop a more comprehensive understanding of vaccine controversies and their implications for policy and practice.In conclusion, while instrumentalist approaches to vaccine research in law and social sciences have dominated the field, there is growing recognition of the need for more nuanced, interdisciplinary perspectives. By incorporating insights from feminist sociology, anthropology, and science and technology studies, scholars can develop a richer understanding of the complex social, cultural, and material dimensions of vaccination. This shift not only enhances our theoretical understanding of vaccines but also has the potential to inform more effective and equitable vaccine policies and practices.", "References": [{"title": "Vaccine hesitancy: definition, scope and determinants", "authors": "Heidi J.
