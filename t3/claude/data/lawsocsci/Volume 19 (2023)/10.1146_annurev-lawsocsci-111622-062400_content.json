{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race, immigration, and labor in the United States has been a subject of increasing scholarly attention in recent years. This literature review examines the historical and contemporary factors driving immigrant worker precarity, with a particular focus on the central role of race in shaping labor experiences and the pursuit of worker justice.The framework of racial capitalism provides a crucial lens through which to understand the experiences of immigrant workers in the United States. Scholars such as Robinson (1983) have argued that capitalism is inherently racial, with its development inextricably linked to processes of racialization and exploitation. Building on this concept, Lowe (2015) demonstrates how the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession have cemented an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally.The historical roots of immigrant labor exploitation can be traced back to the nation's founding. As Ngai (2004) argues, the racialization of immigrant groups has been a consistent feature of U.S. immigration policy, with different groups facing varying degrees of exclusion and exploitation based on prevailing racial ideologies. This racialization process has had profound implications for immigrant workers, shaping their access to rights, protections, and economic opportunities.Contemporary scholarship has increasingly focused on how racism and colonial legacies create migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. Golash-Boza (2015) demonstrates how U.S. foreign policy and economic interventions in Latin America have contributed to migration flows, creating a cycle of displacement and precarious labor. Similarly, Gonzales (2016) examines how the racialization of Latinx immigrants intersects with legal status to produce varying degrees of vulnerability in the labor market.The role of racism in perpetuating migrant worker precarity extends beyond displacement and into the very structures of the immigration bureaucracy. De Genova (2002) argues that the production of migrant 'illegality' is a deliberate process that serves to create a vulnerable and exploitable workforce. This perspective is further developed by Menjívar and Abrego (2012), who introduce the concept of 'legal violence' to describe how immigration laws and their implementation create conditions of suffering and injustice for immigrant workers.In response to these challenges, various movements and organizations have emerged to advocate for immigrant worker rights. The traditional labor movement has played an important role in this struggle, but as Milkman (2006) notes, its effectiveness has been limited by historical tensions between organized labor and immigrant workers. This gap has increasingly been filled by worker centers and the broader immigrant rights movement.Fine (2006) provides a comprehensive analysis of worker centers, demonstrating how these organizations have become crucial sites of advocacy and organizing for low-wage immigrant workers. These centers often employ innovative strategies that go beyond traditional labor organizing, addressing the intersecting issues of work, immigration, and racial justice.The immigrant rights movement has also played a pivotal role in advancing worker justice. Nicholls (2013) examines how immigrant rights activists have strategically framed their demands, often navigating between emphasizing shared humanity and highlighting the specific challenges faced by racialized immigrant groups. This strategic framing has been crucial in building coalitions and advancing policy changes.However, these partnerships between labor organizations, worker centers, and immigrant rights groups have not been without tension. Tensions have arisen around issues of strategy, resource allocation, and the prioritization of different goals. Gleeson (2012) explores these dynamics, highlighting how different organizations navigate these challenges while working towards the common goal of immigrant worker rights.Despite these challenges, scholars have documented numerous successful collaborations and innovative strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights. For instance, Apostolidis (2019) examines how day laborers in the Pacific Northwest have organized to resist exploitation and assert their rights, often in partnership with local advocacy groups and labor organizations.In conclusion, this literature review underscores the critical importance of centering race in studies of low-wage immigrant labor. By examining the historical legacies of racial capitalism, the ongoing processes of racialization in immigration policy and enforcement, and the innovative strategies employed by worker advocates, scholars have illuminated the complex intersections of race, immigration, and labor in the United States. Future research in this field will undoubtedly continue to grapple with these issues, contributing to our understanding of how to achieve greater justice for immigrant workers in an increasingly globalized world.", "References": [{"title": "Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition", "authors": "Cedric J.
