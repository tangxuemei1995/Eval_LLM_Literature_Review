{"Literature Review": "The Guantánamo Bay detention facility, established in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, has become a symbol of the United States' controversial 'war on terror' and its complex legal and ethical implications. This literature review examines the legacy of Guantánamo across four presidential administrations, focusing on its role in debates surrounding torture, military commissions, and the rule of law.The establishment of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent 'war on terror' declared by the Bush administration. Steyn (2004) argues that the creation of this facility was part of a broader strategy to operate outside the constraints of domestic and international law, effectively creating a 'legal black hole.' This perspective is supported by Hafetz (2011), who contends that Guantánamo was deliberately chosen as a location to house detainees precisely because it was believed to be beyond the reach of U.S. courts.The use of enhanced interrogation techniques, widely considered to be torture, has been a central point of controversy surrounding Guantánamo. McCoy (2006) provides a comprehensive historical analysis of U.S. involvement in torture, arguing that the practices at Guantánamo represent a continuation of Cold War-era CIA interrogation methods. This view is echoed by Greenberg (2006), who examines how the Bush administration's legal team worked to redefine torture and justify its use in the name of national security.The military commissions established to try Guantánamo detainees have been another source of intense debate and legal challenges. Denbeaux and Hafetz (2009) argue that these commissions fail to meet basic standards of due process and violate both U.S. and international law. Their work highlights the numerous legal challenges brought against the commissions and the government's attempts to limit detainees' access to civilian courts.The Supreme Court has played a crucial role in shaping the legal landscape surrounding Guantánamo. Wittes (2008) provides a detailed analysis of the key Supreme Court decisions related to Guantánamo, including Rasul v. Bush (2004), Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), and Boumediene v. Bush (2008). These landmark cases affirmed detainees' right to challenge their detention in U.S. courts and struck down early versions of the military commissions as unconstitutional.Despite these legal victories, the closure of Guantánamo has proven to be a persistent challenge. Worthington (2007) documents the stories of Guantánamo detainees and argues that many were wrongfully imprisoned, highlighting the human cost of the facility's continued operation. The Obama administration's failure to close Guantánamo, despite campaign promises to do so, is examined by Savage (2015), who details the political and logistical obstacles that prevented the facility's closure.The Trump administration marked a shift in policy, with a renewed commitment to keeping Guantánamo open and potentially expanding its use. Rosenberg (2019) explores how this policy shift affected ongoing legal proceedings and debates about the facility's future. The Biden administration has signaled a return to the goal of closing Guantánamo, but as Falk and Hajjar (2022) note, significant obstacles remain, including congressional opposition and the challenge of what to do with remaining detainees.Throughout its history, Guantánamo has raised fundamental questions about the balance between national security and human rights. Margulies (2013) examines how the 'war on terror' has challenged traditional notions of the rule of law and argues for a recalibration of U.S. counterterrorism policies to better align with constitutional and international legal norms.The legacy of Guantánamo extends beyond the United States, influencing global perceptions of American commitment to human rights and the rule of law. Duffy (2015) explores how Guantánamo has affected U.S. soft power and its ability to promote human rights internationally, arguing that the facility has significantly damaged America's moral standing.In conclusion, the literature reveals that Guantánamo's legacy is complex and multifaceted, touching on issues of executive power, human rights, national security, and the rule of law. The lack of consensus on Guantánamo's meaning and significance reflects broader partisan divides in American politics and ongoing debates about the proper balance between security and liberty in the face of terrorist threats. As the facility enters its third decade of operation, its future remains uncertain, but its impact on U.S. law, politics, and international relations is likely to endure for years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Guantánamo's Long Shadow", "authors": "Jonathan Hafetz", "journal": "Nation", "year": "2011", "volumes": "293", "first page": "11", "last page": "14", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror", "authors": "Alfred W.
