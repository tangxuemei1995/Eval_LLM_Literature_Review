{"Literature Review": "Medical aid in dying (MAID) has emerged as a significant area of research at the intersection of medicine, law, and culture over the past two decades. This complex and controversial practice, which involves the provision of medication to terminally ill patients to end their lives, has sparked intense debates and social scientific inquiry. This literature review aims to synthesize and analyze the current state of knowledge on MAID, focusing on its social, legal, and cultural dimensions.One of the primary areas of research has been the study of attitudes toward MAID. Hendry et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review of public attitudes, finding generally high levels of support for MAID across various countries, although with significant variations based on demographic factors and cultural contexts. This finding is corroborated by Emanuel et al. (2016), who noted that support for MAID has been increasing over time in the United States, particularly among younger generations and those with higher levels of education.The role of social movements in advocating for MAID has been another crucial area of study. Karsoho et al. (2016) examined the framing strategies employed by right-to-die movements, highlighting how these groups have successfully reframed MAID as a matter of individual autonomy and dignity rather than a moral or religious issue. Similarly, Norwood (2018) explored the historical development of the right-to-die movement in the United States, tracing its evolution from a fringe cause to a mainstream policy debate.The legal landscape surrounding MAID has been a fertile ground for research. Steck et al. (2013) provided a comprehensive overview of different legalization approaches worldwide, comparing and contrasting the regulatory frameworks in countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Oregon (USA). Their analysis revealed significant variations in eligibility criteria, procedural safeguards, and reporting requirements across jurisdictions. Building on this work, Chambaere et al. (2015) examined the impact of legal frameworks on MAID practices, finding that clear regulations can help prevent abuse while ensuring access for eligible patients.As MAID has become legal in more jurisdictions, researchers have turned their attention to the lived experiences of those involved in the practice. Wiebe et al. (2018) conducted in-depth interviews with family members of individuals who had undergone MAID in Canada, revealing complex emotional responses and the importance of support systems throughout the process. Similarly, Gerson et al. (2020) explored the experiences of healthcare providers involved in MAID, highlighting the emotional and ethical challenges they face and the need for comprehensive training and support.The cultural meanings associated with MAID have been a central focus of social scientific inquiry. Gandsman (2018) examined how MAID intersects with broader cultural narratives about individualism, autonomy, and the 'good death' in Western societies. His work highlighted how MAID both reflects and reinforces cultural values around control and self-determination at the end of life. Complementing this perspective, Karsoho et al. (2017) analyzed media representations of MAID in Canada, demonstrating how public discourse shapes and is shaped by evolving cultural attitudes toward death and dying.The process of knowledge production around MAID has also been subject to critical analysis. Timmermans (2005) explored how medical professionals negotiate the boundaries between healing and hastening death in jurisdictions where MAID is legal, revealing the complex ways in which medical knowledge and practice adapt to changing legal and ethical landscapes. Similarly, Broom (2012) examined the role of evidence in MAID debates, highlighting how different stakeholders mobilize scientific knowledge to support their positions.Finally, the comparative lens offered by social scientific research on MAID has provided valuable insights into how different cultural, legal, and healthcare contexts shape end-of-life practices. Rietjens et al. (2009) conducted a cross-national comparison of end-of-life decision-making in six European countries, revealing significant variations in MAID practices even among countries with similar legal frameworks.In conclusion, social scientific research on MAID has made significant contributions to our understanding of this complex and evolving practice. By focusing on attitudes, social movements, legal frameworks, lived experiences, and cultural meanings, this body of work has illuminated the multifaceted nature of MAID and its implications for individuals, healthcare systems, and societies. As MAID continues to be debated and implemented in various jurisdictions, ongoing social scientific inquiry will be crucial in informing policy, practice, and public discourse on this important issue.", "References": [{"title": "Attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide: a review of the current literature", "authors": "Hendry, Maggie and Pasterfield, Diana and Lewis, Ruth and Carter, Ben and Hodgson, Daniel and Wilkinson, Clare", "journal": "Journal of Palliative Medicine", "year": "2013", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1544", "last page": "1552", "DOI": "10.1089/jpm.2012.0430"}, {"title": "Attitudes and Practices of Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide in the United States, Canada, and Europe", "authors": "Emanuel, Ezekiel J and Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D and Urwin, John W and Cohen, Joachim", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2016", "volumes": "316", "first page": "79", "last page": "90", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2016.8499"}, {"title": "Constructing the 'good death' and the 'dying person': Medical Aid-in-Dying in Canada", "authors": "Karsoho, Hadi and Fishman, Jennifer R and Wright, David K and Macdonald, Mary Ellen", "journal": "Sociology of Health & Illness", "year": "2016", "volumes": "38", "first page": "436", "last page": "451", "DOI": "10.1111/1467-9566.12375"}, {"title": "The Final Battle: The Right to Die in America", "authors": "Norwood, Frances", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "47", "first page": "371", "last page": "388", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050140"}, {"title": "Euthanasia and assisted suicide in Western countries: a systematic review", "authors": "Steck, Nicole and Egger, Matthias and Maessen, Maud and Reisch, Thomas and Zwahlen, Marcel", "journal": "European Journal of Public Health", "year": "2013", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1093/eurpub/ckt170"}, {"title": "Recent Trends in Euthanasia and Other End-of-Life Practices in Belgium", "authors": "Chambaere, Kenneth and Vander Stichele, Robert and Mortier, Freddy and Cohen, Joachim and Deliens, Luc", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2015", "volumes": "372", "first page": "1179", "last page": "1181", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMc1414527"}, {"title": "Family Members' Experiences With Medical Assistance in Dying: A Qualitative Study", "authors": "Wiebe, Ellen and Shaw, Janine and Green, Stephanie and Trouton, Konia and Kelly, Michaela", "journal": "Canadian Family Physician", "year": "2018", "volumes": "64", "first page": "e387", "last page": "e393", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Assisted dying: a qualitative study of the views of healthcare professionals", "authors": "Gerson, Sheri M and Koksvik, Gitte H and Richards, Naomi and Materstvedt, Lars Johan and Clark, David", "journal": "BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "e22", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1136/bmjspcare-2019-002016"}, {"title": "Longing for death: suicide, euthanasia and the duty to live", "authors": "Gandsman, Ari", "journal": "Medicine, Anthropology, Theory", "year": "2018", "volumes": "5", "first page": "57", "last page": "73", "DOI": "10.17157/mat.5.1.516"}, {"title": "Examining the role of evidence in end-of-life care and euthanasia debates in Australia", "authors": "Broom, Alex", "journal": "Social Science & Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1535", "last page": "1542", "DOI": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.06.016"}]}
