{"Literature Review": "The study of global lawmaking has become increasingly important in an interconnected world where international agreements significantly impact domestic policies and vice versa. This literature review focuses on the lessons learned from intellectual property rights (IPR) and international health emergencies, with a particular emphasis on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and its implications for global health. The TRIPS agreement, negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994, marked a significant milestone in the global governance of intellectual property rights. Sell (2003) provides a comprehensive analysis of the TRIPS negotiations, highlighting the role of powerful multinational corporations in shaping the agreement's provisions. This work underscores the importance of considering non-state actors in the study of global lawmaking. The impact of TRIPS on public health became a contentious issue, particularly concerning access to essential medicines in developing countries. Hoen et al. (2011) examine the evolution of the debate on IPRs and public health, focusing on the 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Their research demonstrates how civil society organizations and developing countries successfully advocated for flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement to protect public health interests. The relationship between IPRs and public health has been further complicated by the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements. Correa (2006) analyzes the trend of 'TRIPS-plus' provisions in these agreements, which often impose more stringent IPR protections than required by TRIPS. This study highlights the need to consider multiple levels of governance when examining global lawmaking processes. Methodological approaches to studying global lawmaking have evolved in response to these complex dynamics. Shaffer and Pollack (2010) propose a framework for understanding the interaction between hard and soft law in global governance, emphasizing the importance of considering both formal agreements and informal norms. Their work exemplifies the trend towards more nuanced approaches that capture the complexity of global lawmaking. The literature on global lawmaking can be categorized into three main methodological approaches, as suggested by the abstract: 1. Methodological internationalism: This approach focuses primarily on international institutions and agreements as the drivers of global lawmaking. Helfer (2004) provides an example of this approach in his analysis of the regime complex for intellectual property, emphasizing the role of international organizations in shaping global IP norms. 2. Methodological nationalism: This perspective prioritizes the role of domestic factors in shaping global laws. Deere (2008) demonstrates this approach in her study of how developing countries implement TRIPS, highlighting the importance of national political economies and bureaucracies in determining compliance with international agreements. 3. Interplay between domestic and international factors: This approach recognizes the mutual influence of domestic and international elements in global lawmaking. Drahos (2010) exemplifies this perspective in his examination of the global intellectual property rulemaking system, emphasizing the complex interactions between state and non-state actors across multiple levels of governance. Recent scholarship has increasingly called for a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements in global lawmaking. Kapczynski (2009) demonstrates the potential of this approach in her analysis of the access to knowledge movement, showing how transnational advocacy networks have influenced both domestic and international IP policies. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of understanding the interplay between IPRs and global health governance. Abbott and Reichman (2020) examine the challenges and opportunities for global cooperation in developing and distributing vaccines and treatments, emphasizing the need for flexible approaches to IPRs during health emergencies. In conclusion, the study of global lawmaking, particularly in the context of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies, reveals the complex interplay between domestic and international factors. The evolution of methodological approaches reflects a growing recognition of this complexity. Future research in this field would benefit from adopting a co-constitutive approach that captures the dynamic and multifaceted nature of global lawmaking processes. Such an approach could provide valuable insights for policymakers and scholars alike, contributing to more effective and equitable global governance in areas such as public health and intellectual property rights.", "References": [{"title": "Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights", "authors": "Susan K.
