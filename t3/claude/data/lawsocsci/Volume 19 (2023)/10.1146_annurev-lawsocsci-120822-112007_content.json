{"Literature Review": "Mandatory employment arbitration has been a subject of intense debate in the field of employment law and alternative dispute resolution for several decades. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the academic discourse surrounding this topic, focusing on the arguments put forth by both proponents and opponents of the practice, as well as the empirical evidence that has emerged in recent years.Proponents of mandatory employment arbitration argue that it offers a more accessible and efficient means of dispute resolution compared to traditional civil litigation. Colvin and Gough (2015) suggest that arbitration can provide a faster and less costly alternative to court proceedings, potentially benefiting both employers and employees. This view is supported by Estreicher (2001), who contends that arbitration can level the playing field for lower-wage workers who might otherwise be unable to afford legal representation in court.However, critics of mandatory employment arbitration paint a different picture. Stone and Colvin (2015) argue that the practice is inherently coercive, as employees are often required to agree to arbitration as a condition of employment, effectively waiving their right to pursue claims in court. This power imbalance, they assert, can lead to unfair outcomes for employees. Sternlight (2015) further emphasizes that mandatory arbitration can limit employees' ability to engage in collective action, potentially undermining important workplace protections.One of the central debates in the literature revolves around the question of access to justice. Proponents argue that arbitration provides a forum for resolving disputes that might otherwise go unaddressed due to the high costs and complexity of litigation. Eisenberg and Hill (2003) found that arbitration may be particularly beneficial for lower-wage workers with smaller claims, who might be unable to secure legal representation for court proceedings. However, Gough (2021) challenges this notion, suggesting that the purported benefits of arbitration in terms of access to justice may be overstated.Empirical research has played a crucial role in informing this debate. A significant body of evidence has emerged comparing outcomes in arbitration to those in civil litigation. Colvin (2011) conducted a comprehensive analysis of employment arbitration outcomes, finding that employee win rates and award amounts were significantly lower in arbitration compared to litigation. This finding has been corroborated by subsequent studies, including Gough (2021), who found that employees were less likely to prevail in arbitration and received smaller awards when they did win.The issue of repeat players in arbitration has also received considerable attention in the literature. Bingham (1997) first identified the 'repeat player effect' in employment arbitration, suggesting that employers who frequently use arbitration may gain advantages over employees who are typically one-time players. More recent research by Colvin and Gough (2015) has provided further evidence of this effect, finding that employees fare worse when facing employers with more arbitration experience.Another area of concern highlighted in the literature is the potential for bias in arbitrator selection. Eigen and Litwin (2014) argue that the process of arbitrator selection can be manipulated by employers to their advantage, potentially compromising the neutrality of the forum. This concern is echoed by Sternlight (2015), who suggests that arbitrators may have incentives to favor employers in order to secure future appointments.The duration of dispute resolution in arbitration compared to litigation has also been a subject of empirical investigation. While proponents often claim that arbitration offers speedier resolution, some studies have challenged this assumption. Colvin (2011) found that the average time to disposition in employment arbitration was not significantly shorter than in litigation, contrary to common claims about the efficiency of arbitration.It is important to note that the empirical literature on mandatory employment arbitration is not without its limitations. Many studies rely on data from a single arbitration provider, the American Arbitration Association, which may not be representative of all employment arbitration. Additionally, selection effects in both arbitration and litigation can make direct comparisons challenging.In conclusion, the literature on mandatory employment arbitration reveals a complex and contentious landscape. While proponents continue to argue for its benefits in terms of accessibility and efficiency, a growing body of empirical evidence tends to support the concerns raised by critics. The lower success rates for employees, smaller awards, evidence of a repeat player effect, and questions about arbitrator neutrality all pose significant challenges to the legitimacy of mandatory employment arbitration as a forum for resolving workplace disputes. As the debate continues, further research will be crucial in informing policy decisions and potential reforms in this important area of employment law.", "References": [{"title": "Mandatory Arbitration and Inequality of Justice in Employment", "authors": "Alexander J.
