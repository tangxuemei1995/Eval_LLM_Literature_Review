{"Literature Review": "Perceptual decision-making is a fundamental cognitive process that allows organisms to interpret sensory information and select appropriate actions. While traditional research has focused on stable environments with consistent stimuli and rules, recent studies have highlighted the importance of flexibility in decision-making to adapt to changing contexts. This literature review explores the neural mechanisms underlying flexible perceptual decision-making, emphasizing the distributed nature of these processes across various brain regions.The ability to make flexible decisions is crucial for survival in dynamic environments. Cisek and Kalaska (2010) proposed that decision-making involves continuous competition between potential actions, with sensory evidence and contextual factors modulating this competition. This framework suggests that flexibility is an inherent feature of the decision-making process, allowing for rapid adjustments based on changing circumstances.One key aspect of flexible decision-making is the ability to switch between different task rules or stimulus-response mappings. Sakai (2008) reviewed the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in task switching, highlighting its importance in maintaining and updating task sets. The PFC has been shown to exhibit context-dependent activity patterns that reflect current task demands and guide behavior accordingly.However, recent research has revealed that flexible decision-making involves a much broader network of brain regions beyond the PFC. Siegel et al. (2015) used simultaneous recordings from multiple brain areas in monkeys performing a context-dependent decision task. They found that contextual information was represented across a distributed network, including frontal, parietal, and sensory areas, with different regions showing distinct temporal dynamics.The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has emerged as a critical node in flexible decision-making networks. Hanks and Summerfield (2017) reviewed evidence suggesting that the PPC integrates sensory evidence with prior knowledge and decision-related variables, such as reward expectations and action costs. This integration allows for adaptive decision-making based on current context and goals.Sensory areas also play a crucial role in flexible decision-making by modulating their responses based on task demands. David et al. (2012) demonstrated that primary visual cortex neurons in mice show rapid, context-dependent changes in their stimulus selectivity when switching between different visual discrimination tasks. This finding challenges the traditional view of early sensory areas as fixed feature detectors and highlights their role in adaptive processing.Subcortical structures, particularly the basal ganglia, contribute to flexibility in decision-making by mediating the selection and execution of actions. Ding and Gold (2013) reviewed evidence suggesting that the basal ganglia integrate sensory and cognitive information to bias action selection based on current context and learned associations. This subcortical involvement emphasizes the distributed nature of flexible decision-making processes.The neural computations underlying flexible decision-making are diverse and context-dependent. Mante et al. (2013) used a context-dependent integration task in monkeys to show that prefrontal neurons implement a form of dynamic routing, selectively integrating task-relevant sensory inputs while ignoring irrelevant ones. This mechanism allows for rapid adaptation to changing task demands without requiring extensive relearning.Another important aspect of flexible decision-making is the ability to adjust decision policies based on changing environments or internal states. Tajima et al. (2016) developed a computational model that accounts for various forms of context-dependent changes in decision policies, such as adjustments in speed-accuracy trade-offs or changes in response biases. Their model suggests that these policy adjustments can be implemented through context-dependent modulation of baseline activity and gain in decision-related neural populations.Recent technological advances have enabled researchers to investigate the circuit-level mechanisms of flexible decision-making. Pinto et al. (2019) used large-scale calcium imaging in mice to reveal that context-dependent sensorimotor transformations involve the coordinated activity of multiple cortical areas, with different regions showing distinct functional roles in maintaining and implementing task rules.In conclusion, the neural mechanisms underlying flexible perceptual decision-making involve a distributed network of brain regions, including sensory, parietal, prefrontal, motor, and subcortical areas. These regions work in concert to integrate sensory evidence with contextual information, maintain and update task rules, and adjust decision policies based on current demands. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise circuit-level mechanisms that enable communication and coordination between these distributed networks. Additionally, investigating how these flexible decision-making processes are altered in neurological and psychiatric disorders may provide valuable insights for developing targeted interventions. As our understanding of flexible decision-making advances, it will be crucial to develop more comprehensive computational models that can account for the diverse forms of context dependency observed in neural activity and behavior.", "References": [{"title": "Cortical mechanisms of action selection: the affordance competition hypothesis", "authors": "Paul Cisek, John F.
