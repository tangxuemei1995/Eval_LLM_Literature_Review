{"Literature Review": "Salt taste plays a crucial role in regulating sodium intake, which is essential for maintaining physiological homeostasis in animals. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying salt taste perception have been the subject of extensive research in recent years, revealing a complex interplay of multiple pathways and receptors. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of salt taste in mammals and insects, highlighting key findings and areas for future investigation. In mammals, salt taste perception involves at least two distinct pathways: a sodium-specific, amiloride-sensitive pathway mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and a non-specific, amiloride-insensitive pathway involving other cation channels. The ENaC pathway is primarily responsible for detecting low concentrations of sodium and mediating attractive responses, while the amiloride-insensitive pathway contributes to aversive responses at higher salt concentrations. The ENaC channel, composed of α, β, and γ subunits, is expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells (TRCs) in the tongue epithelium. Genetic studies have demonstrated that mice lacking the α-ENaC subunit specifically in taste cells show diminished behavioral and neural responses to low concentrations of NaCl, confirming the critical role of ENaC in salt taste transduction. Furthermore, recent research has identified the transcription factor HNF3β as a key regulator of ENaC expression in taste cells, providing insights into the developmental and regulatory mechanisms of salt taste. The amiloride-insensitive pathway, responsible for high-salt aversion, involves multiple candidate receptors and mechanisms. One proposed mechanism involves the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, particularly TRPV1, by high concentrations of various salts. Additionally, recent studies have implicated the involvement of other ion channels, such as TMEM171, in mediating responses to high salt concentrations. Interestingly, the valence of salt taste responses can be modulated by physiological state and experience. For instance, sodium depletion can enhance the attractiveness of salt and suppress aversive responses to high concentrations. This plasticity in salt taste perception involves both peripheral and central mechanisms, including changes in ENaC expression and alterations in the central processing of gustatory information. In insects, particularly Drosophila melanogaster, significant progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of salt taste. Unlike mammals, insects possess dedicated gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) for detecting low and high salt concentrations. The Ionotropic Receptor 76b (IR76b) has been identified as a key player in low-salt attraction in Drosophila, functioning as a Na+ leak channel. For high-salt aversion, the ppk23 gene, encoding a Degenerin/Epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family member, has been implicated in mediating behavioral responses. Recent studies have also revealed the involvement of chloride ions in salt taste perception, challenging the traditional sodium-centric view. In Drosophila, the chloride channel SecCl has been shown to mediate chloride taste, contributing to salt discrimination and feeding behavior. This finding highlights the importance of considering both cation and anion components in salt taste mechanisms. The downstream signaling pathways and neural circuits involved in salt taste processing are areas of ongoing research. In mammals, salt-responsive TRCs have been shown to synapse onto specific subsets of gustatory nerve fibers, which then project to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the brainstem. From the NTS, salt taste information is relayed to higher brain centers, including the parabrachial nucleus and the gustatory cortex, where it is integrated with other sensory and homeostatic signals to guide behavior. In insects, the neural circuits processing salt taste information have been mapped in greater detail, thanks to the genetic tractability of Drosophila. Salt-responsive GRNs project to specific regions of the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain, where they synapse onto second-order neurons. Recent studies have identified specific classes of neurons in the SEZ that integrate information from different taste modalities, including salt, to guide feeding decisions. While significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of salt taste, many questions remain unanswered. For instance, the exact molecular identity of the amiloride-insensitive salt taste receptor in mammals remains elusive. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of salt taste by physiological state and experience are not fully understood. Future research directions may include investigating the role of gut-brain interactions in salt taste perception, exploring the potential involvement of non-canonical taste pathways, and elucidating the neural circuits that integrate salt taste information with other sensory and homeostatic signals. In conclusion, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of salt taste involve a complex interplay of multiple receptors, ion channels, and signaling pathways. The ability to detect and discriminate salt concentrations is crucial for maintaining sodium homeostasis and avoiding toxicity. As research in this field continues to advance, a more comprehensive understanding of salt taste mechanisms will not only contribute to our basic knowledge of sensory biology but may also have important implications for human health, particularly in addressing issues related to excessive salt consumption.", "References": [{"title": "The cells and logic for mammalian sour taste detection", "authors": "Huang, A.
