{"Literature Review": "The liver's remarkable capacity for regeneration has fascinated scientists and clinicians for centuries. This unique ability allows the liver to maintain homeostasis and recover from various injuries, making it a crucial organ for survival. This literature review aims to explore the multiple facets of cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the mammalian liver, focusing on liver zonation, heterogeneity, homeostasis, acute and chronic injury responses, cellular plasticity, and the regeneration process.Liver zonation and heterogeneity play essential roles in maintaining liver function and homeostasis. The liver is composed of diverse cell types, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and Kupffer cells, each with specific functions and spatial organization (Gebhardt and Matz-Soja, 2014). Hepatocytes, the primary parenchymal cells, exhibit functional heterogeneity across the liver lobule, a phenomenon known as metabolic zonation. This zonation is crucial for the liver's ability to perform various metabolic functions simultaneously (Kietzmann, 2017).The concept of liver zonation has been further elucidated through single-cell RNA sequencing studies, which have revealed distinct gene expression patterns in hepatocytes based on their location within the liver lobule (Halpern et al., 2017). These studies have identified specific markers for periportal and pericentral hepatocytes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation and its importance in maintaining liver homeostasis.Liver homeostasis is maintained through a delicate balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Under normal conditions, hepatocytes have a low turnover rate, with only about 0.5% of cells undergoing mitosis at any given time (Michalopoulos and DeFrances, 1997). However, the liver possesses a remarkable ability to regenerate in response to various forms of injury, including partial hepatectomy, toxic insults, and viral infections.Acute liver injury triggers a complex regenerative response involving multiple cell types and signaling pathways. Following partial hepatectomy, the remaining hepatocytes rapidly enter the cell cycle and proliferate to restore the lost liver mass (Fausto et al., 2006). This process is tightly regulated by a network of cytokines, growth factors, and transcription factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Taub, 2004).In contrast to acute injury, chronic liver injury often leads to fibrosis and impaired regeneration. Chronic insults, such as alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, can overwhelm the liver's regenerative capacity and result in the activation of hepatic stellate cells, leading to excessive extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis (Friedman, 2008). Understanding the mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic injury and the factors that limit regeneration in chronic liver disease is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies.Cellular plasticity plays a vital role in liver regeneration, particularly in situations where hepatocyte proliferation is impaired. Recent studies have demonstrated that under certain conditions, biliary epithelial cells can transdifferentiate into hepatocytes, contributing to liver regeneration (Raven et al., 2017). This process, known as ductal-to-hepatocyte reprogramming, highlights the remarkable plasticity of liver cells and their ability to adapt to different regenerative demands.The liver's regenerative capacity is not limited to hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. Hepatic progenitor cells, also known as oval cells, have been identified as a potential source of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes during liver injury and regeneration (Español-Suñer et al., 2012). These bipotential progenitor cells are activated in response to severe or chronic liver injury and can differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, depending on the nature of the injury and the regenerative demands.Recent advances in single-cell technologies and lineage tracing studies have provided new insights into the cellular dynamics of liver regeneration. These approaches have revealed the heterogeneity of regenerative responses among different cell populations and have identified novel cell states that emerge during the regenerative process (Aizarani et al., 2019). Such studies have also highlighted the importance of cell-cell interactions and the extracellular matrix in orchestrating the regenerative response.Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration has important implications for developing new therapeutic strategies for liver diseases. For example, targeting specific signaling pathways involved in regeneration, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, has shown promise in promoting liver regeneration in preclinical models (Yang et al., 2014). Additionally, advances in tissue engineering and the development of bioartificial liver devices hold potential for supporting liver function in patients with acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease (Soto-Gutierrez et al., 2013).In conclusion, the mammalian liver's remarkable capacity for homeostasis and regeneration is a complex and multifaceted process involving various cell types, signaling pathways, and molecular mechanisms. The interplay between liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and plasticity contributes to the organ's ability to maintain function and recover from injury. Continued research in this field will not only enhance our understanding of liver biology but also pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to treat liver diseases and improve outcomes in liver transplantation.", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic zonation of the liver: The oxygen gradient revisited", "authors": "Kietzmann, Thomas", "journal": "Redox Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "11", "first page": "622", "last page": "630", "DOI": "10.1016/j.redox.2017.01.012"}, {"title": "Liver regeneration", "authors": "Michalopoulos, George K. and DeFrances, Marie C.", "journal": "Science", "year": "1997", "volumes": "276", "first page": "60", "last page": "66", "DOI": "10.1126/science.276.5309.60"}, {"title": "Liver regeneration", "authors": "Fausto, Nelson and Campbell, Jean S. and Riehle, Kimberly J.", "journal": "Hepatology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "43", "first page": "S45", "last page": "S53", "DOI": "10.1002/hep.20969"}, {"title": "Cytokines in the pathogenesis of fatty liver and disease progression to steatohepatitis: implications for treatment", "authors": "Taub, Rebecca", "journal": "American Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "99", "first page": "1000", "last page": "1008", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.04068.x"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of liver fibrosis", "authors": "Friedman, Scott L.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "134", "first page": "1655", "last page": "1669", "DOI": "10.1053/j.gastro.2008.03.003"}, {"title": "Plasticity of adult human hepatic progenitors promotes ductular reaction", "authors": "Raven, Alexander and Lu, Wei-Yu and Man, Tak Yung and Ferreira-Gonzalez, Sofia and O'Duibhir, Eoghan and Dwyer, Benjamin J. and Thomson, John P. and Meehan, Richard R. and Bogorad, Roman and Koteliansky, Victor and Kotelevtsev, Yuri and Ffrench-Constant, Charles and Boulter, Luke and Forbes, Stuart J.", "journal": "Cell Stem Cell", "year": "2017", "volumes": "21", "first page": "312", "last page": "324", "DOI": "10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.016"}, {"title": "Hepatic stellate cells: protean, multifunctional, and enigmatic cells of the liver", "authors": "Friedman, Scott L.", "journal": "Physiological Reviews", "year": "2008", "volumes": "88", "first page": "125", "last page": "172", "DOI": "10.1152/physrev.00013.2007"}, {"title": "Hepatic progenitor cells in human liver diseases", "authors": "Español-Suñer, Regina and Carpentier, Rodolphe and Van Hul, Noémi and Legry, Vanessa and Achouri, Younes and Cordi, Sabine and Jacquemin, Patrick and Lemaigre, Frédéric and Leclercq, Isabelle A.", "journal": "Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "23", "first page": "595", "last page": "603", "DOI": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2012.03.016"}, {"title": "Human liver cell atlas: Unraveling cellular heterogeneity in human liver", "authors": "Aizarani, Nadim and Saviano, Antonio and Sagar and Mailly, Laurent and Durand, Sarah and Herman, Joseph S. and Pessaux, Patrick and Baumert, Thomas F. and Grün, Dominic", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "572", "first page": "199", "last page": "204", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1373-2"}, {"title": "β-Catenin signaling in murine liver zonation and regeneration: A Wnt-Wnt situation!", "authors": "Yang, Jing and Mowry, Laura E. and Nejak-Bowen, Kari N. and Okabe, Hirohisa and Diegel, Cassandra R. and Lang, Richard A. and Williams, Bart O. and Monga, Satdarshan P.", "journal": "Hepatology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "60", "first page": "964", "last page": "976", "DOI": "10.1002/hep.27082"}]}
