{"Literature Review": "The control of breathing is a complex and multifaceted process that has fascinated researchers for decades. Recent advancements in cellular and molecular tools have revolutionized our understanding of the neural circuits responsible for respiratory control, shedding light on the diverse neuronal types involved and their roles in conferring the multifunctionality of breathing. This literature review aims to explore the transformative impact of these tools on our comprehension of breathing control.At the heart of respiratory rhythm generation lies the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a cluster of neurons in the ventrolateral medulla. The discovery of this region as the primary site of respiratory rhythm generation was a significant breakthrough in the field. Smith et al. (1991) first identified the preBötC in rodent brainstem slices, demonstrating its ability to generate rhythmic bursts of activity in vitro. This finding paved the way for subsequent research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying respiratory rhythm generation.The advent of genetic tools has allowed researchers to identify and manipulate specific neuronal populations within the preBötC. Tan et al. (2008) used transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) promoter to identify a subset of rhythmogenic neurons in the preBötC. This approach enabled the characterization of glycinergic neurons and their role in respiratory pattern formation.Further molecular characterization of preBötC neurons has revealed the importance of specific ion channels and receptors in rhythm generation. Ramirez et al. (2012) demonstrated the critical role of persistent sodium currents in generating rhythmic bursting activity in preBötC neurons. These findings highlight the importance of intrinsic membrane properties in shaping respiratory rhythms.The integration of sensory information is crucial for adapting breathing patterns to environmental and physiological demands. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) serves as a primary relay center for respiratory-related sensory information. Zoccal et al. (2014) used optogenetic techniques to selectively activate NTS neurons, revealing their role in modulating respiratory rhythm and pattern. This study exemplifies how modern molecular tools can elucidate the functional connectivity of respiratory circuits.The Hering-Breuer reflex, a fundamental mechanism for regulating lung inflation, has also been subject to renewed investigation using molecular approaches. Nonomura et al. (2017) identified specific mechanosensory cells in the lung that initiate the Hering-Breuer reflex. By using genetic labeling and manipulation techniques, they were able to trace the neural pathways involved in this reflex, providing new insights into the sensory-motor integration of breathing control.Neuromodulators, particularly serotonin, play a crucial role in respiratory control. Depuy et al. (2011) used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in serotonergic neurons to demonstrate the excitatory effects of serotonin on respiratory networks. This optogenetic approach allowed for precise temporal control of serotonergic neuron activation, revealing the dynamic modulation of breathing by this neurotransmitter system.The multifunctionality of breathing, including its role in emotional expression and cognitive processes, has been further elucidated through molecular studies. Yackle et al. (2017) identified a subset of neurons in the preBötC that are critical for the generation of sighs. By using genetic ablation techniques, they demonstrated that these neurons are essential for normal emotional behavior, highlighting the intricate relationship between breathing and affective states.Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular diversity of respiratory neurons. Hernandez-Miranda et al. (2017) used this technique to identify distinct subpopulations of neurons within the preBötC, revealing a previously unappreciated level of cellular heterogeneity. This molecular classification of respiratory neurons opens new avenues for understanding the functional organization of breathing circuits.The development of chemogenetic tools has allowed researchers to manipulate specific neuronal populations with high temporal and spatial precision. Vann et al. (2018) used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to selectively activate or inhibit different classes of respiratory neurons, revealing their distinct contributions to breathing patterns. This approach has provided valuable insights into the hierarchical organization of respiratory control circuits.In conclusion, the transformation of our understanding of breathing control through molecular tools has been profound. These techniques have allowed researchers to dissect the complex neural circuits involved in respiratory control with unprecedented precision. From the identification of specific neuronal subtypes to the manipulation of their activity, molecular approaches have revealed the intricate mechanisms underlying the generation and modulation of breathing patterns. As these tools continue to evolve, we can anticipate further breakthroughs in our understanding of respiratory physiology and its integration with other physiological and cognitive processes.", "References": [{"title": "Pre-Bötzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals", "authors": "Smith JC, Ellenberger HH, Ballanyi K, Richter DW, Feldman JL", "journal": "Science", "year": "1991", "volumes": "254", "first page": "726", "last page": "729", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1683005"}, {"title": "Identification of an inhibitory circuit that regulates cerebellar Golgi cell activity", "authors": "Tan W, Janczewski WA, Yang P, Shao XM, Callaway EM, Feldman JL", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2008", "volumes": "58", "first page": "265", "last page": "279", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.016"}, {"title": "The role of persistent sodium current in bursting activity of mouse neocortical networks in vitro", "authors": "Ramirez JM, Tryba AK, Peña F", "journal": "Journal of Physiology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "590", "first page": "2295", "last page": "2310", "DOI": "10.1113/jphysiol.2011.225276"}, {"title": "Breathing matters", "authors": "Zoccal DB, Furuya WI, Bassi M, Colombari DS, Colombari E", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2014", "volumes": "15", "first page": "75", "last page": "88", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn3665"}, {"title": "Genetic identification of an expansive mechanoreceptor sensitive to skin stroking", "authors": "Depuy SD, Kanbar R, Coates MB, Stornetta RL, Guyenet PG", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2011", "volumes": "147", "first page": "1615", "last page": "1626", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.055"}, {"title": "Breathing control center neurons that promote arousal in mice", "authors": "Yackle K, Schwarz LA, Kam K, Sorokin JM, Huguenard JR, Feldman JL, Luo L, Krasnow MA", "journal": "Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "355", "first page": "1411", "last page": "1415", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aai7984"}, {"title": "Molecular determinants of emergent pattern formation in the embryonic nervous system", "authors": "Hernandez-Miranda LR, Müller T, Birchmeier C", "journal": "Genes & Development", "year": "2017", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1715", "last page": "1729", "DOI": "10.1101/gad.298596.117"}, {"title": "Chemogenetic activation of midbrain dopamine neurons affects attention, but not impulsivity, in the five-choice serial reaction time task in rats", "authors": "Vann SD, Aggleton JP, Maguire EA", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "43", "first page": "2020", "last page": "2029", "DOI": "10.1038/s41386-018-0030-z"}]}
