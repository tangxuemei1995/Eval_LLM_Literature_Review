{"Literature Review": "Fatty acids (FAs) play crucial roles in various physiological processes, serving as essential components of cell membranes, energy sources, and signaling molecules. This literature review focuses on the mechanisms of fatty acid transport and signaling, with particular emphasis on the membrane receptors CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4, and their physiological implications.CD36, also known as fatty acid translocase (FAT), is a multifunctional protein that facilitates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids across cell membranes. Silverstein and Febbraio (2009) demonstrated that CD36 is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the heart, where it plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism. The importance of CD36 in fatty acid uptake was further highlighted by Glatz and Luiken (2017), who showed that CD36 deficiency leads to impaired fatty acid utilization and altered energy homeostasis.Recent studies have revealed that CD36 not only functions as a fatty acid transporter but also initiates intracellular signaling cascades. Samovski et al. (2015) reported that CD36 activation by long-chain fatty acids triggers the phosphorylation of key signaling proteins, including Src kinases and MAP kinases, leading to changes in cellular metabolism and gene expression. This dual role of CD36 as both a transporter and signaling molecule underscores its importance in fatty acid-mediated cellular responses.The G protein-coupled receptors FFAR1 (GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) have emerged as important mediators of fatty acid signaling. FFAR1, primarily expressed in pancreatic β-cells, plays a crucial role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Itoh et al. (2003) demonstrated that long-chain fatty acids activate FFAR1, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels and enhanced insulin secretion. This finding has sparked interest in FFAR1 as a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.FFAR4, on the other hand, is widely expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, macrophages, and enteroendocrine cells. Oh et al. (2010) showed that FFAR4 activation by omega-3 fatty acids exerts anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages and improves systemic insulin sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of FFAR4 as a target for treating obesity-related metabolic disorders.The interplay between fatty acid transport and signaling has significant physiological implications. Impaired fatty acid uptake and signaling have been linked to various metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Bonen et al. (2004) demonstrated that altered CD36 expression and localization in skeletal muscle contribute to impaired fatty acid metabolism in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Similarly, Ichimura et al. (2012) reported that FFAR4 dysfunction in adipose tissue is associated with increased inflammation and insulin resistance in obese individuals.Recent research has also uncovered the role of fatty acid signaling in tissue repair and regeneration. Kuda et al. (2018) showed that FFAR4 activation promotes wound healing and tissue regeneration by modulating inflammatory responses and enhancing the proliferation of epithelial cells. These findings suggest that targeting fatty acid signaling pathways may have therapeutic potential in promoting tissue repair and regeneration.The complex interplay between fatty acid transport and signaling is further exemplified by the involvement of caveolin, a protein that forms specialized membrane microdomains called caveolae. Pohl et al. (2004) demonstrated that caveolin-1 interacts with CD36 and facilitates its localization to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing fatty acid uptake. This interaction between caveolin and CD36 highlights the importance of membrane organization in regulating fatty acid transport and signaling.In conclusion, the mechanisms of fatty acid transport and signaling are intricately linked and play crucial roles in various physiological processes. The membrane receptors CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 serve as key mediators of fatty acid uptake and signaling, influencing cellular metabolism, gene expression, and inflammatory responses. Understanding these mechanisms and their physiological implications is essential for developing targeted therapies for metabolic disorders and promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Future research should focus on elucidating the complex interplay between these receptors and their downstream signaling pathways to identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies for improving metabolic health.", "References": [{"title": "CD36: a class B scavenger receptor involved in angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism", "authors": "Roy L.
