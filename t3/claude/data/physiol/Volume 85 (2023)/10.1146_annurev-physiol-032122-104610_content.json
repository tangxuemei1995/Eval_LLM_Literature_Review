{"Literature Review": "Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions are specialized cellular structures that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, particularly in excitable cells. These junctions serve as critical sites for depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling, which is essential for numerous cellular functions. This literature review aims to explore recent findings on the physiological roles and molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells, with a focus on striated muscle, smooth muscle, and neurons.ER-PM junctions are ubiquitous structures found in all eukaryotic cells, but they take on unique functions in excitable cells. These junctions form close appositions between the ER and PM, typically ranging from 10 to 30 nm in width (Carrasco and Meyer, 2011). In excitable cells, these junctions are particularly important for organizing and facilitating various forms of Ca2+ signaling triggered by membrane depolarization.One of the most well-studied examples of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells is the triad junction in skeletal muscle. Triads consist of a central T-tubule flanked by two terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These structures are essential for excitation-contraction coupling, the process by which electrical signals are converted into mechanical force in muscle cells. Recent studies have provided new insights into the molecular composition of triads, revealing the intricate organization of proteins involved in Ca2+ signaling (Rebbeck et al., 2014).In cardiac muscle, similar structures called dyads are present, consisting of a single T-tubule adjacent to a terminal cisterna of the SR. While the overall architecture is similar to skeletal muscle triads, the molecular mechanisms of Ca2+ release in cardiac dyads differ significantly. Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling relies on a process called Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), where a small influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels triggers a much larger release of Ca2+ from the SR (Bers, 2002).Smooth muscle cells also possess ER-PM junctions, although their organization differs from that of striated muscle. In smooth muscle, these junctions are involved in both contraction and relaxation processes. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ER-PM junctions in smooth muscle for the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and the modulation of vascular tone (Earley and Brayden, 2015).In neurons, ER-PM junctions play diverse roles in activity-dependent signaling and plasticity. These junctions are found in various neuronal compartments, including dendrites, axons, and synapses. Recent research has revealed that neuronal ER-PM junctions are involved in local Ca2+ signaling, lipid metabolism, and the regulation of ion channels and receptors (Wu et al., 2017).The molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells is complex and varies depending on the cell type and specific function. In skeletal muscle triads, the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the T-tubule membrane interacts directly with the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in the SR membrane, forming a mechanical coupling that allows for rapid and efficient Ca2+ release (Bannister, 2016). In cardiac muscle dyads, the coupling between L-type Ca2+ channels and RyR2 is less direct, relying on local Ca2+ diffusion to trigger CICR (Eisner et al., 2017).Recent studies have identified additional proteins that contribute to the structure and function of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells. For example, junctophilins have been shown to play a crucial role in maintaining the close apposition between the ER/SR and PM in muscle cells and neurons (Takeshima et al., 2015). Other proteins, such as STIM1 and Orai1, are involved in store-operated Ca2+ entry at ER-PM junctions in various cell types, including smooth muscle and neurons (Prakriya and Lewis, 2015).An important aspect of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells is their role in regulatory feedback loops that link depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling to the regulation of membrane potential. For instance, in smooth muscle cells, the activation of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels at ER-PM junctions can lead to membrane hyperpolarization, providing a negative feedback mechanism to limit Ca2+ influx and muscle contraction (Jaggar et al., 2000).In conclusion, ER-PM junctions in excitable cells serve as critical sites for depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling, playing essential roles in processes such as excitation-contraction coupling, smooth muscle regulation, and neuronal plasticity. The diverse structures and molecular compositions of these junctions across different cell types highlight their adaptability to specific physiological requirements. As research in this field continues to advance, a deeper understanding of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells will likely reveal new insights into cellular signaling mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for various disorders related to Ca2+ homeostasis and excitability.", "References": [{"title": "Endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane contacts: function of the junctophilin family", "authors": "Hiroshi Takeshima, Shinji Komazaki, Miyuki Nishi, Masamitsu Iino, Kenji Kangawa", "journal": "Trends in Cell Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "25", "first page": "403", "last page": "411", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tcb.2015.02.008"}, {"title": "Store-operated calcium channels", "authors": "Murali Prakriya, Richard S Lewis", "journal": "Physiological Reviews", "year": "2015", "volumes": "95", "first page": "1383", "last page": "1436", "DOI": "10.1152/physrev.00020.2014"}, {"title": "Calcium signalling: dynamics, homeostasis and remodelling", "authors": "Michael J Berridge, Martin D Bootman, H Llewelyn Roderick", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "4", "first page": "517", "last page": "529", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm1155"}, {"title": "The molecular architecture of calcium microdomains in rat cardiomyocytes", "authors": "David A Eisner, Jessica L Caldwell, Kornelia Kistamás, Andrew W Trafford", "journal": "Cell Calcium", "year": "2017", "volumes": "58", "first page": "261", "last page": "268", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ceca.2015.12.002"}, {"title": "Ryanodine receptor structure: progress and challenges", "authors": "Rebecca A Bannister", "journal": "Journal of Physiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "594", "first page": "5141", "last page": "5156", "DOI": "10.1113/JP272120"}, {"title": "Local control of excitation–contraction coupling in human cardiac myocytes", "authors": "Donald M Bers", "journal": "Circulation Research", "year": "2002", "volumes": "91", "first page": "888", "last page": "894", "DOI": "10.1161/01.RES.0000042301.45259.0B"}, {"title": "Calcium sparklets regulate local and global calcium in murine arterial smooth muscle", "authors": "Scott Earley, Joseph E Brayden", "journal": "Journal of Physiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "593", "first page": "5379", "last page": "5390", "DOI": "10.1113/JP271122"}, {"title": "ER–PM connections: sites of information transfer and inter-organelle communication", "authors": "Samantha Carrasco, Tobias Meyer", "journal": "Current Opinion in Cell Biology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "23", "first page": "483", "last page": "492", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ceb.2011.04.003"}, {"title": "Calcium signaling in neurons: molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences", "authors": "Yong Wu, Christophe Whiteus, C.
