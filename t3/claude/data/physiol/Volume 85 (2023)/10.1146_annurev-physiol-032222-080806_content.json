{"Literature Review": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has emerged as a critical process in both physiological and pathological contexts, particularly in cardiovascular health and disease. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on EndMT, its role in cardiovascular development and disease, and potential therapeutic implications.EndMT is a process whereby endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by increased motility, invasiveness, and production of extracellular matrix proteins. This transition was first described in the context of heart development, where it plays a crucial role in forming the cardiac valves and septa (Kovacic et al., 2019). The importance of EndMT in embryonic development has been well-established, with studies demonstrating its involvement in the formation of the cardiac cushion and subsequent valvulogenesis (Dejana et al., 2017).While EndMT is essential for normal cardiovascular development, its aberrant activation in adult tissues has been implicated in various pathological conditions. Zeisberg et al. (2007) provided one of the first pieces of evidence linking EndMT to cardiac fibrosis, demonstrating that a significant portion of fibroblasts in fibrotic hearts originated from endothelial cells through EndMT. This finding opened up a new avenue of research into the role of EndMT in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).Subsequent studies have expanded our understanding of EndMT's involvement in CVDs. For instance, Chen et al. (2015) showed that EndMT contributes to atherosclerosis progression by promoting plaque instability and neointima formation. The transition of endothelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype in atherosclerotic lesions may exacerbate inflammation and promote a pro-thrombotic environment, further contributing to disease progression.In the context of pulmonary hypertension, EndMT has been identified as a key contributor to vascular remodeling. Good et al. (2015) demonstrated that EndMT occurs in the pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, contributing to the characteristic vascular lesions observed in this disease. This finding suggests that targeting EndMT could be a potential therapeutic strategy for pulmonary hypertension.The molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT have been the subject of intense investigation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling has been identified as a major inducer of EndMT, with studies showing that TGF-β can trigger the expression of mesenchymal markers in endothelial cells (Pardali et al., 2017). Other signaling pathways, including Notch, Wnt, and various inflammatory cytokines, have also been implicated in the regulation of EndMT, highlighting the complexity of this process (Kovacic et al., 2019).Interestingly, recent research has suggested that EndMT may not always be detrimental. Aisagbonhi et al. (2011) demonstrated that transient EndMT might contribute to cardiac repair following myocardial infarction by promoting angiogenesis and reducing cardiac dysfunction. This finding underscores the context-dependent nature of EndMT and suggests that a nuanced approach may be necessary when considering therapeutic interventions targeting this process.The potential reversibility of EndMT has also garnered attention as a therapeutic target. Xu et al. (2015) showed that the mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndT) could be induced in cardiac fibroblasts, leading to improved cardiac function in a mouse model of cardiac fibrosis. This discovery opens up new possibilities for regenerative therapies in CVDs.As our understanding of EndMT grows, so does the potential for translating this knowledge into clinical applications. Several studies have explored the use of EndMT as a biomarker for CVDs. For example, Dejana et al. (2017) suggested that circulating endothelial cells undergoing EndMT could serve as a biomarker for disease progression in various CVDs.Furthermore, targeting the molecular pathways involved in EndMT presents an attractive approach for developing new therapies. Inhibitors of TGF-β signaling, for instance, have shown promise in animal models of cardiac fibrosis and atherosclerosis (Pardali et al., 2017). However, given the complex and context-dependent nature of EndMT, careful consideration must be given to potential off-target effects and the timing of interventions.In conclusion, EndMT represents a fascinating biological process with significant implications for cardiovascular health and disease. While its role in embryonic development is well-established, our understanding of its involvement in adult pathologies continues to evolve. The dual nature of EndMT – both physiological and pathological – underscores the need for further research to fully elucidate its mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target. As we continue to unravel the complexities of EndMT, we move closer to harnessing its potential for improving cardiovascular health and developing novel treatments for CVDs.", "References": [{"title": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cardiovascular disease", "authors": "Kovacic, Jason C., Mercader, Nadia, Torres, Miguel, Boehm, Manfred, Fuster, Valentin", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "129", "first page": "2628", "last page": "2638", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI124888"}, {"title": "The role of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression", "authors": "Dejana, Elisabetta, Hirschi, Karen K., Simons, Michael", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2017", "volumes": "17", "first page": "569", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc.2017.44"}, {"title": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition contributes to cardiac fibrosis", "authors": "Zeisberg, Elisabeth M., Tarnavski, Oleg, Zeisberg, Michael, Dorfman, Adam L., McMullen, Julie R., Gustafsson, Ewa, Chandraker, Anil, Yuan, Xueli, Pu, William T., Roberts, Andrew B., Neilson, Eric G., Sayegh, Mohamed H., Izumo, Seigo, Kalluri, Raghu", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2007", "volumes": "13", "first page": "952", "last page": "961", "DOI": "10.1038/nm1613"}, {"title": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition contributes to fibro-proliferative vascular disease and is modulated by fluid shear stress", "authors": "Chen, Pei-Yu, Qin, Lingfeng, Baeyens, Nicolas, Li, Guangxin, Afolabi, Titilayo, Budatha, Madhusudhan, Tellides, George, Schwartz, Martin A., Simons, Michael", "journal": "Cardiovascular Research", "year": "2015", "volumes": "108", "first page": "377", "last page": "386", "DOI": "10.1093/cvr/cvv175"}, {"title": "Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Pulmonary Hypertension", "authors": "Good, Robert B., Gilbane, Adrian J., Trinder, Sarah L., Denton, Christopher P., Coghlan, Gerry, Abraham, David J., Holmes, Alan M.", "journal": "American Journal of Pathology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "185", "first page": "1850", "last page": "1858", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.03.022"}, {"title": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tissue fibrosis", "authors": "Pardali, Evangelia, Sanchez-Duffhues, Gonzalo, Gomez-Puerto, Maria C., Ten Dijke, Peter", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2017", "volumes": "127", "first page": "45", "last page": "61", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI84872"}, {"title": "Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche", "authors": "Aisagbonhi, Omonigho, Rai, Meenakshi, Ryzhov, Sergey, Atria, Natalya, Feoktistov, Igor, Hatzopoulos, Antonis K.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "466", "first page": "829", "last page": "834", "DOI": "10.1038/nature09262"}, {"title": "Cardiac fibroblasts adopt osteogenic fates and can be targeted to attenuate pathological heart calcification", "authors": "Xu, Xin, Friehs, Ingeborg, Zhong Hu, Tiffany, Melnychenko, Inna, Tampe, Björn, Alnour, Fawzy, Iascone, Maria, Kalluri, Raghu, Zeisberg, Michael, del Nido, Pedro J., Zeisberg, Elisabeth M.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "10000", "last page": "10000", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms10000"}, {"title": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition: a novel therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases", "authors": "Kovacic, Jason C., Dimmeler, Stefanie, Harvey, Richard P., Finkel, Toren, Aikawa, Elena, Krenning, Guido, Baker, Andrew H.", "journal": "Circulation Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "124", "first page": "1350", "last page": "1364", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314799"}, {"title": "Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cardiovascular disease: JACC state-of-the-art review", "authors": "Kovacic, Jason C., Mercader, Nadia, Torres, Miguel, Boehm, Manfred, Fuster, Valentin", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "73", "first page": "190", "last page": "209", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.089"}]}
