{"Literature Review": "Racial and ethnic biases in medical technologies have become a critical area of concern in healthcare, particularly in pulmonary medicine. These biases can lead to significant health disparities and unequal treatment outcomes for different racial and ethnic groups. This literature review aims to explore the origins of such biases in pulmonary technologies and discuss their implications for patient care and health equity.One of the most prominent examples of racial bias in pulmonary technology is the pulse oximeter. Pulse oximeters are widely used devices that measure blood oxygen saturation levels, which are crucial for monitoring patients with respiratory conditions. However, recent studies have shown that these devices may be less accurate in patients with darker skin tones. Sjoding et al. (2020) conducted a large-scale study comparing pulse oximetry measurements with arterial blood gas analyses in White and Black patients. They found that Black patients had nearly three times the frequency of occult hypoxemia that was not detected by pulse oximetry compared to White patients. This discrepancy in accuracy can lead to delayed or missed diagnoses of hypoxemia in patients with darker skin, potentially resulting in inadequate treatment and poorer health outcomes.The origins of this bias can be traced back to the development and testing phases of pulse oximeters. Historically, these devices were primarily calibrated and tested on light-skinned individuals, leading to a systematic bias in their performance across different skin tones. Feiner et al. (2007) demonstrated that pulse oximeters tend to overestimate oxygen saturation in individuals with darker skin pigmentation, highlighting the need for more inclusive testing and calibration processes in medical device development.Another area where racial and ethnic biases manifest in pulmonary medicine is pulmonary function testing (PFT). PFTs are essential for diagnosing and monitoring various respiratory conditions, but the interpretation of these tests often relies on prediction equations that may not accurately represent diverse populations. Quanjer et al. (2012) conducted a comprehensive analysis of lung function reference values and found significant differences across ethnic groups. They emphasized the importance of using appropriate reference equations that account for racial and ethnic diversity to avoid misdiagnosis and improper treatment.The use of race-based correction factors in PFT interpretation has been a subject of debate in recent years. While these factors were initially introduced to account for observed differences in lung function between racial groups, critics argue that they may perpetuate racial stereotypes and mask the effects of social determinants of health on lung function. Braun et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review of race-based lung function prediction equations and found that their use could lead to underdiagnosis of lung disease in Black individuals and potentially exacerbate health disparities.The development of algorithms and predictive models in healthcare has also been identified as a potential source of racial and ethnic bias. These algorithms are increasingly used to guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation. However, if they are trained on biased or unrepresentative data, they can perpetuate and amplify existing health disparities. Obermeyer et al. (2019) analyzed a widely used algorithm for predicting healthcare needs and found that it systematically underestimated the health needs of Black patients compared to White patients with similar health status. This bias arose from using healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs, which failed to account for historical disparities in healthcare access and utilization.The perpetuation of these biases can be attributed, in part, to inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Wilkinson et al. (2022) reviewed the regulatory landscape for medical devices and found that current standards often fail to adequately address potential racial and ethnic biases. They called for more rigorous testing requirements and the inclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials and device evaluations.Addressing these biases requires a multifaceted approach. First, there is a need for greater diversity in the development and testing of medical technologies. Bickler et al. (2005) proposed new calibration standards for pulse oximeters that account for a wider range of skin pigmentations. Similarly, Lujan et al. (2021) advocated for the development of more inclusive reference equations for pulmonary function tests that better represent diverse populations.Second, there is a growing recognition of the need to critically examine and potentially revise race-based practices in medicine. Vyas et al. (2020) argued for a reevaluation of race-based clinical algorithms and decision-making tools, emphasizing the importance of considering social determinants of health rather than relying on racial categories as proxies for biological differences.Finally, addressing these biases requires a broader understanding of the complex interplay between biological and social factors that contribute to health disparities. Phelan and Link (2015) proposed the concept of 'fundamental cause theory' to explain how social conditions can persistently influence health outcomes, even as the mechanisms of disease and treatment change over time.In conclusion, the origins of racial and ethnic biases in pulmonary technologies are multifaceted, stemming from historical practices, unrepresentative data, and the conflation of biological and social factors. Addressing these biases requires a concerted effort to improve the development, testing, and regulation of medical technologies, as well as a critical examination of race-based practices in medicine. By doing so, we can work towards more equitable healthcare and better outcomes for all patients, regardless of their racial or ethnic background.", "References": [{"title": "Racial Bias in Pulse Oximetry Measurement", "authors": "Michael W.
