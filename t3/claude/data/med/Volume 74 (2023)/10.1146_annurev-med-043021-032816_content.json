{"Literature Review": "Hepcidin, a small peptide hormone primarily produced by hepatocytes, has emerged as a central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Since its discovery in 2001, extensive research has elucidated its pivotal role in health and disease, particularly in iron-related disorders. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on hepcidin's function, regulation, and its implications in various pathological conditions.Hepcidin's primary function is to regulate iron absorption and distribution throughout the body. It achieves this by binding to ferroportin, the sole known cellular iron exporter, leading to its internalization and degradation [1]. This mechanism effectively controls iron efflux from enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes, thereby modulating plasma iron levels and total body iron content.The regulation of hepcidin expression is complex and responds to multiple physiological stimuli. Iron status is a key regulator, with increased iron levels stimulating hepcidin production through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway [2]. This creates a negative feedback loop that prevents iron overload. Conversely, iron deficiency suppresses hepcidin expression, promoting increased iron absorption and mobilization from stores.Inflammation is another potent inducer of hepcidin expression. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), stimulate hepcidin production through the JAK-STAT3 pathway [3]. This mechanism explains the development of anemia of inflammation, where elevated hepcidin levels restrict iron availability for erythropoiesis despite adequate iron stores.Erythropoietic activity also influences hepcidin expression. Increased erythropoiesis, such as in response to hypoxia or blood loss, suppresses hepcidin production to ensure adequate iron supply for red blood cell production [4]. This suppression is mediated by erythroferrone, a hormone produced by erythroblasts in response to erythropoietin stimulation.The role of hepcidin in various pathological conditions has been extensively studied. In hereditary hemochromatosis, mutations in genes involved in hepcidin regulation or function lead to inappropriately low hepcidin levels relative to body iron stores [5]. This results in excessive iron absorption and accumulation in various organs, potentially causing significant morbidity.Conversely, hepcidin excess is implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of anemia. In anemia of inflammation, elevated hepcidin levels restrict iron availability for erythropoiesis, contributing to the development of anemia [6]. Similarly, in chronic kidney disease, reduced renal clearance and increased production of hepcidin due to inflammation contribute to the development of anemia [7].Recent research has also highlighted the potential role of hepcidin in other conditions. In cancer, elevated hepcidin levels have been associated with more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes in several malignancies [8]. This may be due to the promotion of a pro-inflammatory state and the restriction of iron availability to rapidly dividing cancer cells.The growing understanding of hepcidin's role in iron homeostasis has led to significant interest in its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. Measurement of serum hepcidin levels could provide valuable information about iron status and the underlying cause of anemia, potentially guiding treatment decisions [9]. However, standardization of hepcidin assays remains a challenge, limiting its widespread clinical use.Therapeutically, both hepcidin agonists and antagonists are being developed. Hepcidin agonists or mimetics could be useful in treating iron overload disorders, while antagonists could benefit patients with anemia of inflammation or other conditions characterized by hepcidin excess [10]. These approaches are still in various stages of clinical development but hold promise for improving the management of iron disorders.In conclusion, hepcidin has emerged as a key player in iron homeostasis, with far-reaching implications in health and disease. Its discovery has revolutionized our understanding of iron metabolism and opened new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of iron-related disorders. As research continues, it is likely that hepcidin-targeted therapies will become an important part of the clinical arsenal for managing a wide range of conditions involving iron dysregulation.", "References": [{"title": "Hepcidin and iron regulation, 20 years later", "authors": "Tomas Ganz", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2019", "volumes": "133", "first page": "2022", "last page": "2029", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2018-11-852509"}, {"title": "Regulation of systemic iron homeostasis", "authors": "Tomas Ganz, Elizabeta Nemeth", "journal": "Nature Reviews Nephrology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "11", "first page": "692", "last page": "703", "DOI": "10.1038/nrneph.2015.157"}, {"title": "IL-6 mediates hypoferremia of inflammation by inducing the synthesis of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin", "authors": "Elizabeta Nemeth, Seth Rivera, Victoria Gabayan, Charlotte Keller, Sarah Taudorf, Bente K Pedersen, Tomas Ganz", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2004", "volumes": "113", "first page": "1271", "last page": "1276", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI20945"}, {"title": "Erythroferrone: an erythroid regulator of iron metabolism", "authors": "Leon Kautz, Tomas Ganz", "journal": "Haematologica", "year": "2014", "volumes": "99", "first page": "999", "last page": "1001", "DOI": "10.3324/haematol.2014.108803"}, {"title": "Hepcidin and hereditary hemochromatosis", "authors": "Antonella Roetto, Giuliana Papanikolaou, Michela Politou, Federica Alberti, Domenico Girelli, John Christakis, Dimitris Loukopoulos, Clara Camaschella", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2003", "volumes": "102", "first page": "783", "last page": "786", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2002-10-3085"}, {"title": "Hepcidin and anemia of chronic disease", "authors": "Guenter Weiss, Tomas Ganz, Lawrence T Goodnough", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2019", "volumes": "133", "first page": "40", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2018-06-815506"}, {"title": "Hepcidin and iron regulation in chronic kidney disease", "authors": "Jodie L Babitt, Hua Y Lin", "journal": "Pediatric Nephrology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1939", "last page": "1949", "DOI": "10.1007/s00467-010-1745-1"}, {"title": "The role of hepcidin in iron metabolism", "authors": "Tomas Ganz", "journal": "Acta Haematologica", "year": "2009", "volumes": "122", "first page": "78", "last page": "86", "DOI": "10.1159/000243791"}, {"title": "Hepcidin as a diagnostic tool in anemia", "authors": "Dorine W Swinkels, Domenico Girelli, Coby Laarakkers, Joyce Kroot, Natascia Campostrini, Erwin H J M Kemna, Harold Tjalsma", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2008", "volumes": "112", "first page": "4292", "last page": "4293", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2008-05-157594"}, {"title": "Hepcidin-based screening and treatment for iron deficiency anemia in pharmacies: The PharmIron protocol", "authors": "Domenico Girelli, Giacomo Marchi, Fabiana Busti, Michela Vianello, Annalisa Castagna", "journal": "Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "16", "first page": "657", "last page": "661", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sapharm.2019.08.001"}]}
