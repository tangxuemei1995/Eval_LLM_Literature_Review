{"Literature Review": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019 brought with it a host of clinical challenges, among which thrombotic complications quickly became a major concern. This literature review aims to explore the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic strategies for managing thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients. Early in the pandemic, clinicians observed an unusually high incidence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients. Klok et al. (2020) reported a 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19, despite standard thromboprophylaxis. This finding was corroborated by Helms et al. (2020), who found a remarkably high incidence of pulmonary embolism (23.4%) in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. The pathophysiology underlying the increased thrombotic risk in COVID-19 is multifaceted. Ackermann et al. (2020) demonstrated widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy in pulmonary vessels of COVID-19 patients. They observed distinctive vascular features, including severe endothelial injury associated with intracellular SARS-CoV-2 virus and disrupted cell membranes. This endothelial dysfunction, coupled with excessive inflammation, appears to create a perfect storm for thrombosis. The hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 is characterized by elevated levels of procoagulant factors. Tang et al. (2020) reported significantly higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products in severe COVID-19 cases, suggesting a state of hyperfibrinolysis. Furthermore, Goshua et al. (2020) found elevated levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with critical illness. Given the high thrombotic risk, many hospitals implemented empiric anticoagulation protocols for COVID-19 patients. Observational studies initially suggested a potential benefit of this approach. Paranjpe et al. (2020) reported that systemic anticoagulation was associated with improved hospital survival among mechanically ventilated patients. However, these observational studies were limited by potential confounding and selection bias. To address these limitations, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were initiated. The ATTACC, ACTIV-4a, and REMAP-CAP multiplatform RCT investigated the efficacy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The results, published by Lawler et al. (2021), showed that in noncritically ill patients, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation increased the probability of survival to hospital discharge with reduced use of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support. However, in critically ill patients, therapeutic anticoagulation did not yield a similar benefit. The INSPIRATION trial, conducted by Sadeghipour et al. (2021), compared intermediate-dose vs. standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in ICU patients with COVID-19. The study found no difference in the composite outcome of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. For patients discharged from the hospital, the MICHELLE trial by Ramacciotti et al. (2022) evaluated extended thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban. The study demonstrated a reduction in thrombotic events without an increase in major bleeding, suggesting a potential benefit of this approach in selected high-risk patients. In non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the role of anticoagulation remains unclear. The OVID trial by Barco et al. (2022) found that prophylactic-dose enoxaparin did not reduce all-cause mortality or hospital admission in symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19. The use of antiplatelet agents has also been explored as a potential strategy to mitigate thrombotic risk in COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial, as reported by Abani et al. (2022), investigated the use of aspirin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While aspirin did not reduce 28-day mortality, it was associated with a small reduction in thrombotic events. In conclusion, the current evidence supports the use of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in hospitalized, noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. For critically ill patients, standard prophylactic anticoagulation remains the recommended approach. Extended thromboprophylaxis post-discharge may benefit selected high-risk patients, while the role of anticoagulation in non-hospitalized patients remains uncertain. As our understanding of COVID-19-associated thrombosis evolves, further research is needed to refine these therapeutic strategies and potentially explore novel antithrombotic approaches tailored to the unique pathophysiology of COVID-19.", "References": [{"title": "Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19", "authors": "F.A.
