{"Literature Review": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant challenge in transplant recipients, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of CMV in this population has evolved over the years, with prevention strategies playing a crucial role. This literature review focuses on the role of letermovir (LTV) in CMV prophylaxis and treatment, particularly in transplant recipients.CMV is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that affects a large proportion of the global population. In immunocompetent individuals, primary infection is often asymptomatic or causes mild illness. However, in immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients, CMV can lead to severe complications, including end-organ disease and graft rejection. Kotton et al. (2018) reported that CMV infection occurs in 30-70% of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and 50-80% of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients without prophylaxis.Traditional approaches to CMV management in transplant recipients include universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy. Universal prophylaxis involves administering antiviral drugs to all at-risk patients for a defined period post-transplantation. Preemptive therapy, on the other hand, relies on regular monitoring of CMV viral load and initiating treatment only when the virus is detected. Both strategies have shown efficacy in reducing CMV disease, but they are associated with significant drawbacks, including drug toxicity, cost, and the potential for late-onset CMV disease (Razonable, 2018).The introduction of letermovir has marked a significant advancement in CMV management. LTV is a novel antiviral agent that inhibits the CMV terminase complex, disrupting viral DNA packaging and virion assembly. This unique mechanism of action distinguishes LTV from other anti-CMV drugs, which typically target viral DNA polymerase. Chemaly et al. (2014) demonstrated that LTV exhibited potent anti-CMV activity in vitro and in vivo, with a favorable safety profile.The efficacy of LTV in preventing CMV infection in HCT recipients was established in a landmark phase 3 trial by Marty et al. (2017). This study showed that LTV prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection compared to placebo (37.5% vs. 60.6%, p<0.001) through week 24 post-transplantation. Importantly, LTV was associated with lower all-cause mortality at week 24 (10.2% vs. 15.9%, p=0.03).The success of LTV in HCT recipients has led to its off-label use in SOT recipients. Veit et al. (2021) reported on the use of LTV for CMV prophylaxis in high-risk kidney transplant recipients. Their single-center study found that LTV was effective in preventing CMV infection and was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse events reported.One of the key advantages of LTV is its favorable safety profile. Unlike other anti-CMV drugs such as ganciclovir and valganciclovir, LTV does not cause myelosuppression or nephrotoxicity. This is particularly beneficial in transplant recipients who are already at risk for these complications due to their immunosuppressive regimens. Ljungman et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of LTV in HCT recipients and found that the incidence of adverse events was similar between LTV and placebo groups.Another important aspect of LTV is its potential to overcome antiviral resistance. CMV resistance to ganciclovir and other antivirals is a growing concern in transplant recipients, particularly those requiring prolonged antiviral therapy. Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that LTV retained activity against CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, highlighting its potential as a salvage therapy option.Despite its promising results, several questions remain regarding the optimal use of LTV. The duration of prophylaxis, its role in preemptive therapy, and its efficacy in different types of organ transplants are areas that require further investigation. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of LTV compared to traditional prophylaxis strategies needs to be evaluated in different healthcare settings.In conclusion, letermovir represents a significant advancement in CMV management for transplant recipients. Its unique mechanism of action, favorable safety profile, and efficacy in preventing CMV infection make it a valuable addition to the antiviral armamentarium. As more data emerge from real-world use and ongoing clinical trials, the role of LTV in CMV prophylaxis and treatment is likely to expand, potentially revolutionizing CMV management in transplant recipients.", "References": [{"title": "Updated international consensus guidelines on the management of cytomegalovirus in solid-organ transplantation", "authors": "Camille N.
