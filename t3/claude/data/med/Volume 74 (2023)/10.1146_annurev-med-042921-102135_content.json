{"Literature Review": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a groundbreaking class of medications, initially developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, their therapeutic potential has expanded far beyond glycemic control, with substantial evidence supporting their efficacy in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This literature review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors across various patient populations. The journey of SGLT2 inhibitors began with their approval as antidiabetic agents. Zinman et al. (2015) conducted the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which demonstrated that empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with T2D and established cardiovascular disease. This landmark study not only solidified the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors but also hinted at their potential renoprotective effects. Subsequent analyses of cardiovascular outcome trials revealed consistent improvements in kidney-related outcomes. Wanner et al. (2016) performed a secondary analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, focusing on renal endpoints. They found that empagliflozin treatment was associated with a slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events compared to placebo in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk. The CANVAS Program, reported by Neal et al. (2017), further corroborated these findings. This study showed that canagliflozin, another SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of cardiovascular events and demonstrated a significant reduction in the progression of albuminuria and the composite outcome of sustained 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), need for renal replacement therapy, or death from renal causes. The renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors were not limited to patients with diabetes. Heerspink et al. (2020) conducted the DAPA-CKD trial, which included patients with chronic kidney disease with and without T2D. The results showed that dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of worsening renal function or death from renal or cardiovascular causes, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The CREDENCE trial, reported by Perkovic et al. (2019), specifically focused on patients with diabetic kidney disease. This study demonstrated that canagliflozin treatment resulted in a lower risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events compared to placebo, establishing SGLT2 inhibitors as a cornerstone therapy for diabetic kidney disease. One of the most intriguing aspects of SGLT2 inhibitors is their potential to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Contrary to initial concerns about volume depletion, Nadkarni et al. (2017) conducted a real-world analysis that showed a lower risk of AKI associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use compared to other glucose-lowering drugs. The renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be a class effect, with multiple mechanisms contributing to their benefits. Cherney et al. (2014) investigated the renal hemodynamic effects of empagliflozin in patients with T2D. They found that SGLT2 inhibition led to a reduction in glomerular hyperfiltration, which is thought to be a key mechanism in the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Beyond hemodynamic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. Dekkers et al. (2018) showed that dapagliflozin reduced inflammatory and fibrotic markers in the kidneys of patients with T2D, suggesting multiple pathways through which these drugs exert their renoprotective effects. The safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors has been extensively studied. Wiviott et al. (2019) reported the results of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, which included a large cohort of patients with T2D. This study confirmed the cardiovascular and renal benefits of dapagliflozin while demonstrating a favorable safety profile, with no increase in the risk of adverse events compared to placebo. In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors have revolutionized the management of kidney disease in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Their consistent renoprotective effects, coupled with cardiovascular benefits and a favorable safety profile, have positioned them as a crucial therapy in nephrology and cardiology. As research continues, it is likely that we will uncover even more applications for this remarkable class of medications, further solidifying their place in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and related conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes", "authors": "Bernard Zinman, Christoph Wanner, John M.
