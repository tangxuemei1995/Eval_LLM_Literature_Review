{"Literature Review": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) has emerged as a significant clinical entity in recent years, challenging traditional understanding of myocardial infarction (MI) pathophysiology. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on MINOCA, its prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management strategies.MINOCA is defined as an acute MI with no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease (≥50% stenosis in a major epicardial vessel). The prevalence of MINOCA has been reported to be approximately 6-8% of all MI cases, with a higher incidence in women compared to men. Pasupathy and colleagues conducted a systematic review of 28 studies, finding a pooled prevalence of 6% among patients with acute MI undergoing coronary angiography, with women comprising 43% of MINOCA cases.The pathogenesis of MINOCA is complex and multifactorial, involving various mechanisms that differ from traditional MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD). Agewall and colleagues identified several potential causes, including plaque disruption, coronary artery spasm, coronary microvascular dysfunction, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and thromboembolism. Additionally, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and myocarditis have been recognized as important differential diagnoses that can mimic MINOCA.Diagnosis of MINOCA requires a systematic approach to identify the underlying mechanism. Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for initial assessment, but it has limitations in detecting subtle coronary abnormalities. Intravascular imaging techniques, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), have shown promise in identifying plaque disruption and erosion in MINOCA patients. Reynolds and colleagues demonstrated that IVUS could detect plaque rupture in 38% of MINOCA cases, highlighting the importance of advanced imaging techniques.Provocative testing for coronary artery spasm has gained attention as a diagnostic tool in MINOCA. Montone and colleagues conducted a study on 80 MINOCA patients, finding that 46% had evidence of epicardial or microvascular spasm during acetylcholine testing. This underscores the significance of vasomotor dysfunction in MINOCA pathogenesis and the potential role of provocative testing in diagnosis.Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as a valuable non-invasive tool for differentiating various causes of MINOCA. Dastidar and colleagues performed CMR on 388 MINOCA patients and found that it could provide a diagnosis in 74% of cases, with myocarditis (25%), MI (25%), and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (17%) being the most common findings. The high diagnostic yield of CMR emphasizes its importance in the evaluation of MINOCA patients.Management strategies for MINOCA are less well-defined compared to MI-CAD, primarily due to the heterogeneity of underlying mechanisms and limited clinical trial data specific to MINOCA. Current guidelines for secondary prevention of MI are largely based on studies of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. However, Lindahl and colleagues analyzed data from the SWEDEHEART registry and found that statins and ACE inhibitors/ARBs were associated with improved outcomes in MINOCA patients, suggesting potential benefits of traditional cardioprotective medications.The role of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in MINOCA remains controversial. While DAPT is a cornerstone of treatment in MI-CAD, its efficacy in MINOCA is less clear. Bossard and colleagues conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,535 MINOCA patients and found no significant benefit of DAPT on long-term outcomes, highlighting the need for further research in this area.Recent studies have explored novel therapeutic approaches for MINOCA. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with antiplatelet and vasodilatory properties, has shown promise in treating MINOCA patients with vasospastic angina. Suda and colleagues reported improved symptoms and reduced major adverse cardiac events in MINOCA patients treated with cilostazol compared to conventional therapy.Despite advances in our understanding of MINOCA, several knowledge gaps remain. The optimal duration of follow-up, the role of repeat coronary angiography, and the long-term prognosis of MINOCA patients are areas that require further investigation. Additionally, there is a pressing need for randomized controlled trials specifically designed for MINOCA patients to establish evidence-based treatment guidelines.In conclusion, MINOCA represents a heterogeneous group of conditions with diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. A systematic diagnostic approach, including advanced imaging techniques and provocative testing, is crucial for identifying the underlying cause. While management strategies are evolving, there is a clear need for targeted clinical trials to define optimal care for MINOCA patients. Future research should focus on developing tailored treatment algorithms based on specific MINOCA subtypes to improve outcomes in this important patient population.", "References": [{"title": "Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA): a whole new ball game", "authors": "Stefan Agewall, Jason C.
