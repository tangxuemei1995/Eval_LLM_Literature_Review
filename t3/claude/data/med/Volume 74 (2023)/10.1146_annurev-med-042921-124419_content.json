{"Literature Review": "The use of race in medical practice and research has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate in recent years, particularly in the field of nephrology. This literature review focuses on the historical context, current developments, and future directions regarding the use of race in kidney function estimation, with a particular emphasis on the path toward health justice.Historically, the incorporation of race into medical algorithms and clinical decision-making tools has been rooted in the concept of racial essentialism, which assumes that racial categories reflect inherent biological differences (Eneanya et al., 2019). This perspective has led to the development and widespread use of race-based clinical algorithms, including those for estimating kidney function. The most commonly used equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, have included a race coefficient for Black individuals (Levey et al., 2020).The inclusion of race in these equations was based on observed differences in serum creatinine levels between Black and non-Black individuals, with the assumption that these differences were due to inherent biological variations rather than social or environmental factors (Vyas et al., 2020). However, this approach has been increasingly criticized for perpetuating racial stereotypes, potentially leading to disparities in care, and failing to account for the complex, multifaceted nature of race as a social construct rather than a biological reality.In 2020, the nephrology community began a formal reassessment of the use of race in kidney function estimation equations. This reevaluation was prompted by growing concerns about the ethical implications and potential harm caused by race-based medicine (Delgado et al., 2021). The movement gained momentum following the publication of influential papers questioning the scientific validity and ethical justification for using race in eGFR calculations (Eneanya et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2020).The critical examination of race-based eGFR equations revealed several important issues. First, the use of race as a proxy for biological differences oversimplifies the complex genetic and environmental factors that influence kidney function (Crews et al., 2019). Second, the binary categorization of individuals as Black or non-Black fails to account for the diversity within racial groups and the reality of mixed racial heritage (Cerdeña et al., 2020). Third, the inclusion of race in these equations may contribute to health disparities by potentially delaying referrals for specialist care or transplantation for Black patients (Eneanya et al., 2019).In response to these concerns, several institutions and organizations have taken steps to remove race from eGFR calculations. For example, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) formed a joint task force to reassess the inclusion of race in diagnosing kidney diseases (Delgado et al., 2021). Their efforts culminated in the development and recommendation of new race-free equations for estimating kidney function.The development of race-free eGFR equations represents a significant step toward more equitable and scientifically rigorous kidney function estimation. These new equations aim to maintain accuracy while eliminating the potential for bias introduced by race-based calculations (Inker et al., 2021). However, the transition to race-free equations is not without challenges. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on clinical decision-making, particularly in the context of kidney transplantation and the allocation of scarce resources (Diao et al., 2021).As the nephrology community moves forward, several key considerations emerge. First, there is a need for ongoing research to refine and validate race-free eGFR equations across diverse populations (Inker et al., 2021). Second, the implementation of new equations must be accompanied by education and training for healthcare providers to ensure appropriate interpretation and application (Delgado et al., 2021). Third, the broader implications of removing race from clinical algorithms must be carefully considered, including potential unintended consequences and the need for alternative approaches to addressing health disparities (Diao et al., 2021).The journey toward race-free kidney function estimation serves as a valuable case study for addressing the use of race in other areas of medicine. It highlights the importance of critically examining long-standing practices, engaging in interdisciplinary collaboration, and prioritizing health equity in clinical decision-making tools (Cerdeña et al., 2020).In conclusion, the recent developments in kidney function estimation reflect a growing recognition of the need to address racial bias in medicine and move toward more equitable healthcare practices. While significant progress has been made, continued research, education, and vigilance are necessary to ensure that the path toward health justice in nephrology and beyond remains clear and unobstructed. The lessons learned from this process can inform similar efforts in other medical specialties, ultimately contributing to a more just and effective healthcare system for all.", "References": [{"title": "Race, Genetic Ancestry, and Estimating Kidney Function in CKD", "authors": "Nisha Bansal, Cynthia Delgado, Yoshio Hall, Harold I.
