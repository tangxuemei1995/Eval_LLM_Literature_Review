{"Literature Review": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have revolutionized the diagnostic landscape for undiagnosed rare and ultrarare Mendelian diseases. These next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have significantly improved the ability to identify genetic causes of previously undiagnosed conditions, leading to more accurate diagnoses, tailored treatments, and informed genetic counseling.The advent of ES and GS has dramatically increased diagnostic yields in patients with undiagnosed syndromes. A landmark study by Yang et al. (2013) demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 25% using ES in a cohort of 2000 patients with suspected genetic disorders. This success rate has since been corroborated and even surpassed in subsequent studies. For instance, Retterer et al. (2016) reported a diagnostic yield of 28.8% in a large-scale analysis of 3040 ES cases, with higher rates observed in specific patient subgroups.The impact of ES and GS extends beyond diagnosis. These technologies have facilitated the discovery of novel disease-causing genes and expanded our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations. Chong et al. (2015) highlighted the power of ES in identifying new disease genes, reporting 830 novel disease-gene associations discovered through ES between 2010 and 2014. This rapid expansion of genetic knowledge has profound implications for both clinical practice and basic research.Moreover, ES and GS have proven particularly valuable in solving diagnostic odysseys for patients with complex or atypical presentations. Trujillano et al. (2017) demonstrated the utility of ES in diagnosing patients who had undergone extensive prior genetic testing without success, achieving a diagnostic rate of 307% in this challenging cohort. Similarly, Lionel et al. (2018) showed that GS could provide diagnoses in 41% of patients who remained undiagnosed after ES, underscoring the complementary nature of these technologies.The clinical utility of ES and GS extends beyond diagnosis to impact patient management and treatment decisions. Stark et al. (2016) reported that molecular diagnoses obtained through ES led to changes in clinical management in 46% of diagnosed patients. These changes included initiation of new treatments, avoidance of unnecessary procedures, and more accurate prognostication.Despite these successes, challenges remain in the application of ES and GS to undiagnosed syndromes. One significant hurdle is the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Amendola et al. (2016) highlighted the complexity of VUS interpretation, noting substantial discordance in variant classification among laboratories. Efforts to standardize variant interpretation, such as the guidelines proposed by Richards et al. (2015), have improved consistency but have not eliminated the challenge entirely.Another limitation of current ES and GS technologies is their reliance on short-read sequencing, which can miss certain types of genetic variations. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as those developed by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, offer promise in resolving complex structural variants and repetitive regions that are challenging for short-read sequencing. However, as noted by Mantere et al. (2019), while long-read sequencing shows potential for improving diagnostic yields, its clinical implementation faces challenges related to cost, accuracy, and data analysis.Equity in access to ES and GS remains a significant concern. Stark et al. (2019) highlighted disparities in access to genetic testing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. These disparities not only impact individual patient care but also limit our understanding of genetic diversity and disease mechanisms in underrepresented populations.Ethical considerations surrounding ES and GS also warrant attention. As discussed by Bertier et al. (2016), issues such as incidental findings, data sharing, and privacy concerns need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of these powerful technologies.Looking ahead, the field of ES and GS in undiagnosed syndromes continues to evolve rapidly. Advancements in bioinformatics and artificial intelligence promise to improve variant interpretation and diagnostic yields. Integration of multi-omics data, including transcriptomics and proteomics, with genomic data may provide additional insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.In conclusion, ES and GS have transformed the landscape of rare disease diagnostics, offering hope to patients with previously undiagnosed conditions. While challenges remain, ongoing technological advancements and collaborative efforts in the scientific community continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in genetic diagnosis and personalized medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Clinical whole-exome sequencing for the diagnosis of mendelian disorders", "authors": "Yaping Yang, Donna M.
