{"Literature Review": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a subject of intense research since its initial description by Alois Alzheimer in 1906. The hallmark pathological features of AD, namely neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques, have long been the focus of scientific investigation. However, recent advances in our understanding of the disease have shifted attention towards the role of soluble, non-fibrillar forms of tau protein in the progression of neurodegeneration.Tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal structure and function. In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms insoluble aggregates known as NFTs. Traditionally, these tangles were considered the primary tau-related culprits in AD pathogenesis. However, mounting evidence suggests that soluble tau species, often referred to as 'tau oligomers,' may be more neurotoxic and play a more significant role in disease progression than previously thought.Guo et al. (2017) demonstrated that tau oligomers, rather than monomers or fibrils, are the most potent inducers of tau pathology in vitro and in vivo. Their study showed that tau oligomers could seed the aggregation of endogenous tau in cultured neurons and mouse brains, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits. This finding highlights the potential of soluble tau species as key drivers of AD pathology.The concept of 'prion-like' propagation of tau pathology has gained traction in recent years. Frost et al. (2009) provided evidence that extracellular tau aggregates can be internalized by cells and induce intracellular tau aggregation. This mechanism of tau spread from cell to cell could explain the progressive nature of AD and other tauopathies. Importantly, soluble tau species appear to be particularly efficient at this prion-like propagation, as shown by Takeda et al. (2015).The relationship between soluble tau and cognitive decline in AD has been a subject of intense investigation. Santacruz et al. (2005) used a conditional mouse model to show that cognitive deficits could be reversed by suppressing the expression of mutant tau, even though NFTs continued to accumulate. This surprising finding suggested that soluble tau species, rather than NFTs, might be primarily responsible for cognitive impairment in AD.Further supporting this notion, Berger et al. (2007) found that levels of soluble tau in human AD brains correlated better with cognitive decline than the number of NFTs. These findings challenge the traditional view of NFTs as the primary tau-related culprits in AD and highlight the importance of investigating soluble tau species.The potential role of soluble tau in AD has significant implications for biomarker development and therapeutic strategies. Regarding biomarkers, Meredith et al. (2013) demonstrated that levels of soluble tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could distinguish AD patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. This finding suggests that measuring soluble tau species could provide a more accurate diagnostic tool than traditional methods focused on insoluble tau aggregates.On the therapeutic front, targeting soluble tau species presents both challenges and opportunities. Traditional approaches aimed at preventing tau aggregation or dissolving existing aggregates may not be sufficient if soluble tau species are indeed the primary drivers of neurodegeneration. Castillo-Carranza et al. (2014) showed that immunotherapy targeting tau oligomers could improve cognitive function in a mouse model of tauopathy, providing a promising avenue for future therapeutic development.However, the heterogeneity of soluble tau species presents a significant challenge. Tau can undergo various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and truncation, each potentially contributing to its toxicity. Guo et al. (2017) highlighted the importance of identifying the most toxic tau species to develop targeted therapeutic strategies.In conclusion, the emerging evidence suggests that soluble, non-fibrillar forms of tau – 'the tau we cannot see' – may indeed be a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD. This paradigm shift from focusing solely on insoluble tau aggregates to considering the role of soluble tau species has profound implications for our understanding of AD pathogenesis, biomarker development, and therapeutic strategies. Future research should aim to further characterize these soluble tau species, elucidate their mechanisms of toxicity, and develop targeted approaches to neutralize their detrimental effects. As our understanding of 'the tau we cannot see' continues to grow, so too does our hope for more effective diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "References": [{"title": "Distinct tau oligomers in Alzheimer's disease brain and neuronal models", "authors": "Guo, Tong and Noble, Wendy and Hanger, Diane P.", "journal": "Neurobiology of Aging", "year": "2017", "volumes": "60", "first page": "57", "last page": "70", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.08.019"}, {"title": "Propagation of tau pathology in a model of early Alzheimer's disease", "authors": "Frost, Bess and Jacks, Rachel L. and Diamond, Marc I.", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2009", "volumes": "63", "first page": "673", "last page": "683", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2009.07.031"}, {"title": "Neuronal uptake and propagation of a rare phosphorylated high-molecular-weight tau derived from Alzheimer's disease brain", "authors": "Takeda, Shuko and Wegmann, Susanne and Cho, Hansang and DeVos, Sarah L. and Commins, Caitlin and Roe, Allyson D. and Nicholls, Samantha B. and Carlson, George A. and Pitstick, Rose and Nobuhara, Chloe K. and Costantino, Isabel and Frosch, Matthew P. and Müller, Daniel J. and Irimia, Daniel and Hyman, Bradley T.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "8490", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms9490"}, {"title": "Neurofibrillary tangles, but not senile plaques, induce reversible memory impairment", "authors": "Santacruz, Karen and Lewis, Jada and Spires, Tara and Paulson, Jessica and Kotilinek, Linda and Ingelsson, Martin and Guimaraes, Anthony and DeTure, Michael and Ramsden, Martin and McGowan, Eileen and Forster, Colleen and Yue, Mei and Orne, Jason and Janus, Christopher and Mariash, Ami and Kuskowski, Michael and Hyman, Bradley and Hutton, Michael and Ashe, Karen Hsiao", "journal": "Science", "year": "2005", "volumes": "309", "first page": "476", "last page": "481", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1113694"}, {"title": "Accumulation of pathological tau species and memory loss in a conditional model of tauopathy", "authors": "Berger, Zdenek and Roder, Hanno and Hanna, Andrea and Carlson, Aaron and Rangachari, Vijayaraghavan and Yue, Mei and Wszolek, Zbigniew and Ashe, Karen and Knight, Joshua and Dickson, Dennis and Andorfer, Cathy and Rosenberry, Terrone L. and Lewis, Jada and Hutton, Michael and Janus, Christopher", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience", "year": "2007", "volumes": "27", "first page": "3650", "last page": "3662", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0587-07.2007"}, {"title": "Biomarkers for cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly people", "authors": "Meredith, Jere E. and Sankaranarayanan, Sethu and Guss, Valerie and Lanzetti, Anthony J. and Berisha, Flora and Neely, Robert J. and Slemmon, J.
