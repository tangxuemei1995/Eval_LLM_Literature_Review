{"Literature Review": "The landscape of terrorism in the United States has undergone significant changes in the two decades between the September 11th, 2001 attacks and the January 6th, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol. This literature review examines the evolution of far-right and jihadi terrorism within the United States during this period, focusing on the impact of counterterrorism policies, the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment, and the growth of far-right extremism.In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration implemented a series of counterterrorism measures aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks. However, these policies have been criticized for their disproportionate impact on Muslim communities and their potential to fuel radicalization. Cainkar and Maira (2005) argue that the post-9/11 policies, including surveillance, detentions, and deportations, led to the marginalization and stigmatization of Muslim Americans, creating a climate of fear and distrust.The misuse of deterrence in counterterrorism efforts has been a subject of scholarly debate. Lum et al. (2006) conducted a systematic review of counterterrorism strategies and found that many interventions either increased terrorism or had no discernible effect on reducing it. They suggest that poorly conceived policies may have unintended consequences, potentially exacerbating the very problems they aim to solve.The rise of anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States following 9/11 has been well-documented. Disha et al. (2011) analyzed FBI hate crime statistics and found a significant increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the wake of the attacks. This surge in hate crimes not only affected Muslim communities but also those perceived to be Muslim, highlighting the broader impact of Islamophobia on American society.The legitimization of anti-Muslim ideals in the post-9/11 era has had far-reaching consequences. Bail (2012) examined the media framing of Islam and found that fringe organizations promoting anti-Muslim views gained disproportionate attention, contributing to the mainstreaming of Islamophobic discourse. This shift in public perception has implications for both jihadi extremism and far-right movements.While the focus on jihadi terrorism remained strong in the years following 9/11, far-right extremism was growing beneath the surface. Piazza (2017) analyzed domestic terrorism incidents in the United States and found that far-right extremists were responsible for a significant proportion of attacks, often targeting minority communities. Despite this trend, law enforcement and policymakers continued to prioritize jihadi threats, potentially overlooking the growing danger posed by far-right groups.The interplay between jihadi and far-right extremism is complex and multifaceted. Ebner (2017) argues that these seemingly opposed ideologies actually feed off each other, creating a 'cumulative extremism' effect. The author suggests that anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies can serve as recruitment tools for jihadi groups, while jihadi attacks can be used to justify far-right extremist ideologies.The rise of the alt-right and other far-right movements in recent years has brought renewed attention to domestic extremism. Berger (2018) traces the evolution of these movements, highlighting how they have leveraged social media and online platforms to spread their ideologies and recruit new members. The author argues that the mainstreaming of far-right ideas has contributed to an environment where extremist views are increasingly normalized.The events of January 6th, 2021, marked a significant escalation in far-right extremist activity. Miller-Idriss (2020) presciently warned of the growing threat of far-right extremism in the United States, noting the increasing militarization and organization of these groups. The author's analysis of far-right movements' tactics and ideologies provides valuable context for understanding the events that unfolded at the Capitol.The contrasting responses to 9/11 and January 6th highlight the complex nature of terrorism and national security in the United States. Perliger and Sweeney (2022) argue that the failure to adequately address far-right extremism stems from a combination of factors, including political polarization, institutional biases, and the decentralized nature of many far-right movements.As the United States grapples with the ongoing threat of both jihadi and far-right terrorism, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to counterterrorism. Future research and policy efforts must consider the interconnected nature of these threats and the potential unintended consequences of counterterrorism measures. By learning from the experiences of the past two decades, policymakers and researchers can work towards developing more effective strategies for preventing and countering all forms of extremism while safeguarding civil liberties and promoting social cohesion.", "References": [{"title": "Policing and racialization of Arabs and Muslims in the United States in the aftermath of 9/11", "authors": "Louise Cainkar, Sunaina Maira", "journal": "Race and Arab Americans Before and After 9/11: From Invisible Citizens to Visible Subjects", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "204", "last page": "228", "DOI": "10.2307/j.ctt1ggjjxq.15"}, {"title": "The effectiveness of counter-terrorism strategies", "authors": "Cynthia Lum, Leslie W.
