{"Literature Review": "The role of victim advocacy in criminal justice reform in England and Wales has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with various organizations and movements playing crucial roles in shaping policy and public discourse. This literature review aims to explore the current state of victim advocacy, its impact on criminal justice reform, and the challenges faced by different victim groups in having their voices heard.Victim Support, established in 1974, has been a major institution aiding victims of volume crime in England and Wales (Mawby, 2016). However, despite its extensive reach and support services, research suggests that victims' voices are often underrepresented in policy discussions. Walklate (2007) argues that while Victim Support provides essential services, its structure and funding model may limit its ability to advocate for systemic changes effectively.The lack of a unified voice for victims of traumatic crimes has been a significant obstacle in influencing criminal justice reform. Rock (2004) notes that while many victims of serious crimes are organized and purposeful in their advocacy efforts, they have struggled to form a cohesive movement. This fragmentation has often resulted in competing narratives and priorities, potentially diluting the impact of victim advocacy on policy-making processes.In contrast, the women's movement, particularly groups supporting abused women, has emerged as a powerful force in shaping criminal justice reform in England and Wales. Hague and Malos (2005) highlight how feminist activism has been instrumental in bringing domestic violence to the forefront of public and political attention since the 1970s. This sustained effort has led to significant legislative changes and improved support services for victims of domestic abuse.The impact of the women's movement on criminal justice reform became particularly evident in the late 2020s and early 2021s. Widely publicized killings of women, such as the murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021, sparked nationwide protests and renewed calls for action to address violence against women (Bates, 2021). This public outcry coincided with the passage of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, which introduced new protections for victims and expanded the definition of domestic abuse to include economic abuse and coercive control (Stark and Hester, 2019).The success of the women's movement in influencing policy can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the movement has effectively utilized media and public awareness campaigns to highlight the prevalence and impact of violence against women. Secondly, it has built strong coalitions with other advocacy groups, researchers, and policymakers, creating a more unified front in pushing for reform (Htun and Weldon, 2012).However, the prominence of the women's movement in criminal justice reform discussions has raised questions about the representation of other victim groups. Walklate and Fitz-Gibbon (2018) argue that while the focus on violence against women is crucial, there is a risk of overshadowing the needs of other vulnerable groups, such as elderly victims or male victims of domestic abuse.The challenge of balancing diverse victim needs within criminal justice reform efforts is further complicated by the intersectionality of victimization experiences. Crenshaw (1991) emphasizes the importance of considering how factors such as race, class, and sexuality intersect with gender in shaping experiences of victimization and access to justice. This intersectional approach has been increasingly recognized in victim advocacy efforts, but its integration into policy-making remains inconsistent (Potter, 2015).The role of technology in victim advocacy and criminal justice reform is an emerging area of interest. Social media platforms have provided new avenues for victims to share their experiences and mobilize support (McGlynn and Rackley, 2017). However, the digital divide and concerns about online harassment pose challenges to ensuring equitable access to these advocacy tools.Looking forward, the future of victim advocacy in criminal justice reform in England and Wales will likely depend on the ability of various victim groups to build coalitions and present a more unified front while still addressing the specific needs of different victim populations. The success of the women's movement in influencing policy provides valuable lessons for other advocacy groups seeking to impact criminal justice reform.In conclusion, while Victim Support continues to play a crucial role in supporting victims of volume crime, it is the women's movement that has made the most visible impact on criminal justice reform in recent years. The challenge moving forward will be to build on this momentum while ensuring that the diverse needs of all victim groups are represented in policy discussions and reform efforts.", "References": [{"title": "Victim Support: 30 Years of Supporting Victims and Witnesses", "authors": "Ross Mawby", "journal": "International Review of Victimology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "22", "first page": "135", "last page": "147", "DOI": "10.1177/0269758015610854"}, {"title": "Coercive Control: How Men Entrap Women in Personal Life", "authors": "Evan Stark, Marianne Hester", "journal": "Violence Against Women", "year": "2019", "volumes": "25", "first page": "11", "last page": "32", "DOI": "10.1177/1077801218820733"}, {"title": "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color", "authors": "Kimberle Crenshaw", "journal": "Stanford Law Review", "year": "1991", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1241", "last page": "1299", "DOI": "10.2307/1229039"}]}
