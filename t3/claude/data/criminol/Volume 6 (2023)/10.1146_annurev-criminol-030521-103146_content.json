{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on carceral systems worldwide, with prisons and jails becoming hotspots for virus transmission. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding COVID-19 in correctional facilities, focusing on its impact on incarcerated individuals, staff, health systems, and surrounding communities.The heightened vulnerability of incarceral populations to infectious diseases has been well-documented in previous pandemics. However, the scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic have brought unprecedented attention to the health challenges faced by these institutions. A study by Saloner et al. (2020) found that the COVID-19 case rate for prisoners was 5.5 times higher than the general U.S. population, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions in these settings.The rapid spread of COVID-19 in correctional facilities can be attributed to several factors. Overcrowding, poor ventilation, and inadequate sanitation have been identified as key contributors to virus transmission (Franco-Paredes et al., 2021). Additionally, the constant movement of people in and out of these facilities, including staff and new admissions, increases the risk of introducing the virus into these closed environments (Puglisi et al., 2021).The impact of COVID-19 extends beyond the incarcerated population. Correctional officers and other staff members have also been significantly affected by the pandemic. A study by Novisky et al. (2020) found that correctional staff experienced high levels of stress and anxiety due to the increased risk of exposure to the virus and concerns about potentially transmitting it to their families.Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in carceral settings have varied widely. Testing strategies have been a crucial component of these efforts, with many facilities implementing routine screening and surveillance testing. However, the effectiveness of these measures has been inconsistent. A study by Hagan et al. (2020) found that while mass testing helped identify asymptomatic cases, logistical challenges and resource limitations often hindered comprehensive testing efforts.Vaccination has emerged as a critical tool in combating COVID-19 in correctional facilities. However, vaccine uptake among incarcerated individuals and staff has been variable. A study by Stern et al. (2021) found that vaccine hesitancy was a significant challenge in some facilities, highlighting the need for targeted education and outreach efforts.The pandemic has also prompted discussions about depopulation strategies to reduce overcrowding and minimize virus transmission. Some jurisdictions have implemented early release programs or alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders. A study by Reinhart and Chen (2021) found that such decarceration efforts were associated with reduced COVID-19 case growth in county jails, suggesting that population reduction can be an effective public health strategy.The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare delivery in correctional facilities has been substantial. Many facilities have had to adapt their healthcare systems to manage COVID-19 cases while maintaining essential services for other health conditions. A study by Wurcel et al. (2020) highlighted the challenges of providing adequate care for chronic conditions and mental health issues during the pandemic, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to healthcare delivery in these settings.The pandemic has also shed light on the interconnectedness between correctional facilities and surrounding communities. Research by Jiménez et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails could lead to increased transmission in nearby communities, underscoring the importance of considering carceral health as a public health priority.While the body of research on COVID-19 in carceral systems has grown significantly, there are still important gaps in our understanding. Future research should focus on the long-term health effects of COVID-19 on incarcerated populations, the impact of prolonged isolation measures on mental health, and the effectiveness of various intervention strategies in different correctional settings.In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the unique challenges faced by carceral systems in managing infectious diseases. The growing body of research on this topic provides valuable insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in these settings and the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. However, continued research is needed to inform evidence-based policies and practices that can improve health outcomes for incarcerated individuals and correctional staff, both during the current pandemic and in preparation for future public health crises.", "References": [{"title": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Federal and State Prisons", "authors": "Brendan Saloner, Kalind Parish, Julie A.
