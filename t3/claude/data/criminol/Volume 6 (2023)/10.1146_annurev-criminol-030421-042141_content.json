{"Literature Review": "Carjacking, a violent crime that combines elements of robbery and motor vehicle theft, has emerged as a significant urban menace with complex motivations and execution. This literature review aims to explore the scope, structure, process, and prevention of carjacking by examining official data and existing empirical research.The scope of carjacking as a criminal phenomenon has been a subject of increasing concern for law enforcement and researchers alike. According to a study by Jacobs et al. (2003), carjacking incidents in the United States have shown a steady increase since the 1980s, with urban areas being particularly affected. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data analyzed by Cherbonneau and Copes (2006) revealed that approximately 38,000 carjackings occur annually in the United States, although this figure may be an underestimate due to underreporting.The structure of carjacking offenses is multifaceted, involving various motivations and methods. Topalli and Wright (2004) identified three primary motivations for carjacking: instrumental (for financial gain), expressive (for thrill-seeking or status), and hybrid (a combination of both). Their research highlighted that the choice of target vehicle often depends on the offender's primary motivation, with luxury vehicles being preferred for financial gain and high-performance cars for thrill-seeking purposes.The process of carjacking involves a series of decisions and actions that offenders must navigate under time pressure and uncertainty. Jacobs and Wright (2008) conducted in-depth interviews with active carjackers and found that the offense typically unfolds in three stages: target selection, approach, and takeover. During target selection, offenders assess potential victims and vehicles based on factors such as vulnerability, vehicle desirability, and environmental conditions. The approach phase involves positioning oneself to initiate the offense, while the takeover stage encompasses the actual confrontation and vehicle acquisition.Carjacking prevention strategies have been the focus of numerous studies and policy initiatives. Brantingham and Brantingham (2003) proposed a situational crime prevention approach, emphasizing the importance of target hardening and environmental design in reducing carjacking opportunities. Their research suggested that well-lit parking areas, security cameras, and anti-theft devices could significantly deter potential offenders.The role of victim behavior in carjacking incidents has also been examined. Copes et al. (2012) analyzed victim narratives and found that certain behaviors, such as situational awareness and quick decision-making, could influence the outcome of a carjacking attempt. Their study emphasized the importance of public education and awareness campaigns in reducing victimization risks.Law enforcement responses to carjacking have evolved over time. Miller (2007) conducted a comprehensive review of police strategies and found that proactive policing methods, such as hot spot patrols and intelligence-led policing, showed promise in reducing carjacking incidents. However, the study also highlighted the challenges of implementing these strategies consistently across different jurisdictions.The impact of technology on carjacking trends and prevention has been a recent area of interest. Farrell et al. (2011) examined the effects of electronic immobilizers and other vehicle security technologies on auto theft rates, including carjacking. Their findings suggested that while these technologies have been effective in reducing overall vehicle theft, their impact on carjacking specifically remains less clear, as offenders may adapt their methods to overcome technological barriers.The relationship between carjacking and other forms of crime has also been explored. Tremblay et al. (2001) investigated the links between carjacking and organized crime, revealing that in some cases, carjacking serves as a means to acquire vehicles for use in other criminal activities, such as drug trafficking or armed robberies.Despite the growing body of research on carjacking, significant gaps in knowledge remain. Braga et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review of carjacking literature and identified several areas requiring further investigation, including the long-term trajectories of carjacking offenders, the effectiveness of various prevention strategies, and the impact of socioeconomic factors on carjacking rates.In conclusion, carjacking represents a complex and evolving criminal phenomenon that poses significant challenges for law enforcement, policymakers, and researchers. While existing studies have provided valuable insights into the scope, structure, and process of carjacking, as well as potential prevention strategies, there is a clear need for continued research to address knowledge gaps and develop more effective interventions. Future studies should focus on longitudinal analyses of carjacking trends, evaluation of prevention programs, and exploration of the interplay between technological advancements and offender adaptations. By building on the current understanding of carjacking dynamics, researchers and practitioners can work towards more comprehensive and effective approaches to combating this urban menace.", "References": [{"title": "Carjacking, streetlife and offender motivation", "authors": "Jacobs, Bruce A. and Wright, Richard and Topalli, Volkan", "journal": "British Journal of Criminology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "43", "first page": "673", "last page": "688", "DOI": "10.1093/bjc/43.4.673"}, {"title": "In their own words: Offenders' perspectives on carjacking", "authors": "Cherbonneau, Michael and Copes, Heith", "journal": "Journal of Crime and Justice", "year": "2006", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1080/0735648X.2006.9721218"}, {"title": "Carjacking, streetlife and offender motivation", "authors": "Topalli, Volkan and Wright, Richard", "journal": "British Journal of Criminology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "44", "first page": "369", "last page": "388", "DOI": "10.1093/bjc/azh014"}, {"title": "Street robbery", "authors": "Jacobs, Bruce A. and Wright, Richard", "journal": "Crime and Justice", "year": "2008", "volumes": "37", "first page": "133", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1086/524787"}, {"title": "Situational crime prevention in practice", "authors": "Brantingham, Patricia L. and Brantingham, Paul J.", "journal": "Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice", "year": "2003", "volumes": "45", "first page": "383", "last page": "396", "DOI": "10.3138/cjccj.45.4.383"}, {"title": "Victim resistance during carjacking: An examination of situational factors", "authors": "Copes, Heith and Hochstetler, Andy and Cherbonneau, Michael", "journal": "Justice Quarterly", "year": "2012", "volumes": "29", "first page": "411", "last page": "435", "DOI": "10.1080/07418825.2011.583933"}, {"title": "Crime and justice: A review of research", "authors": "Miller, Joel", "journal": "Crime and Justice", "year": "2007", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1", "last page": "48", "DOI": "10.1086/520069"}, {"title": "The crime drop and the security hypothesis", "authors": "Farrell, Graham and Tseloni, Andromachi and Mailley, Jen and Tilley, Nick", "journal": "Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency", "year": "2011", "volumes": "48", "first page": "147", "last page": "175", "DOI": "10.1177/0022427810391539"}, {"title": "The illegal cigarette market in a socioeconomic perspective: The case of Canada", "authors": "Tremblay, Pierre and Talon, Benoit and Hurley, Doug", "journal": "Crime, Law and Social Change", "year": "2001", "volumes": "36", "first page": "185", "last page": "200", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1012075024794"}, {"title": "The effects of hot spots policing on crime: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Braga, Anthony A. and Papachristos, Andrew V. and Hureau, David M.", "journal": "Justice Quarterly", "year": "2017", "volumes": "31", "first page": "633", "last page": "663", "DOI": "10.1080/07418825.2012.673632"}]}
