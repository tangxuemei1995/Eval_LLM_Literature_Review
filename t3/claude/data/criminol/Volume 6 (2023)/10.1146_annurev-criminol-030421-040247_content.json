{"Literature Review": "The issue of fatal police violence (FPV) in the United States has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in comparison to other developed nations. This literature review aims to explore the factors contributing to the exceptionally high rates of police killings in the U.S. and compare them with other countries, both in the Americas and globally.One of the most striking aspects of American policing is its decentralized nature. Bayley and Stenning (2016) describe the U.S. policing structure as 'radically decentralized,' which has significant implications for oversight, training, and accountability. This decentralization can lead to inconsistent policies and practices across different jurisdictions, potentially contributing to higher rates of FPV. However, it is important to note that decentralization alone does not fully explain the high rates of police killings, as some Latin American countries with more centralized policing systems also experience elevated FPV rates (Chevigny, 1990).The prevalence of gun violence in the United States is another crucial factor in understanding the high rates of FPV. Zimring and Arsiniega (2015) argue that the widespread availability of firearms in the U.S. creates a heightened sense of danger among police officers, leading to a greater willingness to use preemptive force. This 'culture of fear' among law enforcement can result in more frequent use of deadly force, even in situations where it may not be necessary.Ethnoracial inequality and discord play a significant role in the dynamics of police violence in the United States. Research by Edwards et al. (2019) demonstrates that Black Americans are disproportionately affected by police killings, with a risk of being killed by police that is 2.5 times higher than that of white Americans. This racial disparity in police violence is deeply rooted in historical and systemic inequalities, which continue to shape policing practices and outcomes.Comparative studies have shown that other developed nations, particularly in Northern Europe, have significantly lower rates of FPV than the United States. Kuhns et al. (2016) attribute this difference to factors such as more extensive training, stricter use-of-force policies, and greater accountability measures in these countries. However, it is worth noting that some countries with fewer resources, such as Spain and Chile, have also achieved relatively low rates of FPV, suggesting that financial resources alone do not determine outcomes (Osse and Cano, 2017).The role of police culture and training in shaping use-of-force outcomes cannot be overstated. Terrill et al. (2003) found that police officers' attitudes and beliefs about the use of force are strongly influenced by organizational culture and training practices. In the United States, the emphasis on officer safety and the 'warrior' mentality in police training may contribute to a greater willingness to use deadly force (Stoughton, 2015).While the United States stands out among developed nations for its high rates of FPV, it is important to consider the broader context of the Americas. Some Latin American countries experience similar or even higher rates of police killings. Chevigny (1990) argues that this regional pattern may be related to shared historical experiences of colonialism, inequality, and political instability.The issue of police accountability is central to understanding and addressing FPV. Walker and Archbold (2014) emphasize the importance of robust oversight mechanisms and transparency in reducing police violence. However, the decentralized nature of U.S. policing can make it challenging to implement consistent accountability measures across jurisdictions.Recent reform efforts in the United States have focused on various strategies to reduce police violence, including de-escalation training, body-worn cameras, and community policing initiatives. While these approaches show promise, their effectiveness in significantly reducing FPV remains a subject of ongoing research and debate (Engel et al., 2020).In conclusion, the exceptionally high rates of fatal police violence in the United States can be attributed to a complex interplay of factors, including decentralized policing structures, prevalent gun violence, ethnoracial inequalities, and organizational culture. While some of these factors are shared with other high-FPV countries in the Americas, the United States stands out among developed nations for its reliance on deadly force. Comparative analyses with low-FPV countries suggest that improvements in training, accountability, and use-of-force policies could potentially reduce police killings, even in the absence of extensive resources. As research in this field continues to evolve, it is crucial to consider both the unique aspects of American policing and the broader global context to develop effective strategies for reducing fatal police violence.", "References": [{"title": "Policing across the world: Issues for the twenty-first century", "authors": "David H.
