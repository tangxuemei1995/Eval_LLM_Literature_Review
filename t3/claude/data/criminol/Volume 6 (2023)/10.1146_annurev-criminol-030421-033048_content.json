{"Literature Review": "The intersection of immigration and crime has been a topic of significant interest in criminological research for over a century. While early studies in this field were predominantly ethnographic in nature, contemporary scholarship has largely shifted towards quantitative approaches. This literature review aims to revisit classic ethnographies of immigration and crime, highlight their methodological contributions, and synthesize recent ethnographic research in this area, demonstrating the continued relevance and value of qualitative approaches in understanding the complex relationship between immigration and crime.The early 20th century saw a surge in ethnographic studies of immigration and crime, particularly associated with the Chicago School of Sociology. Scholars such as Thomas and Znaniecki (1918) conducted groundbreaking research on Polish immigrants in Chicago and Europe, providing rich, detailed accounts of the immigrant experience and its relation to crime and social disorganization. Their work, 'The Polish Peasant in Europe and America,' set a precedent for in-depth, qualitative investigations of immigrant communities.Building on this foundation, Shaw and McKay (1942) developed their influential social disorganization theory, which posited that neighborhood characteristics, rather than individual or group traits, were the primary determinants of crime rates. Their ethnographic work in Chicago's immigrant neighborhoods provided crucial insights into the social processes underlying crime in these communities, challenging prevailing notions of inherent criminality among certain immigrant groups.Despite the valuable contributions of these early ethnographies, contemporary criminology has largely favored quantitative approaches. Martínez and Lee (2000) argue that this shift has led to a 'collective amnesia' in the field, with many researchers overlooking the rich insights provided by earlier qualitative studies. Similarly, Bosworth et al. (2018) critique the 'newness fetish' in criminology, which often prioritizes novel quantitative methods over established qualitative approaches.However, a small but growing body of contemporary ethnographic research on immigration and crime is emerging, demonstrating the continued relevance of qualitative methods in this field. One significant area of focus has been the policing of immigrant communities in the age of 'crimmigration' – the increasing convergence of criminal and immigration law. Armenta (2017) conducted an ethnographic study of local police practices in Nashville, Tennessee, revealing how officers navigate the complex terrain of immigration enforcement and community policing. Her work highlights the nuanced ways in which local law enforcement agencies interpret and implement federal immigration policies, often leading to unintended consequences for immigrant communities.Another important strand of contemporary ethnographic research examines the lived experiences inside deportation and detention regimes. Golash-Boza (2015) conducted extensive fieldwork in deportation centers and among deported individuals in Jamaica, Brazil, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. Her work provides a vivid account of the human costs of deportation policies and their impact on families and communities, offering insights that quantitative studies often fail to capture.The integration experiences of Muslims, a highly marginalized but understudied immigrant population, have also been the subject of recent ethnographic inquiry. Adida et al. (2016) conducted an ethnographic study of Muslim immigrants in France, exploring the challenges they face in integrating into French society and the potential implications for social cohesion and crime. Their work highlights the complex interplay between religious identity, discrimination, and social integration, demonstrating the value of qualitative approaches in understanding these nuanced dynamics.Ethnographic research has also shed light on immigrants' unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization. Bucher et al. (2010) conducted an ethnographic study of day laborers in Las Vegas, revealing how their precarious legal status and working conditions expose them to various forms of exploitation and victimization. This work underscores the importance of qualitative methods in uncovering hidden forms of victimization that may be overlooked in quantitative studies.In conclusion, while quantitative approaches have dominated recent criminological research on immigration and crime, ethnographic studies continue to offer valuable insights into this complex relationship. By providing rich, contextual data on the lived experiences of immigrants, their interactions with law enforcement, and their vulnerabilities to victimization, ethnographic research complements and enhances our understanding of the immigration-crime nexus. As the field of criminology continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize the enduring value of qualitative approaches and to integrate them more fully into contemporary research on immigration and crime.", "References": [{"title": "The Polish Peasant in Europe and America: Monograph of an Immigrant Group", "authors": "William I.
