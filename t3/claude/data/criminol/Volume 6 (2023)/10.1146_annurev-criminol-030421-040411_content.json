{"Literature Review": "The concept of overcriminalization has gained significant attention in recent years, with scholars and practitioners across the political spectrum expressing concern about the expansion of criminal law and its consequences. This literature review examines the complexities surrounding overcriminalization, focusing on six key questions that must be addressed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the issue. First, it is crucial to define what constitutes criminal law. Husak (2008) argues that criminal law is distinguished by its punitive nature and the stigma associated with conviction. However, Coffee (1991) contends that the boundaries between criminal and civil law have become increasingly blurred, complicating efforts to identify overcriminalization. Second, the meaning of overcriminalization itself is subject to debate. Kadish (1967) describes it as the use of criminal law to punish conduct that should not be criminalized, while Luna (2005) emphasizes the excessive quantity of criminal laws. These differing perspectives highlight the need for a clear definition to guide discussions on the topic. Third, the pernicious effects of overcriminalization are widely acknowledged but variously interpreted. Stuntz (2001) argues that it leads to selective enforcement and undermines the rule of law, while Larkin (2013) focuses on its economic costs and impact on individual liberty. Understanding these consequences is essential for developing effective solutions. Fourth, the distinction between de jure and de facto overcriminalization is crucial. Smith (2005) contends that the problem lies primarily in the law on the books, advocating for legislative reform. In contrast, Barkow (2019) emphasizes the role of prosecutorial discretion in exacerbating overcriminalization, suggesting that changes in enforcement practices may be necessary. Fifth, the normative criteria for addressing overcriminalization are contentious. Husak (2008) proposes a set of internal constraints on criminalization, including the harm principle and wrongfulness requirement. However, Duff (2014) argues for a more communitarian approach, emphasizing the role of shared values in determining the scope of criminal law. Sixth, the extent to which overcriminalization is a serious concern in contemporary penal systems remains debated. While Stuntz (2011) presents a compelling case for its pervasiveness in the United States, Lippke (2015) suggests that the problem may be overstated and that other issues, such as mass incarceration, deserve greater attention. These six questions are interconnected, and positions on one often influence perspectives on others. For example, one's definition of criminal law (question 1) may shape their understanding of what constitutes overcriminalization (question 2). Similarly, views on the normative criteria for addressing the issue (question 5) may inform assessments of its seriousness (question 6). The literature reveals a general consensus that overcriminalization is a problem, but disagreements persist regarding its nature, causes, and solutions. Husak (2008) provides a comprehensive critique of overcriminalization, arguing that it undermines the moral authority of criminal law and leads to unjust punishments. However, his focus on internal constraints has been challenged by scholars like Duff (2014), who emphasize the need for a more contextual approach. Stuntz (2001, 2011) offers a historical perspective, tracing the roots of overcriminalization to the expansion of federal criminal law and the rise of prosecutorial power. His work highlights the systemic nature of the problem and the challenges of reform. Barkow (2019) builds on this analysis, examining the role of institutional incentives in perpetuating overcriminalization and proposing structural changes to address the issue. The debate over de jure versus de facto overcriminalization remains unresolved. While Smith (2005) advocates for legislative solutions, such as sunset provisions for criminal statutes, others like Luna (2005) argue for a multi-faceted approach that includes both legal and institutional reforms. This disagreement reflects broader tensions between those who view overcriminalization primarily as a problem of law-making and those who emphasize its enforcement dimensions. The normative foundations for addressing overcriminalization also remain contested. While the harm principle, articulated by Mill and developed by Feinberg (1984), remains influential, critics like Duff (2014) argue for a more nuanced approach that considers community values and the expressive function of criminal law. These debates reflect deeper philosophical disagreements about the proper aims and limits of criminal justice. In conclusion, while the literature on overcriminalization is extensive, significant gaps and disagreements persist. Future research should aim to develop more precise definitions and metrics for measuring overcriminalization, explore its varied manifestations across different legal systems, and propose evidence-based solutions that address both its legal and institutional dimensions. Additionally, greater attention should be paid to the perspectives of marginalized communities who are often disproportionately affected by overcriminalization. Only by grappling with these complex issues can we hope to develop a more just and effective criminal justice system.", "References": [{"title": "Overcriminalization: The Limits of the Criminal Law", "authors": "Douglas Husak", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195328714.001.0001"}, {"title": "Does 'Unlawful' Mean 'Criminal'?: Reflections on the Disappearing Tort/Crime Distinction in American Law", "authors": "John C.
