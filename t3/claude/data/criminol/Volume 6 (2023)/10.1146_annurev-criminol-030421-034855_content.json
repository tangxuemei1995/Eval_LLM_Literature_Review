{"Literature Review": "The field of criminology has long been focused on understanding and preventing crime, but John Braithwaite's autobiographical review, 'Beyond Predatory Peace,' challenges us to expand our perspective and consider the interconnections between crime, peace, war, and environmental crises. This literature review aims to contextualize Braithwaite's work within the broader landscape of criminological research and explore its implications for future studies.Braithwaite's approach to criminology is unique in its long-term, multidisciplinary focus. While traditional criminology has often concentrated on immediate causes and effects of crime, Braithwaite's work emphasizes the importance of considering broader societal and global factors. This aligns with the growing recognition in the field that crime cannot be understood in isolation from other social phenomena. As noted by Agnew (2011), a comprehensive understanding of crime requires consideration of macro-level factors such as globalization, climate change, and international conflicts.The concept of 'predatory peace' that Braithwaite introduces is particularly intriguing. It suggests that peace, traditionally viewed as an unequivocally positive state, can sometimes mask or even facilitate harmful dynamics. This idea resonates with critical criminology perspectives, which argue that definitions of crime and peace are often shaped by power structures rather than objective harm (Michalowski, 2016).Braithwaite's inclusion of cybercrime in his research agenda is prescient, given the exponential growth of this form of crime in recent decades. As Wall (2007) points out, cybercrime presents unique challenges to traditional criminological theories and law enforcement approaches. Braithwaite's work may offer valuable insights into how cybercrime intersects with broader issues of peace and conflict.The autobiographical nature of Braithwaite's review provides a rare glimpse into the personal journey of a criminologist. This approach aligns with the growing recognition in social sciences of the value of reflexivity and positionality in research. As noted by Alvesson and Sköldberg (2017), reflexive methodology can enhance the depth and validity of qualitative research.Braithwaite's emphasis on the long-term study of organizational crime is particularly relevant in today's context of increasing corporate power and influence. As Tombs and Whyte (2015) argue, organizational crime often has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond immediate victims, affecting entire communities and even nations.The connection Braithwaite draws between crime and environmental crises is an area ripe for further exploration. Green criminology, a subfield that examines environmental crimes and harms, has gained traction in recent years. As South (2014) notes, environmental issues are increasingly recognized as matters of criminological concern, given their potential to cause widespread harm and exacerbate existing social inequalities.Braithwaite's aspiration for a 'macrocriminology of freedom' represents an ambitious attempt to synthesize diverse strands of criminological thought. This aligns with calls from scholars like Loader and Sparks (2011) for a 'public criminology' that engages more directly with broader societal issues and policy debates.The author's acknowledgment of the 'messy' nature of his research process is refreshingly honest and aligns with recent discussions in the philosophy of science about the non-linear nature of scientific progress. As Feyerabend (2010) argues, scientific advancement often involves periods of apparent chaos and contradiction before new paradigms emerge.Finally, Braithwaite's work challenges us to think beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. His integration of insights from peace studies, environmental science, and cybersecurity into criminological research exemplifies the kind of interdisciplinary approach that many scholars argue is necessary to address complex global challenges (Repko and Szostak, 2020).In conclusion, John Braithwaite's autobiographical review offers a unique and valuable perspective on the field of criminology. By emphasizing the interconnections between crime, peace, war, and environmental crises, and by advocating for a long-term, multidisciplinary approach, Braithwaite's work challenges us to expand our understanding of what criminology can and should encompass. While his ambitions may remain 'half-baked,' they undoubtedly provide fertile ground for future research and debate in the field.", "References": [{"title": "Why Crime Occurs: A General Theory of Crime Causation", "authors": "Robert Agnew", "journal": "Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency", "year": "2011", "volumes": "48", "first page": "187", "last page": "242", "DOI": "10.1177/0022427810395581"}, {"title": "Theory and Practice in Critical Criminology", "authors": "Raymond J.
