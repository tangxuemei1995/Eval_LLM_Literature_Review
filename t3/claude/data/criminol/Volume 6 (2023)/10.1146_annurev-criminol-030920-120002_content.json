{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race, ethnicity, and criminology has long been a subject of scholarly interest, particularly in the context of understanding disparities in crime rates and criminal justice system involvement. While much of the existing literature has focused on comparisons between Black and White populations, there is a growing recognition of the need to expand this discourse to include Latino/a/x communities, the largest racial minority group in the United States. This literature review aims to explore the application of Latina and Latino Critical Legal Theory (LatCrit) to criminology, with a focus on understanding Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement.LatCrit, an offshoot of Critical Race Theory, provides a valuable framework for examining the unique experiences of Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice system. As noted by Delgado and Stefancic (2017), LatCrit emphasizes the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, language, and immigration status in shaping the lived experiences of Latino/a/x people. This perspective is particularly relevant in criminology, where these factors can significantly influence both the perception and reality of criminal behavior and justice system interactions.The racialization of Latino/a/x communities has been a persistent theme in American society, with implications for their treatment within the criminal justice system. Menjívar and Abrego (2012) argue that the process of racialization has led to the construction of Latino/a/x individuals as inherently criminogenic, influencing both public perception and institutional practices. This racialization process is not static but evolves in response to social, political, and economic factors, as demonstrated by Flores (2018) in her analysis of the changing racial categorization of Mexican Americans over time.The impact of this racialization on crime rates and criminal justice system involvement among Latino/a/x populations is complex and multifaceted. Burch (2015) found that Latino/a/x individuals often face disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration compared to their White counterparts, even when controlling for socioeconomic factors. However, it is crucial to note that crime rates and patterns within Latino/a/x communities are not monolithic and can vary significantly based on factors such as generational status, national origin, and local context (Martínez and Lee, 2000).Language and cultural barriers play a significant role in shaping Latino/a/x experiences within the criminal justice system. Pérez (2018) highlights how limited English proficiency can lead to misunderstandings, inadequate legal representation, and ultimately, disparate outcomes in criminal proceedings. Moreover, cultural differences in perceptions of authority and justice can influence how Latino/a/x individuals interact with law enforcement and navigate the legal system (Provine and Doty, 2011).The intersection of immigration policy and criminal justice is another critical area of focus in understanding Latino/a/x involvement in the criminal legal system. Menjívar and Abrego (2012) argue that the increasing criminalization of immigration has blurred the lines between civil and criminal law, leading to what they term 'legal violence' against Latino/a/x communities. This conflation of immigration enforcement and criminal justice has resulted in increased surveillance, profiling, and detention of Latino/a/x individuals, regardless of their immigration status (Armenta, 2017).LatCrit also emphasizes the importance of examining how systemic racism and structural inequalities contribute to crime and criminal justice involvement among Latino/a/x populations. Vélez et al. (2015) demonstrate how neighborhood disadvantage, which disproportionately affects Latino/a/x communities, can contribute to higher crime rates and increased police presence. These structural factors, rooted in historical and ongoing processes of racial and ethnic marginalization, must be considered in any comprehensive analysis of Latino/a/x crime patterns.The application of LatCrit to criminology also calls for a critical examination of how criminological theories have traditionally addressed (or failed to address) the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals. Many mainstream criminological theories were developed primarily through the lens of Black-White comparisons and may not fully capture the nuances of Latino/a/x experiences. Incorporating LatCrit perspectives into criminological theory can help to address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive understanding of crime and justice in diverse communities (Hagan et al., 2008).As the Latino/a/x population continues to grow and diversify, it is crucial for criminology as a field to adapt and expand its theoretical frameworks to better understand and address the unique challenges faced by this community. By integrating LatCrit perspectives into criminological research and theory, scholars can develop more nuanced and culturally responsive approaches to studying crime and criminal justice involvement among Latino/a/x populations.In conclusion, the application of LatCrit to criminology offers a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement. By centering race and racism, acknowledging the complexities of Latino/a/x identities, and critically examining systemic inequalities, researchers can develop more comprehensive and equitable approaches to addressing crime and justice issues in Latino/a/x communities. As the field of criminology continues to evolve, the integration of LatCrit perspectives will be essential in ensuring that research and policy adequately reflect the diverse experiences of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States.", "References": [{"title": "LatCrit: A conceptual overview", "authors": "Richard Delgado, Jean Stefancic", "journal": "Harvard Latino Law Review", "year": "2017", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2954360"}, {"title": "Legal Violence: Immigration Law and the Lives of Central American Immigrants", "authors": "Cecilia Menjívar, Leisy J.
