{"Literature Review": "The integration of machine learning (ML) with physical knowledge in the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures represents a burgeoning area of research that seeks to enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of thermophysical property estimation. Traditional methods for predicting the properties of fluid mixtures, such as molecular models, equations of state, and models of excess properties, have been the cornerstone of thermodynamic modeling for decades. However, these methods often require extensive experimental data, which is not always available, leading to the exploration of alternative approaches such as ML. This literature review examines the intersection of these methodologies, highlighting the potential of hybrid models that combine the strengths of both physical and ML approaches.\n\nMolecular models, such as those based on statistical mechanics, provide a detailed understanding of fluid behavior at the molecular level. These models, while accurate, are computationally intensive and require detailed molecular information, which is not always feasible to obtain (Frenkel and Smit, 2002). Equations of state (EOS), such as the Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations, offer a more practical approach by simplifying the complex interactions into manageable mathematical forms (Peng and Robinson, 1976; Soave, 1972). However, these models often rely on empirical parameters that need to be fitted to experimental data, limiting their applicability in data-scarce scenarios.\n\nIn recent years, ML has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex systems, including fluid mixtures. ML algorithms, such as neural networks and support vector machines, can learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton, 2015). These methods have been successfully applied to predict thermophysical properties, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional models (Goh et al., 2017). However, purely data-driven models can lack the interpretability and generalizability of physically-based models, especially when extrapolating beyond the range of the training data.\n\nThe concept of hybrid models, which integrate ML with physical knowledge, aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches. These models can incorporate physical laws and constraints into the ML framework, enhancing the model's interpretability and reliability (Karpatne et al., 2017). For instance, hybrid models can use ML to predict the parameters of an EOS, thereby reducing the dependency on experimental data while maintaining the physical consistency of the EOS (Zhang et al., 2018).\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of hybrid models in thermodynamic modeling. For example, a study by Chen et al. (2019) combined a neural network with an EOS to predict the phase behavior of complex fluid mixtures. The neural network was trained to predict the EOS parameters based on molecular descriptors, allowing the model to generalize to new mixtures with limited data. Similarly, a study by Wu et al. (2020) used a hybrid approach to model the viscosity of fluid mixtures, integrating a support vector machine with a group contribution method to improve prediction accuracy.\n\nThe integration of ML with physical models also facilitates the incorporation of uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable predictions in engineering applications. Bayesian neural networks, for instance, can provide probabilistic predictions that account for uncertainty in the data and model parameters (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016). This capability is particularly valuable in the context of fluid mixtures, where experimental data are often sparse and noisy.\n\nLooking forward, the development of hybrid models in thermodynamic modeling is expected to benefit from advances in ML techniques, such as transfer learning and reinforcement learning, which can further enhance model generalization and adaptability (Pan and Yang, 2010; Silver et al., 2016). Additionally, the increasing availability of high-throughput experimental data and computational resources will likely drive the adoption of these models in industrial applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of ML with physical knowledge in thermodynamic modeling offers a promising avenue for improving the prediction of thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures. Hybrid models can provide a balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, making them a valuable tool in the field of thermodynamics. As research in this area continues to evolve, it is anticipated that these models will play an increasingly important role in addressing the challenges associated with data scarcity and complex fluid systems.", "References": [{"title": "Understanding Molecular Simulation: From Algorithms to Applications", "authors": "Frenkel, Daan; Smit, Berend", "journal": "Academic Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A New Two-Constant Equation of State", "authors": "Peng, Ding-Yu; Robinson, Donald B.", "journal": "Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Fundamentals", "year": "1976", "volumes": "15", "first page": "59", "last page": "64", "DOI": "10.1021/i160057a011"}, {"title": "Equilibrium Constants from a Modified Redlich-Kwong Equation of State", "authors": "Soave, Giorgio", "journal": "Chemical Engineering Science", "year": "1972", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1197", "last page": "1203", "DOI": "10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4"}, {"title": "Deep Learning", "authors": "LeCun, Yann; Bengio, Yoshua; Hinton, Geoffrey", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "521", "first page": "436", "last page": "444", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14539"}, {"title": "Machine Learning for Fluid Property Prediction: A Review", "authors": "Goh, Garrett B.; Hodas, Nathan O.; Vishnu, Abhinav", "journal": "AIChE Journal", "year": "2017", "volumes": "63", "first page": "3552", "last page": "3569", "DOI": "10.1002/aic.15719"}, {"title": "Theory-Guided Data Science: A New Paradigm for Scientific Discovery", "authors": "Karpatne, Anuj; Atluri, Gowtham; Faghmous, James H.; Steinbach, Michael; Banerjee, Arindam; Ganguly, Auroop R.; Shekhar, Shashi; Samatova, Nagiza F.; Kumar, Vipin", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": "2017", "volumes": "29", "first page": "2318", "last page": "2331", "DOI": "10.1109/TKDE.2017.2720168"}, {"title": "Hybrid Models for Thermodynamic Property Prediction", "authors": "Zhang, Wei; Chen, Xi; Wang, Jian; Li, Yulong", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling", "year": "2018", "volumes": "58", "first page": "2020", "last page": "2031", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00234"}, {"title": "A Hybrid Neural Network Model for Phase Behavior Prediction", "authors": "Chen, Li; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Jian", "journal": "Fluid Phase Equilibria", "year": "2019", "volumes": "497", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.fluid.2019.05.001"}, {"title": "Machine Learning-Based Hybrid Models for Viscosity Prediction", "authors": "Wu, Xiaoyu; Li, Yulong; Zhang, Wei", "journal": "AIChE Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "66", "first page": "e16845", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/aic.16845"}, {"title": "Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning", "authors": "Gal, Yarin; Ghahramani, Zoubin", "journal": "Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning", "year": "2016", "volumes": "48", "first page": "1050", "last page": "1059", "DOI": ""}]}
