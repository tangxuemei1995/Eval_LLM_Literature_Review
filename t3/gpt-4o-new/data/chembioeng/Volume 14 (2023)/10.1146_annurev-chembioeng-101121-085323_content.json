{"Literature Review": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a significant area of interest in green chemistry due to their potential as sustainable alternatives to conventional solvents. The concept of DESs was first introduced by Abbott et al. in 2003, who described them as eutectic mixtures formed by the complexation of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) [1]. This definition has since expanded, leading to some misconceptions about what constitutes a DES. A more precise definition, grounded in thermodynamic principles, is necessary to distinguish between simple eutectic mixtures and deep eutectic solvents. The original scope of DESs was limited to mixtures of Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases, but this has broadened to include a variety of precursors, such as quaternary ammonium salts, metal halides, and organic acids [2].\n\nThe sustainability of DESs is a critical factor in their evaluation as green solvents. While many DESs, particularly those based on choline chloride, are touted for their low toxicity and biodegradability, recent studies have raised concerns about their environmental impact. For instance, Smith et al. (2014) highlighted that the biodegradability of DESs is highly dependent on the nature of the HBD and HBA used [3]. Choline chloride-based DESs, although initially considered green, have been found to exhibit varying degrees of toxicity and biodegradability, challenging their status as environmentally benign solvents [4].\n\nThe stability of DESs is another area of concern. The thermal and chemical stability of these solvents is crucial for their application in various industrial processes. Research by Zhang et al. (2016) demonstrated that the stability of DESs is influenced by the strength of the hydrogen bonding interactions between the components [5]. Stronger interactions generally lead to more stable DESs, but they can also result in higher viscosities, which may limit their practical applications [6].\n\nDespite these challenges, DESs offer unique advantages, particularly their ability to dissolve a wide range of compounds. This property is attributed to the depression of the melting point of the mixture, which allows solid compounds to be liquefied and used as solvents. This feature has been exploited in various applications, including metal processing, pharmaceuticals, and biomass processing [7]. For example, DESs have been used to extract bioactive compounds from plant materials, offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional organic solvents [8].\n\nThe application of DESs in metal processing is particularly noteworthy. DESs have been used as electrolytes in metal electrodeposition, offering advantages such as low volatility, high conductivity, and the ability to dissolve metal salts that are insoluble in water [9]. This has significant implications for the development of more sustainable and efficient metal processing techniques.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, DESs have been explored as solvents for drug formulation and delivery. Their ability to dissolve poorly soluble drugs and enhance their bioavailability is a promising avenue for research [10]. However, the potential toxicity of DESs remains a concern, necessitating further studies to ensure their safety in pharmaceutical applications.\n\nIn conclusion, while DESs hold promise as green solvents, their development is hindered by misconceptions and challenges related to their sustainability, stability, and toxicity. A clearer definition of DESs, based on thermodynamic principles, is essential to advance their application. Further research is needed to address the environmental and safety concerns associated with DESs, particularly those based on choline chloride. Despite these challenges, the unique properties of DESs, such as their ability to liquefy solid compounds, offer exciting opportunities for their use in various industrial applications.", "References": [{"title": "Deep eutectic solvents formed between choline chloride and carboxylic acids: Versatile alternatives to ionic liquids", "authors": "Andrew P.
