{"Literature Review": "The transition to a net-zero emission economy is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires the integration of various energy sources and technologies. International Oil Companies (IOCs) have a pivotal role in this transition due to their extensive experience and capabilities in managing large-scale energy projects. Historically, IOCs have been central to the global energy supply, primarily through the exploration, extraction, and distribution of hydrocarbons. However, the pressing need to mitigate climate change has necessitated a shift towards sustainable energy solutions, where IOCs can leverage their expertise in engineering, project management, and global logistics to facilitate the transition to low- or zero-emission energy systems (IEA, 2021). \n\nOne of the key contributions of IOCs in the net-zero transition is their ability to scale up the production of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol. These carriers are crucial for overcoming the limitations of a fully electrified energy system, particularly in terms of energy density and storage capacity. Hydrogen, for instance, can be produced through various methods, including electrolysis using renewable energy or steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The latter method, often referred to as 'blue hydrogen,' is particularly relevant for IOCs given their existing infrastructure and expertise in natural gas processing (BNEF, 2020). \n\nAmmonia and methanol are also gaining attention as potential energy carriers due to their ability to store and transport energy efficiently. Ammonia, which can be synthesized using hydrogen and nitrogen, offers a high energy density and can be used directly as a fuel or as a hydrogen carrier. Methanol, on the other hand, can be produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, providing a pathway for carbon recycling and utilization (IRENA, 2021). IOCs are well-positioned to develop and optimize these production processes, given their experience in chemical engineering and large-scale industrial operations. \n\nThe integration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies is another area where IOCs can make significant contributions. CCS is essential for reducing emissions from existing fossil fuel-based energy systems and for enabling the production of low-carbon hydrogen and other synthetic fuels. IOCs have been involved in several CCS projects worldwide, demonstrating their capability to manage the technical and financial challenges associated with these technologies (Global CCS Institute, 2020). By investing in CCS, IOCs can help bridge the gap between current energy systems and future low-carbon alternatives. \n\nFurthermore, IOCs can play a crucial role in the development of infrastructure for the transport and storage of energy carriers. The global energy transition requires a robust and flexible infrastructure that can accommodate various energy sources and carriers. IOCs have the logistical expertise and financial resources to develop and manage such infrastructure, including pipelines, storage facilities, and shipping routes. This capability is particularly important for ensuring energy security and supply stability in a net-zero emission economy (BP, 2021). \n\nIn addition to their technical and logistical capabilities, IOCs have the financial strength to invest in research and development of new technologies and business models. By collaborating with governments, research institutions, and other stakeholders, IOCs can drive innovation in areas such as renewable energy integration, energy efficiency, and digitalization. These efforts can help reduce the cost of clean energy technologies and accelerate their deployment on a global scale (ExxonMobil, 2021). \n\nHowever, the transition to a net-zero emission economy also presents significant challenges for IOCs. The shift away from fossil fuels requires a fundamental transformation of their business models and investment strategies. IOCs must balance the need to maintain profitability with the imperative to reduce emissions and invest in sustainable energy solutions. This transition is further complicated by regulatory and policy uncertainties, as well as the need to manage stakeholder expectations and social license to operate (Shell, 2021). \n\nIn conclusion, IOCs have a critical role to play in the transition to a net-zero emission economy. Their expertise in large-scale energy production, infrastructure development, and financial investment positions them as key enablers of this transition. By leveraging their capabilities and resources, IOCs can help drive the development and deployment of low- or zero-emission energy carriers, CCS technologies, and supporting infrastructure. However, to succeed in this role, IOCs must navigate the challenges of transforming their business models and aligning their strategies with the goals of a sustainable energy future.", "References": [{"title": "World Energy Outlook 2021", "authors": "International Energy Agency", "journal": "IEA Publications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Hydrogen Economy Outlook", "authors": "Bloomberg New Energy Finance", "journal": "BNEF Publications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Innovation Outlook: Renewable Methanol", "authors": "International Renewable Energy Agency", "journal": "IRENA Publications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Global Status of CCS 2020", "authors": "Global CCS Institute", "journal": "GCCSI Publications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Statistical Review of World Energy 2021", "authors": "BP", "journal": "BP Publications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Energy & Carbon Summary 2021", "authors": "ExxonMobil", "journal": "ExxonMobil Publications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Energy Transition Strategy 2021", "authors": "Shell", "journal": "Shell Publications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Role of Hydrogen in the Energy Transition", "authors": "International Energy Agency", "journal": "IEA Publications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Ammonia as a Clean Energy Carrier", "authors": "International Renewable Energy Agency", "journal": "IRENA Publications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Carbon Capture and Storage: A Key to Climate Change Mitigation", "authors": "Global CCS Institute", "journal": "GCCSI Publications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
