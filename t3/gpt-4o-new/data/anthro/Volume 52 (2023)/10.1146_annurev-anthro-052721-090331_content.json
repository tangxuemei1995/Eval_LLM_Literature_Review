{"Literature Review": "Water is a fundamental component of human biology, influencing a wide array of physiological and psychological processes. The interdisciplinary nature of water's role in human life necessitates an integrative approach to understand its impact fully. This review explores the intersection of water needs, water insecurity (WI), and human biology, emphasizing the biocultural perspective and the embodiment framework. \n\nHuman water needs are primarily dictated by physiological requirements, which are influenced by factors such as age, sex, physical activity, and environmental conditions. Thirst is the primary mechanism that signals the need for water intake, and it is regulated by complex neurobiological pathways (Popkin et al., 2010). Hydration strategies, therefore, must consider these physiological signals alongside cultural practices and environmental availability. For instance, in many cultures, the consumption of water is not only a response to thirst but also a social activity, which can influence hydration status (Stookey et al., 2011). \n\nWater insecurity, defined as the lack of reliable access to sufficient and safe water, is a growing concern globally. It is estimated that over two billion people experience water insecurity, which can have profound effects on human biology (Jepson et al., 2017). The embodiment framework provides a useful lens to understand how WI affects human biology. This framework posits that social and environmental stressors, such as WI, are internalized and manifest in physiological and psychological outcomes (Krieger, 2005). \n\nThe physiological impacts of WI are diverse and significant. Dehydration, a direct consequence of inadequate water intake, can lead to cellular damage and impaired organ function. Chronic dehydration has been linked to increased risk of kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and chronic kidney disease (Clark et al., 2016). Moreover, dehydration can exacerbate the effects of other health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, by impairing the body's ability to regulate blood glucose and blood pressure (Popkin et al., 2010). \n\nPsychologically, WI is associated with increased stress and anxiety, which can further impact physical health. The stress of not knowing when or where the next source of water will come from can lead to chronic stress responses, which are known to affect mental health and cognitive function (Stevenson et al., 2012). Cognitive impairment due to dehydration is well-documented, with studies showing that even mild dehydration can affect attention, memory, and mood (Pross et al., 2014). \n\nCoping strategies for WI vary widely and are influenced by cultural, economic, and environmental factors. In some communities, individuals may resort to rationing water, prioritizing certain uses over others, or seeking alternative water sources, which may not always be safe (Jepson et al., 2017). These strategies can have further implications for health, as the use of contaminated water sources can lead to waterborne diseases, while rationing can exacerbate dehydration and its associated health risks. \n\nClimate change is an additional factor that complicates the relationship between water needs, WI, and human biology. Changes in precipitation patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and rising temperatures all contribute to the growing challenge of ensuring adequate water supply (Bates et al., 2008). These environmental changes can alter water availability and quality, further exacerbating WI and its health impacts. \n\nThe embodiment of water-related stressors is evident in the aging process and cardiometabolic health. Chronic exposure to WI and the associated stress can accelerate biological aging, as evidenced by markers such as telomere length (Needham et al., 2013). Additionally, the stress and physiological strain of coping with WI can contribute to the development of cardiometabolic conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Stookey et al., 2011). \n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of water needs, WI, and human biology is complex and multifaceted. An integrative approach that considers the biocultural and environmental contexts is essential to fully understand and address the health implications of water insecurity. As climate change continues to impact water availability, it is crucial to develop adaptive strategies that ensure equitable access to safe and sufficient water, thereby mitigating the adverse health effects associated with WI.", "References": [{"title": "Water, hydration, and health", "authors": "Barry M.
