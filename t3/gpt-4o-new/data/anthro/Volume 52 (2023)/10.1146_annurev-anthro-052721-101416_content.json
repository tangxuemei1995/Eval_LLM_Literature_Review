{"Literature Review": "The study of religious conversion as a political phenomenon has gained significant traction within anthropological scholarship, reflecting a broader interest in understanding the intersections between religion and politics. This literature review explores the dual notion of 'making a difference' in the context of religious conversion, examining how anthropologists have both influenced the discourse on conversion and investigated the impact of religious change on political and social structures. \n\nHistorically, religious conversion has been viewed primarily as a personal or spiritual transformation. However, recent anthropological studies have shifted focus to consider conversion as a political act, one that can influence and be influenced by broader socio-political contexts. This shift is evident in the work of Robbins (2004), who argues that conversion can serve as a form of resistance or adaptation to colonial and post-colonial power dynamics. By framing conversion as a political act, anthropologists have highlighted the agency of converts in negotiating their identities and social positions within complex power structures.\n\nThe political implications of religious conversion are further explored in the work of Asad (1993), who examines how conversion narratives are often shaped by colonial and missionary agendas. Asad's analysis reveals how conversion can be used as a tool for both domination and liberation, depending on the context and the actors involved. This dual potential of conversion underscores the importance of understanding the political dimensions of religious change.\n\nAnother significant contribution to this field is the work of van der Veer (1996), who explores the role of conversion in the construction of national and communal identities. Van der Veer argues that conversion can serve as a means of asserting or contesting political authority, as seen in the case of Hindu-Muslim conversions in India. This perspective highlights the complex interplay between religious and political identities, and the ways in which conversion can be used to negotiate these identities in times of political crisis.\n\nThe notion of 'making a difference' is also evident in the work of Meyer (1999), who examines the impact of Pentecostal conversion on social and political life in Ghana. Meyer argues that conversion to Pentecostalism can lead to significant changes in social norms and political engagement, as converts adopt new moral and ethical frameworks. This transformation can have profound implications for political participation and governance, as new religious movements challenge existing power structures and advocate for social change.\n\nIn addition to these case studies, anthropologists have also developed theoretical frameworks to understand the political dimensions of religious conversion. For example, the concept of 'political conversion' has been proposed as a way to analyze the ways in which religious change can lead to shifts in political allegiance and ideology. This concept is explored in the work of Harding (2000), who examines the role of conversion in the rise of the Christian Right in the United States. Harding argues that conversion can serve as a catalyst for political mobilization, as individuals and communities adopt new religious and political identities.\n\nThe relationship between religious conversion and political crises is another area of interest for anthropologists. The work of Comaroff and Comaroff (1991) highlights how conversion can be both a response to and a catalyst for political upheaval. In their study of South Africa, the Comaroffs demonstrate how conversion to Christianity provided a means of coping with the social and political disruptions of colonialism, while also serving as a platform for political resistance and reform.\n\nDespite the growing interest in the political dimensions of religious conversion, there remain significant gaps in the literature. Future research could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which conversion intersects with other forms of political and social change. For example, the links between religious conversion and economic transformation, migration, and globalization are areas that warrant further exploration. Additionally, more attention could be paid to the experiences of converts themselves, particularly in terms of how they navigate the complex interplay between religious and political identities.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of religious conversion as a political phenomenon offers valuable insights into the ways in which religious change can influence and be influenced by broader socio-political contexts. By framing conversion as a political act, anthropologists have made significant contributions to the discourse on religious change, highlighting the agency of converts and the complex interplay between religion and politics. As this field of inquiry continues to evolve, it will be important to consider the diverse and dynamic ways in which religious conversion can 'make a difference' in the lives of individuals, communities, and polities.", "References": [{"title": "The Anthropology of Christianity", "authors": "Joel Robbins", "journal": "Religion", "year": "2004", "volumes": "34", "first page": "191", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1016/j.religion.2004.01.001"}, {"title": "Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power in Christianity and Islam", "authors": "Talal Asad", "journal": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "year": "1993", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Conversion to Modernities: The Globalization of Christianity", "authors": "Peter van der Veer", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "1996", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Translating the Devil: Religion and Modernity Among the Ewe in Ghana", "authors": "Birgit Meyer", "journal": "Edinburgh University Press", "year": "1999", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics", "authors": "Susan Friend Harding", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Of Revelation and Revolution: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa", "authors": "Jean Comaroff, John L.
