{"Literature Review": "The study of men and masculinities within anthropology has undergone significant transformation since the turn of the millennium, reflecting broader shifts in gender studies and the social sciences. This literature review examines the evolution of these studies, highlighting key theoretical frameworks, ethnographic contributions, and interdisciplinary dialogues that have shaped the field. The focus on men and masculinities has expanded beyond traditional Western-centric perspectives, incorporating diverse voices and experiences from the Global South, thereby enriching the discourse with varied cultural contexts and insights. \n\nHistorically, the anthropology of masculinity was overshadowed by a predominant focus on women and femininity, as scholars sought to address gender imbalances in research (Connell, 2005). However, the recognition that masculinity itself is a socially constructed and variable category has led to a burgeoning interest in its study. This shift is evident in the increasing number of ethnographic studies that explore the lived experiences of men across different societies, examining how masculinity is constructed, performed, and contested (Gutmann, 1996). \n\nOne significant area of research has been the intersection of masculinity and militarism. Studies have shown how military institutions often serve as sites for the production and reinforcement of hegemonic masculinities, which valorize aggression, stoicism, and dominance (Enloe, 2000). These studies have been crucial in understanding how militarized masculinities contribute to broader societal norms and power structures, influencing everything from national identity to domestic violence (Higate, 2003). \n\nIn the realm of public health, anthropologists have explored how masculinities impact health behaviors and outcomes. Research has highlighted how traditional masculine norms can discourage men from seeking medical help or engaging in preventive health measures, thereby exacerbating health disparities (Courtenay, 2000). This has led to calls for more gender-sensitive health interventions that challenge harmful masculine norms and promote healthier behaviors among men. \n\nGender inequalities remain a central concern in the study of masculinities. Anthropologists have examined how men navigate and perpetuate gender hierarchies, often in ways that are contextually specific and culturally nuanced (Kimmel, 2008). This includes exploring how men respond to changing gender roles and expectations, particularly in societies undergoing rapid social and economic transformations. Such studies have been instrumental in revealing the complexities of gender relations and the ways in which men can both resist and reinforce patriarchal structures. \n\nThe rise of trans* social movements has also prompted a reevaluation of traditional notions of masculinity. Anthropologists have been at the forefront of documenting the experiences of trans* individuals, challenging binary understandings of gender and highlighting the fluidity and diversity of gender identities (Valentine, 2007). This work has been critical in expanding the scope of masculinity studies to include non-binary and gender non-conforming perspectives, thereby enriching the field with new theoretical and methodological approaches. \n\nInnovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology has further contributed to the study of masculinities. Biological anthropologists have explored the evolutionary and physiological aspects of masculinity, examining how biological factors interact with cultural norms to shape male behaviors and identities (Gilmore, 1990). Linguistic anthropologists, on the other hand, have analyzed how language and discourse construct and reflect masculinities, revealing the power of language in shaping gendered identities and relations (Cameron, 1997). \n\nArchaeology has also played a role in the study of masculinities, offering insights into the historical and material dimensions of gender. Archaeological studies have uncovered evidence of diverse gender roles and relations in past societies, challenging contemporary assumptions about the universality of certain masculine traits and behaviors (Joyce, 2008). \n\nOverall, the anthropology of masculinity has moved towards a more inclusive and intersectional approach, recognizing the importance of examining gender, sex, and sexuality in non-binary frameworks. This shift reflects broader trends in gender studies, which increasingly emphasize the fluidity and multiplicity of gender identities and experiences. As anthropologists continue to explore these themes, they contribute to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of masculinity and its implications for individuals and societies. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of men and masculinities in anthropology has evolved significantly over the past two decades, driven by a growing recognition of the complexity and diversity of masculine identities and experiences. By incorporating insights from the Global South and engaging with interdisciplinary dialogues, anthropologists have enriched the field with new perspectives and approaches. As the study of masculinities continues to develop, it promises to offer valuable insights into the dynamics of gender, power, and identity in a rapidly changing world.", "References": [{"title": "Masculinities", "authors": "R.
