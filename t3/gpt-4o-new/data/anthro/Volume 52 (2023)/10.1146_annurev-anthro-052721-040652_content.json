{"Literature Review": "The discourse surrounding the decolonization of museums has gained significant traction in recent decades, driven by a critical reassessment of how museums represent and engage with Indigenous cultures. This literature review explores the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, with a particular focus on Native North American heritage, while also drawing comparisons to international movements. The decolonization of museums is rooted in a broader critique of ethnographic museums that emerged prominently in the 1990s. Scholars such as Clifford (1997) have argued that ethnographic museums have historically perpetuated colonial narratives by presenting Indigenous cultures as static and exotic 'others' (Clifford, 1997). This critique was further amplified by the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, which mandated the return of human remains and cultural items to Native American tribes. NAGPRA has been a pivotal moment in the decolonization of museums, as it legally recognized the rights of Native American communities to their cultural heritage and prompted museums to reevaluate their collections and practices (Fine-Dare, 2002). The act has also spurred a broader conversation about the ethical responsibilities of museums in the stewardship of Indigenous artifacts. The representation of Native American cultures in museums has been a central concern in the literature on decolonization. Scholars have critiqued the ways in which Native American cultures have been depicted in public displays, often through a colonial lens that emphasizes their 'otherness' and historical marginalization (Lonetree, 2012). This has led to calls for more inclusive and accurate representations that reflect the diversity and agency of Native American communities. The involvement of Native American communities in the care and interpretation of collections has been a significant development in this regard. Collaborative projects between museums and Native American tribes have emerged as a model for decolonizing museum practices. These collaborations often involve co-curation, where Native American representatives work alongside museum staff to develop exhibitions and educational programs that reflect Indigenous perspectives and knowledge systems (Peers and Brown, 2003). Such partnerships have been instrumental in challenging traditional power dynamics and fostering mutual respect and understanding. The rise of tribal museums has also been a critical component of the decolonization movement. Tribal museums, which are often managed and operated by Native American communities, provide a platform for Indigenous voices and narratives that are often absent in mainstream museums. These institutions not only serve as cultural repositories but also as spaces for cultural revitalization and education (Kreps, 2003). Tribal museums have been at the forefront of efforts to indigenize museum practices, offering alternative models that prioritize community engagement and cultural sovereignty. The decolonization of museums is part of a broader paradigm shift in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums. This shift is characterized by a move away from viewing museums as neutral spaces of knowledge production to recognizing them as sites of power and contestation. Scholars such as Smith (2012) have argued for a more reflexive and critical approach to museum anthropology that acknowledges the colonial legacies of these institutions and seeks to address them through decolonizing methodologies (Smith, 2012). This involves not only rethinking the ways in which museums engage with Indigenous communities but also reimagining the role of museums in society. In conclusion, the decolonization of museums represents a significant shift in the field of museum studies and practice. It challenges traditional narratives and power structures, advocating for more inclusive and equitable approaches to the representation and stewardship of Indigenous cultures. The literature on this topic highlights the importance of collaboration, community engagement, and the recognition of Indigenous knowledge systems in the ongoing efforts to decolonize museums. As the movement continues to evolve, it offers valuable insights into the potential for museums to serve as spaces of reconciliation and cultural empowerment.", "References": [{"title": "Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century", "authors": "James Clifford", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "1997", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Grave Injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA", "authors": "G.
