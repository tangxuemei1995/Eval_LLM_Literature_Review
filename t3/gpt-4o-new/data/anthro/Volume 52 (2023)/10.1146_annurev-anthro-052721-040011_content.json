{"Literature Review": "Critical University Studies (CUS) is an emergent interdisciplinary field that critically examines the structures and functions of higher education institutions, particularly in relation to their historical and ongoing entanglements with national and global political movements. This field draws on a variety of scholarly traditions, including history, sociology, anthropology, and critical race theory, to interrogate how universities have been complicit in perpetuating systems of oppression, such as colonialism, racism, and capitalism. A significant body of work within CUS traces the origins of the American university system to the transatlantic slave trade, racial science, and the displacement and genocide of Native American peoples. For instance, Wilder (2013) provides a comprehensive historical account of how American universities were built on the profits of slavery and how they contributed to the development of racial science that justified racial hierarchies. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how contemporary universities continue to perpetuate racial and colonial logics. \n\nThe work of scholars such as Patel (2015) and Stein (2019) further explores how universities are implicated in global systems of power and inequality. Patel argues that universities are not merely passive sites of knowledge production but active participants in the maintenance of state interests and neoliberal economic policies. Stein expands on this by examining how universities have become sites of 'knowledge capitalism,' where the commodification of education and research serves to reinforce global inequalities. These analyses highlight the need for a critical examination of the role of higher education in perpetuating systems of oppression and the potential for universities to serve as sites of resistance and transformation. \n\nAbolitionist and decolonial perspectives within CUS offer important frameworks for reimagining the role of the university. Abolitionist scholars, such as Gilmore (2007), argue for the dismantling of carceral logics within higher education, which manifest in practices such as campus policing and the surveillance of marginalized students. Decolonial scholars, including Tuck and Yang (2012), call for a fundamental rethinking of the university's relationship to Indigenous peoples and lands, advocating for the return of land and resources as a form of reparative justice. These perspectives challenge the university to move beyond superficial diversity initiatives and engage in meaningful structural change. \n\nThe intersection of CUS with anthropology provides a unique lens for examining the discipline's complicity in colonial and imperial projects. As noted by Harrison (1997), anthropology has historically been implicated in the construction of racial and cultural hierarchies, often serving as a tool of empire. Recent work by scholars such as Jobson (2020) and TallBear (2013) calls for an antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology that critically examines its own practices and assumptions. This involves not only diversifying the field but also challenging the epistemological foundations that have privileged Western/white ways of knowing. \n\nThe emerging field of abolitionist anthropology offers promising interventions for addressing these challenges. Abolitionist anthropology seeks to dismantle the structures of oppression within the discipline and the academy more broadly, drawing on the principles of abolitionist movements that seek to end systems of incarceration and punishment. This involves rethinking the role of the anthropologist as an activist-scholar who is committed to social justice and the liberation of marginalized communities. \n\nIn conclusion, Critical University Studies provides a vital framework for understanding the complex and often contradictory role of higher education in contemporary society. By drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives and engaging with abolitionist and decolonial frameworks, CUS offers a powerful critique of the university as a site of both oppression and potential liberation. As the field continues to evolve, it will be important for scholars to remain attentive to the ways in which universities are implicated in broader systems of power and to explore new possibilities for transformative change.", "References": [{"title": "Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled History of America's Universities", "authors": "Craig Steven Wilder", "journal": "Bloomsbury Press", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Decolonizing Educational Research: From Ownership to Answerability", "authors": "L.
