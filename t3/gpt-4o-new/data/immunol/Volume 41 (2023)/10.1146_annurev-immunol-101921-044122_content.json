{"Literature Review": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to treat various malignancies by harnessing the body's immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells. Among the immune cells, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells play pivotal roles in tumor immunity. T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are known for their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells in an antigen-specific manner. NK cells, on the other hand, provide a rapid response to tumor cells through recognition of stress-induced ligands and the absence of self-MHC molecules. The complementary roles of T cells and NK cells in tumor immunity suggest that dual engagement of these cell types could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies (Vivier et al., 2012). \n\nRecent studies have highlighted the synergistic interactions between T cells and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment. NK cells have been shown to recruit dendritic cells (DCs) to tumors, which in turn enhance the induction of CD8+ T cell responses (Böttcher et al., 2018). This recruitment is crucial as DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells that can prime and activate T cells, thereby amplifying the anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, T cells secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine that activates NK cells, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that enhances the cytotoxic activity of both cell types (Waldmann, 2006). \n\nTargeting immune evasion mechanisms is a critical aspect of designing effective cancer immunotherapies. The NKG2D receptor on NK cells and its ligands, MICA and MICB, on tumor cells represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Tumors often downregulate these ligands to escape NK cell-mediated lysis. Strategies to upregulate MICA and MICB expression or block their shedding from the tumor cell surface have been explored to enhance NK cell activity (Groh et al., 2002). \n\nInterestingly, T cells and NK cells share several inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance their anti-tumor functions. The CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E receptor-ligand systems are examples of such shared pathways. Inhibiting these pathways can release the brakes on T cell and NK cell activity, thereby enhancing their ability to eliminate cancer cells (André et al., 2018). For instance, blocking the interaction between TIGIT and CD155 has been shown to enhance both T cell and NK cell responses against tumors (Johnston et al., 2014). \n\nEmerging therapeutic strategies also focus on modulating the cytokine milieu within tumors to impact the function of T cells and NK cells. Cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-21 have been investigated for their ability to enhance the proliferation and cytotoxicity of NK cells and T cells (Waldmann, 2006). Additionally, the use of checkpoint inhibitors that target inhibitory cytokines, such as TGF-β, can further potentiate the anti-tumor activity of these lymphocytes (Flavell et al., 2010). \n\nIn conclusion, the dual engagement of T cells and NK cells in cancer immunotherapy offers a promising strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity. By targeting shared inhibitory and activating receptors, modulating cytokine environments, and overcoming immune evasion mechanisms, it is possible to design more effective immunotherapies. Future research should focus on understanding the complex interactions between these immune cells and the tumor microenvironment to develop novel therapeutic approaches that can improve patient outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Innate or adaptive immunity?
