{"Literature Review": "The aging process is accompanied by significant changes in the immune system, a phenomenon often referred to as immunosenescence. One of the most affected components of the immune system during aging is the T cell compartment, which undergoes dramatic remodeling. This review focuses on the extremely differentiated T cell subsets that accumulate during aging and their contribution to tissue deterioration and inflammaging. \n\nAging is associated with a reduction in the naive T cell pool and an accumulation of memory-like T cells. Naive T cells are crucial for responding to new antigens, and their reduction is linked to thymic involution, which decreases the output of new T cells (Palmer, 2013). The accumulation of memory-like T cells, on the other hand, is characterized by a shift towards a more differentiated state, often acquiring a phenotype of terminally differentiated cells. These cells lose the expression of costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, and acquire properties of senescent cells, including resistance to apoptosis and altered cytokine production (Effros, 2004). \n\nOne subset of age-associated T cells that has been extensively studied is the extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer (NK) properties. These cells, often referred to as CD8+CD28- T cells, exhibit increased cytotoxicity and are capable of producing high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α (Strindhall et al., 2013). The accumulation of these cells in nonlymphoid tissues is thought to contribute to tissue damage and chronic inflammation, a hallmark of aging known as inflammaging (Franceschi et al., 2000). \n\nAnother important subset of T cells that accumulate during aging is the exhausted T cells. These cells are characterized by the expression of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, and exhibit altered cytokine production and reduced proliferative capacity (Wherry, 2011). Exhausted T cells are often found in chronic infections and cancer, but their presence in the elderly suggests a role in age-related immune dysfunction. The altered cytokine production by these cells can contribute to a proinflammatory environment, further exacerbating tissue deterioration (Pereira et al., 2020). \n\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs) are another subset that undergoes changes during aging. While Tregs are generally associated with maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, age-associated Tregs have been shown to gain proinflammatory features (Sharma et al., 2006). This shift in function may be due to changes in the cytokine milieu or intrinsic alterations in the Tregs themselves. The proinflammatory nature of these Tregs can contribute to the chronic low-grade inflammation observed in the elderly, further promoting tissue damage and dysfunction (Gregg et al., 2005). \n\nA common feature of these age-associated T cell subsets is their loss of lymph node homing capacity. This is often due to the downregulation of homing receptors, such as CCR7 and CD62L, which are essential for T cell migration to lymphoid tissues (Goronzy et al., 2007). Instead, these cells preferentially migrate to nonlymphoid tissues, where they can exert their cytotoxic and proinflammatory effects. The accumulation of these cells in tissues such as the skin, liver, and lungs is associated with increased tissue damage and the development of age-related diseases (Akbar and Henson, 2011). \n\nIn conclusion, the remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging leads to the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets that contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging. These subsets, including cytotoxic T cells with NK properties, exhausted T cells, and proinflammatory Tregs, lose their lymph node homing capacity and preferentially migrate to nonlymphoid tissues. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes and their impact on tissue homeostasis is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate age-related immune dysfunction and improve healthspan in the elderly.", "References": [{"title": "Thymic involution and immune reconstitution", "authors": "Palmer, D.
