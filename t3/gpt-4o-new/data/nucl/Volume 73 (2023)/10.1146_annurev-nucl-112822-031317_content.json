{"Literature Review": "The study of medium response and jet–hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions has become a focal point in understanding the properties of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP). The QGP is a state of matter believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang, where quarks and gluons are not confined within hadrons. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have provided a platform for recreating and studying this exotic state of matter under controlled conditions. One of the most significant phenomena observed in these collisions is jet quenching, which refers to the energy loss of high-energy partons as they traverse the QGP. This energy loss is a direct consequence of the interaction between the jet and the medium, providing insights into the transport properties of the QGP (Gyulassy and Wang, 1994). \n\nJet quenching is characterized by the suppression of high transverse momentum (pT) hadrons and jets in heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton collisions. This suppression is quantified by the nuclear modification factor, R_AA, which is significantly less than unity in central heavy-ion collisions (Adams et al., 2005). Theoretical models have been developed to describe the energy loss mechanisms, including radiative and collisional energy loss. Radiative energy loss, where the parton loses energy by emitting gluons, is considered the dominant mechanism at high energies (Baier et al., 1997). Collisional energy loss, on the other hand, involves interactions with the medium constituents and becomes significant at lower energies (Thoma and Gyulassy, 1991). \n\nApart from the direct energy loss, the interaction of jets with the QGP also leads to medium excitation, which manifests as a redistribution of energy and momentum in the medium. This medium response is crucial for understanding the soft components of jets and has been studied using both weakly and strongly coupled approaches. In the weakly coupled approach, perturbative QCD techniques are employed to describe the interactions between the jet and the medium (Arnold et al., 2003). In contrast, the strongly coupled approach utilizes the AdS/CFT correspondence, which provides a dual description of strongly coupled gauge theories in terms of classical gravity in higher dimensions (Gubser, 2006). These approaches offer complementary insights into the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets. \n\nThe medium response to jet energy loss has significant implications for jet observables. For instance, the redistribution of energy can lead to modifications in the jet shape and fragmentation functions, which are sensitive to the details of the jet-medium interaction (Chatrchyan et al., 2013). Moreover, the medium response can give rise to unique signatures in jet–hadron correlations, such as the broadening of the away-side peak and the enhancement of low-pT hadrons (Aad et al., 2010). These signatures provide valuable information about the in-medium dynamics of jets and the properties of the QGP. \n\nRecent experimental and theoretical efforts have focused on isolating the medium response from the direct jet energy loss. Techniques such as event shape engineering and jet grooming have been employed to enhance the sensitivity to medium-induced modifications (Acharya et al., 2019). Additionally, the development of sophisticated jet reconstruction algorithms has enabled the study of jet substructure, providing further insights into the medium response (Sirunyan et al., 2018). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of medium response and jet–hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the QGP. The interplay between jet quenching and medium excitation offers a unique opportunity to probe the transport properties of the QGP and the dynamics of jet-medium interactions. Continued experimental and theoretical efforts are necessary to disentangle the complex interplay between jets and the medium, paving the way for a precise extraction of the QGP properties.", "References": [{"title": "Jet quenching in dense matter", "authors": "Gyulassy, M., Wang, X.-N.", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1994", "volumes": "420", "first page": "583", "last page": "614", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(94)90079-5"}, {"title": "Experimental and theoretical challenges in the search for the quark–gluon plasma: The STAR Collaboration's critical assessment of the evidence from RHIC collisions", "authors": "Adams, J., Aggarwal, M.
