{"Literature Review": "The study of lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in b and c decays has become a focal point in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, while successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, does not account for certain observed anomalies, particularly in the flavor sector. The exploration of LFV and LFUV in heavy meson decays, such as those involving b and c quarks, provides a promising avenue for uncovering new physics. \n\nLepton flavor universality (LFU) is a principle in the SM that posits that the interactions of the three lepton families (electron, muon, and tau) with gauge bosons are identical, except for differences due to their masses. However, recent experimental results have suggested potential violations of LFU, particularly in the decays of B mesons. For instance, the LHCb collaboration has reported anomalies in the ratios of branching fractions of B meson decays to different lepton flavors, such as the R_K and R_K* ratios, which compare the rates of B → Kμ+μ− to B → Ke+e− decays (Aaij et al., 2014). These measurements have consistently shown deviations from the SM predictions, hinting at possible LFUV. \n\nTheoretical models attempting to explain these anomalies often introduce new particles or interactions that preferentially couple to certain lepton flavors. For example, leptoquarks or Z' bosons are popular candidates that could mediate such flavor-specific interactions (Hiller and Schmaltz, 2014). These models not only provide a framework for understanding LFUV but also predict correlated effects in LFV processes, which are strictly forbidden in the SM. Thus, the observation of LFV would be a clear signal of new physics. \n\nExperimental searches for LFV in b and c decays have been conducted at various facilities, including the LHCb, Belle, and BaBar experiments. These searches focus on rare decay modes such as B → Kμe or D → μe, which would indicate LFV if observed. Although no significant LFV signals have been detected so far, the sensitivity of these experiments continues to improve, offering hope for future discoveries (Lees et al., 2012). \n\nThe connection between LFUV and LFV is further supported by theoretical considerations. In many BSM scenarios, the same new physics that causes LFUV can also lead to LFV. For instance, models with additional Higgs doublets or supersymmetry can naturally accommodate both phenomena (Crivellin et al., 2015). The observed size of LFUV effects in B decays suggests that LFV processes might occur at rates accessible to current or near-future experiments. \n\nMoreover, the study of LFUV and LFV in c decays, although less explored than b decays, offers complementary insights. The charm sector provides a unique testing ground for BSM physics due to its distinct flavor dynamics and the potential for interference effects between different decay amplitudes (Fajfer et al., 2012). Recent measurements of D meson decays have also hinted at possible LFUV, motivating further investigation in this area. \n\nThe experimental landscape for studying LFUV and LFV is rapidly evolving. The LHCb experiment, with its recent upgrades, is poised to provide more precise measurements of B and D meson decays. Similarly, the Belle II experiment, with its high luminosity, is expected to significantly enhance the sensitivity to rare decay processes (Kou et al., 2019). These advancements, combined with theoretical developments, make the study of LFUV and LFV a vibrant and promising field. \n\nIn conclusion, the investigation of LFUV and LFV in b and c decays is at the forefront of the search for new physics. The observed anomalies in LFU tests, coupled with the theoretical link to LFV, suggest that we may be on the verge of discovering phenomena that challenge the SM. With ongoing and upcoming experimental efforts, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries in this area is substantial.", "References": [{"title": "Test of lepton universality using B+ → K+ℓ+ℓ− decays", "authors": "R.
