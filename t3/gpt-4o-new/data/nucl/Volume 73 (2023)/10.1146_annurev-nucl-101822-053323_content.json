{"Literature Review": "The study of boson-boson interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is pivotal for understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, which involve the self-couplings of vector bosons and their interactions with the Higgs boson, provide a unique window into the dynamics of EWSB. The LHC, particularly in its high-luminosity phase (HL-LHC), offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe these interactions at high energies, potentially revealing deviations from SM predictions that could indicate new physics (NP) beyond the current theoretical framework.\n\nThe SM predicts that the Higgs boson is responsible for EWSB, giving mass to the W and Z bosons through the Higgs mechanism. However, if the Higgs mechanism is not the sole contributor to EWSB, deviations in the scattering amplitudes of vector bosons at high energies could occur. These deviations might be detectable even if the NP scale is beyond the direct reach of the LHC. Theoretical studies have suggested that such deviations could manifest as anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) or through the presence of new resonances (Barger et al., 1990; Eboli et al., 2000).\n\nExperimental efforts at the LHC have focused on measuring the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets, a signature of VBS processes. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported several measurements of these processes, providing critical tests of the SM predictions. For instance, the ATLAS collaboration has measured the production of W±W±, WZ, and ZZ pairs in association with two jets, observing results consistent with SM expectations but with room for potential NP contributions (Aad et al., 2020). Similarly, the CMS collaboration has conducted analyses of VBS processes, focusing on the same-sign WW and WZ channels, and has reported results that align with the SM but also highlight the sensitivity to AQGCs (Sirunyan et al., 2019).\n\nTheoretical models that extend the SM, such as those involving extra dimensions or composite Higgs scenarios, predict modifications to VBS processes. These models often introduce new particles or interactions that could alter the VBS cross sections or kinematic distributions. For example, models with extra dimensions predict the existence of Kaluza-Klein excitations that could enhance VBS rates (Randall and Sundrum, 1999). Composite Higgs models suggest the presence of new resonances that could be observed as deviations in the invariant mass distributions of vector boson pairs (Contino et al., 2011).\n\nThe HL-LHC, with its increased luminosity, will significantly enhance the sensitivity to VBS processes and potential NP effects. The larger data samples will allow for more precise measurements of VBS cross sections and the exploration of higher energy regimes where deviations from the SM might become apparent. Prospects for the HL-LHC include improved measurements of AQGCs and the potential discovery of new resonances or other NP signatures (Cepeda et al., 2019).\n\nIn addition to direct measurements, the study of VBS processes at the LHC also involves sophisticated theoretical and computational tools. Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating both SM and NP scenarios, are essential for interpreting experimental data and for making precise predictions of VBS cross sections and kinematic distributions (Alwall et al., 2014). These simulations are crucial for understanding the backgrounds and for optimizing the selection criteria used in experimental analyses.\n\nOverall, the study of boson-boson interactions at the LHC is a vibrant area of research with significant implications for our understanding of fundamental physics. The combination of experimental measurements and theoretical developments is poised to provide critical insights into the nature of EWSB and the potential existence of NP. As the LHC continues to collect data, and with the advent of the HL-LHC, the prospects for discovering new phenomena in VBS processes remain promising.", "References": [{"title": "Anomalous quartic gauge couplings in e+e− collisions", "authors": "Barger, V., Cheung, K., Han, T., Phillips, R.
