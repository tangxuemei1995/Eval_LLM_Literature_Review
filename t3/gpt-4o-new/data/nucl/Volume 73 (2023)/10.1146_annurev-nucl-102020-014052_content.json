{"Literature Review": "The study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the large-Nc limit, where Nc represents the number of colors, has been a significant area of research in theoretical physics. This approach provides a systematic framework for understanding the behavior of strong interactions, particularly in the context of nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. The large-Nc limit simplifies the complex dynamics of QCD by allowing for a perturbative expansion in 1/Nc, which can yield insights into the ordering of interactions based on their scaling with Nc. This method has been instrumental in elucidating the structure of two-nucleon interactions and has potential applications in contexts where empirical data is scarce.\n\nThe concept of large-Nc QCD was first introduced by 't Hooft, who proposed that as Nc becomes large, the theory simplifies, and certain non-perturbative aspects become tractable (t Hooft, 1974). In this limit, the meson sector becomes dominant, and baryons can be treated as solitons, leading to a semi-classical picture of baryons as Skyrmions (Witten, 1979). This framework has been extended to study the NN interaction, where the leading-order contributions scale as Nc, and subleading contributions scale as 1/Nc (Kaplan & Manohar, 1996).\n\nThe large-Nc approach has been applied to effective field theories (EFTs) to systematically organize the hierarchy of interactions. In the context of NN interactions, the leading-order terms correspond to central forces, while spin-orbit and tensor forces appear at subleading orders (Kaplan, Savage, & Wise, 1998). This ordering is consistent with empirical observations, where central forces dominate the NN potential, and spin-dependent forces provide corrections. The large-Nc expansion thus provides a natural explanation for the observed hierarchy of forces in nuclear physics.\n\nHowever, the application of large-Nc QCD to NN interactions is not without challenges. One significant issue is the potential for misinterpretation due to the subtleties involved in the scaling of different operators. For instance, certain operators that appear to be suppressed in the large-Nc limit may still have significant contributions due to their coupling to other degrees of freedom (Cohen, 2002). Additionally, the large-Nc expansion assumes that Nc is large but finite, which may not always be a valid approximation for Nc = 3, the physical case.\n\nBeyond the two-nucleon sector, large-Nc QCD has implications for few-nucleon interactions, including three-nucleon forces. These forces are crucial for understanding the structure of light nuclei and nuclear matter. In the large-Nc limit, three-nucleon forces are expected to be suppressed relative to two-nucleon forces, scaling as 1/Nc^2 (Phillips & Cohen, 2003). This suppression is consistent with the empirical observation that three-nucleon forces are weaker than two-nucleon forces but still play a significant role in nuclear structure.\n\nThe large-Nc framework also provides insights into weak and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions. In particular, it offers a systematic way to organize the contributions of weak interactions to nuclear processes, such as beta decay and neutrino-nucleus scattering (Savage, 2001). The large-Nc expansion can also be used to explore the effects of BSM physics on nuclear interactions, providing a bridge between nuclear physics and high-energy physics.\n\nAnother area of interest is the application of large-Nc QCD to two-nucleon external currents, which are relevant for understanding electromagnetic and weak interactions in nuclei. These currents can be systematically organized in the large-Nc framework, allowing for a consistent treatment of their contributions to nuclear processes (Meissner, 2004). This approach has been used to study the role of two-body currents in processes such as electron scattering and neutrino interactions with nuclei.\n\nDespite the successes of the large-Nc approach, several open questions remain. One key issue is the convergence of the large-Nc expansion and its applicability to real-world systems with Nc = 3. Additionally, the role of non-perturbative effects, such as chiral symmetry breaking and confinement, in the large-Nc limit is not fully understood. Further research is needed to address these questions and to explore the full potential of the large-Nc framework in nuclear physics.\n\nIn conclusion, the large-Nc approach to QCD provides a powerful tool for understanding the hierarchy of interactions in nuclear physics. It offers a systematic framework for organizing NN interactions and has potential applications in few-nucleon systems, weak interactions, and BSM physics. However, careful consideration of the limitations and potential pitfalls of the large-Nc expansion is necessary to avoid misinterpretation and to fully realize its potential in advancing our understanding of nuclear interactions.", "References": [{"title": "A Planar Diagram Theory for Strong Interactions", "authors": "Gerard 't Hooft", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1974", "volumes": "72", "first page": "461", "last page": "473", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(74)90154-0"}, {"title": "Baryons in the 1/N Expansion", "authors": "Edward Witten", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1979", "volumes": "160", "first page": "57", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(79)90232-3"}, {"title": "A New Expansion for Small Velocities", "authors": "David B.
