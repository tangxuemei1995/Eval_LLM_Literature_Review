{"Literature Review": "The study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons, such as D0(+), Λc, Ξc, and Ωc, has been a focal point in the field of particle physics due to its implications for understanding quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and testing the Standard Model (SM). These decays provide a unique window into the dynamics of strong and weak interactions, allowing for precise measurements of decay constants and form factors, which are crucial for testing the unitarity of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix and lepton flavor universality. Recent advancements in both theoretical and experimental approaches have significantly enhanced our understanding of these processes.\n\nTheoretical frameworks, particularly lattice QCD, have been instrumental in providing precise calculations of decay constants and form factors. Lattice QCD allows for non-perturbative calculations of hadronic matrix elements, which are essential for interpreting experimental data on leptonic and semileptonic decays. Recent lattice QCD calculations have achieved unprecedented precision, reducing uncertainties in decay constants and form factors for charmed mesons and baryons (Aoki et al., 2019). These calculations are crucial for testing the SM predictions and for extracting CKM matrix elements with high precision.\n\nExperimentally, the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) has played a pivotal role in advancing charm physics. Located at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider, BESIII has collected extensive data sets near the production thresholds of charmed hadrons, providing a rich environment for studying their decays. The high luminosity and clean environment of BESIII have enabled precise measurements of branching fractions and decay rates, contributing significantly to our understanding of charm decays (Ablikim et al., 2015).\n\nLeptonic decays of charmed mesons, such as D+ → l+ν, are particularly sensitive to the decay constant fD, which encapsulates the non-perturbative QCD effects. Precise measurements of fD are essential for testing lattice QCD predictions and for extracting the CKM matrix element |Vcd|. Recent experimental results from BESIII and other collaborations have provided improved measurements of fD, which are in good agreement with lattice QCD predictions, thereby validating the theoretical framework (Ablikim et al., 2019).\n\nSemileptonic decays, such as D0 → K−e+νe, are equally important as they provide access to form factors, which describe the momentum transfer dependence of the decay. These form factors are crucial for extracting CKM matrix elements such as |Vcs| and |Vcd|. Recent studies have focused on measuring the q2 dependence of form factors with high precision, using data from BESIII and other experiments. These measurements have provided stringent tests of lattice QCD predictions and have improved our understanding of the dynamics of semileptonic decays (Lees et al., 2015).\n\nCharmed baryons, such as Λc, Ξc, and Ωc, also undergo leptonic and semileptonic decays, providing additional opportunities to study QCD and the SM. The decay constants and form factors for these baryons are less well known compared to charmed mesons, making them an active area of research. Recent experimental efforts have focused on measuring the branching fractions and decay rates of these baryons, providing new insights into their decay dynamics (Aaij et al., 2017).\n\nThe study of leptonic and semileptonic decays also provides a testing ground for lepton flavor universality, a fundamental principle of the SM that posits that the weak interaction should treat all leptons equally. Recent measurements of ratios of branching fractions, such as R(D) and R(D*), have shown some deviations from SM predictions, sparking interest in potential new physics scenarios. However, measurements in the charm sector have so far been consistent with lepton flavor universality, providing important constraints on new physics models (Huschle et al., 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons has made significant progress in recent years, driven by advances in both theoretical and experimental techniques. Lattice QCD has provided precise predictions for decay constants and form factors, while experiments like BESIII have provided high-quality data for testing these predictions. These studies have not only enhanced our understanding of QCD and the SM but have also provided important constraints on potential new physics. As experimental techniques continue to improve and new data become available, the study of charm decays will remain a vibrant area of research, with the potential to uncover new insights into the fundamental forces of nature.", "References": [{"title": "Review of lattice results concerning low-energy particle physics", "authors": "S.
