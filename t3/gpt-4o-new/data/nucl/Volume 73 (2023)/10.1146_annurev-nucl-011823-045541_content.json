{"Literature Review": "The study of live radioisotopes such as 60Fe and 244Pu on Earth and the Moon provides critical insights into recent nearby astrophysical explosions, such as supernovae and neutron star mergers. These isotopes serve as cosmic messengers, offering a unique window into the processes and events that have shaped our cosmic neighborhood. The detection of 60Fe in deep-sea sediments, Antarctic snow, and lunar regolith, as well as 244Pu in deep-sea crusts, has been made possible through advances in ultrasensitive accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) techniques. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of supernova nucleosynthesis, particularly the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), supernova dust production, and the formation of the Local Bubble surrounding the Solar System.\n\nThe presence of 60Fe in terrestrial and lunar samples is indicative of supernova activity in the vicinity of the Solar System. Studies have shown that 60Fe, with a half-life of approximately 2.6 million years, is a product of stellar nucleosynthesis, primarily formed in supernovae (Wallner et al., 2016). The detection of two distinct pulses of 60Fe, occurring around 3 million and 7 million years ago, suggests multiple supernova events (Knie et al., 2004). These findings are supported by the analysis of deep-sea ferromanganese crusts and sediments, which have recorded these isotopic signatures over millions of years (Fitoussi et al., 2008).\n\nThe discovery of 244Pu in deep-sea crusts further supports the occurrence of recent r-process events, which are responsible for the creation of heavy elements beyond iron in the periodic table. The r-process, or rapid neutron capture process, occurs in environments with high neutron fluxes, such as supernovae or neutron star mergers (Wallner et al., 2015). The presence of 244Pu, with a half-life of 80.8 million years, in Earth's crust suggests a relatively recent astrophysical event, possibly a neutron star merger, that contributed to the local abundance of heavy elements (Paul et al., 2001).\n\nThe application of AMS has been pivotal in these discoveries. AMS allows for the detection of rare isotopes at extremely low concentrations, which is essential for studying isotopes like 60Fe and 244Pu that are present in trace amounts (Fifield, 1999). This technique has enabled researchers to measure isotopic ratios with high precision, providing robust evidence for the timing and nature of nearby astrophysical events (Kutschera, 2005).\n\nThe implications of these findings extend beyond nuclear physics and astrophysics. The deposition of supernova material on Earth and the Moon has potential consequences for heliophysics, as the interaction of supernova shock waves with the heliosphere can influence solar and cosmic ray fluxes (Fields et al., 2008). Additionally, the influx of extraterrestrial material may have played a role in astrobiology, potentially affecting the development of life on Earth through changes in the planet's radiation environment (Melott et al., 2004).\n\nGeologically, the presence of supernova-derived isotopes in sedimentary records provides a tool for understanding Earth's past environments and the timing of geological events. The isotopic signatures can be used to correlate sediment layers across different regions, offering insights into the global impact of supernova events (Ellis et al., 1996). Furthermore, the study of these isotopes can inform evolutionary biology by providing a timeline for environmental changes that may have influenced the evolution of life on Earth (Raup, 1986).\n\nThe formation of the Local Bubble, a region of hot, low-density gas surrounding the Solar System, is also linked to nearby supernova activity. The Local Bubble is thought to have been created by multiple supernova explosions over the past 10-20 million years, which have swept up interstellar material and created a cavity in the interstellar medium (Breitschwerdt et al., 1996). The isotopic evidence of recent supernovae supports this model, suggesting that the Solar System has been shaped by these explosive events.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes provides valuable insights into the history of nearby astrophysical explosions and their impact on the Solar System. The use of advanced AMS techniques has enabled the detection of isotopic signatures that reveal the timing and nature of these events. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of supernova nucleosynthesis, the r-process, and the formation of the Local Bubble, as well as their effects on heliophysics, astrobiology, geology, and evolutionary biology.", "References": [{"title": "Recent near-Earth supernovae probed by global deposition of interstellar radioactive 60Fe", "authors": "Wallner, A., Feige, J., Kinoshita, N., Paul, M., Fifield, L.
