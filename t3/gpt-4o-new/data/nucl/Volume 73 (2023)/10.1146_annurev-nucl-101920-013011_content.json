{"Literature Review": "The search for long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has become a significant area of research in particle physics, driven by the potential to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). LLPs are hypothesized particles that have a longer lifetime than typical SM particles, allowing them to travel a measurable distance before decaying. This unique property makes them a compelling target for experimental searches, as they can provide insights into phenomena such as dark matter, supersymmetry, and other exotic theories. \n\nThe theoretical motivation for LLPs is rooted in several extensions of the SM. For instance, supersymmetry (SUSY) models often predict the existence of LLPs, such as the neutralino, which could be a candidate for dark matter (Feng et al., 2010). Similarly, models involving hidden sectors or extra dimensions can lead to the production of LLPs that interact weakly with SM particles, making them difficult to detect with traditional methods (Arkani-Hamed et al., 2005). These models suggest that LLPs could have masses ranging from a few GeV to several TeV and lifetimes that allow them to decay within the LHC detectors, providing a unique signature that can be exploited in experimental searches.\n\nExperimentally, the search for LLPs at the LHC involves several innovative techniques. Traditional searches for new particles often rely on detecting high-energy decay products at the interaction point. However, LLPs require different strategies due to their extended lifetimes. One approach is to look for displaced vertices, which occur when an LLP decays at a significant distance from the primary interaction point (Aad et al., 2015). This method is sensitive to particles with lifetimes on the order of picoseconds to nanoseconds. Another technique involves the use of timing information to identify delayed signals, which can indicate the presence of LLPs that travel slower than the speed of light (Sirunyan et al., 2019). Additionally, missing transverse energy (MET) signatures can be indicative of LLPs that escape detection, similar to neutrinos in SM processes.\n\nThe estimation of signal efficiencies and background rates is a critical aspect of LLP searches. Signal efficiency refers to the probability of correctly identifying an LLP event, while background rates pertain to the likelihood of misidentifying SM processes as LLP events. Accurate estimation of these parameters is essential for determining the sensitivity of a search. Monte Carlo simulations are often employed to model the production and decay of LLPs, taking into account detector effects and potential backgrounds (Alwall et al., 2014). These simulations help in optimizing the selection criteria and improving the signal-to-background ratio.\n\nSeveral experimental collaborations at the LHC have conducted searches for LLPs, yielding important results and setting constraints on various theoretical models. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have both reported searches for displaced vertices and delayed signals, with no significant excess observed beyond SM expectations (Aad et al., 2015; Sirunyan et al., 2019). These results have placed stringent limits on the parameter space of many LLP models, motivating further theoretical and experimental efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the search for LLPs at the LHC is a dynamic and evolving field, with significant implications for our understanding of fundamental physics. The combination of theoretical models predicting LLPs and the development of novel experimental techniques has opened new avenues for discovery. As the LHC continues to collect data, the potential for uncovering new physics through LLP searches remains high, promising exciting developments in the years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Supersymmetry and the LHC inverse problem", "authors": "Jonathan L.
