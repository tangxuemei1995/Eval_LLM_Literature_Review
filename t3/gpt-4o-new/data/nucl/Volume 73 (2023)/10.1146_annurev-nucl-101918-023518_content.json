{"Literature Review": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory has emerged as a pivotal facility for neutrino research, particularly through the efforts of the COHERENT Collaboration. The SNS provides a high-intensity, high-quality source of neutrinos primarily from pion decay at rest, which has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering (CEvNS). This process, first predicted in the 1970s, involves the scattering of neutrinos off entire nuclei, leading to a coherent enhancement of the cross-section that is proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus (Freedman, 1974). The first observation of CEvNS by the COHERENT Collaboration marked a significant milestone in neutrino physics, providing a new avenue to probe physics beyond the Standard Model (Akimov et al., 2017). \n\nThe initial CEvNS measurements by COHERENT utilized a 14.6 kg CsI[Na] detector, which successfully detected the process with a statistical significance of 6.7 sigma (Akimov et al., 2017). This observation not only confirmed the theoretical predictions but also opened up new possibilities for testing non-standard neutrino interactions and constraining neutrino properties such as the neutrino magnetic moment and charge radius (Scholberg, 2006). Subsequent measurements with a 24 kg liquid argon detector further validated these findings and provided additional data to refine theoretical models (Akimov et al., 2020). \n\nThe SNS's capability to produce a copious flux of neutrinos also facilitates the study of inelastic neutrino–nucleus interactions, which are crucial for understanding supernova neutrinos. These interactions can provide insights into the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae and the role of neutrinos in these cataclysmic events (Balantekin and Fuller, 2013). The COHERENT Collaboration's ongoing efforts to measure these interactions will enhance our understanding of neutrino properties and their implications for astrophysical phenomena. \n\nMoreover, the SNS offers a unique opportunity to search for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter. Theoretical models suggest that dark matter particles in this mass range could be produced in high-energy proton collisions, such as those occurring at the SNS (Batell et al., 2009). The COHERENT Collaboration's detectors are well-suited to search for these elusive particles, potentially providing the first direct evidence of dark matter interactions with ordinary matter. \n\nThe COHERENT Collaboration's suite of detectors, located in Neutrino Alley at the SNS, is designed to address a broad physics program that intersects particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. These detectors, which include CsI[Na], liquid argon, and germanium detectors, are optimized for different aspects of neutrino and dark matter research (Akimov et al., 2018). The collaboration's future plans include upgrading these detectors and deploying new technologies to enhance sensitivity and expand the range of measurable phenomena. \n\nIn addition to CEvNS and dark matter searches, the SNS provides a platform for exploring other fundamental questions in neutrino physics. For instance, the precise measurement of neutrino cross-sections at low energies can improve our understanding of neutrino oscillations and the role of neutrinos in the early universe (Formaggio and Zeller, 2012). Furthermore, the SNS's intense neutrino flux can be used to test the unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix and search for sterile neutrinos, which are hypothesized to exist beyond the three known neutrino flavors (Abazajian et al., 2012). \n\nThe COHERENT Collaboration's work at the SNS exemplifies the synergy between experimental and theoretical physics. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the SNS, the collaboration is poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of fundamental physics. The ongoing and future experiments at the SNS will not only test the limits of the Standard Model but also explore new physics scenarios that could reshape our understanding of the universe. As the COHERENT Collaboration continues to accumulate data and refine its experimental techniques, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries remains high, promising to shed light on some of the most profound questions in modern physics.", "References": [{"title": "Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering", "authors": "Freedman, D.
