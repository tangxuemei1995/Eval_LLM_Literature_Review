{"Literature Review": "The detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils are pivotal in the search for dark matter and the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS). These processes are characterized by their low-energy signatures, which necessitate highly sensitive detection techniques and precise calibration methods to ensure accurate interpretation of experimental data. The detection of nuclear recoils is primarily achieved through direct detection experiments, which aim to observe the rare interactions of dark matter particles or neutrinos with atomic nuclei. These interactions produce nuclear recoils that can be detected using various technologies, including scintillators, semiconductors, and cryogenic detectors. Each of these technologies has its own advantages and challenges in terms of energy resolution, background discrimination, and scalability (Akerib et al., 2017; Aprile et al., 2018). \n\nScintillation detectors, such as those using liquid xenon or argon, are widely used in dark matter searches due to their large target masses and ability to discriminate between nuclear and electronic recoils. The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment, for example, utilizes a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) to achieve high sensitivity to low-energy nuclear recoils (Akerib et al., 2017). Semiconductor detectors, such as germanium and silicon, offer excellent energy resolution and are employed in experiments like SuperCDMS, which focuses on low-mass dark matter particles (Agnese et al., 2018). Cryogenic detectors, such as those used in the CRESST and EDELWEISS experiments, operate at millikelvin temperatures to achieve low energy thresholds and are particularly sensitive to low-energy recoils (Angloher et al., 2016; Armengaud et al., 2019). \n\nCalibration of these detectors is crucial for understanding their response to nuclear recoils and for distinguishing potential dark matter or neutrino signals from background noise. Calibration techniques often involve the use of neutron sources, which can produce nuclear recoils similar to those expected from dark matter or neutrino interactions. Monoenergetic neutron sources, such as those produced by deuterium-deuterium (D-D) or deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, are commonly used to calibrate detector response across a range of recoil energies (Akerib et al., 2017; Aprile et al., 2018). Additionally, neutron scattering experiments can provide detailed information on the energy dependence of detector response, which is critical for accurate signal interpretation (Agnese et al., 2018). \n\nBackground mitigation is another critical aspect of nuclear recoil detection and calibration. Cosmic rays, environmental radioactivity, and intrinsic detector noise can all contribute to background signals that obscure potential dark matter or neutrino interactions. Shielding, active veto systems, and careful material selection are commonly employed to reduce these backgrounds (Aprile et al., 2018; Armengaud et al., 2019). Furthermore, the development of advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, has shown promise in improving background discrimination and enhancing the sensitivity of nuclear recoil detectors (Angloher et al., 2016). \n\nThe presentation of calibration results is essential for facilitating comparison between different experiments and for establishing a common framework for interpreting nuclear recoil data. Standardized reporting of calibration data, including energy thresholds, resolution, and efficiency, allows for more straightforward comparison of detector performance and sensitivity across different experimental setups (Akerib et al., 2017; Aprile et al., 2018). Moreover, the development of shared databases and collaborative efforts among research groups can help to harmonize calibration practices and improve the overall reliability of nuclear recoil measurements (Agnese et al., 2018). \n\nLooking to the future, several challenges and opportunities exist for the field of nuclear recoil calibration. As dark matter and neutrino experiments push towards lower energy thresholds and larger detector volumes, the need for more precise and comprehensive calibration techniques becomes increasingly important. The development of new calibration sources, such as low-energy ion beams or novel neutron generators, could provide more accurate and versatile calibration options (Armengaud et al., 2019). Additionally, the integration of multi-detector systems and the use of complementary detection technologies may offer new insights into nuclear recoil processes and enhance the discovery potential of future experiments (Angloher et al., 2016). \n\nIn conclusion, the detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils are critical components of dark matter and neutrino research. Advances in detector technology, calibration methods, and background mitigation strategies continue to improve the sensitivity and reliability of these experiments. As the field progresses, ongoing collaboration and innovation will be essential to overcoming the challenges and realizing the full potential of nuclear recoil measurements in the search for new physics.", "References": [{"title": "Results from a search for dark matter in the complete LUX exposure", "authors": "D.
