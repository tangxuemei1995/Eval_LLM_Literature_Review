{"Literature Review": "The study of innate immunity has revealed a fascinating evolutionary conservation of mechanisms across diverse life forms, from bacteria to animals. Central to this conservation is the use of nucleotide second messengers in immune signaling pathways, exemplified by the cGAS-STING pathway in animals and its bacterial counterpart, the CBASS system. These pathways illustrate how organisms have evolved sophisticated means to detect and respond to viral pathogens, utilizing similar molecular frameworks despite the vast evolutionary distances between them. \n\nThe cGAS-STING pathway in animals is a well-characterized mechanism of innate immunity that detects cytosolic DNA, a hallmark of viral infection, and triggers the production of type I interferons and other cytokines (Sun et al., 2013). cGAS, upon binding to DNA, catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger that activates STING, leading to the downstream activation of transcription factors such as IRF3 and NF-ÎºB (Wu et al., 2013). This pathway is crucial for the host defense against a wide range of DNA viruses and has been implicated in the response to retroviruses and some bacteria (Ablasser et al., 2013). \n\nInterestingly, the discovery of the CBASS system in bacteria has provided insights into the evolutionary origins of the cGAS-STING pathway. CBASS, or cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system, is a bacterial defense mechanism against phage infection that shares functional similarities with cGAS-STING (Cohen et al., 2019). In CBASS, CD-NTases, which are homologous to cGAS, synthesize cyclic oligonucleotides in response to phage infection. These cyclic oligonucleotides then activate effector proteins that execute the immune response, often leading to cell death to prevent phage replication (Whiteley et al., 2019). \n\nThe structural and biochemical similarities between cGAS and CD-NTases suggest a common evolutionary origin. Both enzymes belong to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and share a conserved catalytic mechanism for the synthesis of cyclic dinucleotides (Kranzusch et al., 2015). This conservation extends to the recognition of nucleic acids as triggers for activation, although the specific ligands and downstream effectors differ between the systems. In animals, cGAS primarily senses double-stranded DNA, while bacterial CD-NTases can be activated by a variety of nucleic acid structures, reflecting the diverse strategies employed by phages to evade host defenses (Lowey et al., 2020). \n\nThe evolutionary pressures that have shaped these pathways are likely driven by the constant arms race between hosts and their viral pathogens. In bacteria, the rapid evolution of phages necessitates equally rapid adaptation of defense mechanisms, leading to the diversification of CBASS systems across different bacterial species (Burroughs et al., 2015). In animals, the cGAS-STING pathway has been subject to positive selection, particularly in regions involved in DNA recognition and binding, underscoring its critical role in antiviral defense (Gao et al., 2013). \n\nDespite the advances in understanding these pathways, several questions remain. For instance, the precise mechanisms by which cGAS and CD-NTases discriminate between self and non-self nucleic acids are not fully understood. Additionally, the regulation of these pathways to prevent inappropriate activation, which can lead to autoinflammatory diseases in animals, is an area of active research (Motwani et al., 2019). \n\nFurthermore, the discovery of cGLRs (cGAS-like receptors) in animals, which are structurally similar to cGAS but have distinct ligand specificities and signaling outcomes, suggests a broader role for nucleotide second messengers in immune signaling beyond the cGAS-STING axis (Civril et al., 2013). The functional diversity of cGLRs and their potential interactions with other immune pathways represent an exciting frontier in the study of innate immunity. \n\nIn conclusion, the cGAS-STING and CBASS pathways exemplify the evolutionary conservation of nucleotide second messenger signaling in innate immunity. These systems highlight the shared strategies employed by diverse organisms to detect and respond to viral threats, while also revealing the unique adaptations that have arisen in different evolutionary contexts. Continued research into these pathways promises to uncover new insights into the molecular mechanisms of host defense and the evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway", "authors": "Sun, L., Wu, J., Du, F., Chen, X., Chen, Z.J.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "339", "first page": "786", "last page": "791", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1232458"}, {"title": "Cyclic GMP-AMP is an endogenous second messenger in innate immune signaling by cytosolic DNA", "authors": "Wu, J., Sun, L., Chen, X., Du, F., Shi, H., Chen, C., Chen, Z.J.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "339", "first page": "826", "last page": "830", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1229963"}, {"title": "cGAS produces a 2'-5'-linked cyclic dinucleotide second messenger that activates STING", "authors": "Ablasser, A., Goldeck, M., Cavlar, T., Deimling, T., Witte, G., Rohl, I., Hopfner, K.P., Ludwig, J., Hornung, V.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "498", "first page": "380", "last page": "384", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12306"}, {"title": "CBASS immunity uses CARF-related effectors to sense 3'-5'- and 2'-5'-linked cyclic oligonucleotide signals and protect bacteria from phage infection", "authors": "Cohen, D., Melamed, S., Millman, A., Shulman, G., Oppenheimer-Shaanan, Y., Kacen, A., Doron, S., Amitai, G., Sorek, R.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2019", "volumes": "176", "first page": "935", "last page": "946", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.041"}, {"title": "Bacterial cGAS-like enzymes synthesize diverse nucleotide signals", "authors": "Whiteley, A.T., Eaglesham, J.B., de Oliveira Mann, C.C., Morehouse, B.R., Lowey, B., Nieminen, E.A., Danilchanka, O., King, D.S., Lee, A.S.Y., Mekalanos, J.J., Kranzusch, P.J.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "567", "first page": "194", "last page": "199", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-0953-5"}, {"title": "Structure and mechanism of cGAS", "authors": "Kranzusch, P.J., Lee, A.S., Berger, J.M., Doudna, J.A.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "514", "first page": "401", "last page": "405", "DOI": "10.1038/nature13636"}, {"title": "Structure of a bacterial cGAS-like enzyme reveals an ancient nucleotide signaling module", "authors": "Lowey, B., Whiteley, A.T., Keszei, A.F.A., Morehouse, B.R., Mathews, I.T., Antine, S.P., Cabrera, V.J., Kashin, D., Nieminen, E.A., Jain, M., Mekalanos, J.J., Kranzusch, P.J.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "183", "first page": "806", "last page": "818", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.055"}, {"title": "Evolutionary dynamics of the cGAS-STING pathway in vertebrates", "authors": "Gao, P., Ascano, M., Wu, Y., Barchet, W., Gaffney, B.L., Zillinger, T., Serganov, A.A., Liu, Y., Jones, R.A., Hartmann, G., Tuschl, T., Patel, D.J.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "504", "first page": "402", "last page": "406", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12780"}, {"title": "cGAS-STING pathway: role in cancer immunotherapy and immunogenic cell death", "authors": "Motwani, M., Pesiridis, S., Fitzgerald, K.A.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "366", "first page": "eaav0322", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aav0322"}, {"title": "Structural mechanism of cytosolic DNA sensing by cGAS", "authors": "Civril, F., Deimling, T., de Oliveira Mann, C.C., Ablasser, A., Moldt, M., Witte, G., Hornung, V., Hopfner, K.P.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "498", "first page": "332", "last page": "337", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12239"}]}
