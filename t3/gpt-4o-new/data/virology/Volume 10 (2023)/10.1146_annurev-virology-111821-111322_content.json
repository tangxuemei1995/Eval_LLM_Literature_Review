{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that specifically infect bacteria, yet their interactions with mammalian cells have garnered increasing attention. Traditionally, phages were considered irrelevant to mammalian cells due to their inability to infect or replicate within these cells. However, recent studies have highlighted their potential to interact with mammalian cells, influencing various physiological and pathological processes. This literature review explores the mechanisms of phage interaction with mammalian cells, focusing on surface interactions, internalization, intracellular processing, and the implications for health and disease. \n\nPhages are abundant in the human body, particularly in the gut, where they are part of the human virome. The human virome is a complex community of viruses that inhabit the human body, and phages constitute a significant portion of this community (Reyes et al., 2010). Their presence in the human body suggests potential interactions with mammalian cells, which could have implications for health and disease. \n\nThe initial interaction between phages and mammalian cells occurs at the cell surface. Phages can bind to cell surface receptors, which may facilitate their internalization. For instance, phages have been shown to bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of immune cells, potentially modulating immune responses (Górski et al., 2017). This interaction can lead to the activation of signaling pathways that influence inflammation and immunity. \n\nOnce bound to the cell surface, phages can be internalized by mammalian cells through various endocytic pathways. Endocytosis is a cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular material. Phages can be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, or macropinocytosis, depending on the cell type and the phage (Lehti et al., 2017). The choice of endocytic pathway can influence the intracellular fate of the phage and its potential impact on the cell. \n\nAfter internalization, phages are trafficked within the cell to various intracellular compartments. The intracellular trafficking of phages can determine their fate and the cellular response. Phages can be directed to lysosomes for degradation, or they may escape the endosomal pathway and interact with the cytosol (Miernikiewicz et al., 2016). The ability of phages to escape degradation and persist within cells could have implications for their use in therapeutic applications. \n\nThe intracellular processing of phages can influence cellular functions and immune responses. Phages that escape degradation can interact with cytosolic receptors, such as the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), which can modulate immune responses (Van Belleghem et al., 2017). This interaction can lead to the production of cytokines and other immune mediators, influencing inflammation and immunity. \n\nThe potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions on health and disease is an emerging area of research. Phages have been shown to modulate immune responses, which could have implications for inflammatory diseases and immune disorders (Dąbrowska et al., 2019). Additionally, phages have been explored as therapeutic agents in phage therapy, where they are used to target bacterial infections. Understanding the interactions between phages and mammalian cells is crucial for optimizing phage therapy and minimizing potential side effects. \n\nIn conclusion, while phages do not infect mammalian cells in the traditional sense, they can interact with these cells in ways that influence cellular functions and immune responses. The mechanisms of phage interaction with mammalian cells, including surface binding, internalization, and intracellular processing, are complex and multifaceted. These interactions have significant implications for health and disease, particularly in the context of the human virome and phage therapy. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of phage-mammalian interactions and to harness their potential for therapeutic applications.", "References": [{"title": "Viruses in the faecal microbiota of monozygotic twins and their mothers", "authors": "Reyes, A., Haynes, M., Hanson, N., Angly, F.
