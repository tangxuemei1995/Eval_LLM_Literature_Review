{"Literature Review": "Herpesviruses are a family of large, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide range of hosts, including humans. A critical step in the herpesvirus life cycle is the nuclear egress of capsids, which involves the translocation of viral capsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is mediated by the nuclear egress complex (NEC), a viral protein complex that facilitates the budding of capsids at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and their subsequent release into the cytoplasm. The NEC is composed of two viral proteins, UL31 and UL34, which form a dimeric complex that oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat on the INM, inducing membrane curvature and scission (Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015). The NEC-mediated budding process is highly conserved among herpesviruses, but there are species-specific differences in the later steps of nuclear egress (Mettenleiter et al., 2013). \n\nThe NEC is essential for the nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids, and its function has been extensively studied using mutational analyses and structural biology approaches. Mutational analyses have identified several functionally important regions in the NEC, including the membrane-binding domain and the oligomerization interface (Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015). Structural studies have provided insights into the molecular architecture of the NEC and its mechanism of action. For example, cryo-electron microscopy studies have revealed the honeycomb-shaped lattice formed by the NEC on the INM, which is thought to drive membrane curvature and scission (Hagen et al., 2015). Despite these advances, several questions remain unanswered, including the precise timing and location of NEC formation, the regulation of vesicle formation, and the mechanisms that ensure directionality during nuclear egress (Mettenleiter et al., 2013). \n\nThe primary enveloped virion (PEV) is a transient intermediate in the nuclear egress pathway, formed by the budding of capsids at the INM. The composition of the PEV and the machinery mediating its fusion with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) are still debated. Some studies suggest that the PEV contains a limited set of viral and host proteins, while others propose a more complex composition (Mettenleiter et al., 2013). The fusion of the PEV with the ONM is a critical step in nuclear egress, but the molecular machinery mediating this process is not well understood. It is thought to involve viral and host factors, but the identities of these factors and their roles in membrane fusion remain unclear (Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015). \n\nSpecies and cell type-specific differences in the nuclear egress of herpesviruses add another layer of complexity to our understanding of this process. For example, the NEC of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) have been shown to have different requirements for membrane curvature and scission, suggesting that the mechanisms of nuclear egress may vary between different herpesviruses (Mettenleiter et al., 2013). Additionally, the host cell type can influence the efficiency and outcome of nuclear egress, with some cell types supporting more efficient egress than others (Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, the nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids is a complex and highly regulated process that involves the coordinated action of viral and host factors. The NEC plays a central role in this process, mediating the budding and scission of capsids at the INM. While significant progress has been made in understanding the structure and function of the NEC, many questions remain unanswered, including the composition of the PEV, the machinery mediating membrane fusion, and the species and cell type-specific differences in nuclear egress. Further research is needed to address these questions and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the nuclear egress of herpesviruses.", "References": [{"title": "Nuclear egress of herpesviruses: the prototypic vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport", "authors": "Mettenleiter, Thomas C., Klupp, Barbara G., Granzow, Harald", "journal": "Advances in Virus Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "86", "first page": "107", "last page": "158", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-394315-6.00004-5"}, {"title": "Nuclear egress of herpesviruses", "authors": "Bigalke, J.
