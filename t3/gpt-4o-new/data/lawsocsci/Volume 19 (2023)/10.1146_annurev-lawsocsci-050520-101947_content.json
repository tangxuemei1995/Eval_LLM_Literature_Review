{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of data governance in managing public health crises. The rapid deployment of digital technologies, such as contact tracing apps, has brought to the forefront the complexities and challenges associated with data governance. These challenges are not only technical but also ethical, legal, and social, necessitating a comprehensive framework for data governance that addresses issues of power, authority, and legitimacy. \n\nOne of the primary concerns during the pandemic has been the management of data flows. The question of 'who decides about data flows' is central to data governance. Traditionally, data governance has been the purview of governments and large corporations, but the pandemic has shown the need for a more inclusive approach that involves multiple stakeholders, including civil society and individuals (Floridi, 2020). This inclusive approach is necessary to ensure that data governance frameworks are not only effective but also legitimate and trusted by the public. \n\nThe basis on which decisions about data flows are made is another critical aspect of data governance. During the pandemic, decisions about data collection and use were often made in the absence of clear guidelines or frameworks, leading to concerns about privacy and data protection (Zwitter & Gstrein, 2020). The lack of a clear basis for decision-making has highlighted the need for data governance frameworks that are grounded in principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness. These principles are essential to ensure that data is used in ways that respect individual rights and promote the public good. \n\nAccountability and oversight are also crucial components of data governance. The pandemic has shown that without proper oversight, data can be misused or mishandled, leading to data harms such as discrimination, exclusion, and loss of privacy (Taylor, 2020). Effective data governance frameworks must include mechanisms for accountability and oversight to ensure that data is used responsibly and ethically. This includes the establishment of independent bodies to monitor data use and the implementation of robust data protection laws and regulations. \n\nThe pandemic has also highlighted the importance of data intermediaries in data governance. Data intermediaries, such as technology companies and data brokers, play a critical role in the collection, processing, and dissemination of data (Crawford & Schultz, 2021). However, their role in data governance is often unclear, leading to concerns about their accountability and the potential for abuse of power. Data governance frameworks must address the role of data intermediaries and ensure that they are held accountable for their actions. \n\nData sovereignty is another important issue that has emerged during the pandemic. The global nature of the pandemic has highlighted the need for data governance frameworks that respect national sovereignty while also facilitating international cooperation (Kuner, 2020). This requires a delicate balance between protecting national interests and promoting global public health. Data governance frameworks must address issues of data sovereignty and ensure that data is shared in ways that respect national laws and regulations while also promoting the global public good. \n\nThe design and digital infrastructure of data systems are also critical to data governance. The pandemic has shown that poorly designed data systems can lead to data breaches and other security issues (Binns, 2020). Data governance frameworks must ensure that data systems are designed with privacy and security in mind, incorporating principles of privacy by design and security by design. This includes the use of encryption and other security measures to protect data from unauthorized access and use. \n\nRegulatory technologies, or 'regtech', have also emerged as important tools for data governance during the pandemic. Regtech can help automate compliance with data protection laws and regulations, reducing the burden on organizations and ensuring that data is used in compliance with legal and ethical standards (Zarsky, 2020). Data governance frameworks must incorporate regtech solutions to ensure that data is used responsibly and ethically. \n\nFinally, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of social trust and license in data governance. Public trust in data governance frameworks is essential to ensure their effectiveness and legitimacy (Mittelstadt, 2020). Data governance frameworks must be designed in ways that promote public trust, including through transparency, accountability, and public engagement. This includes involving the public in decision-making processes and ensuring that data governance frameworks are responsive to public concerns and needs. \n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for comprehensive data governance frameworks that address issues of power, authority, and legitimacy. These frameworks must be inclusive, transparent, and accountable, ensuring that data is used in ways that respect individual rights and promote the public good. The pandemic experience with contact tracing apps, in particular, has shown the many unresolved governance challenges and the need for a broader framework of data governance.", "References": [{"title": "The ethics of AI in health care: A mapping review", "authors": "Luciano Floridi", "journal": "Social Science & Medicine", "year": "2020", "volumes": "260", "first page": "113172", "last page": "113172", "DOI": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113172"}, {"title": "Big data ethics", "authors": "Andre J.
