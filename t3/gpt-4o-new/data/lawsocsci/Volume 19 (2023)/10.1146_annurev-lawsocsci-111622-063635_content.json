{"Literature Review": "The concept of legality within the context of China's authoritarian regime has been a subject of extensive scholarly debate. The notion of legality in a Leninist single-party state like China is complex and multifaceted. Scholars have approached this issue from various perspectives, leading to differing conclusions about the existence and nature of legality in China. One perspective is that of 'order maintenance,' which posits that legality is largely absent in China. This view suggests that the legal system primarily serves to maintain social order and the authority of the Communist Party, rather than to uphold the rule of law as understood in liberal democracies (Peerenboom, 2002). In contrast, the 'dual-state' and 'instrumentalist' views of law suggest that there is a form of partial legality in China. These perspectives argue that while the legal system is used instrumentally by the state to achieve its goals, there are areas where legal norms are applied consistently and predictably, thus providing a semblance of legality (Chen, 2016). The notion of 'bare legality' goes further, suggesting that China exhibits complete legality, albeit in a form that is distinct from Western legal systems. This view holds that the legal system in China is fully functional within the parameters set by the state, and that it provides a framework for governance and economic activity (Zhang, 2017).\n\nThe second question addressed in this review is whether authoritarian legality strengthens regime legitimacy in China. There is a consensus among scholars that the Chinese state seeks to legitimize its rule through the adoption of authoritarian legality. This involves the use of legal mechanisms to enhance the state's image as a modern, rule-based entity, thereby bolstering its legitimacy both domestically and internationally (Ginsburg, 2008). Empirical research supports this claim, showing that the Chinese government has invested heavily in legal reforms and the establishment of legal institutions as a means of enhancing its legitimacy (He, 2014). These efforts are seen as part of a broader strategy to maintain social stability and economic growth, which are key pillars of the regime's legitimacy (Li, 2015).\n\nThe third question concerns China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy, and the role of law in this process. The transition paradigm, which assumes a linear progression from plan to market, has been criticized for overlooking the illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets in China. Scholars argue that while China has embraced market mechanisms, the state retains significant control over key economic sectors, and legal reforms have been selectively implemented to support state capitalism (Naughton, 2007). The dual-state model, which posits the coexistence of a normative state and a prerogative state, helps explain this phenomenon. The normative state operates under the rule of law, while the prerogative state exercises arbitrary power. This duality allows the Chinese state to maintain control over strategic sectors while promoting economic growth through market reforms (Pei, 2006).\n\nThe role of law in China's state capitalism is further complicated by the persistence of plan elements. Despite market reforms, the state continues to play a dominant role in the allocation of resources, particularly in land and labor markets. Legal frameworks governing property rights and labor relations are often subordinated to state interests, reflecting the illiberal nature of China's economic system (Gallagher, 2011). This has implications for regime resilience, as the state's ability to control key economic levers is seen as a source of stability and power. However, it also contributes to economic inequality and social tensions, as the benefits of economic growth are unevenly distributed (Whyte, 2010).\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China highlights the complex interplay between law, state power, and economic development. While the Chinese legal system exhibits elements of legality, it is fundamentally shaped by the state's authoritarian nature and its strategic interests. The dual-state model provides a useful framework for understanding the coexistence of legal norms and arbitrary power in China. Moreover, the role of law in China's economic transition underscores the importance of considering the illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets. These insights are crucial for understanding the resilience of the Chinese regime, as well as the challenges it faces in terms of economic inequality and social stability.", "References": [{"title": "China's Long March Toward Rule of Law", "authors": "Randall Peerenboom", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Chinese Legal System: Globalization and Local Legal Culture", "authors": "Albert H.
