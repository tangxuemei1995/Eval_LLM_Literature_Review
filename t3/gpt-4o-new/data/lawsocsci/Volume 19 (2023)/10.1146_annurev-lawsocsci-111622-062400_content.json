{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race and low-wage immigrant labor is a critical area of study that has garnered significant attention in recent years. This literature review explores the historical and contemporary factors contributing to immigrant worker precarity, emphasizing the central role of race in achieving worker justice. The framework of racial capitalism provides a lens through which to understand these dynamics, highlighting how legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession have entrenched an exclusionary economic system both in the United States and globally. \n\nRacial capitalism, a concept developed by Cedric Robinson, posits that capitalism inherently relies on racial differentiation and exploitation (Robinson, 1983). This framework is crucial for understanding how race has historically been used to justify the exploitation of labor, particularly in the context of immigration. The legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession have created a foundation for an economic system that marginalizes non-white workers, including immigrants. These historical injustices have been perpetuated through policies and practices that continue to disadvantage immigrant workers today (Melamed, 2015).\n\nThe displacement of migrants is often driven by racism and colonial legacies. Colonialism has historically disrupted local economies and societies, forcing individuals to migrate in search of better opportunities (Patel, 2017). This displacement is compounded by contemporary global economic policies that prioritize profit over people, often at the expense of marginalized communities. As a result, immigrant workers frequently find themselves in precarious employment situations, characterized by low wages, lack of job security, and limited access to labor rights (Sassen, 1998).\n\nRacism is deeply embedded in the immigration bureaucracy, further exacerbating the precarity of immigrant workers. Immigration policies often reflect and reinforce racial hierarchies, privileging certain groups over others. For example, the U.S. immigration system has historically favored European immigrants while imposing stricter restrictions on those from non-European countries (Ngai, 2004). This racial bias in immigration policy contributes to the marginalization of immigrant workers, limiting their access to legal protections and resources (Gonzales, 2011).\n\nThe traditional labor movement has played a significant role in advocating for worker rights, but it has not always adequately addressed the specific needs of immigrant workers. Historically, labor unions have been criticized for excluding immigrant workers and failing to address issues of race and racism within their ranks (Milkman, 2006). However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of centering race in labor organizing. Worker centers and the immigrant rights movement have emerged as key players in this effort, advocating for policies and practices that address the unique challenges faced by immigrant workers (Fine, 2006).\n\nThese movements have had to navigate coalitional tensions as they build new strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights. The intersection of race and immigration status presents unique challenges that require innovative approaches to organizing and advocacy. For example, worker centers often employ a community-based model that emphasizes the empowerment of immigrant workers and the importance of building solidarity across racial and ethnic lines (Gordon, 2005). This approach has been effective in addressing the specific needs of immigrant workers and challenging the systemic racism that underpins their exploitation.\n\nIn conclusion, centering race in studies of low-wage immigrant labor is essential for understanding the complex dynamics that contribute to worker precarity. The framework of racial capitalism provides a valuable lens for examining these issues, highlighting the historical and contemporary factors that have shaped the experiences of immigrant workers. By addressing the role of race in immigration policy and labor organizing, researchers and advocates can develop more effective strategies for achieving worker justice and realizing the rights of immigrant workers.", "References": [{"title": "Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition", "authors": "Cedric J.
