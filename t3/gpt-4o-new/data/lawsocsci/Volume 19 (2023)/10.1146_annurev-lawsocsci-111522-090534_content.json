{"Literature Review": "The study of vaccines within the sociolegal and science studies fields has predominantly been characterized by an instrumentalist approach, focusing on the role of law as a tool for promoting public health through vaccine acceptance. This approach, while valuable, often overlooks the complex socio-cultural dynamics that influence vaccine hesitancy and acceptance. The instrumentalist perspective tends to prioritize legal frameworks and policies aimed at increasing vaccination rates, often at the expense of understanding the underlying social, cultural, and political factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy (Gostin et al., 2015). \n\nRecent interdisciplinary research has begun to challenge this narrow focus by incorporating constructivist approaches from feminist sociology and anthropology. These approaches emphasize the ethnographic richness of vaccine debates, highlighting how they reflect and perpetuate existing social inequalities, such as those related to parenting, race, and colonialism (Reich, 2016). For instance, studies have shown that vaccine hesitancy is not merely a result of misinformation or lack of access but is deeply intertwined with issues of trust, power, and identity (Dubé et al., 2013). \n\nFeminist sociological perspectives have been particularly insightful in uncovering how vaccine debates can reinforce gendered expectations and inequalities in parenting. For example, mothers are often held primarily responsible for their children's health, which can lead to heightened scrutiny and judgment regarding their vaccination decisions (Reich, 2016). This scrutiny is further compounded by racial and socio-economic factors, as minority and low-income mothers may face additional barriers and biases in accessing healthcare and making informed decisions about vaccines (Reich, 2016). \n\nAnthropological studies have also contributed to a more nuanced understanding of vaccine hesitancy by examining the historical and cultural contexts in which vaccines are received and perceived. These studies reveal how colonial histories and power dynamics continue to shape public perceptions of vaccines, particularly in marginalized communities (Leach & Fairhead, 2007). For instance, in some African countries, historical experiences of medical exploitation and experimentation have led to deep-seated mistrust of Western medical interventions, including vaccines (Leach & Fairhead, 2007). \n\nScience and technology studies (STS) offer another promising avenue for exploring the sociolegal dimensions of vaccines. STS approaches emphasize the materiality and movement of vaccines within networks of production, finance, and global politics, providing a broader context for understanding vaccine distribution and acceptance (Latour, 2005). These approaches highlight the complex interplay between scientific knowledge, technological innovation, and socio-political factors in shaping vaccine policies and practices (Latour, 2005). \n\nHowever, integrating STS perspectives into vaccine research poses significant methodological challenges. These challenges include the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, the complexity of tracing vaccine networks across different scales and contexts, and the difficulty of capturing the dynamic and contested nature of vaccine debates (Latour, 2005). Despite these challenges, STS approaches offer valuable insights into the broader socio-political and economic forces that influence vaccine acceptance and hesitancy (Latour, 2005). \n\nIn conclusion, while the instrumentalist approach to vaccines in sociolegal studies has provided important insights into the role of law in promoting public health, it is limited in its ability to address the complex socio-cultural dynamics that influence vaccine hesitancy and acceptance. Constructivist approaches from feminist sociology, anthropology, and STS offer valuable theoretical tools for understanding these dynamics, highlighting the need for more interdisciplinary research that moves beyond instrumentalist conceptions of law. By incorporating these diverse perspectives, researchers can develop more comprehensive and contextually informed strategies for addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting vaccine acceptance.", "References": [{"title": "Law, ethics, and public health in the vaccination debates: Politics of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine", "authors": "Lawrence O.
