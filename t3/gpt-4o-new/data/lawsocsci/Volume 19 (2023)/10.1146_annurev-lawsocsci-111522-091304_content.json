{"Literature Review": "The study of global lawmaking, particularly in the context of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and international health emergencies, has garnered significant scholarly attention. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, established in the 1990s, serves as a pivotal case study for understanding the complexities of international lawmaking. TRIPS, as a multilateral agreement under the World Trade Organization (WTO), set minimum standards for IP protection and enforcement, influencing both global trade and public health policies (Drahos, 2002). The agreement has been critiqued for prioritizing the interests of developed countries and multinational corporations over those of developing nations, particularly in the realm of access to essential medicines (Sell, 2003). \n\nThe intersection of IP and public health became particularly pronounced during the HIV/AIDS crisis, where the high cost of antiretroviral drugs, protected under patent laws, posed significant barriers to treatment in low-income countries. This led to the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health in 2001, which affirmed the right of WTO members to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all (Correa, 2002). The Doha Declaration exemplifies the tension between international IP agreements and national health policies, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that considers both economic and humanitarian concerns (Hoen, 2003). \n\nIn examining global lawmaking, scholars have identified three primary methodological approaches: methodological internationalism, methodological nationalism, and the interplay between domestic and international factors. Methodological internationalism focuses on the role of international institutions and agreements in shaping national policies. This approach emphasizes the top-down influence of global norms and standards, as seen in the implementation of TRIPS across various jurisdictions (Matthews, 2002). However, critics argue that this perspective overlooks the agency of national actors and the diversity of local contexts (Yu, 2007). \n\nConversely, methodological nationalism centers on the domestic factors that influence international lawmaking. This approach considers how national interests, political dynamics, and cultural values shape a country's engagement with international agreements. For instance, the United States' strong IP protection policies are often attributed to the influence of its powerful pharmaceutical lobby and the prioritization of innovation-driven economic growth (Sell, 2003). Methodological nationalism provides valuable insights into the domestic motivations behind a country's stance in international negotiations but may underestimate the impact of global pressures and interdependencies (May, 2007). \n\nThe third approach, which examines the interplay between domestic and international factors, offers a more nuanced understanding of global lawmaking. This perspective recognizes that international agreements are not merely imposed on nations but are co-constituted through complex interactions between global and local actors. The negotiation and implementation of IP agreements often involve a dynamic process of adaptation and resistance, where domestic policies are shaped by international norms and vice versa (Roffe, 2004). This approach aligns with the concept of legal pluralism, which acknowledges the coexistence of multiple legal systems and the fluidity of legal boundaries (Berman, 2007). \n\nBuilding on these methodological insights, scholars have called for a co-constitutive approach to studying global lawmaking. This approach advocates for an integrated analysis that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements. By examining the reciprocal influences between global and local actors, researchers can better understand the complexities of international agreements and their impact on national policies (Shaffer, 2005). Such an approach is particularly relevant in the context of international health emergencies, where the need for coordinated global responses must be balanced with respect for national sovereignty and local needs. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of global lawmaking through the lens of IP and international health emergencies provides valuable lessons for understanding the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors. The TRIPS agreement and its subsequent developments illustrate the challenges and opportunities of negotiating international rules that balance economic interests with public health imperatives. By adopting a co-constitutive approach, researchers can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of global lawmaking processes and their implications for health policy and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Information Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy?", "authors": "Peter Drahos, John Braithwaite", "journal": "Earthscan", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights", "authors": "Susan K.
