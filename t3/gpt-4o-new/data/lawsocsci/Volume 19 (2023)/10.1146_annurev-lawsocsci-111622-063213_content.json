{"Literature Review": "The issue of bias and discrimination is deeply entrenched in societal structures, and efforts to mitigate these biases have been a focal point of social science research. The traditional approach to debiasing has often involved training programs aimed at altering individual cognitive processes. However, the efficacy of these interventions has been questioned due to their transient effects. Research indicates that the impact of debias training on cognitive patterns is ephemeral, often dissipating within 24 hours, and the influence on behavior is minimal (Lai et al., 2016). This raises questions about the effectiveness of such interventions in the context of a society structured by historical and contemporary laws and policies that perpetuate segregation and stratification.\n\nThe social cognitive perspective suggests that biases are not merely individual failings but are deeply embedded in the social environment. Implicit biases, which are automatic and unconscious, are shaped by societal norms and structures (Greenwald & Krieger, 2006). These biases are reinforced by laws and policies that historically have created and maintained social hierarchies. For instance, Jim Crow laws in the United States institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination, embedding racial biases into the social fabric (Alexander, 2012). Such legal frameworks not only reflect societal biases but also perpetuate them by normalizing discriminatory practices.\n\nThe role of laws and policies in shaping social cognition is further illustrated by the concept of 'structural racism,' which refers to the systemic nature of racial bias embedded in laws, policies, and institutions (Bonilla-Silva, 1997). Structural racism creates environments where biases are learned and reinforced, making it challenging for individual-level interventions to have lasting effects. This is supported by research showing that environments characterized by inequality and segregation foster intergroup biases (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005).\n\nGiven the limitations of individual-focused debiasing strategies, there is a growing recognition of the need for systemic interventions. Laws and policies can serve as powerful tools for social change by altering the environments that give rise to and sustain biases. For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States was a landmark policy that aimed to dismantle institutionalized racial discrimination. By prohibiting discrimination in public places, employment, and education, it sought to create a more equitable social structure (Graham, 1990).\n\nResearch on the effects of policy interventions on bias reduction suggests that legal and policy changes can lead to significant shifts in social norms and attitudes. For instance, the legalization of same-sex marriage in various countries has been associated with increased acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals and a reduction in related biases (Flores & Barclay, 2016). This demonstrates the potential of laws and policies to not only change behaviors but also influence underlying attitudes and beliefs.\n\nMoreover, policies that promote integration and diversity have been shown to reduce intergroup biases. Contact theory posits that intergroup contact under appropriate conditions can reduce prejudice (Allport, 1954). Policies that facilitate such contact, such as desegregation efforts in schools, have been found to decrease racial biases and improve intergroup relations (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). These findings underscore the importance of creating environments that foster positive intergroup interactions as a means of reducing bias.\n\nIn conclusion, while individual-level debiasing interventions have limited efficacy, laws and policies offer a promising avenue for creating lasting change in social cognition and reducing discrimination. By addressing the structural and environmental factors that contribute to bias, legal and policy interventions can reshape social norms and promote equality. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms through which laws and policies can effectively serve as debiasing social interventions, with a focus on creating inclusive and equitable environments.", "References": [{"title": "Reducing implicit racial preferences: I.
