{"Literature Review": "The Guantánamo Bay detention facility, established in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, has become a symbol of the United States' controversial approach to counterterrorism. Its legacy is deeply intertwined with issues of torture, war crimes, and the erosion of legal norms, reflecting broader tensions in US politics and law. This literature review examines the multifaceted legacy of Guantánamo, focusing on its legal, political, and ethical implications across four US administrations. \n\nThe establishment of Guantánamo Bay as a detention facility was initially justified by the Bush administration as a necessary measure in the 'war on terror.' The facility was intended to house 'enemy combatants' who were deemed a threat to national security. However, the legal status of these detainees was ambiguous, as they were not afforded the protections of the Geneva Conventions, nor were they tried in civilian courts (Rasul v. Bush, 2004). This ambiguity led to significant legal challenges, with the Supreme Court eventually ruling that detainees had the right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus petitions (Boumediene v. Bush, 2008). These rulings underscored the tension between national security and civil liberties, a theme that has persisted throughout Guantánamo's history (Hafetz, 2011).\n\nThe use of enhanced interrogation techniques, often described as torture, at Guantánamo and other CIA black sites has been a focal point of criticism. Reports by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other human rights organizations have documented the use of waterboarding, stress positions, and other forms of physical and psychological abuse (ICRC, 2007). These practices have been widely condemned as violations of international law, including the Convention Against Torture, to which the US is a signatory (Sands, 2008). The Obama administration's decision to ban these techniques and close CIA black sites marked a significant policy shift, although the failure to close Guantánamo itself highlighted the complexities of dismantling the post-9/11 security apparatus (Savage, 2011).\n\nThe military commissions established to try Guantánamo detainees have also been a source of controversy. Critics argue that these commissions lack the procedural safeguards of civilian courts, undermining the rule of law (Fidell, 2013). The commissions have been plagued by legal challenges, delays, and questions about their legitimacy, with only a handful of convictions secured over two decades. The Obama administration's attempt to try some detainees in federal courts was met with political resistance, reflecting the deep partisan divides over Guantánamo's future (Goldsmith, 2012).\n\nGuantánamo's legacy is further complicated by its symbolic significance. For many, it represents a departure from American values and a stain on the country's human rights record. The facility has been used as a recruitment tool by terrorist organizations, who cite it as evidence of US hypocrisy (McCoy, 2006). Domestically, Guantánamo has become a political football, with Republicans and Democrats offering starkly different narratives about its necessity and morality (Kurnaz, 2008). This polarization has hindered efforts to develop a coherent policy on detention and interrogation, contributing to the facility's continued operation.\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to Guantánamo was characterized by a return to hardline policies, including the resumption of military commissions and the expansion of detention authority (Bellinger, 2017). However, the Biden administration has signaled a desire to close the facility, though significant legal and political obstacles remain. The lack of a national consensus on Guantánamo reflects broader challenges in US politics, where partisanship often impedes the development of effective and ethical counterterrorism strategies (Wittes, 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, Guantánamo's legacy is a testament to the complexities of balancing security and liberty in the post-9/11 era. The facility's continued existence highlights the difficulties of reconciling national security imperatives with the rule of law and human rights. As the US grapples with these challenges, Guantánamo remains a potent symbol of the unresolved tensions at the heart of its counterterrorism policies.", "References": [{"title": "Rasul v.
