{"Literature Review": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in the study of molecular bricks of life, such as DNA bases and amino acids. These molecules are fundamental to biological processes, and understanding their spectral signatures is crucial for insights into their structure and function. However, the complexity of these molecules poses significant challenges for both experimental and theoretical spectroscopy. The primary challenge lies in the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with molecular size and the presence of large-amplitude internal motions, which complicate the interpretation of gas-phase spectra. \n\nQuantum-chemical computations have been instrumental in predicting the spectral properties of molecules. However, the accuracy of these predictions is often limited by the computational cost associated with large molecules. For instance, the computational expense of high-level ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster theory, increases steeply with the number of electrons and the size of the basis set (Bartlett and Musiał, 2007). This makes it challenging to apply these methods to medium-sized molecules, which are typical of the molecular bricks of life. To address this, researchers have developed various strategies, such as composite methods and reduced-scaling techniques, to balance accuracy and computational feasibility (Helgaker et al., 2012). \n\nThe presence of large-amplitude internal motions in molecules like amino acids and nucleobases further complicates the spectral analysis. These motions lead to anharmonicity in vibrational spectra, which cannot be accurately captured by the harmonic approximation commonly used in quantum-chemical calculations (Barone, 2005). Anharmonic corrections are necessary to obtain reliable vibrational frequencies and intensities, and several methods have been proposed to incorporate these effects, including vibrational perturbation theory and variational approaches (Christiansen, 2004). \n\nRotational spectroscopy, which provides detailed information about molecular structure, is also affected by the complexity of these molecules. The rotational spectra of medium-sized molecules are often congested due to the presence of numerous rotational transitions, making spectral assignment challenging (Pate et al., 2015). Advances in computational techniques, such as the use of machine learning algorithms for spectral assignment, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges (Qu et al., 2018). \n\nDespite these challenges, significant progress has been made in the computational spectroscopy of molecular bricks of life. For example, the use of density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent variant (TD-DFT) has become widespread due to their relatively low computational cost and reasonable accuracy for large systems (Koch and Holthausen, 2001). However, the accuracy of DFT is highly dependent on the choice of the functional, and ongoing research aims to develop functionals that can accurately describe the electronic structure of complex biomolecules (Becke, 2014). \n\nMoreover, the integration of experimental and computational approaches has proven to be a powerful strategy for studying these systems. For instance, the combination of high-resolution spectroscopy with quantum-chemical calculations has enabled the accurate determination of molecular structures and the identification of conformers in the gas phase (Schnell et al., 2013). This synergy between theory and experiment is essential for advancing our understanding of the molecular bricks of life. \n\nIn conclusion, while the gas-phase computational spectroscopy of molecular bricks of life presents significant challenges, ongoing developments in computational methods and the integration of experimental data are paving the way for more accurate and comprehensive studies. Future research will likely focus on further improving the accuracy and efficiency of quantum-chemical methods, as well as developing new techniques for handling the complexity of these systems. The continued collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians will be crucial in overcoming the challenges associated with the spectral analysis of these fundamental biological molecules.", "References": [{"title": "Coupled-cluster theory in quantum chemistry", "authors": "Rodney J.
