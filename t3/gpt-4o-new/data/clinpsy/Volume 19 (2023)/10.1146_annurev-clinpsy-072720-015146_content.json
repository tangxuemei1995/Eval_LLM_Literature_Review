{"Literature Review": "The mental health of African American youth is a critical area of study, particularly in the context of pervasive racism and its detrimental effects. Racism is a significant stressor that can lead to adverse mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem among African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults (Anderson et al., 2019). However, resilience factors such as racial and ethnic identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting practices have been identified as protective mechanisms that can mitigate these negative impacts. This literature review explores these resilience factors, examining their roles and the mechanisms through which they operate, while also addressing critiques and gaps in the existing research.\n\nRacial and ethnic identity is a well-documented resilience factor that can buffer the effects of racism on mental health. A strong racial identity can enhance self-esteem and provide a sense of belonging and purpose, which are crucial for psychological well-being (Sellers et al., 2006). Research by Neblett et al. (2013) suggests that a positive racial identity can reduce the psychological distress associated with racial discrimination. This protective effect is thought to arise from the internalization of positive group values and the development of coping strategies that are specific to racial and ethnic experiences. However, critiques of this body of research highlight the need for more nuanced understandings of how racial identity interacts with other social identities, such as gender and socioeconomic status, to influence mental health outcomes (Seaton et al., 2011).\n\nEthnic-racial socialization, the process by which parents and caregivers transmit cultural values and beliefs to their children, is another critical resilience factor. This socialization can take various forms, including cultural socialization, preparation for bias, and promotion of mistrust (Hughes et al., 2006). Studies have shown that ethnic-racial socialization can enhance self-esteem and academic achievement, while also providing children with the tools to navigate and resist racial discrimination (Hughes et al., 2009). However, the effectiveness of these socialization practices can vary depending on the context and the specific messages conveyed. For instance, preparation for bias messages can be protective, but if not balanced with messages of cultural pride, they may lead to increased anxiety and mistrust (Neblett et al., 2008).\n\nReligiosity and spirituality are also significant resilience factors for African American youth. These factors provide a framework for meaning-making and offer social support networks that can be crucial in times of stress (Mattis et al., 2004). Research indicates that religious involvement is associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety among African American adolescents (Breland-Noble et al., 2015). Spirituality, in particular, can foster a sense of hope and purpose, which are essential for resilience. However, the role of religiosity and spirituality in mental health is complex and can be influenced by the type of religious beliefs and practices, as well as the broader cultural context (Chatters et al., 2008).\n\nFamily and parenting practices are foundational to the development of resilience in African American youth. Supportive family environments that emphasize warmth, communication, and cultural pride can buffer the negative effects of racism (McLoyd et al., 2000). Parenting practices that promote autonomy and critical thinking can also empower youth to challenge and resist discriminatory experiences (Brody et al., 2006). However, research has pointed out that the effectiveness of these practices can be contingent on the broader social and economic context, highlighting the need for policies that support family stability and economic security (Conger et al., 2002).\n\nRecent studies have expanded the understanding of these resilience factors by incorporating considerations of gender, cultural context, and structural racism. For example, gender differences in the experience and impact of racism have been explored, with findings suggesting that African American boys and girls may benefit from different types of resilience strategies (Seaton et al., 2014). Additionally, the role of structural racism in shaping the context in which these resilience factors operate has been increasingly recognized, underscoring the need for systemic interventions that address the root causes of racial disparities in mental health (Williams et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the resilience factors that protect African American youth from the mental health impacts of racism, there remain critical gaps and challenges. Future research should continue to explore the intersections of race, gender, and socioeconomic status, and the ways in which these intersecting identities influence resilience. Moreover, there is a need for longitudinal studies that can capture the dynamic nature of resilience over time. Finally, translating these research findings into effective prevention and intervention strategies, as well as policies that promote mental health equity, remains a crucial goal.", "References": [{"title": "Racial identity, racial discrimination, perceived stress, and psychological distress among African American young adults", "authors": "Anderson, R.
