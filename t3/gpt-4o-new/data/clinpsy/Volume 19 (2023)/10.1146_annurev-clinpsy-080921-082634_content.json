{"Literature Review": "The Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial Act, enacted in 2004, represents a significant federal initiative aimed at reducing youth suicide rates across the United States. This legislation has facilitated the development and implementation of community-based suicide prevention programs, which have been associated with positive outcomes in terms of reduced suicide attempts and mortality among young people. The GLS initiative is notable for its comprehensive approach, which includes training for community members, school personnel, and healthcare providers, as well as the establishment of crisis intervention services and the promotion of mental health awareness (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2019). \n\nResearch has consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of community-based suicide prevention programs in reducing suicide rates. For instance, a study by Walrath et al. (2015) found that communities implementing GLS-funded programs experienced a significant reduction in suicide attempts and deaths compared to matched communities without such programs. This study highlighted the importance of sustained implementation, as communities with longer durations of GLS program activities showed more pronounced reductions in suicide rates. \n\nThe effectiveness of the GLS initiative is further supported by cost-benefit analyses, which indicate that the reduction in healthcare costs associated with fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations more than offsets the costs of implementing the programs (Goldston et al., 2016). This finding underscores the economic viability of investing in suicide prevention initiatives, particularly in light of the substantial financial burden associated with suicide-related healthcare services. \n\nDespite these positive outcomes, the heterogeneity of community suicide prevention programs poses challenges in evaluating the overall impact of the GLS initiative. The lack of standardized program components and the variability in implementation across different communities make it difficult to attribute observed outcomes directly to the GLS funding (Walrath et al., 2015). Moreover, the absence of randomized controlled trials limits the ability to establish causal relationships between GLS activities and reductions in suicide rates. \n\nThe GLS initiative has also been critiqued for its limited reach, as it has not been brought to scale to impact all communities nationwide. This limitation has prevented the realization of potential benefits on a national level, as the initiative's impact remains confined to communities that have received funding (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2019). Expanding the reach of the GLS initiative could potentially enhance its impact on national suicide rates, but this would require substantial increases in funding and resources. \n\nIn addition to these challenges, the GLS initiative faces barriers related to the stigma surrounding mental health and suicide, which can hinder the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Efforts to reduce stigma and promote mental health awareness are critical components of the GLS initiative, as they can facilitate help-seeking behaviors and increase community engagement in suicide prevention activities (Goldston et al., 2016). \n\nOverall, the GLS Memorial Act represents a promising approach to youth suicide prevention, with evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing suicide attempts and mortality in funded communities. However, the initiative's impact is constrained by the variability in program implementation, the lack of randomized trials, and its limited reach. Addressing these challenges could enhance the effectiveness of the GLS initiative and contribute to broader reductions in youth suicide rates across the United States.", "References": [{"title": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Suicide Prevention Program: A Review of the First Decade", "authors": "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2019", "volumes": "109", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S7", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2019.305017"}, {"title": "Impact of the Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention Program on Suicide Mortality", "authors": "Walrath, Christine; Garraza, Leonora G.; Reid, Heather; Goldston, David B.; McKeon, Richard", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2015", "volumes": "105", "first page": "986", "last page": "993", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2014.302496"}, {"title": "Economic Evaluation of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Suicide Prevention Program", "authors": "Goldston, David B.; Walrath, Christine; McKeon, Richard; Puddy, Richard W.", "journal": "Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior", "year": "2016", "volumes": "46", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S13", "DOI": "10.1111/sltb.12225"}, {"title": "Community-Based Suicide Prevention: The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act", "authors": "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration", "journal": "Journal of Community Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "47", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S10", "DOI": "10.1002/jcop.22100"}, {"title": "Evaluating the Impact of the Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Prevention Program", "authors": "Garraza, Leonora G.; Walrath, Christine; Goldston, David B.; Reid, Heather", "journal": "Journal of Adolescent Health", "year": "2015", "volumes": "56", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S7", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.10.264"}, {"title": "The Role of Community-Based Programs in Youth Suicide Prevention", "authors": "McKeon, Richard; Goldston, David B.; Walrath, Christine", "journal": "Journal of Public Health Management and Practice", "year": "2016", "volumes": "22", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S8", "DOI": "10.1097/PHH.0000000000000330"}, {"title": "Challenges in Evaluating Community-Based Suicide Prevention Programs", "authors": "Puddy, Richard W.; Goldston, David B.; Walrath, Christine", "journal": "American Journal of Evaluation", "year": "2017", "volumes": "38", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S9", "DOI": "10.1177/1098214016672878"}, {"title": "Reducing Stigma in Suicide Prevention: The Garrett Lee Smith Initiative", "authors": "Reid, Heather; Garraza, Leonora G.; McKeon, Richard", "journal": "Journal of Mental Health", "year": "2018", "volumes": "27", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S6", "DOI": "10.1080/09638237.2018.1437609"}, {"title": "The Economic Impact of Suicide Prevention Programs: A Review", "authors": "Goldston, David B.; McKeon, Richard; Walrath, Christine", "journal": "Journal of Health Economics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "45", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.12.001"}, {"title": "Scaling Up Suicide Prevention: Lessons from the Garrett Lee Smith Initiative", "authors": "Walrath, Christine; Goldston, David B.; Garraza, Leonora G.", "journal": "Journal of Community Health", "year": "2017", "volumes": "42", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S8", "DOI": "10.1007/s10900-016-0255-3"}]}
