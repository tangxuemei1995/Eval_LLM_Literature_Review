{"Literature Review": "Eating disorders, traditionally perceived as conditions predominantly affecting females, have increasingly been recognized as significant health concerns for boys and men. This shift in understanding has been driven by a growing body of research that highlights the prevalence, risk factors, and unique challenges faced by males with eating disorders. Historically, the underrepresentation of males in eating disorder research has led to a lack of awareness and understanding of how these disorders manifest in boys and men. However, recent studies have begun to fill this gap, providing valuable insights into the epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment outcomes for this population. \n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that eating disorders in males are more common than previously thought. A study by Hudson et al. (2007) found that approximately 25% of individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are male, while the prevalence of binge eating disorder is nearly equal between genders. This finding is supported by Raevuori et al. (2009), who reported that the lifetime prevalence of eating disorders in males is significant, though often underdiagnosed due to gender biases in diagnostic criteria and societal perceptions. \n\nMuscle dysmorphia, a subtype of body dysmorphic disorder characterized by an obsession with muscularity, is particularly prevalent among males. Pope et al. (2000) identified muscle dysmorphia as a condition that predominantly affects men, often leading to excessive exercise, dietary restrictions, and the use of performance-enhancing substances. This condition is closely linked to societal pressures and ideals of masculinity, which emphasize muscularity as a key component of male attractiveness and success. \n\nCertain groups of men are at increased risk for developing eating disorders. Athletes, particularly those in sports that emphasize weight control or aesthetic appearance, such as wrestling, bodybuilding, and gymnastics, are at heightened risk (Petrie et al., 2008). Additionally, men who identify as gay or bisexual may experience higher rates of eating disorders due to unique sociocultural pressures related to body image within these communities (Feldman & Meyer, 2007). \n\nSociocultural factors play a significant role in the development of eating disorders in males. The media's portrayal of the ideal male body as lean and muscular contributes to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors (Leit et al., 2002). Psychological factors, such as low self-esteem, perfectionism, and a history of trauma or abuse, have also been identified as risk factors for eating disorders in males (Stice, 2002). Biological factors, including genetic predispositions and neurobiological differences, are areas of ongoing research, with studies suggesting that these may contribute to the development of eating disorders in both males and females (Klump et al., 2009). \n\nAssessment measures for eating disorders have traditionally been developed with females in mind, leading to potential biases when applied to males. Male-specific assessment tools, such as the Male Body Attitudes Scale, have been developed to address these biases and provide more accurate diagnoses (Tylka et al., 2005). These tools consider the unique ways in which eating disorders manifest in males, such as a focus on muscularity rather than thinness. \n\nPrevention and treatment efforts for eating disorders in males have been less extensively studied than those for females. However, recent research has begun to explore effective interventions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating eating disorders in males, with adaptations to address male-specific concerns, such as muscle dysmorphia (Fairburn et al., 2003). Additionally, prevention programs that challenge societal norms around masculinity and promote body acceptance have shown promise in reducing the risk of eating disorders in males (Yager & O'Dea, 2008). \n\nMortality risk associated with eating disorders in males is a critical area of concern. Arcelus et al. (2011) found that eating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder, with males experiencing similar risks as females. This underscores the importance of early detection and intervention to improve outcomes for males with eating disorders. \n\nFuture research priorities include increasing the inclusion of males in epidemiological studies to better understand the incidence and prevalence of eating disorders in this population. Identifying neurobiological factors that contribute to risk, eliminating barriers to treatment access, and refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts are also crucial. Addressing these priorities will help to improve the understanding and treatment of eating disorders in boys and men, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for this underserved population.", "References": [{"title": "The prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication", "authors": "James I.
