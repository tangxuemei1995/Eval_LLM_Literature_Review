{"Literature Review": "Parental incarceration is a profound and complex issue that affects millions of children in the United States, posing significant risks to their emotional and behavioral development. The literature on this topic has expanded considerably over the past few decades, highlighting both the challenges and the resilience exhibited by these children. This review synthesizes current research on the adverse effects of parental incarceration, the factors contributing to resilience, and the implications for future research and practice. \n\nThe adverse effects of parental incarceration on children are well-documented. Children with incarcerated parents are at an increased risk for a range of emotional and behavioral problems, including anxiety, depression, aggression, and academic difficulties (Murray, Farrington, & Sekol, 2012). These children often experience stigma, economic hardship, and disruptions in caregiving, which can exacerbate their vulnerability (Wildeman & Western, 2010). The separation from a parent due to incarceration can lead to attachment disruptions and a sense of loss, further compounding the emotional distress experienced by these children (Poehlmann, 2005). \n\nDespite these challenges, research has also identified factors that contribute to resilience among children with incarcerated parents. Resilience is defined as the ability to adapt positively in the face of adversity. Several studies have highlighted the role of supportive relationships, particularly with non-incarcerated caregivers, in fostering resilience (Arditti, 2012). These relationships can provide emotional support, stability, and a sense of normalcy, which are crucial for children's well-being. Additionally, community-based interventions and programs that offer mentoring, counseling, and educational support have been shown to mitigate some of the negative impacts of parental incarceration (Miller, 2006). \n\nThe concept of resilience, however, requires a critical reframing. Traditional resilience research often focuses on individual traits and behaviors, potentially overlooking the broader social and structural factors that influence children's experiences. Scholars argue for a more contextualized approach that considers intersecting inequalities, such as race, socioeconomic status, and gender, which can shape the experiences and outcomes of children with incarcerated parents (Gonzalez, 2016). This perspective emphasizes the importance of addressing systemic issues, such as mass incarceration and social inequality, as part of efforts to support these children. \n\nMoreover, resilience research and practice should be viewed as complements to, rather than substitutes for, social and institutional change. While fostering resilience is important, it is equally crucial to advocate for policies and practices that reduce the prevalence and impact of parental incarceration. This includes reforming sentencing laws, improving prison conditions, and providing support for families affected by incarceration (Travis, Western, & Redburn, 2014). By addressing the root causes of parental incarceration and its associated inequalities, we can create a more just and supportive environment for children and families. \n\nIn conclusion, the literature on children with incarcerated parents highlights both the risks and the potential for resilience. Future research should continue to explore the complex interplay of individual, familial, and societal factors that influence children's outcomes. Additionally, there is a need for social justice-informed approaches that prioritize systemic change alongside efforts to support individual resilience. By adopting a holistic and intersectional perspective, researchers and practitioners can better address the needs of children with incarcerated parents and contribute to their positive development.", "References": [{"title": "Effects of parental imprisonment on child antisocial behaviour and mental health: a systematic review", "authors": "Joseph Murray, David P.
