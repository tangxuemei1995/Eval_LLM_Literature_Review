{"Literature Review": "Supernatural attributions, encompassing beliefs in entities such as God, the devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma, are deeply embedded in the cultural and psychological fabric of many societies. These beliefs, while often overlooked in clinical psychology, play a significant role in shaping human behavior and cognition. The literature on supernatural beliefs is vast and interdisciplinary, spanning psychology, anthropology, sociology, and religious studies. This review aims to synthesize key findings from these fields, highlighting the psychological relevance of supernatural attributions. \n\nSupernatural beliefs often serve as coping mechanisms, providing individuals with a framework to understand and manage life's uncertainties and adversities. Pargament et al. (2000) found that religious coping, which often involves supernatural attributions, can be a significant resource for individuals facing stress and trauma. These beliefs offer a sense of control and predictability, which can be psychologically comforting. For instance, attributing a positive outcome to divine intervention can enhance feelings of gratitude and hope, while attributing negative events to malevolent forces can externalize blame and reduce self-criticism (Pargament et al., 2000).\n\nHowever, supernatural attributions can also be sources of distress. When individuals perceive themselves as being punished by supernatural forces, it can lead to feelings of guilt, anxiety, and depression. Exline et al. (2014) explored the concept of spiritual struggles, where individuals experience conflict, doubt, or distress related to their supernatural beliefs. These struggles can exacerbate mental health issues, particularly when individuals feel abandoned or punished by a higher power. The dual role of supernatural beliefs as both coping resources and sources of distress underscores their complexity and the need for nuanced understanding in clinical settings.\n\nSupernatural attributions are also significant in the context of psychopathology. Some studies suggest that certain cognitive styles and personality traits predispose individuals to supernatural beliefs. For example, individuals with a high need for closure or those who prefer intuitive thinking over analytical reasoning are more likely to endorse supernatural explanations (Lindeman & Aarnio, 2006). Moreover, certain psychopathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, are associated with heightened supernatural beliefs, particularly those involving paranoia or delusions of control (Siddle et al., 2002). Understanding these associations is crucial for clinicians, as it can inform diagnostic and therapeutic processes.\n\nCultural and social influences play a pivotal role in shaping supernatural attributions. Beliefs in supernatural entities and forces are often deeply rooted in cultural narratives and traditions. For instance, in many Eastern cultures, karma is a prevalent belief that influences moral and ethical decision-making (White, 2010). Similarly, in Western societies, beliefs in God or divine intervention are often intertwined with cultural norms and values. These cultural contexts can influence how individuals interpret and respond to supernatural experiences, highlighting the importance of cultural competence in clinical practice.\n\nThe role of supernatural beliefs as moral guides and decision-making tools is another area of interest. Supernatural attributions often provide a moral framework that guides behavior and decision-making. For example, belief in karma can encourage prosocial behavior by promoting the idea that good deeds will be rewarded, while bad deeds will be punished (White, 2010). Similarly, belief in divine justice can influence individuals' perceptions of fairness and retribution (Shariff & Norenzayan, 2007). These moral frameworks can have profound implications for individual and collective behavior, influencing everything from personal relationships to societal norms.\n\nIn conclusion, supernatural attributions are a multifaceted phenomenon with significant psychological implications. They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, signals of psychopathology, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Understanding the diverse roles of supernatural beliefs requires an interdisciplinary approach that considers cognitive, cultural, and social factors. For clinical psychologists, engaging with this literature can enhance their understanding of clients' belief systems and improve therapeutic outcomes. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to explore the nuanced ways in which supernatural attributions intersect with mental health and well-being.", "References": [{"title": "The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE", "authors": "Kenneth I.
