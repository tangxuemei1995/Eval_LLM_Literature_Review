{"Literature Review": "Racism and social determinants of health have been increasingly recognized as critical factors influencing the prevalence and manifestation of psychosis, particularly among marginalized racial and ethnic groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified racism as a significant public health threat, underscoring the need to understand its impact on mental health outcomes, including psychosis (CDC, 2021). Structural racism, which refers to the systemic inequities embedded within societal institutions, plays a pivotal role in shaping the social determinants of health that contribute to the risk of psychosis. This literature review explores the relationship between racism, social determinants, and the extended psychosis phenotype, with a focus on Black and Latinx populations in the United States.\n\nResearch has consistently shown that Black and Latinx individuals are more likely to report psychotic experiences compared to their White counterparts. This disparity is largely attributed to social determinants such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and exposure to police violence (Veling et al., 2008; Compton & Shim, 2015). Racial discrimination, in particular, has been identified as a chronic stressor that can lead to heightened vulnerability to psychosis. Studies have demonstrated that experiences of racial discrimination are associated with increased levels of psychological distress, which can exacerbate symptoms of psychosis (Williams & Mohammed, 2009).\n\nFood insecurity is another critical social determinant that disproportionately affects Black and Latinx communities and has been linked to an increased risk of psychosis. Food insecurity can lead to nutritional deficiencies and chronic stress, both of which are known risk factors for the development of psychotic disorders (Weiser et al., 2015). Moreover, the stress associated with food insecurity can trigger or worsen psychotic symptoms, particularly in individuals who are already vulnerable due to other social and environmental stressors.\n\nPolice violence and the broader context of systemic violence against marginalized communities also contribute to the risk of psychosis. The trauma associated with police violence can have profound psychological effects, leading to increased rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues, including psychosis (Bor et al., 2018). The fear and stress generated by police violence can exacerbate existing mental health conditions and increase the likelihood of psychotic episodes.\n\nThe intergenerational transmission of stress and trauma is another important consideration in understanding the impact of racism on psychosis risk. Research suggests that the chronic stress experienced by Black and Latina pregnant mothers can have biological consequences for their offspring, potentially increasing the risk of psychosis in the next generation (Fine et al., 2020). This highlights the need for interventions that address the specific stressors faced by these populations to prevent the perpetuation of health disparities across generations.\n\nMultidisciplinary early psychosis interventions have shown promise in improving outcomes for individuals experiencing psychosis. These interventions typically involve coordinated care that addresses both the clinical and social needs of patients, including those related to racism and discrimination (Kane et al., 2016). However, access to such interventions remains limited, particularly for Black and Latinx individuals who may face additional barriers related to socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and cultural competence of providers.\n\nTo effectively address the impact of racism on psychosis, it is essential to dismantle the discriminatory structures that perpetuate health inequities. This requires a comprehensive approach that includes policy changes, community-based interventions, and efforts to increase awareness and understanding of the social determinants of health among healthcare providers and policymakers (Gee & Ford, 2011). By addressing the root causes of racial disparities in mental health, we can work towards a more equitable healthcare system that supports the mental well-being of all individuals, regardless of their racial or ethnic background.", "References": [{"title": "Racism and Health: Evidence and Needed Research", "authors": "David R.
