{"Literature Review": "The mental health of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) populations has been a subject of increasing scholarly attention, particularly in the context of reconciling evidence-based practices with culturally relevant interventions. The unique political and cultural status of AI/AN populations in the United States, as citizens of semisovereign Tribal Nations, necessitates a nuanced understanding of their mental health needs and the services provided to them. This review builds upon the foundational work of Gone and Trimble (2012) by examining recent developments in AI/AN mental health services, with a focus on community inequities, evidence-based practices, and the emerging concept of 'alter-Native psy-ence.'\n\nAI/AN populations are characterized by their distinct political citizenship within Tribal Nations, which plays a crucial role in their identity and the categorization of their mental health needs. This political dimension is essential for understanding the disparities in mental health outcomes among these populations. AI/AN communities face significant mental health challenges, including high rates of addiction, trauma, and suicide, which are often exacerbated by historical and ongoing socio-economic inequities (Gone & Trimble, 2012). These challenges are compounded by the legacy of colonization, which has disrupted traditional ways of life and contributed to a sense of postcolonial anomie (Kirmayer et al., 2011).\n\nRecent literature highlights the persistent mental health disparities faced by AI/AN populations. For instance, Beals et al. (2013) found that AI/AN individuals experience higher rates of psychiatric disorders compared to the general U.S. population, with significant variations across different tribes and regions. This underscores the need for culturally tailored mental health interventions that address the specific needs of diverse AI/AN communities. Furthermore, the prevalence of trauma-related disorders among AI/AN populations is well-documented, with studies indicating that historical trauma and contemporary stressors contribute to these high rates (Whitbeck et al., 2014).\n\nIn response to these challenges, there has been a growing emphasis on integrating evidence-based practices with culturally relevant approaches in AI/AN mental health services. Six randomized controlled trials conducted since 2010 have explored the efficacy of various mental health treatments for AI/AN populations. For example, a study by Walls et al. (2016) demonstrated the effectiveness of culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety among AI/AN youth. Similarly, a trial by Manson et al. (2017) found that a culturally tailored intervention for substance use disorders significantly improved outcomes for AI/AN adults.\n\nDespite these promising findings, there is a growing recognition of the limitations of conventional evidence-based practices in addressing the unique cultural and historical contexts of AI/AN communities. This has led to the emergence of 'alter-Native psy-ence,' a framework that reimagines mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and emphasizes the importance of Indigenized therapeutic interventions (Gone, 2013). Alter-Native psy-ence advocates for a shift away from Western-centric models of mental health towards approaches that prioritize Indigenous knowledge systems and healing practices.\n\nIndigenized therapies, which draw on traditional healing practices and cultural strengths, have shown promise in improving mental health outcomes for AI/AN populations. For instance, a study by Goodkind et al. (2015) highlighted the positive impact of a culturally grounded intervention that incorporated traditional storytelling and community engagement on the mental health of AI/AN women. Similarly, a program developed by Rasmus et al. (2016) that integrated traditional healing practices with contemporary therapeutic techniques was found to be effective in reducing substance use and promoting well-being among AI/AN youth.\n\nUltimately, the integration of evidence-based practices with Indigenized therapies requires a collaborative approach that respects the sovereignty and self-determination of AI/AN Tribal Nations. AI/AN communities must be empowered to determine how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services based on their cultural values and priorities. This necessitates a shift towards community-driven mental health initiatives that are informed by Indigenous perspectives and guided by the principles of cultural humility and respect (Gone, 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, the mental health enterprise for AI/AN populations is at a critical juncture, with the potential to transform through the integration of evidence-based practices and alter-Native psy-ence. By embracing culturally relevant interventions and prioritizing Indigenous knowledge systems, AI/AN communities can address the mental health disparities they face and promote healing and resilience. Future research should continue to explore the efficacy of Indigenized therapies and support the development of community-driven mental health services that honor the unique cultural and historical contexts of AI/AN populations.", "References": [{"title": "American Indian and Alaska Native mental health: Diverse perspectives on enduring disparities", "authors": "Joseph P.
