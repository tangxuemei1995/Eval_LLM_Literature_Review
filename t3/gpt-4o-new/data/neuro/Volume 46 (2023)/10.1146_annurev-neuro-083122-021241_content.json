{"Literature Review": "The architecture of the visual cortex has been a subject of extensive research, particularly in understanding how different species process visual information. The traditional view has been that the rodent primary visual cortex (V1) lacks the columnar organization seen in carnivores and primates, which has led to the assumption that rodents have a fundamentally different cortical network architecture (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). However, recent studies have challenged this notion by highlighting the presence of modular clusters in the mouse visual cortex, which play a crucial role in integrating feedforward and feedback information streams. \n\nThe concept of radial cell columns as a hallmark of cortical architecture was first introduced by Mountcastle (1957), who described the columnar organization in the somatosensory cortex of cats. This concept was later extended to the visual cortex, where orientation columns were identified as fundamental units of processing in primates (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). In contrast, the rodent V1 was thought to lack such orientation columns, leading to the belief that rodents process visual information differently. However, recent anatomical and functional studies have revealed that while orientation columns may be absent, the mouse visual cortex exhibits a modular organization that supports complex processing streams (Ohki et al., 2005).\n\nLayer 1 of the mouse visual cortex has been identified as a critical site for integrating thalamocortical inputs and intracortical processing streams. This layer receives dense inputs from the thalamus, which are organized into modular clusters that correspond to distinct sensory and sensorimotor functions (Larkum, 2013). These clusters are thought to facilitate the integration of feedforward and feedback information, allowing for the modulation of sensory processing based on contextual and behavioral demands (Petreanu et al., 2009). The presence of these modular clusters suggests that the mouse visual cortex is capable of sophisticated processing, despite the absence of traditional columnar organization.\n\nThe role of layer 1 in integrating feedforward and feedback information is further supported by studies on the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is highly expressed in this layer. Activation of these receptors has been shown to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity, suggesting that they play a role in the dynamic regulation of cortical processing streams (Gulledge et al., 2009). This modulation is thought to be crucial for the integration of sensory and sensorimotor information, allowing the cortex to adapt to changing environmental and behavioral contexts.\n\nIn addition to layer 1, projection neurons in the deeper layers of the mouse visual cortex also exhibit a modular organization. These neurons are involved in transthalamic communications, which are essential for coordinating sensory processing across different cortical areas (Sherman and Guillery, 2002). The modular organization of these projection neurons suggests that the mouse visual cortex is organized into distinct processing streams, each of which is specialized for different aspects of sensory and sensorimotor processing (Harris and Shepherd, 2015).\n\nThe integration of feedforward and feedback information streams in the mouse visual cortex is further supported by studies on patchy connections, which are a prominent feature of the cortical architecture. These connections form a network of interconnected modules that facilitate the flow of information across different cortical areas (Bosking et al., 1997). The presence of these patchy connections suggests that the mouse visual cortex is capable of complex processing, despite the absence of traditional columnar organization.\n\nIn conclusion, the mouse visual cortex exhibits a modular architecture that supports the integration of feedforward and feedback information streams. This architecture is characterized by modular clusters of inputs to layer 1 and projection neurons in the deeper layers, which facilitate the integration of sensory and sensorimotor information. The presence of patchy connections further supports the notion that the mouse visual cortex is capable of sophisticated processing, despite the absence of traditional columnar organization. These findings challenge the traditional view of the rodent visual cortex and suggest that it shares more similarities with the visual cortices of carnivores and primates than previously thought.", "References": [{"title": "Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex", "authors": "Hubel, D.
