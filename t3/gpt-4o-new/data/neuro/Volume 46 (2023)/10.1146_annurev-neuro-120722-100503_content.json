{"Literature Review": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues within the cerebral cortex is a complex process that plays a crucial role in navigation, visual processing, and perception. The vestibular system, which provides information about head position and movement, is often overshadowed by more dominant sensory modalities such as vision. However, recent research has highlighted its significant contribution to cortical sensory representation and sensory-driven decision-making, particularly in the context of spatial navigation. This literature review aims to synthesize current findings on the cortical integration of vestibular and visual cues, focusing on their role in enhancing perceptual accuracy and facilitating navigation-related decision-making. \n\nThe vestibular system's role in spatial orientation and navigation has been well-documented, with studies demonstrating its involvement in maintaining balance and stabilizing gaze during movement (Angelaki and Cullen, 2008). The vestibular system provides critical feedback about self-motion, which is integrated with visual information to form a coherent representation of the environment. This integration occurs in several cortical areas, including the parietal and temporal lobes, which are known to process multisensory information (Gu et al., 2008). \n\nRecent experimental approaches in rodents have provided insights into the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals. For instance, studies have shown that vestibular inputs are integrated with visual cues in the retrosplenial cortex, a region implicated in spatial navigation and memory (Chen et al., 2018). This integration enhances the accuracy of self-motion perception, allowing for more precise navigation and orientation. Furthermore, the vestibular system's contribution to visual processing is evident in its role in modulating visual cortex activity, thereby influencing visual perception and attention (Fetsch et al., 2010). \n\nThe integration of vestibular and visual cues is not limited to spatial navigation but extends to other cognitive functions such as decision-making. Vestibular signals provide a constant update on self-motion status, which is crucial for making rapid decisions during navigation. This process involves the integration of sensory information in the parietal cortex, where neurons encode both vestibular and visual signals to guide behavior (Britten, 2008). The ability to predict future states based on current sensory inputs is a key aspect of this integration, allowing for anticipatory adjustments in movement and perception. \n\nDespite these advances, several knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of vestibulo-visual integration. One major challenge is elucidating the precise neural mechanisms underlying this process. While studies have identified key cortical areas involved in multisensory integration, the specific pathways and synaptic interactions remain largely unknown. Additionally, the extent to which vestibular signals influence higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory and attention, is still under investigation. \n\nAnother area of interest is the role of vestibular signals in perceptual learning and adaptation. Research suggests that the integration of vestibular and visual cues can enhance perceptual learning by providing a more robust sensory representation (MacNeilage et al., 2008). This process may involve changes in synaptic plasticity within cortical circuits, leading to improved sensory discrimination and decision-making. Understanding the mechanisms of perceptual learning in the context of vestibulo-visual integration could have implications for developing interventions for sensory processing disorders. \n\nIn conclusion, the integration of vestibular and visual cues within the cerebral cortex is a dynamic process that enhances sensory perception and facilitates navigation-related decision-making. While significant progress has been made in understanding the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals, further research is needed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying this integration. Addressing these knowledge gaps will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the brain integrates multisensory information to guide behavior and perception.", "References": [{"title": "Multisensory integration: From perception to action", "authors": "Angelaki, D.
