{"Literature Review": "The concept of a cognitive map, first introduced by Tolman in 1948, has been a cornerstone in understanding how mammals navigate and represent space in their brains (Tolman, 1948). The entorhinal-hippocampal network plays a crucial role in this process, with neurons in these regions encoding various navigation-related variables. This review explores the development of these circuits and the computations that underpin spatial representation in the mammalian brain. \n\nThe hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are central to the formation of cognitive maps. Place cells in the hippocampus, discovered by O'Keefe and Dostrovsky in 1971, fire when an animal is in a specific location, providing a neural basis for spatial memory (O'Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971). Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, identified by Hafting et al. in 2005, exhibit a hexagonal firing pattern that covers the entire environment, offering a metric for spatial navigation (Hafting et al., 2005). Together, these cells form a network that encodes spatial information, allowing for the creation of a cognitive map. \n\nThe development of these spatially tuned neurons is a complex process that begins early in life. Studies have shown that the basic architecture of the hippocampal-entorhinal network is established prenatally, but the functional maturation of these circuits continues postnatally (Langston et al., 2010). During this period, environmental interactions play a significant role in shaping the development of spatial representations. For instance, exposure to enriched environments has been shown to enhance the development of place cells and improve spatial memory (Akers et al., 2014). \n\nThe ontogeny of grid cells follows a similar trajectory. Research indicates that grid cells emerge later than place cells, with their firing patterns becoming more stable and regular as the animal matures (Wills et al., 2010). This maturation process is thought to be influenced by sensory experiences and locomotor activity, which help refine the spatial tuning of these neurons. \n\nThe development of spatial representations is also influenced by genetic factors. Studies on genetically modified mice have revealed that certain genes are critical for the proper development of the entorhinal-hippocampal network. For example, the deletion of the gene Cntnap2 has been shown to disrupt the formation of grid cells, highlighting the importance of genetic regulation in the development of spatial circuits (Peñagarikano et al., 2011). \n\nIn addition to genetic and environmental factors, neural activity itself plays a crucial role in the development of spatial representations. Activity-dependent mechanisms, such as synaptic plasticity, are essential for the refinement of neural circuits and the establishment of stable cognitive maps. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a process that strengthens synaptic connections, has been implicated in the development of place cells and the consolidation of spatial memories (Bliss & Lømo, 1973). \n\nRecent advances in imaging and electrophysiological techniques have provided new insights into the development of spatial representations. For instance, in vivo calcium imaging has allowed researchers to track the activity of large populations of neurons over time, revealing how spatial representations evolve during development (Dombeck et al., 2010). These studies have shown that the emergence of spatially tuned neurons is a dynamic process, with significant changes occurring in response to environmental and experiential factors. \n\nThe development of cognitive maps is not only crucial for navigation but also for memory formation. The hippocampus is known to play a key role in the encoding and consolidation of episodic memories, which often contain spatial components (Scoville & Milner, 1957). The integration of spatial and non-spatial information in the hippocampal-entorhinal network allows for the formation of rich, context-dependent memories. \n\nIn conclusion, the development of circuits and computations for the representation of space in the brain is a multifaceted process influenced by genetic, environmental, and activity-dependent factors. Understanding the ontogeny of these spatial representations provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying navigation and memory. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between these factors and their impact on the development of cognitive maps.", "References": [{"title": "Cognitive maps in rats and men", "authors": "Edward C.
