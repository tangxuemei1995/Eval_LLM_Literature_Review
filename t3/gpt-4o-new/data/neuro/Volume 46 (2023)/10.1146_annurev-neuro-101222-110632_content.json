{"Literature Review": "The study of cognition has traditionally been dominated by language and introspection, often neglecting the evolutionary and biological underpinnings of cognitive processes. This oversight is particularly evident in the study of memory, where human-centric definitions have limited the scope of research, especially in non-human animals. Recent perspectives suggest that cognition, including memory, can be better understood through the lens of exaptation, where existing biological structures are co-opted for new functions. This approach emphasizes the body-brain partnership, highlighting how circuits originally evolved for bodily regulation have been repurposed for cognitive tasks. \n\nExaptation, a concept introduced by Gould and Vrba (1982), refers to the process by which features acquire functions for which they were not originally adapted. In the context of cognition, this suggests that neural circuits initially evolved for bodily functions, such as metabolic regulation, have been exapted for cognitive processes like memory and planning. The hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory, provides a compelling example of this process. It plays a dual role in both endocrine-homeostatic regulation and memory processing, particularly during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), which are critical for memory consolidation (Buzsáki, 2015). \n\nThe hippocampus is integral to the formation of cognitive maps, which are mental representations of spatial environments. These maps are not only crucial for navigation but also for simulating future scenarios and recalling past experiences. This ability to mentally travel through time is a hallmark of human cognition and is thought to have evolved from the need to predict and prepare for future states, a process deeply rooted in the regulation of bodily functions (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). The concept of cognitive maps aligns with the idea that the brain's primary function is to ensure the organism's survival by predicting and adapting to changes in the environment. \n\nThe role of the hippocampus in both memory and homeostasis underscores the interconnectedness of cognitive and bodily functions. During SWRs, the hippocampus engages in a form of offline processing, replaying sequences of neural activity that correspond to past experiences. This replay is thought to facilitate the consolidation of memories, allowing the organism to learn from past experiences and apply this knowledge to future situations (Girardeau et al., 2009). Moreover, SWRs have been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism, suggesting a direct link between memory processing and bodily regulation (Buzsáki, 2015). \n\nThe concept of allostasis, which refers to the process by which the body achieves stability through change, further illustrates the body-brain partnership in cognition. Allostasis involves the brain's ability to anticipate and adapt to future demands, a process that is inherently cognitive. The brain's predictive capabilities are not limited to bodily functions but extend to the external environment, allowing for complex behaviors such as planning and decision-making (Sterling, 2012). \n\nSleep, a state traditionally associated with rest and recovery, also plays a crucial role in the body-brain partnership. During sleep, the brain continues to engage in cognitive processes, such as memory consolidation and problem-solving. The persistence of SWRs during sleep highlights the ongoing interaction between cognitive and bodily functions, as these neural events are involved in both memory processing and the regulation of metabolic processes (Diekelmann and Born, 2010). \n\nIn conclusion, the exaptation of neural circuits for cognitive functions underscores the evolutionary continuity between bodily regulation and cognition. The hippocampus exemplifies this continuity, serving both homeostatic and cognitive roles. This perspective challenges traditional views of cognition as a purely mental process, emphasizing the importance of the body-brain partnership in understanding cognitive phenomena. By recognizing the evolutionary roots of cognitive processes, researchers can develop more comprehensive models of cognition that account for the complex interplay between the brain and the body.", "References": [{"title": "Exaptation—a missing term in the science of form", "authors": "Stephen Jay Gould, Elisabeth S.
