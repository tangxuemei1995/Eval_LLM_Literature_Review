{"Literature Review": "The bacterial flagellum and the injectisome are two remarkable examples of bacterial nanomachines that utilize the type III secretion system (T3SS) as a core component of their function. The T3SS is a highly conserved export machinery that plays a crucial role in the assembly of these structures and, in the case of the injectisome, in the translocation of effector proteins into host cells. The structural and functional insights into these systems have been significantly advanced by the advent of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), which have provided high-resolution images of these complex molecular machines.\n\nThe bacterial flagellum is a rotary motor that enables bacterial motility, a critical factor for survival and colonization in various environments. The flagellum is composed of three main parts: the basal body, the hook, and the filament. The basal body anchors the flagellum to the cell membrane and acts as a rotary motor, powered by the proton motive force across the bacterial membrane (Minamino et al., 2008). The hook acts as a universal joint, allowing the filament to rotate and propel the bacterium forward. The T3SS is integral to the assembly of the flagellum, facilitating the export of flagellar components across the bacterial membrane (Chevance and Hughes, 2008).\n\nThe injectisome, also known as the needle complex, is a specialized T3SS found in many pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia species. It functions as a molecular syringe, injecting effector proteins directly into host cells to manipulate host cellular processes and promote bacterial survival and replication (Cornelis, 2006). The injectisome is thought to have evolved from the flagellum, retaining the core T3SS machinery but acquiring additional components that enable its specialized function (Galan and Collmer, 1999).\n\nRecent advances in cryo-EM have provided detailed structural insights into both the flagellum and the injectisome. For instance, the structure of the Salmonella Typhimurium injectisome was resolved at near-atomic resolution, revealing the intricate architecture of the needle complex and its associated components (Hu et al., 2017). Similarly, the structure of the bacterial flagellum has been elucidated, providing insights into the arrangement of its various components and the mechanism of its rotary motion (Kojima and Blair, 2004).\n\nOne of the key similarities between the flagellum and the injectisome is the presence of a basal body that anchors the structure to the bacterial membrane. In both systems, the basal body is composed of multiple rings that span the inner and outer membranes, providing a stable platform for the assembly of the extracellular components (Macnab, 2003). The basal body also houses the T3SS export apparatus, which is responsible for the secretion of structural and effector proteins (Diepold and Armitage, 2015).\n\nDespite these similarities, there are also significant differences between the flagellum and the injectisome. The flagellum is a motility apparatus, with a long helical filament that rotates to propel the bacterium. In contrast, the injectisome is a secretion apparatus, with a shorter needle-like structure that penetrates host cell membranes to deliver effector proteins (Cornelis, 2006). The injectisome also contains additional components, such as the translocon, which forms a pore in the host cell membrane to facilitate the translocation of effector proteins (Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011).\n\nThe evolution of the injectisome from the flagellum is a fascinating example of how bacterial systems can be repurposed for new functions. The injectisome has retained the core T3SS machinery of the flagellum but has acquired additional components that enable its specialized role in pathogenesis. This evolutionary process has been driven by the need for pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host cells and evade host immune responses (Galan and Collmer, 1999).\n\nIn conclusion, the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome are two remarkable examples of bacterial nanomachines that utilize the T3SS as a core component of their function. Recent advances in cryo-EM have provided detailed structural insights into these systems, revealing the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions. These insights have not only enhanced our understanding of bacterial motility and pathogenesis but also have potential implications for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting these systems.", "References": [{"title": "The bacterial flagellum: machinery for motility and a lot more", "authors": "Minamino, Tohru; Imada, Katsumi; Namba, Keiichi", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "6", "first page": "464", "last page": "476", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro1904"}, {"title": "The type III secretion system: a bacterial device for close combat with cells of their eukaryotic host", "authors": "Cornelis, Guy R.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2006", "volumes": "361", "first page": "745", "last page": "760", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2005.1793"}, {"title": "Type III secretion systems: a structural and mechanistic perspective", "authors": "Diepold, Andreas; Armitage, Judith P.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "13", "first page": "343", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro3456"}, {"title": "The bacterial flagellum: reversible rotary propellor and type III export apparatus", "authors": "Chevance, Fabienne F.
