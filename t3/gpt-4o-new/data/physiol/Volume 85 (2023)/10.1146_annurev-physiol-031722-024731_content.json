{"Literature Review": "Perceptual decision-making is a complex cognitive process that involves interpreting sensory information to guide behavior. Traditional studies have often focused on stable environments with consistent stimuli and fixed decision rules, which do not fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world decision-making. Recent research has shifted towards understanding how the brain adapts to changing environments, highlighting the flexibility of perceptual decision-making processes. This review synthesizes findings from various studies to elucidate the neural mechanisms that enable this flexibility. \n\nOne of the key insights into flexible decision-making is the role of context-dependent neural activity. Contextual information can modulate decision-making processes, allowing individuals to adapt their behavior according to the demands of the environment. This flexibility is supported by a distributed network of brain regions, including the posterior parietal cortex, sensory and motor areas, subcortical structures, and the prefrontal cortex, which is traditionally associated with cognitive control (Mante et al., 2013). The prefrontal cortex, in particular, is crucial for integrating contextual information and adjusting decision policies accordingly (Miller & Cohen, 2001).\n\nThe posterior parietal cortex has been implicated in the integration of sensory information and the formation of perceptual decisions. Studies have shown that neurons in this region exhibit context-dependent activity, which reflects the integration of sensory inputs with task demands (Gold & Shadlen, 2007). This suggests that the posterior parietal cortex plays a pivotal role in adapting decision-making processes to changing contexts by modulating sensory representations based on task requirements.\n\nSensory and motor areas also contribute to flexible decision-making by encoding stimulus-action mappings that are context-dependent. For instance, research has demonstrated that sensory neurons can adjust their response properties based on the expected outcome of a decision, thereby influencing the selection of appropriate actions (Summerfield & de Lange, 2014). This dynamic encoding of sensory information allows for rapid adaptation to new environments and tasks.\n\nSubcortical regions, such as the basal ganglia, are involved in the modulation of decision-making processes through reinforcement learning mechanisms. These structures are thought to contribute to the flexibility of decision-making by updating decision policies based on feedback from previous actions (Frank et al., 2007). The basal ganglia's role in learning and adapting to new reward contingencies highlights its importance in flexible decision-making.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is a central hub for cognitive control and is essential for implementing flexible decision-making strategies. It integrates information from various brain regions to guide behavior according to current goals and environmental demands (Miller & Cohen, 2001). The prefrontal cortex's ability to maintain and manipulate information about task rules and context allows for the rapid adjustment of decision-making processes in response to changing conditions.\n\nRecent advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have provided further insights into the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making. For example, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have identified context-dependent changes in brain activity patterns that correlate with shifts in decision-making strategies (Duncan, 2010). Electrophysiological recordings have revealed that neurons in the prefrontal cortex and other regions exhibit dynamic changes in firing rates and patterns in response to different task demands (Rigotti et al., 2013).\n\nTheoretical models have also contributed to our understanding of flexible decision-making by simulating how neural networks can adapt to changing environments. These models suggest that flexibility arises from the interaction of multiple neural circuits that encode different aspects of decision-making, such as sensory evidence, task rules, and expected outcomes (Wang, 2008). By simulating the dynamics of these circuits, researchers can explore how changes in connectivity and synaptic weights contribute to the adaptation of decision-making processes.\n\nIn conclusion, the flexibility of perceptual decision-making is supported by a distributed network of brain regions that integrate contextual information to guide behavior. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility is crucial for advancing our knowledge of cognitive processes and has implications for developing interventions for disorders characterized by impaired decision-making. Future research should focus on elucidating the interactions between different brain regions and the computational principles that govern flexible decision-making. By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how the brain adapts to changing environments.", "References": [{"title": "Context-dependent computation by recurrent dynamics in prefrontal cortex", "authors": "Valerio Mante, David Sussillo, Krishna V.
