{"Literature Review": "Fatty acids (FAs) are crucial components of cellular membranes and serve as significant energy sources. Beyond their structural and energetic roles, FAs are pivotal in cellular signaling, influencing various physiological processes. The transport and signaling of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are mediated by specific membrane receptors, primarily CD36 and the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) FFAR1 and FFAR4. These receptors are integral to the regulation of metabolic pathways, impacting nutrient uptake, cell proliferation, differentiation, and the secretion of bioactive factors. Understanding the mechanisms of FA transport and signaling is essential, particularly given the association of impaired FA uptake with obesity-related complications such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nCD36, a multifunctional glycoprotein, is widely expressed in various tissues and plays a significant role in FA uptake and metabolism. It facilitates the uptake of LCFAs into cells, influencing lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Studies have shown that CD36 deficiency can lead to altered FA metabolism and insulin resistance, highlighting its importance in metabolic health (Silverstein & Febbraio, 2009). CD36 also participates in FA signaling, modulating pathways related to inflammation and oxidative stress, which are critical in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders (Koonen et al., 2007).\n\nThe GPCRs FFAR1 (also known as GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) are activated by medium to long-chain FAs and are involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and anti-inflammatory responses. FFAR1 is predominantly expressed in pancreatic β-cells and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thereby playing a crucial role in glucose homeostasis (Itoh et al., 2003). FFAR4, on the other hand, is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue and the gut, and is involved in anti-inflammatory signaling and the regulation of energy balance (Oh et al., 2010). Activation of FFAR4 by omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and exert anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases (Oh et al., 2014).\n\nThe signaling pathways activated by these receptors are complex and involve various intracellular mediators. For instance, CD36-mediated FA uptake is linked to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Tontonoz & Spiegelman, 2008). Similarly, FFAR1 and FFAR4 activation leads to the stimulation of intracellular signaling cascades involving protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are crucial for insulin secretion and anti-inflammatory responses (Briscoe et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2010).\n\nThe physiological implications of FA signaling are vast, influencing processes such as β-oxidation, tissue repair, and inflammation. β-oxidation, the process of FA breakdown for energy production, is tightly regulated by FA signaling pathways. CD36 and FFARs modulate the expression of enzymes involved in β-oxidation, thereby influencing energy expenditure and metabolic health (Hajri et al., 2002). Additionally, FA signaling plays a role in tissue repair and regeneration, with CD36 and FFAR4 being implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis and wound healing (Greenwalt et al., 1992; Oh et al., 2010).\n\nThe interplay between FA transport and signaling is also critical in the context of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Obesity is characterized by altered FA metabolism and impaired FA signaling, leading to insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. The dysregulation of CD36 and FFARs in obesity contributes to these metabolic disturbances, underscoring the importance of these receptors in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Hajri et al., 2002; Oh et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the transport and signaling of LCFAs via CD36 and FFARs are essential for maintaining metabolic health. These receptors not only facilitate FA uptake but also modulate key signaling pathways that influence metabolic processes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying FA transport and signaling can provide insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders and identify potential therapeutic targets for their treatment.", "References": [{"title": "CD36 and atherosclerosis", "authors": "Silverstein, Roy L., Febbraio, Maria", "journal": "Current Opinion in Lipidology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "20", "first page": "369", "last page": "375", "DOI": "10.1097/MOL.0b013e32832e0f4c"}, {"title": "CD36: a multifunctional scavenger receptor that contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism", "authors": "Koonen, Debby P.
