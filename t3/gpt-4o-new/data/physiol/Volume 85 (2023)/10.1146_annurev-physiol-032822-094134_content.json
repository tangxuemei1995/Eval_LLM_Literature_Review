{"Literature Review": "The liver is a vital organ with a remarkable capacity for regeneration, a phenomenon that has been recognized since ancient times. This regenerative ability is not only a fascinating biological process but also a critical aspect of clinical practices such as living donor liver transplantation. The liver's ability to regenerate is underpinned by its unique cellular architecture and the dynamic interplay of various cellular and molecular mechanisms. This review explores the multiple facets of cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the mammalian liver, focusing on liver zonation, heterogeneity, homeostasis, and the response to acute and chronic injury. \n\nLiver zonation refers to the spatial organization of metabolic functions within the liver lobule, which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and facilitating regeneration. The liver lobule is divided into zones based on the oxygen gradient, with periportal (zone 1), midzonal (zone 2), and pericentral (zone 3) regions, each exhibiting distinct metabolic activities (Gebhardt and Matz-Soja, 2014). This zonation is regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and Notch, which are essential for maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation during liver regeneration (Benhamouche et al., 2006). \n\nHeterogeneity within the liver is another critical factor that influences its regenerative capacity. The liver comprises various cell types, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, each playing distinct roles in liver function and regeneration (Miyaoka and Miyajima, 2013). Hepatocytes, the primary parenchymal cells, are the main drivers of liver regeneration. However, recent studies have highlighted the role of non-parenchymal cells in modulating the regenerative process. For instance, hepatic stellate cells, traditionally known for their role in fibrosis, have been shown to secrete growth factors that promote hepatocyte proliferation during regeneration (Kordes et al., 2014). \n\nCellular plasticity is a hallmark of liver regeneration, allowing cells to adapt and respond to injury. In response to acute injury, such as partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes rapidly re-enter the cell cycle to restore liver mass. This process is tightly regulated by a cascade of growth factors and cytokines, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which activate signaling pathways that drive cell proliferation (Michalopoulos, 2017). In contrast, chronic liver injury, such as that caused by viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse, can lead to a more complex regenerative response involving progenitor cells. These bipotential progenitor cells, also known as oval cells, can differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, contributing to liver regeneration when hepatocyte proliferation is impaired (Yanger et al., 2014). \n\nThe liver's regenerative capacity is not limitless, and chronic injury can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, conditions characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and impaired liver function. The transition from regeneration to fibrosis is mediated by the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the production of pro-fibrotic cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Hernandez-Gea and Friedman, 2011). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the balance between regeneration and fibrosis is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver regeneration and prevent chronic liver disease progression. \n\nRecent advances in liver regeneration research have focused on the role of the immune system in modulating the regenerative process. Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages, play a dual role in liver regeneration by clearing apoptotic cells and secreting cytokines that promote hepatocyte proliferation (Tacke and Zimmermann, 2014). Additionally, the recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages to the liver during injury has been shown to enhance regeneration by secreting pro-regenerative factors (Zhang et al., 2012). \n\nIn conclusion, the liver's ability to regenerate is a complex process involving a delicate balance of cellular and molecular mechanisms. Liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and plasticity are key factors that contribute to the liver's regenerative capacity. Understanding these processes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver regeneration and treat liver diseases. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular pathways that regulate liver regeneration and exploring the potential of stem cell-based therapies to promote liver repair.", "References": [{"title": "Liver zonation: Novel aspects of its regulation and its impact on homeostasis", "authors": "Gebhardt, R., Matz-Soja, M.", "journal": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "20", "first page": "8491", "last page": "8504", "DOI": "10.3748/wjg.v20.i26.8491"}, {"title": "Wnt/β-catenin signaling controls liver zonation and expansion of hepatocytes during liver development and regeneration", "authors": "Benhamouche, S., Decaens, T., Godard, C., Chambrey, R., Rickman, D.
