{"Literature Review": "The concept of learning without neurons in physical systems represents a paradigm shift in understanding how learning can occur outside traditional biological or computational frameworks. This emerging field, often referred to as physical learning, explores how physical systems can autonomously adapt and learn desirable properties through local learning rules. This review synthesizes recent theoretical and experimental advances in this domain, highlighting the potential of physical systems to solve complex inverse problems without the need for computational design. \n\nOne of the foundational concepts in physical learning is the ability of systems to adapt their parameters in response to environmental stimuli or usage examples. This is akin to the way biological systems learn and adapt, but without the neural networks typically associated with learning processes. For instance, molecular self-assembly is a process where molecules autonomously organize into structured arrangements, a phenomenon that can be harnessed for physical learning. Whitesides and Grzybowski (2002) discuss how self-assembly can be used to create complex structures without external guidance, providing a basis for understanding how physical systems can learn and adapt autonomously (Whitesides & Grzybowski, 2002).\n\nFlow networks are another area where physical learning has shown promise. These networks can adapt to optimize flow distribution in response to changing conditions, much like how neural networks adjust weights to minimize error. Ronellenfitsch and Katifori (2016) demonstrated that flow networks could evolve to optimize transport efficiency through local adaptation rules, highlighting the potential for physical systems to learn optimal configurations without explicit programming (Ronellenfitsch & Katifori, 2016).\n\nMechanical metamaterials, which are engineered materials with properties not found in naturally occurring substances, also exhibit learning capabilities. These materials can be designed to change their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli, effectively 'learning' new behaviors. Coulais et al. (2018) explored how mechanical metamaterials could be programmed to exhibit specific responses to mechanical inputs, demonstrating a form of physical learning where the material itself adapts to perform desired functions (Coulais, Sounas, & Alù, 2018).\n\nThe theoretical underpinnings of physical learning draw from concepts in machine learning and inverse design. Inverse design involves determining the system parameters that produce a desired outcome, a process that can be computationally intensive. However, physical learning systems can bypass this computational bottleneck by directly adapting to achieve the desired state. This is particularly advantageous in systems where an accurate model is difficult to obtain or where the system needs to adapt to changing conditions over time. For example, the work by Stern et al. (2020) on adaptive materials illustrates how physical systems can autonomously adjust to new environments, providing a practical advantage over traditional computational approaches (Stern, Bartal, & Fleischer, 2020).\n\nMoreover, physical learning machines offer a novel perspective on learning theory by incorporating physical constraints into the learning process. This integration challenges traditional views of learning, which often assume idealized conditions without considering the physical limitations of the system. The work by Horowitz and Esposito (2014) on thermodynamic constraints in learning processes provides insights into how physical laws can shape learning dynamics, suggesting that physical systems might exploit these constraints to enhance learning efficiency (Horowitz & Esposito, 2014).\n\nExperimental advances in physical learning have also been significant. For instance, the development of smart materials that can change properties in response to environmental changes exemplifies the practical applications of physical learning. These materials can be used in a variety of applications, from adaptive building materials to responsive clothing, showcasing the versatility of physical learning systems. The research by Liu et al. (2016) on smart hydrogels that respond to temperature changes is a prime example of how physical systems can be engineered to learn and adapt autonomously (Liu, Genzer, & Dickey, 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, the field of physical learning is rapidly evolving, offering new insights into how systems can learn and adapt without traditional computational frameworks. By leveraging the inherent properties of physical systems, researchers are uncovering new ways to solve complex problems and design adaptive materials. As this field continues to grow, it promises to redefine our understanding of learning and adaptation, with implications for a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines.", "References": [{"title": "Self-assembly at all scales", "authors": "George M.
