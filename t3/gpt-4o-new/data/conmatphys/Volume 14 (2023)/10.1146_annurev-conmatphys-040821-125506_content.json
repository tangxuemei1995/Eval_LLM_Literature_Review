{"Literature Review": "The study of odd viscosity and odd elasticity has emerged as a fascinating area of research in the field of continuum mechanics, challenging traditional notions of how materials respond to external forces. Traditionally, elasticity is associated with a material's ability to store energy, while viscosity is linked to energy dissipation. However, certain materials exhibit additional linear response coefficients, known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity, which lead to unconventional behaviors such as transverse responses, modified dislocation dynamics, and topological waves. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of odd viscosity and odd elasticity, exploring their phenomenology, the systems in which they arise, and the underlying microscopic mechanisms.\n\nOdd viscosity is a non-dissipative response that occurs in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, leading to a transverse flow that is perpendicular to the applied stress. This phenomenon was first theoretically predicted in quantum Hall fluids, where the Hall viscosity arises due to the presence of a magnetic field and the quantization of electronic states (Avron et al., 1995). Subsequent studies have extended the concept of odd viscosity to classical systems, such as chiral active fluids, where the breaking of time-reversal symmetry is achieved through active rotation or self-propulsion of particles (Banerjee et al., 2017). These systems exhibit unique flow patterns and instabilities that are not present in traditional viscous fluids.\n\nOdd elasticity, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a material to exhibit a non-conservative elastic response, where the stress is not solely determined by the strain but also depends on the rate of deformation. This behavior has been observed in systems with broken parity and time-reversal symmetries, such as metamaterials with chiral microstructures (Coulais et al., 2017). These materials can exhibit negative stiffness and non-reciprocal wave propagation, leading to novel mechanical properties that are not found in conventional elastic materials.\n\nThe phenomenology of odd viscosity and odd elasticity is rich and diverse, with implications for a wide range of physical systems. For instance, in quantum fluids, odd viscosity can lead to the emergence of topological edge modes and quantized transport properties, which are of great interest for applications in quantum computing and spintronics (Read, 2009). In astrophysical gases, odd viscosity can influence the dynamics of accretion disks and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe (Takahashi et al., 2016). In active and driven matter, odd viscosity and odd elasticity can give rise to novel collective behaviors, such as flocking, swarming, and pattern formation, which are relevant for understanding biological systems and designing synthetic materials (Marchetti et al., 2013).\n\nThe microscopic mechanisms underlying odd viscosity and odd elasticity are diverse and depend on the specific system under consideration. In quantum fluids, odd viscosity arises from the quantization of electronic states and the presence of a magnetic field, which breaks time-reversal symmetry (Avron et al., 1995). In chiral active fluids, odd viscosity is a result of the self-propulsion and active rotation of particles, which break both parity and time-reversal symmetries (Banerjee et al., 2017). In metamaterials, odd elasticity is achieved through the design of chiral microstructures that break parity symmetry and allow for non-reciprocal wave propagation (Coulais et al., 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, the study of odd viscosity and odd elasticity has opened up new avenues for research in continuum mechanics, with implications for a wide range of physical systems. These phenomena challenge traditional notions of material response and offer exciting opportunities for the design of novel materials with unique mechanical properties. Further research is needed to fully understand the microscopic mechanisms underlying odd viscosity and odd elasticity and to explore their potential applications in technology and industry.", "References": [{"title": "Viscosity of Quantum Hall Fluids", "authors": "Joseph E.
