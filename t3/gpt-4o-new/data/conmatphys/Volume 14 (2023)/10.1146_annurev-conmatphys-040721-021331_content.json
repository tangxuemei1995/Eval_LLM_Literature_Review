{"Literature Review": "The study of Fermi surfaces, traditionally known as fermiology, has evolved significantly with the discovery of topological metals. These materials exhibit Fermi surfaces characterized by nontrivial Berry phases, which have profound implications for their electronic properties. The Berry phase, a geometric phase acquired over a closed loop in momentum space, is a key feature distinguishing topological metals from conventional ones. This review explores the diagnostic potential of magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations in understanding the fermiology of topological metals. \n\nQuantum oscillations, such as the de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas effects, are powerful tools for probing the Fermi surface geometry. These oscillations arise from the quantization of electron orbits in a magnetic field and are sensitive to the topology of the Fermi surface. The phase offset of these oscillations, for instance, can reveal the presence of a nontrivial Berry phase, which is a hallmark of topological metals (Shoenberg, 1984). The Berry phase contributes an additional phase shift to the oscillations, which can be detected experimentally (Mikitik & Sharlai, 1999). \n\nThe orientation of the magnetic field relative to the crystallographic axes plays a crucial role in determining the characteristics of the quantum oscillations. For instance, in Dirac and Weyl semimetals, the direction of the magnetic field can influence the splitting of Fermi surface pockets due to spin-orbit coupling (Armitage, Mele, & Vishwanath, 2018). This splitting can lead to closely proximate pockets, which are sensitive to the Berry curvature and can result in observable changes in the oscillation waveform. \n\nThe symmetry class of the topological metal also affects the quantum oscillations. In systems with time-reversal symmetry, the Berry phase can lead to protected surface states that contribute to the oscillation signal (Hasan & Kane, 2010). These surface states are robust against perturbations, making them a distinctive feature of topological metals. In contrast, systems lacking certain symmetries may exhibit different oscillation patterns due to the presence of additional topological invariants (Fu, Kane, & Mele, 2007). \n\nMagnetic breakdown, a phenomenon where electrons tunnel between different Fermi surface pockets, is another critical aspect of topological metals. This effect is particularly relevant when pockets are closely proximate, either due to weak spin-orbit coupling or band-touching points (Pippard, 1989). Magnetic breakdown can lead to complex oscillation patterns that encode information about the Berry connection, a nonabelian generalization of the Berry phase (Fuchs et al., 2010). \n\nThe emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom in topological metals further enriches their fermiology. This pseudospin arises from the spin-momentum locking in Dirac and Weyl semimetals, leading to unique transport properties (Burkov & Balents, 2011). The interplay between pseudospin and Berry phase can result in novel quantum oscillation phenomena, such as the chiral anomaly, which manifests as an unusual negative magnetoresistance (Nielsen & Ninomiya, 1983). \n\nFuture research in topofermiology may explore interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities, which can lead to new phases of matter with exotic properties. Additionally, the study of two-dimensional electron liquids in topological metals could reveal new insights into the role of topology in low-dimensional systems (Novoselov et al., 2005). These directions hold promise for uncovering new aspects of quantum materials and their potential applications in technology. \n\nIn conclusion, the fermiology of topological metals is a rich and evolving field that combines elements of geometry, topology, and quantum mechanics. The study of quantum oscillations provides a window into the complex interplay of these factors, offering insights into the fundamental properties of topological metals. As experimental techniques continue to advance, the potential for discovering new topological phenomena in metals remains vast.", "References": [{"title": "Magnetic Oscillations in Metals", "authors": "David Shoenberg", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "1984", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Manifestation of Berry's phase in metal physics", "authors": "G.
