{"Literature Review": "Superconductivity, a quantum mechanical phenomenon characterized by zero electrical resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields, is fundamentally influenced by the symmetries present in the material's crystal structure. In particular, inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry play crucial roles in determining the nature of Cooper pairs, the bound electron pairs responsible for superconductivity. The breaking of these symmetries can lead to novel superconducting phases with unique properties. In recent years, the study of superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials, where inversion symmetry is absent, has gained significant attention due to the emergence of unconventional superconducting states and potential topological phases. \n\nNoncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCS) are characterized by the absence of a center of inversion in their crystal lattice, leading to the presence of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC). This coupling can lift the spin degeneracy of electronic bands, resulting in a mixed singlet-triplet pairing state, which is not possible in centrosymmetric superconductors. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that ASOC can lead to a variety of exotic superconducting phenomena, including the possibility of topological superconductivity, which is of great interest for quantum computing applications due to its potential to host Majorana fermions [1]. \n\nThe concept of local inversion-symmetry breaking, where inversion symmetry is broken at a local level but preserved globally, introduces additional complexity to the study of superconductivity. In such systems, the local environment around certain atoms or clusters lacks inversion symmetry, leading to local Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. This can result in hidden spin polarization, where spin textures are present despite the global inversion symmetry of the crystal [2]. The presence of local inversion-symmetry breaking can significantly alter the electronic structure of the normal state, affecting the density of states and the Fermi surface topology, which in turn influences the superconducting properties [3]. \n\nMaterials with local inversion-symmetry breaking have been realized in various crystal structures, such as the CePt3Si family, where the lack of a global inversion center leads to unconventional superconducting behavior. In these materials, the interplay between strong electron correlations and ASOC can stabilize novel superconducting states, including those with mixed parity order parameters [4]. The classification of superconducting order parameters in such systems requires a careful consideration of the local symmetry environment, as traditional classification schemes based on global symmetries may not be applicable [5]. \n\nThe phenomenology of superconductivity in locally noncentrosymmetric materials is rich and varied. For instance, the presence of local Rashba spin-orbit coupling can lead to anisotropic superconducting gaps and the emergence of nodal structures, which are not typically expected in centrosymmetric superconductors. Additionally, the interplay between local inversion-symmetry breaking and external magnetic fields can give rise to unusual magnetoelectric effects, such as the magnetoelectric effect observed in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Li2(Pd,Pt)3B [6]. \n\nTopological superconductivity, a state of matter characterized by a nontrivial topology of the superconducting wave function, is another intriguing possibility in locally noncentrosymmetric materials. The presence of local inversion-symmetry breaking can facilitate the realization of topological superconducting phases by enabling the formation of nontrivial band structures and supporting the existence of Majorana modes at the material's surface or in vortex cores [7]. Recent experimental observations of zero-bias conductance peaks in tunneling spectroscopy measurements have provided evidence for the existence of such topological states in certain noncentrosymmetric superconductors [8]. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of superconductivity in materials with local inversion-symmetry breaking offers a fertile ground for discovering new superconducting phases and understanding the interplay between symmetry, electronic structure, and superconductivity. The unique properties of these materials, including the potential for topological superconductivity, make them promising candidates for future technological applications. Continued research in this area, both theoretical and experimental, is essential for unraveling the complex phenomena associated with local inversion-symmetry breaking and harnessing their potential for practical use [9, 10].", "References": [{"title": "Noncentrosymmetric superconductors: Introduction and overview", "authors": "E.
