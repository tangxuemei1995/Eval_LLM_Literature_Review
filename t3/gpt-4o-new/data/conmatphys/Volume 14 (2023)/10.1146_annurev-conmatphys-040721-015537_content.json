{"Literature Review": "Floquet engineering has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring novel phases of matter through periodic driving, which allows for the realization of states that are otherwise inaccessible in thermal equilibrium. The foundation of this approach lies in Floquet theory, which provides a framework for deriving an effective static Hamiltonian that describes the time-averaged dynamics of a periodically driven system. While much of the early work in this field focused on closed quantum systems, there is a growing recognition of the need to understand open quantum systems, where dissipation and decoherence play significant roles. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of Floquet states in open quantum systems, with a particular focus on the interplay between periodic driving and dissipation. \n\nThe study of Floquet systems in the context of open quantum systems is motivated by the ubiquity of dissipation in real-world systems. Dissipation, often modeled through coupling to an external environment, can lead to decoherence and energy exchange, which fundamentally alter the dynamics of the system. The formalism of quantum master equations has been extensively used to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. These equations provide a way to incorporate the effects of dissipation into the system's evolution, allowing for a more realistic description of experimental conditions. The Lindblad master equation is a particularly popular choice due to its ability to ensure complete positivity and trace preservation of the density matrix (Breuer and Petruccione, 2002). \n\nRecent advances in experimental techniques have enabled the engineering of dissipation in a controlled manner, opening new avenues for exploring nonequilibrium phases of matter. For instance, the ability to tailor dissipation has been used to stabilize exotic states such as time crystals and topological phases in driven-dissipative systems (Müller et al., 2012; Diehl et al., 2008). These developments have spurred theoretical investigations into the role of dissipation in Floquet systems, leading to a deeper understanding of how periodic driving can be used to control and manipulate quantum states in the presence of an environment. \n\nOne of the key questions in this area of research is whether the concepts of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be extended to Floquet systems. In closed systems, the Floquet Hamiltonian can often be used to define an effective temperature, allowing for the application of equilibrium concepts. However, in open systems, the presence of dissipation complicates this picture. Several studies have explored the conditions under which Floquet states can be described by an effective thermal distribution, with some suggesting that a generalized Gibbs ensemble may be applicable (Shirai et al., 2015; Iadecola and Chamon, 2015). \n\nThe interplay between periodic driving and dissipation has also been investigated in the context of quantum synchronization, where the goal is to achieve phase locking between the system and the driving field. This phenomenon has been observed in a variety of systems, including optomechanical resonators and trapped ions, and is thought to be a promising avenue for quantum control (Walter et al., 2014; Lee and Sadeghpour, 2013). Theoretical models have shown that dissipation can play a crucial role in stabilizing synchronized states, highlighting the importance of understanding the dissipative dynamics in Floquet systems. \n\nAnother area of active research is the study of topological properties in driven-dissipative systems. Floquet engineering has been used to realize topological phases that are not present in static systems, such as Floquet topological insulators and superconductors. The inclusion of dissipation adds an additional layer of complexity, as it can lead to the emergence of new topological phenomena that are unique to nonequilibrium settings (Rudner et al., 2009; Lindner et al., 2011). These studies have revealed that dissipation can both enhance and destroy topological order, depending on the specific system and driving parameters. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of Floquet states in open quantum systems is a rapidly evolving field that bridges the gap between nonequilibrium statistical physics and quantum control. The interplay between periodic driving and dissipation presents both challenges and opportunities for the realization of novel quantum states. As experimental techniques continue to advance, it is likely that our understanding of these systems will deepen, leading to new insights into the fundamental nature of quantum matter.", "References": [{"title": "The Theory of Open Quantum Systems", "authors": "Heinz-Peter Breuer, Francesco Petruccione", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Engineered dissipation for quantum information", "authors": "Markus Müller, Sebastian Diehl, Guido Pupillo, Peter Zoller", "journal": "Advances in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "61", "first page": "1", "last page": "80", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-396482-3.00001-6"}, {"title": "Quantum states and phases in driven open quantum systems with cold atoms", "authors": "Sebastian Diehl, Andreas Micheli, Alessandro Kantian, Bernd Kraus, Hans Peter Büchler, Peter Zoller", "journal": "Nature Physics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "4", "first page": "878", "last page": "883", "DOI": "10.1038/nphys1073"}, {"title": "Effective Floquet Hamiltonian in the presence of a time-periodic drive", "authors": "Tomonari Shirai, Takashi Mori, Shohei Miyashita", "journal": "Physical Review E", "year": "2015", "volumes": "91", "first page": "030101", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevE.91.030101"}, {"title": "Floquet topological insulators", "authors": "Gil Refael, Netanel H.
