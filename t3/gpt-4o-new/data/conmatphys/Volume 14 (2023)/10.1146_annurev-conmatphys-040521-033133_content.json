{"Literature Review": "The study of topological materials has significantly advanced our understanding of condensed matter physics, particularly through the concept of bulk-boundary correspondence. This principle, which links the bulk properties of a material to its boundary states, has been a cornerstone in the study of topological insulators and superconductors (Hasan and Kane, 2010). Recently, the exploration of non-Hermitian systems, where the Hamiltonians are not necessarily Hermitian, has opened new avenues in topological physics. Non-Hermitian systems are characterized by complex eigenvalues, which introduce novel phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (Yao and Wang, 2018). This review aims to synthesize recent developments in non-Hermitian topological physics, with a particular focus on boundary phenomena and the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology. \n\nThe extension of topological phases to non-Hermitian systems has been a significant development in recent years. Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can exhibit topological phases that are not possible in Hermitian systems, due to the complex nature of their eigenvalues (Gong et al., 2018). The non-Hermitian skin effect, a phenomenon where an extensive number of eigenstates localize at the boundary of a system, is a direct consequence of non-Hermiticity. This effect challenges the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, as the bulk properties alone are insufficient to predict the boundary states (Kunst et al., 2018). \n\nThe non-Hermitian skin effect has been observed in various systems, including photonic lattices and electronic circuits, where the boundary conditions significantly alter the spectrum of the system (Xiao et al., 2020). This sensitivity to boundary conditions is a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems and has led to the development of new theoretical frameworks to understand these phenomena. For instance, the concept of the generalized Brillouin zone has been introduced to account for the non-Hermitian skin effect, providing a more accurate description of the system's spectrum (Yokomizo and Murakami, 2019). \n\nIn addition to the non-Hermitian skin effect, non-Hermitian systems can exhibit exceptional points, where two or more eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. These points are unique to non-Hermitian systems and have been shown to lead to novel topological phases (Bergholtz et al., 2021). Exceptional points have been experimentally realized in various platforms, including optical systems and mechanical metamaterials, highlighting their potential for practical applications (Ozdemir et al., 2019). \n\nThe interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology has also led to the discovery of new topological invariants that characterize non-Hermitian systems. These invariants, such as the biorthogonal Chern number, extend the concept of topological invariants from Hermitian systems to non-Hermitian ones (Shen et al., 2018). The development of these invariants has provided deeper insights into the topological nature of non-Hermitian systems and has facilitated the classification of non-Hermitian topological phases. \n\nFurthermore, the study of non-Hermitian topological systems has revealed the existence of topological edge states that are robust against certain types of disorder and perturbations. These edge states, which arise due to the non-Hermitian skin effect, have potential applications in robust signal transmission and sensing (Weimann et al., 2017). The robustness of these states is a direct consequence of the topological nature of non-Hermitian systems, which protects them against specific types of perturbations. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of non-Hermitian topological phenomena has significantly expanded our understanding of topological physics. The unique features of non-Hermitian systems, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, have challenged traditional notions of bulk-boundary correspondence and have led to the development of new theoretical frameworks and topological invariants. As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that non-Hermitian systems will play an increasingly important role in the development of novel materials and devices with unique topological properties.", "References": [{"title": "Colloquium: Topological insulators", "authors": "Hasan, M.
