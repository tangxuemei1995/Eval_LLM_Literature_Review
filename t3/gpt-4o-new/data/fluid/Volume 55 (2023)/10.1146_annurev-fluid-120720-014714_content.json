{"Literature Review": "The study of free surface flows, particularly those involving singularities such as breakup and coalescence, is a critical area of research in fluid dynamics. These phenomena are characterized by complex multiscale interactions that challenge traditional computational methods. Sharp interface methods have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating these flows, offering the ability to capture the intricate dynamics of interfaces with high precision. This literature review explores the development and application of sharp interface methods in the context of free surface flows with singularities, focusing on the challenges and advancements in simulating drop breakup, coalescence, and related phenomena. \n\nThe breakup of liquid threads and the coalescence of droplets are processes that involve the formation and resolution of singularities, where the fluid interface undergoes topological changes. These events are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. However, the presence of singularities introduces significant computational challenges, as the equations become ill-posed at the point of singularity (Eggers, 1997). Traditional numerical methods, such as volume-of-fluid (VOF) and level-set methods, often struggle to accurately capture the dynamics near singularities due to their diffuse interface representation (Sussman et al., 1994). \n\nSharp interface methods, on the other hand, maintain a clear distinction between different phases, allowing for more accurate tracking of the interface. These methods have been particularly successful in simulating the pinch-off of liquid threads, a process that involves the thinning of a fluid column until it breaks into separate droplets. The work of Eggers and Dupont (1994) demonstrated that sharp interface methods could effectively capture the self-similar nature of the pinch-off process, providing insights into the universal scaling laws that govern the dynamics of singularities. \n\nIn the context of coalescence, sharp interface methods have also proven advantageous. The coalescence of droplets involves the drainage of the thin film separating them, a process that is highly sensitive to the initial conditions and the properties of the fluid. The study by Aarts et al. (2005) utilized sharp interface methods to investigate the dynamics of film drainage and the subsequent coalescence of droplets, revealing the critical role of van der Waals forces in the final stages of film rupture. \n\nThe application of sharp interface methods extends beyond simple drop breakup and coalescence to more complex systems, such as inkjet printing and microfluidics. In these applications, the ability to accurately simulate the formation and breakup of jets is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring the quality of the final product. The work of Castrejón-Pita et al. (2015) highlighted the importance of sharp interface methods in capturing the rapid dynamics of jet formation and breakup, providing a framework for improving the design of inkjet printers. \n\nMoreover, sharp interface methods have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the role of surfactants in free surface flows. Surfactants, which are often present in practical applications, can significantly alter the interfacial tension and, consequently, the dynamics of breakup and coalescence. The study by Stone (1994) demonstrated how sharp interface methods could be used to model the complex interactions between surfactants and fluid interfaces, offering insights into the stabilization mechanisms that prevent premature breakup. \n\nDespite their advantages, sharp interface methods are not without limitations. The computational cost associated with resolving fine-scale features near singularities can be prohibitive, particularly in three-dimensional simulations. Recent advancements in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques have addressed some of these challenges by dynamically adjusting the resolution based on the local flow features (Berger and Colella, 1989). This approach allows for efficient allocation of computational resources, enabling the simulation of complex free surface flows with high fidelity. \n\nIn conclusion, sharp interface methods have significantly advanced the simulation and analysis of free surface flows with singularities. Their ability to accurately capture the dynamics of interfaces has provided valuable insights into the fundamental processes governing breakup and coalescence. As computational power continues to increase and numerical techniques evolve, sharp interface methods are likely to play an even more prominent role in the study of complex fluid systems, paving the way for new discoveries and applications in fields such as microfluidics, inkjet printing, and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Nonlinear dynamics of liquid jets and drops", "authors": "Jens Eggers", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "1997", "volumes": "69", "first page": "865", "last page": "929", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.69.865"}, {"title": "A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow", "authors": "Mark Sussman, Peter Smereka, Stanley Osher", "journal": "Journal of Computational Physics", "year": "1994", "volumes": "114", "first page": "146", "last page": "159", "DOI": "10.1006/jcph.1994.1155"}, {"title": "Drop formation in a one-dimensional approximation of the Navier-Stokes equation", "authors": "Jens Eggers, Todd F.
