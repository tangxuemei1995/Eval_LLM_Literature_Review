{"Literature Review": "The study of shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (STBLI) has been a significant area of research in fluid dynamics due to its implications in aerodynamics, propulsion systems, and other engineering applications. While two-dimensional (2D) STBLI has been extensively studied, the dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) STBLI present a more complex and less understood challenge. This literature review aims to synthesize the current understanding of 3D STBLI, highlighting the differences from 2D interactions and identifying areas for future research. \n\nThe fundamental difference between 2D and 3D STBLI lies in the geometric complexity and the resulting flow structures. In 2D STBLI, the interaction is typically characterized by a separation bubble, shock-induced separation, and reattachment, which are relatively well-understood phenomena (Dolling, 2001). However, in 3D STBLI, the interaction involves additional complexities such as skewed vortical structures and conical asymptotic behavior, which are influenced by the three-dimensionality of the flow (Gaitonde, 2015). These interactions are not only configuration-dependent but also exhibit a range of behaviors that are not present in 2D interactions. \n\nOne of the key features of 3D STBLI is the presence of conical asymptotic behavior, where the specifics of the shock generator become less significant, and the interaction assumes a conical form (Benay et al., 2006). This behavior is indicative of the self-similar nature of the flow, which is a unifying property across different configurations. However, this asymptotic behavior breaks down in regions that are critical to the dynamics of 3D STBLI, such as near shock generators and symmetry planes (Souverein et al., 2010). These regions exhibit complex flow features that are not captured by the conical asymptotic model, necessitating further investigation. \n\nThe spectral content of 3D STBLI also differs significantly from that of 2D interactions. While 2D STBLI is characterized by prominent low-frequency dynamics associated with separation-shock breathing, 3D STBLI spectra are more representative of mid-frequency, convective, shear-layer dynamics (Clemens and Narayanaswamy, 2014). This shift in spectral content is attributed to the absence of a uniform separation length scale in 3D interactions, which is crucial for normalizing the lowest-frequency dynamics in 2D STBLI. The mid-frequency dynamics in 3D STBLI are indicative of the convective nature of the shear layer, which plays a dominant role in the interaction (Gaitonde, 2015). \n\nThe skewed vortical structures observed in 3D STBLI are a result of the interaction between the boundary layer and the swept shock. These structures reflect the essentially 2D influence of the boundary layer on the 3D character of the interaction (Benay et al., 2006). The vortical structures are responsible for the redistribution of momentum and energy within the flow, leading to complex flow patterns that are not present in 2D interactions. Understanding these structures is crucial for predicting the behavior of 3D STBLI and for developing effective flow control strategies. \n\nRecent research has focused on various aspects of 3D STBLI, including modal and nonmodal analyses, moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions, fluid/structure interactions, and flow control (Souverein et al., 2010). Modal analysis involves the study of the natural modes of the flow, which can provide insights into the stability and dynamics of the interaction. Nonmodal analysis, on the other hand, focuses on transient growth mechanisms that can lead to significant flow disturbances. These analyses are essential for understanding the underlying physics of 3D STBLI and for developing predictive models. \n\nFluid/structure interactions in 3D STBLI are another area of active research. These interactions are critical in applications where the structural response to aerodynamic loads is important, such as in aircraft wings and turbine blades (Clemens and Narayanaswamy, 2014). Understanding the coupling between the fluid and structural dynamics is essential for designing structures that can withstand the complex loading conditions associated with 3D STBLI. \n\nFlow control strategies for 3D STBLI are also being explored, with the aim of mitigating adverse effects such as flow separation and unsteady loading. Techniques such as passive control using vortex generators and active control using synthetic jets have shown promise in modifying the flow structure and reducing the impact of 3D STBLI (Dolling, 2001). These strategies are crucial for improving the performance and efficiency of systems affected by 3D STBLI. \n\nIn conclusion, the dynamics of 3D STBLI present a complex and challenging area of research with significant implications for engineering applications. While recent advances have improved our understanding of these interactions, many aspects remain poorly understood, particularly in regions where asymptotic behavior breaks down. Future research should focus on developing a comprehensive understanding of the flow physics, improving predictive models, and exploring effective flow control strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Fifty Years of Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interaction Research: What Next?", "authors": "Dolling, David S.", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2001", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1517", "last page": "1531", "DOI": "10.2514/2.1471"}, {"title": "Progress in Hypersonic Shock Wave/Boundary Layer Interactions", "authors": "Gaitonde, Datta V.", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2015", "volumes": "72", "first page": "80", "last page": "99", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paerosci.2014.09.002"}, {"title": "Shock Wave/Boundary Layer Interactions in Hypersonic Flows", "authors": "Benay, R., Chpoun, A., Lani, A., Magin, T., and Degrez, G.", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2006", "volumes": "42", "first page": "129", "last page": "172", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paerosci.2006.07.001"}, {"title": "Experimental Study of Three-Dimensional Shock Wave/Turbulent Boundary Layer Interactions", "authors": "Souverein, L.
