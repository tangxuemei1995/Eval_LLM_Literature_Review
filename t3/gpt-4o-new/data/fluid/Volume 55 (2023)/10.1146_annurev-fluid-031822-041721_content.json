{"Literature Review": "The field of fluid mechanics has seen significant advancements in the development of particle image-based volumetric flow measurement techniques, particularly in the context of 3D Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT). These techniques have become essential for quantitatively accessing unsteady flow properties in various experimental applications. The primary focus of this review is on the physical properties and circumstances of 3D particle-based measurements, with an emphasis on improving reconstruction accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution, and completeness. \n\n3D Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) is a technique that allows for the determination of position, velocity, and acceleration of particles within a fluid flow. This method provides a comprehensive understanding of the flow dynamics by tracking a large number of individual particle trajectories within the investigated volume. The technique has evolved significantly over the years, with the advent of dense 3D LPT methods such as Shake-The-Box (STB) marking a significant milestone. STB has enabled the characterization of unsteady flows by providing high-resolution Lagrangian and Eulerian data, including long particle trajectories embedded in time-resolved 3D velocity and pressure fields (Schanz et al., 2016). \n\nThe development of 3D LPT techniques has been driven by the need for accurate and detailed flow measurements in complex fluid systems. Traditional methods, such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), have limitations in terms of spatial resolution and the ability to capture three-dimensional flow structures. LPT, on the other hand, offers a more detailed and comprehensive view of the flow by capturing the motion of individual particles in three dimensions (Adrian, 2005). This capability is particularly important for understanding turbulent flows, where the interaction of different flow structures can significantly impact the overall flow dynamics. \n\nOne of the key challenges in 3D LPT is the accurate reconstruction of particle positions and velocities. Iterative particle reconstruction techniques have been developed to address this challenge, allowing for improved accuracy in particle tracking. These techniques involve the iterative refinement of particle positions and velocities based on the available image data, leading to more accurate and reliable measurements (Wieneke, 2008). The use of advanced algorithms and computational techniques has further enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of these methods, enabling the capture of complex flow structures with high spatial and temporal resolution. \n\nThe integration of data assimilation techniques with 3D LPT has further expanded the capabilities of this method. Data assimilation involves the incorporation of additional information, such as Navier-Stokes constraints, to improve the accuracy and completeness of the flow measurements. This approach allows for the generation of high-resolution velocity and pressure fields, providing a more detailed understanding of the flow dynamics (Gesemann et al., 2016). The combination of LPT and data assimilation has proven to be particularly effective in capturing unsteady flows, where the interaction of different flow structures can significantly impact the overall flow dynamics. \n\nThe application of 3D LPT in fluid mechanics has led to significant advancements in our understanding of complex flow phenomena. For example, the technique has been used to study the dynamics of turbulent boundary layers, where the interaction of different flow structures can significantly impact the overall flow dynamics (Elsinga et al., 2006). The ability to capture detailed flow measurements in three dimensions has also enabled the study of complex flow phenomena, such as vortex dynamics and flow separation, which are critical for understanding the behavior of fluid systems in various engineering applications. \n\nIn conclusion, 3D Lagrangian Particle Tracking has emerged as a powerful tool for studying complex flow phenomena in fluid mechanics. The development of advanced techniques, such as Shake-The-Box and iterative particle reconstruction, has significantly enhanced the accuracy and resolution of flow measurements, enabling the capture of detailed flow structures in three dimensions. The integration of data assimilation techniques has further expanded the capabilities of LPT, providing a more comprehensive understanding of unsteady flows. As the field continues to evolve, it is expected that 3D LPT will play an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of complex fluid systems and their behavior in various engineering applications.", "References": [{"title": "Shake-The-Box: Lagrangian particle tracking at high particle image densities", "authors": "Schanz, D., Gesemann, S., and Schröder, A.", "journal": "Experiments in Fluids", "year": "2016", "volumes": "57", "first page": "70", "last page": "70", "DOI": "10.1007/s00348-016-2157-1"}, {"title": "Particle Image Velocimetry", "authors": "Adrian, R.
