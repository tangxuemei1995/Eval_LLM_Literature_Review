{"Literature Review": "Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) represent a significant advancement in propulsion technology, offering the potential for enhanced efficiency through pressure-gain combustion. The fundamental operation of an RDE involves a detonation wave that travels circumferentially within an annular combustion chamber, compressing the incoming fuel-air mixture and releasing heat through chemical reactions. This process is inherently unsteady and involves complex interactions across multiple scales, from the molecular level of chemical reactions to the macroscopic dynamics of wave propagation. Understanding and managing the nonidealities in RDEs is crucial for realizing their theoretical efficiency gains. \n\nOne of the primary nonidealities in RDEs is unsteady mixing, which arises from the high-speed, turbulent environment within the combustion chamber. The rapid movement of the detonation wave can lead to incomplete mixing of the fuel and oxidizer, resulting in secondary combustion processes that occur downstream of the primary detonation front. These secondary combustion processes can lead to deflagration losses, which are less efficient than detonation and can reduce the overall performance of the engine (Rankin et al., 2017). The challenge lies in optimizing the injection and mixing processes to minimize these losses while maintaining the stability of the detonation wave.\n\nSecondary combustion is closely linked to the phenomenon of multiple competing waves within the RDE. In practical designs, it is common for multiple detonation waves to coexist and interact within the chamber. These interactions can lead to complex wave patterns and affect the distribution of heat release and mixing within the engine (Schwer and Kailasanath, 2011). The presence of secondary waves, which are weaker pressure waves that follow the primary detonation wave, can further complicate the flow dynamics and contribute to inefficiencies. Understanding the interplay between these waves is essential for optimizing the performance of RDEs.\n\nThe operational characteristics of RDEs are determined by a delicate balance between large-scale processes, such as wave propagation and chamber geometry, and small-scale processes, such as chemical kinetics and turbulence. This multiscale coupling is a key factor in the performance of RDEs and requires sophisticated modeling and simulation tools to analyze. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been widely used to study the complex flow fields within RDEs and to predict the effects of various design parameters on engine performance (Schwer and Kailasanath, 2011; Wolanski, 2013). These simulations can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of wave propagation, mixing, and heat release, and can help identify strategies for mitigating nonidealities.\n\nExperimental studies have also played a crucial role in advancing the understanding of RDE nonidealities. High-speed diagnostics, such as schlieren imaging and pressure transducers, have been used to capture the dynamic behavior of detonation waves and to measure the performance of RDEs under various operating conditions (Lu et al., 2011). These experiments have highlighted the importance of chamber geometry and fuel injection strategies in controlling the stability and efficiency of the detonation process. For example, the use of angled or tangential injection ports has been shown to enhance mixing and reduce the occurrence of secondary combustion (Rankin et al., 2017).\n\nDespite the progress made in understanding RDE nonidealities, several challenges remain. The extreme conditions within the combustion chamber, including high temperatures and pressures, pose significant challenges for both experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Additionally, the transient nature of the detonation process makes it difficult to achieve steady-state operation, which is desirable for practical applications. Ongoing research efforts are focused on developing more robust and accurate models of detonation chemistry and turbulence, as well as exploring novel materials and designs that can withstand the harsh operating environment of RDEs (Wolanski, 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, while RDEs offer the potential for significant efficiency gains through pressure-gain combustion, achieving these gains requires a deep understanding of the nonidealities inherent in their operation. Unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves are key factors that influence the performance of RDEs and must be carefully managed through a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Continued research in this area is essential for overcoming the challenges associated with RDE nonidealities and for realizing the full potential of this promising propulsion technology.", "References": [{"title": "Non-ideal effects in rotating detonation engines", "authors": "Rankin, B.
