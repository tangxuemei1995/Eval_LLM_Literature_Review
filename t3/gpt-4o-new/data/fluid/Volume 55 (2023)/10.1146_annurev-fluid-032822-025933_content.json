{"Literature Review": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) represents a fascinating area of fluid dynamics that bridges the gap between classical turbulence and viscoelastic fluid behavior. The phenomenon is characterized by chaotic flow states driven by the interaction of inertial and elastic forces, primarily in dilute polymer solutions. This review aims to synthesize recent advancements in understanding EIT, focusing on experimental observations, numerical simulations, and theoretical models that elucidate its unique dynamics and potential applications. \n\nThe study of EIT has gained momentum following the recognition of polymer drag reduction, a phenomenon where minute concentrations of polymers significantly reduce turbulent friction drag in wall-bounded flows. This effect was first documented by Toms in 1948, and since then, extensive research has been conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms (Toms, 1948). However, EIT, which involves energy transfer from small elastic scales to larger flow scales, has been less explored despite its potential to provide insights into complex flow phenomena such as elastic turbulence and maximum drag reduction (Xi & Graham, 2010).\n\nExperimental studies have been pivotal in identifying the distinct characteristics of EIT. For instance, Samanta et al. (2013) demonstrated that EIT can occur at Reynolds numbers significantly lower than those required for Newtonian turbulence, highlighting the role of elastic instabilities in triggering chaotic flow states. These findings were corroborated by subsequent experiments that observed similar transitions in various flow configurations, including channel and pipe flows (Choueiri et al., 2018). The experimental evidence suggests that EIT is not merely a modification of inertial turbulence but a fundamentally different state driven by polymer dynamics.\n\nNumerical simulations have further advanced the understanding of EIT by providing detailed insights into the flow structures and instabilities involved. Min et al. (2003) employed direct numerical simulations to reveal the presence of coherent structures in EIT, which differ significantly from those in Newtonian turbulence. These structures are characterized by elongated streaks and vortices that are stabilized by elastic forces, leading to a self-sustaining cycle distinct from the classical turbulence regeneration cycle (Dubief et al., 2013). Such simulations have been instrumental in identifying the parameter regimes where EIT dominates and in elucidating the role of polymer concentration and molecular weight in modulating flow behavior.\n\nTheoretical models have also contributed to the understanding of EIT by providing frameworks to describe the interplay between elastic and inertial forces. The FENE-P (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic Peterlin) model, for example, has been widely used to capture the essential features of viscoelastic flows and predict the onset of EIT (Bird et al., 1987). Recent advancements in modeling have focused on incorporating more complex polymer dynamics and interactions, which are crucial for accurately capturing the transition from laminar to EIT and from EIT to inertial turbulence (Haward et al., 2016).\n\nOne of the intriguing aspects of EIT is its potential connection to elastic turbulence, a chaotic flow state observed in highly elastic fluids at low Reynolds numbers. Both phenomena involve the transfer of energy across scales driven by elastic forces, yet they occur in different flow regimes. Understanding the relationship between EIT and elastic turbulence could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of energy transfer and dissipation in viscoelastic flows (Groisman & Steinberg, 2000). Moreover, exploring the links between EIT and polymer drag reduction could lead to novel strategies for flow control and energy savings in industrial applications (White & Mungal, 2008).\n\nDespite the progress made, several challenges remain in unraveling the self-sustaining mechanism of EIT. One of the key questions is how elastic instabilities interact with inertial forces to sustain chaotic flow states over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Addressing this question requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines experimental, numerical, and theoretical efforts. Additionally, the development of more sophisticated models that capture the complex rheological behavior of polymer solutions is essential for advancing the understanding of EIT and its implications for other flow phenomena.\n\nIn conclusion, EIT represents a rich area of research with significant implications for both fundamental fluid dynamics and practical applications. Continued efforts to elucidate the mechanisms of EIT and its connections to other flow phenomena will undoubtedly enhance our understanding of viscoelastic turbulence and open new avenues for innovation in flow control technologies.", "References": [{"title": "Some observations on the flow of linear polymer solutions through straight tubes at large Reynolds numbers", "authors": "B.
