{"Literature Review": "The evaporation of sessile droplets is a phenomenon that has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in various scientific and industrial applications, including inkjet printing, cooling technologies, and biological assays. The process is governed by a complex interplay of factors such as surface tension, thermal gradients, and vapor diffusion, making it a rich area for theoretical and experimental investigation. This review synthesizes the current understanding of sessile droplet evaporation, focusing on mathematical models that describe the process, the modes of evaporation, and the implications for droplet lifetimes and deposition patterns. \n\nMathematical models have been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms of sessile droplet evaporation. One of the foundational models is the diffusion-limited model, which assumes that the evaporation rate is controlled by the diffusion of vapor away from the droplet surface. This model, first proposed by Deegan et al., provides a framework for understanding the 'coffee-ring' effect, where solute particles are deposited at the droplet's edge as it evaporates (Deegan et al., 1997). The model predicts that the evaporation rate is highest at the contact line, leading to a non-uniform deposition pattern. \n\nFurther refinements to the diffusion-limited model have incorporated the effects of thermal gradients and Marangoni flows. Hu and Larson (2005) extended the model to include thermal Marangoni effects, which arise due to temperature-induced surface tension gradients. Their work demonstrated that these flows could counteract the coffee-ring effect by redistributing solute particles towards the center of the droplet (Hu and Larson, 2005). This insight has significant implications for applications requiring uniform deposition, such as in the fabrication of electronic devices. \n\nThe modes of evaporation are another critical aspect of sessile droplet dynamics. The two primary modes are constant contact radius (CCR) and constant contact angle (CCA). In the CCR mode, the droplet maintains a fixed base radius while the contact angle decreases, whereas in the CCA mode, the contact angle remains constant, and the base radius shrinks. The transition between these modes is influenced by factors such as substrate wettability and ambient conditions (Stauber et al., 2014). Understanding these modes is crucial for predicting droplet lifetimes, which are important for applications like spray cooling and pesticide delivery. \n\nRecent studies have also explored the evaporation of multiple droplets, which introduces additional complexity due to interactions between droplets. These interactions can lead to collective behaviors such as coalescence and competitive evaporation, where the presence of neighboring droplets affects the evaporation rate of a given droplet (Kim et al., 2016). Such phenomena are particularly relevant in applications involving droplet arrays, such as in microfluidic devices and biological assays. \n\nThe future directions of research in sessile droplet evaporation are likely to focus on more sophisticated models that account for additional physical effects, such as the influence of ambient humidity and the role of substrate porosity. Advances in computational techniques, such as lattice Boltzmann methods and molecular dynamics simulations, offer promising avenues for exploring these complex interactions at a more detailed level (Sefiane et al., 2008). Moreover, experimental techniques such as high-speed imaging and infrared thermography are expected to provide new insights into the transient behaviors of evaporating droplets. \n\nIn conclusion, the evaporation of sessile droplets is a multifaceted problem that continues to challenge researchers across disciplines. Mathematical models have provided valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing droplet evaporation, but there remains much to be explored, particularly in the context of multiple droplet interactions and the influence of complex substrates. As the field advances, a deeper understanding of these processes will undoubtedly lead to improved control and optimization in a wide range of applications.", "References": [{"title": "Capillary flow as the cause of ring stains from dried liquid drops", "authors": "Robert D.
