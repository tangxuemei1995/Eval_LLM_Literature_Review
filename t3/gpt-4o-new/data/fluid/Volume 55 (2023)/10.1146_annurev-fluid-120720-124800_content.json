{"Literature Review": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become an indispensable tool in the aerospace industry, facilitating the design and analysis of both new and derivative aircraft. The evolution of CFD technology over the past few decades has been marked by significant advancements in computational power, numerical algorithms, and modeling techniques, which have collectively enhanced its application in aerospace engineering. This literature review explores the current state of aerospace CFD technology, focusing on its application process, the role of geometry, turbulence models, numerical algorithms, mesh adaptation, and design optimization, while also addressing the challenges and future directions of the field. \n\nThe application of CFD in aerospace engineering is primarily driven by its ability to simulate complex fluid flows around aircraft structures, providing insights that are critical for design and performance optimization. The integration of CFD into the aerospace design process has been facilitated by advancements in computational resources, allowing for more detailed and accurate simulations (Slotnick et al., 2014). The centrality of geometry in CFD cannot be overstated, as the accuracy of simulations is heavily dependent on the fidelity of the geometric representation of the aircraft. High-fidelity geometric models are essential for capturing the intricate details of aircraft structures, which in turn influence the flow characteristics (Mavriplis, 2007).\n\nTurbulence modeling remains one of the most challenging aspects of CFD, particularly in the aerospace industry where accurate prediction of turbulent flows is crucial for performance assessment. Various turbulence models have been developed, ranging from the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) (Spalart, 2000). While RANS models are widely used due to their computational efficiency, they often lack the accuracy required for complex flow scenarios. LES and DNS offer higher accuracy but at a significantly higher computational cost, making them less feasible for routine industrial applications (Sagaut, 2006).\n\nHigher-order numerical algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CFD simulations. These algorithms, which include methods such as Discontinuous Galerkin and Spectral Element Methods, offer improved resolution of flow features and better convergence properties compared to traditional second-order methods (Cockburn & Shu, 2001). However, their adoption in the aerospace industry has been limited by the complexity of implementation and the need for specialized expertise.\n\nOutput-based mesh adaptation is another area of active research in CFD, aimed at optimizing the computational mesh based on the desired output quantities (Venditti & Darmofal, 2002). This approach allows for the efficient allocation of computational resources, focusing on regions of the flow where high accuracy is required. Despite its potential benefits, the implementation of output-based mesh adaptation in industrial applications is still in its infancy, with challenges related to automation and robustness needing to be addressed.\n\nNumerical design optimization using CFD has gained traction in the aerospace industry, enabling the exploration of a wide design space to identify optimal configurations (Jameson, 1998). This process involves the integration of CFD simulations with optimization algorithms, such as gradient-based or evolutionary algorithms, to iteratively refine the design. The main challenge in this area is the high computational cost associated with running multiple CFD simulations, which can be mitigated through the use of surrogate models or reduced-order models (Forrester et al., 2008).\n\nThe future of aerospace CFD technology is poised for significant advancements, with the potential for certification by analysis and model-based design becoming standard practice. This transition will require continued investment in high-performance computing, the development of more accurate and efficient turbulence models, and the integration of CFD with other engineering disciplines (Slotnick et al., 2014). Additionally, the adoption of machine learning techniques in CFD holds promise for accelerating simulations and improving model accuracy (Duraisamy et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, while CFD has become a cornerstone of aerospace engineering, several challenges remain that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential. Continued research and development in areas such as turbulence modeling, numerical algorithms, and design optimization are essential for advancing the state of the art. By addressing these challenges, the aerospace industry can move towards a future where CFD plays a central role in the design and certification of aircraft, ultimately leading to more efficient and innovative designs.", "References": [{"title": "CFD Vision 2030 Study: A Path to Revolutionary Computational Aerosciences", "authors": "Slotnick, Jeffrey P., Khodadoust, Abdollah, Alonso, Juan, Darmofal, David, Gropp, William, Lurie, Elizabeth, Mavriplis, Dimitri", "journal": "NASA Technical Report", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Revisiting the Turbulence Problem in CFD", "authors": "Spalart, Philippe R.", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2000", "volumes": "35", "first page": "245", "last page": "272", "DOI": "10.1016/S0376-0421(99)00012-8"}, {"title": "High-Order Methods for Computational Physics", "authors": "Cockburn, Bernardo, Shu, Chi-Wang", "journal": "Journal of Scientific Computing", "year": "2001", "volumes": "16", "first page": "173", "last page": "261", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1012873910884"}, {"title": "Output-Based Error Estimation and Mesh Adaptation for Aerodynamic Flows", "authors": "Venditti, David A., Darmofal, David L.", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2002", "volumes": "40", "first page": "1570", "last page": "1578", "DOI": "10.2514/2.1802"}, {"title": "Aerodynamic Design via Control Theory", "authors": "Jameson, Antony", "journal": "Journal of Scientific Computing", "year": "1998", "volumes": "3", "first page": "233", "last page": "260", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1019125925752"}, {"title": "Turbulence Modeling for Large Eddy Simulation", "authors": "Sagaut, Pierre", "journal": "Springer", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/3-540-33186-3"}, {"title": "Surrogate-Based Analysis and Optimization", "authors": "Forrester, Alexander I.
