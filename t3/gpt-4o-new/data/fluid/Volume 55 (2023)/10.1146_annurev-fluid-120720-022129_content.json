{"Literature Review": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) have emerged as a powerful computational tool for simulating fluid dynamics in complex geometries. The inception of IBMs can be traced back to the early 1960s, although their widespread recognition and application did not occur until the 1970s, with significant advancements in computational capabilities occurring in the new millennium. The foundational work by Peskin in 1972, which applied IBMs to simulate blood flow in the heart, marked a pivotal moment in the development of these methods (Peskin, 1972). This work demonstrated the potential of IBMs to handle complex, moving boundaries within a fluid domain using a fixed Cartesian grid, thus simplifying the computational process and reducing the need for complex mesh generation.\n\nThe primary advantage of IBMs lies in their ability to maintain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes while accommodating complex boundary geometries. This is achieved by embedding the boundary within the computational grid and applying force terms to represent the boundary's influence on the fluid flow. This approach allows for the simulation of fluid-structure interactions without the need for body-fitted meshes, which can be computationally expensive and challenging to generate (Mittal and Iaccarino, 2005).\n\nDespite their advantages, IBMs are not without limitations. One of the significant challenges is the accurate resolution of thin wall shear layers, particularly in high-Reynolds number flows. Traditional IBMs struggle with this due to the lack of anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries, which is crucial for capturing the fine-scale features of the flow (Mittal et al., 2008). To address this, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies. These approaches aim to enhance the resolution of boundary layers while maintaining the computational efficiency of the method (Balaras, 2004).\n\nWall models in IBMs are designed to approximate the effects of the boundary layer without resolving it fully. This is particularly useful in high-Reynolds number flows, where the boundary layer is thin and requires high resolution to capture accurately. Various wall modeling techniques have been proposed, including the use of empirical correlations and simplified boundary layer equations (Piomelli and Balaras, 2002). These models can significantly reduce the computational cost while providing reasonable accuracy for engineering applications.\n\nLocal grid refinement strategies involve increasing the grid resolution in regions of interest, such as near the boundaries, while maintaining a coarser grid elsewhere. This approach can improve the accuracy of IBMs in capturing boundary layer effects without the need for a globally refined grid, which would be computationally prohibitive (Uhlmann, 2005). However, implementing local grid refinement in IBMs can introduce additional complexities, such as ensuring the stability and consistency of the numerical scheme across different grid resolutions.\n\nIn addition to these technical challenges, IBMs must also be carefully tailored to the specific problem at hand. The choice of IBM implementation can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. For instance, the immersed boundary method with direct forcing, which applies a direct modification to the momentum equations, is suitable for problems with complex, moving boundaries (Fadlun et al., 2000). In contrast, the continuous forcing approach, which applies a smoothed force field, may be more appropriate for problems with stationary boundaries (Taira and Colonius, 2007).\n\nLooking to the future, the development of IBMs is likely to focus on improving their robustness and accuracy for a broader range of applications. This includes the integration of IBMs with other numerical methods, such as large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulation (DNS), to enhance their capability to simulate turbulent flows (Griffith and Peskin, 2005). Additionally, the application of IBMs to multiphysics problems, where fluid mechanics is coupled with other physical phenomena, presents an exciting avenue for research. This requires the development of new models and algorithms to handle the complex interactions between different physical processes (Mittal and Dong, 2010).\n\nIn conclusion, immersed boundary methods have established themselves as a versatile and efficient tool for simulating complex fluid dynamics problems. While they offer significant advantages in terms of simplicity and computational efficiency, challenges remain in accurately resolving boundary layer effects and tailoring the method to specific applications. Ongoing research efforts are focused on addressing these challenges and expanding the applicability of IBMs to a wider range of problems, including those involving multiphysics interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Flow patterns in the vicinity of heart valves: A numerical method", "authors": "Charles S.
