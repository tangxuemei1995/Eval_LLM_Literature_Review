{"Literature Review": "Rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection (RRBC) is a complex fluid dynamics system that has been extensively studied due to its relevance in understanding geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. The interplay between buoyancy and rotation in RRBC is crucial for understanding processes in the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and outer core, as well as in stellar environments. The system is characterized by the Rayleigh number (Ra), which quantifies the strength of buoyancy, and the Ekman and Rossby numbers, which describe the influence of rotation. The dynamics of RRBC are governed by the competition between buoyancy-driven convection and the stabilizing effects of rotation, leading to a rich variety of flow structures and heat transport behaviors.\n\nThe onset of convection in RRBC is significantly influenced by rotation. Chandrasekhar (1953) was among the first to theoretically investigate the effects of rotation on convective instability, showing that rotation delays the onset of convection by stabilizing the fluid layer. This stabilization is due to the Coriolis force, which acts to suppress vertical motions and promote the formation of columnar vortices, known as Taylor columns, that align with the rotation axis (Chandrasekhar, 1953). These vortical structures are a hallmark of RRBC and have been observed in both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations (Julien et al., 1996).\n\nThe transition from buoyancy-dominated to rotation-dominated regimes in RRBC is marked by changes in the flow structure and heat transport. In the buoyancy-dominated regime, the flow is characterized by turbulent plumes and large-scale circulation patterns similar to those observed in non-rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection (Niemela et al., 2000). As rotation becomes more significant, the flow transitions to a regime where columnar vortices dominate, and the large-scale circulation is suppressed (Ecke et al., 1992). This transition is often described in terms of the Rossby number, with low Rossby numbers indicating strong rotational effects.\n\nHeat transport in RRBC is a key area of study, as it provides insights into the efficiency of convective processes in natural systems. The Nusselt number (Nu), which quantifies the enhancement of heat transport due to convection, is used to characterize the heat transfer efficiency. In the rotation-dominated regime, heat transport is often reduced compared to the non-rotating case due to the suppression of vertical motions by the Coriolis force (King et al., 2009). However, under certain conditions, rotation can enhance heat transport by promoting the formation of coherent structures that facilitate efficient heat transfer (Kunnen et al., 2008).\n\nTheoretical models and scaling laws have been developed to describe the heat transport in RRBC. Grossmann and Lohse (2000) proposed a unifying theory for heat transport in Rayleigh–Bénard convection, which has been extended to include the effects of rotation. This theory suggests that the heat transport scaling depends on the relative strengths of buoyancy and rotation, as well as the Prandtl number, which characterizes the fluid's thermal diffusivity. Recent studies have focused on refining these scaling laws to better capture the complex interactions between buoyancy and rotation in RRBC (Stevens et al., 2013).\n\nDirect numerical simulations (DNS) have played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of RRBC. These simulations allow for detailed investigations of the flow structures and heat transport mechanisms in RRBC, providing insights that are difficult to obtain from experiments alone. DNS studies have revealed the intricate dynamics of columnar vortices and their role in modulating heat transport (Schmitz and Tilgner, 2009). Additionally, DNS has been used to explore the effects of non-Oberbeck–Boussinesq conditions, where variations in fluid properties with temperature are significant, and centrifugal effects, which become important at high rotation rates (Horn and Shishkina, 2014).\n\nIn summary, RRBC is a rich and complex system that provides valuable insights into the interplay between buoyancy and rotation in natural systems. The transition between buoyancy-dominated and rotation-dominated regimes is marked by significant changes in flow structure and heat transport, with important implications for understanding geophysical and astrophysical processes. Ongoing research, including theoretical developments, experimental studies, and numerical simulations, continues to enhance our understanding of this fascinating system.", "References": [{"title": "Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability", "authors": "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1953", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Rapidly rotating turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection", "authors": "Keith Julien, Stephen Legg, John McWilliams, John Werne", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "1996", "volumes": "322", "first page": "243", "last page": "273", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022112096002775"}, {"title": "Turbulent convection at very high Rayleigh numbers", "authors": "John J.
