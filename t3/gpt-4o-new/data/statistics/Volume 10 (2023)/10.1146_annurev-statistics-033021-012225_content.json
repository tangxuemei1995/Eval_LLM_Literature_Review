{"Literature Review": "The detection of exoplanets through radial velocity (RV) measurements has been a cornerstone of exoplanetary science since the first discovery of a planet orbiting a Sun-like star in 1995 (Mayor and Queloz, 1995). The RV method measures the Doppler shifts in the spectrum of a star, which are induced by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets. This technique is particularly powerful because it provides information about the planet's mass and orbital parameters, such as eccentricity and semi-major axis, which are crucial for understanding the architecture of planetary systems (Fischer et al., 2014). However, the detection of Earth-like planets remains challenging due to the presence of complex noise sources and the need for precise statistical methods to analyze RV data.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in RV data analysis is the presence of temporally correlated noise, which can arise from both instrumental and astrophysical sources. Instrumental noise can be caused by imperfections in the spectrograph or the data reduction process, while astrophysical noise can result from stellar activity, such as spots and flares, which can mimic or obscure planetary signals (Dumusque et al., 2012). To address these challenges, various statistical methods have been developed to model and mitigate the effects of correlated noise. For instance, Gaussian process (GP) regression has been widely used to model correlated noise in RV data. GPs are flexible, non-parametric models that can capture complex temporal correlations and have been successfully applied to disentangle stellar activity from planetary signals (Haywood et al., 2014).\n\nAnother significant challenge in RV data analysis is the uneven sampling of observations, which can lead to aliasing and complicate the detection of periodic signals. Traditional periodogram-based methods, such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, have been adapted to handle unevenly sampled data, but they may not be sufficient for detecting low-amplitude signals from Earth-like planets (Zechmeister and Kürster, 2009). More advanced techniques, such as Bayesian model comparison and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, have been employed to explore the parameter space of RV models more exhaustively and efficiently (Gregory, 2005). These methods allow for a probabilistic interpretation of the data and can incorporate prior information about the system, which is particularly useful when dealing with complex models and large parameter spaces.\n\nModel comparison is another critical aspect of RV data analysis, as it allows researchers to assess the plausibility of different hypotheses about the planetary system. Bayesian model comparison provides a rigorous framework for comparing models with different numbers of planets and different noise structures, taking into account both the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model (Ford and Gregory, 2007). This approach helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the detected signals are robust and not artifacts of the noise or the model.\n\nDespite these advances, there are still significant challenges and areas for improvement in RV data analysis. One area of active research is the development of more sophisticated noise models that can better capture the complex, multivariate nature of the noise in RV data. For example, multi-dimensional GPs and other machine learning techniques are being explored to model the joint distribution of RV measurements and ancillary data, such as photometry or activity indicators, which can provide additional information about the noise sources (Rajpaul et al., 2015).\n\nAnother area for improvement is the development of more efficient algorithms for exploring the large parameter space of RV models. While MCMC methods are powerful, they can be computationally expensive, especially for models with many parameters or when dealing with large datasets. Recent advances in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and other sampling techniques offer promising avenues for improving the efficiency of parameter estimation in RV data analysis (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the detection of exoplanets through RV measurements is a complex problem that requires sophisticated statistical methods to address the challenges of correlated noise, uneven sampling, and large parameter spaces. While significant progress has been made in recent years, there are still many opportunities for further research and development in this field. By unifying existing approaches and identifying areas for improvement, researchers can continue to advance the state of the art in RV data analysis and move closer to the goal of detecting Earth-like planets.", "References": [{"title": "A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star", "authors": "Michel Mayor, Didier Queloz", "journal": "Nature", "year": "1995", "volumes": "378", "first page": "355", "last page": "359", "DOI": "10.1038/378355a0"}, {"title": "Exoplanet Detection Techniques", "authors": "Debra A.
