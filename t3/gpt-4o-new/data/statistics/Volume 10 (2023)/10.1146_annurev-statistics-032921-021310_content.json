{"Literature Review": "Frailty models have become a cornerstone in the analysis of complex survival data, particularly when dealing with dependent survival times. These models introduce a random effect, known as frailty, to account for unobserved heterogeneity and dependence within clustered data or repeated events for individuals. The concept of frailty was first introduced by Vaupel et al. (1979) and has since evolved significantly, with numerous methodological advancements and applications in various fields. \n\nOne of the primary contexts in which frailty models are applied is clustered survival data. This occurs when survival data are collected from clusters such as families, hospitals, or geographical regions, where individuals within the same cluster may share common risk factors. The shared frailty model, a popular approach in this context, assumes that individuals within a cluster share a common frailty term, which induces correlation among their survival times. This model has been extensively used in medical research, particularly in studies involving familial aggregation of diseases (Duchateau and Janssen, 2008). \n\nIn addition to clustered data, frailty models are also applicable to recurrent event data, where multiple events are recorded for each individual. In such cases, the frailty term accounts for the correlation between repeated events for the same individual. The use of frailty models in recurrent event data has been explored in various studies, including those focusing on hospital readmissions and repeated infections (Cook and Lawless, 2007). \n\nFrailty models can be integrated with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time (AFT) model. The Cox model, introduced by Cox (1972), is widely used due to its semi-parametric nature, which does not require specification of the baseline hazard function. The incorporation of frailty into the Cox model allows for the accommodation of unobserved heterogeneity, thereby improving the model's fit and predictive accuracy (Therneau and Grambsch, 2000). On the other hand, the AFT model, which assumes a parametric form for the survival distribution, can also be extended to include frailty terms, providing an alternative approach to handling dependent survival data (Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2002). \n\nRecent advances in frailty models have focused on improving estimation methods and computational efficiency. Traditional estimation methods, such as the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and penalized likelihood approaches, have been complemented by Bayesian methods, which offer a flexible framework for incorporating prior information and handling complex data structures (Ibrahim et al., 2001). Moreover, the development of R packages, such as 'frailtypack' and 'survival', has facilitated the implementation of frailty models, making them more accessible to researchers (Rondeau et al., 2012). \n\nAnother area of advancement is the extension of frailty models to accommodate competing risks and multistate models. Competing risks arise when individuals are at risk of more than one type of event, and the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of others. Frailty models have been adapted to handle such data by introducing cause-specific frailty terms, which allow for the modeling of dependence between different types of events (Andersen et al., 2012). Similarly, multistate models, which describe transitions between different states over time, have been extended to include frailty terms, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing complex survival data (Putter et al., 2007). \n\nIn conclusion, frailty models have proven to be a versatile and powerful tool for analyzing dependent survival data. The ongoing development of estimation methods, computational tools, and model extensions continues to enhance their applicability and utility in various research settings. As the field progresses, it is anticipated that frailty models will play an increasingly important role in the analysis of complex survival data, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of dependence and heterogeneity.", "References": [{"title": "The impact of frailty on the dynamics of mortality", "authors": "James W.
