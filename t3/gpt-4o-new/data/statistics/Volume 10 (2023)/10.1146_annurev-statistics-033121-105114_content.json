{"Literature Review": "The role of statistics in promoting data reusability and research transparency is increasingly recognized as a critical component of modern scientific inquiry. The growing emphasis on open science and data-intensive research has led to a paradigm shift where data sharing is not only encouraged but often mandated by funding agencies and academic publishers. This shift necessitates a deeper understanding of the practices that promote data reusability and research transparency, particularly from a statistical perspective. \n\nData reusability is fundamentally linked to the principles of open science, which advocate for the accessibility and transparency of research outputs. Open science aims to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. The movement towards open science has been driven by the recognition that sharing data can enhance the reproducibility and replicability of research findings, which are cornerstones of scientific integrity (Nosek et al., 2015). Reproducibility refers to the ability to obtain consistent results using the same data and methods, while replicability involves achieving similar outcomes with new data or methods (Peng, 2011). \n\nStatistical thinking plays a pivotal role in enhancing data reusability by providing frameworks for evaluating the quality and usability of shared data. The quality of data is a critical determinant of its reusability. High-quality data should be accurate, complete, consistent, and timely. Statisticians can contribute to data quality by developing and applying rigorous data validation and cleaning techniques, which are essential for identifying and correcting errors before data is shared (Pipino et al., 2002). Moreover, statisticians can help design metadata standards that provide contextual information necessary for data reusers to understand and appropriately analyze shared data (Wilkinson et al., 2016). \n\nThe FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) provide a framework for enhancing the reusability of data. These principles emphasize the importance of making data and metadata machine-readable to facilitate automated data discovery and integration (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Statisticians can play a crucial role in implementing these principles by developing tools and methodologies that ensure data is FAIR-compliant. For instance, they can create algorithms that automate the process of data annotation and indexing, thereby improving data findability and accessibility (Mons et al., 2017). \n\nResearch transparency is closely linked to data reusability, as transparent research practices facilitate the verification and validation of research findings. Transparency involves the open sharing of research methods, data, and analysis workflows, which allows other researchers to scrutinize and build upon existing work (Miguel et al., 2014). Statisticians can promote transparency by advocating for the use of open-source statistical software and reproducible research practices, such as version control and literate programming (Gentleman & Lang, 2007). These practices enable researchers to document and share their analytical processes in a way that is accessible and understandable to others. \n\nDespite the clear benefits of data sharing, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of data reusability and transparency practices. One major challenge is the lack of incentives for researchers to share their data. Many researchers are concerned about the potential misuse of their data or the loss of competitive advantage (Tenopir et al., 2011). To address these concerns, statisticians and other stakeholders can advocate for policies that recognize and reward data sharing as a valuable scholarly contribution. Additionally, they can develop frameworks for data citation that ensure researchers receive credit for their data contributions (Mooney & Newton, 2012). \n\nAnother challenge is the variability in data quality and documentation across different disciplines. Statisticians can help address this issue by developing standardized protocols for data collection, management, and sharing that are tailored to the specific needs of different research communities (Borgman, 2012). These protocols can include guidelines for data formatting, metadata creation, and quality assurance, which can help ensure that shared data is both usable and reliable. \n\nIn conclusion, statisticians have a vital role to play in promoting data reusability and research transparency. By applying their expertise in data quality assessment, metadata standards, and reproducible research practices, statisticians can help create a research environment where data is shared openly and used effectively. This, in turn, can enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific research, ultimately leading to more robust and reliable scientific knowledge.", "References": [{"title": "Promoting an open research culture", "authors": "Brian A.
