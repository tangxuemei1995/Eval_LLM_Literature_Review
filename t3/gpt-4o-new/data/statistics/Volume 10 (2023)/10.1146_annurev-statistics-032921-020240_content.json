{"Literature Review": "The evaluation of model diagnostics and forecast performance, particularly in the context of quantiles, is a critical area of research in statistical modeling and forecasting. Quantile forecasts, which provide a range of possible outcomes rather than a single point estimate, are increasingly used in various fields due to their ability to capture uncertainty and provide more informative predictions. This literature review explores the methodologies and tools used for assessing the goodness of fit and predictive performance of quantile forecasts, focusing on calibration, scoring functions, and their applications.\n\nCalibration is a fundamental concept in forecast evaluation, referring to the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies. In the context of quantile forecasts, calibration can be divided into unconditional and conditional calibration. Unconditional calibration, often assessed through coverage plots, examines whether the predicted quantiles contain the true values at the expected frequency (Gneiting et al., 2007). Conditional calibration, on the other hand, is a more stringent criterion that considers the reliability of forecasts across different conditions or subsets of data, often visualized using quantile reliability diagrams (Dawid, 1984).\n\nScoring functions are essential tools for evaluating and comparing the performance of quantile forecasts. The pinball loss, also known as the quantile loss function, is a widely used asymmetric piecewise linear score that measures the accuracy of quantile predictions (Koenker and Bassett, 1978). This scoring function is particularly useful because it is consistent for quantile forecasts, meaning that it provides an unbiased assessment of forecast accuracy. Other scoring functions, such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), have also been adapted for quantile evaluation, offering a comprehensive measure of forecast quality (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007).\n\nThe coefficient of determination and skill scores are additional metrics that can be used to assess the performance of quantile forecasts. The coefficient of determination, or R-squared, provides a measure of how well the forecasted quantiles explain the variability in the observed data (Koenker and Machado, 1999). Skill scores, which compare the performance of a forecast model to a reference model, offer a relative measure of forecast quality and are particularly useful in competitive forecasting environments (Murphy, 1988).\n\nThe application of these diagnostic and evaluation tools is illustrated in several case studies. Engel's food expenditure data, a classic dataset in econometrics, has been used to demonstrate the application of quantile regression and the evaluation of forecast performance using scoring functions (Koenker and Hallock, 2001). The Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 provided a platform for testing and comparing different quantile forecasting models, highlighting the importance of calibration and scoring functions in competitive settings (Hong et al., 2016). Similarly, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub has utilized quantile forecasts to provide probabilistic predictions of pandemic trends, emphasizing the need for reliable and accurate forecast evaluation methods (Cramer et al., 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation of quantile forecasts involves a combination of calibration assessment, scoring functions, and performance metrics. Unconditional and conditional calibration provide insights into the reliability of forecasts, while scoring functions such as the pinball loss offer a consistent measure of forecast accuracy. The application of these tools in various domains underscores their importance in improving the quality and reliability of quantile forecasts. As the use of quantile forecasts continues to grow, ongoing research in model diagnostics and forecast evaluation will be crucial for advancing the field and enhancing the utility of probabilistic predictions.", "References": [{"title": "Strictly Proper Scoring Rules, Prediction, and Estimation", "authors": "Gneiting, Tilmann; Raftery, Adrian E.", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2007", "volumes": "102", "first page": "359", "last page": "378", "DOI": "10.1198/016214506000001437"}, {"title": "Statistical Theory: The Prequential Approach", "authors": "Dawid, A.
