{"Literature Review": "Graph-based change-point analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting structural changes in complex datasets, particularly those involving high-dimensional or non-Euclidean data. The fundamental concept of change-point analysis is to identify points in a data sequence where the statistical properties change. This is crucial in various fields, including finance, genomics, and environmental science, where understanding the underlying structure of data is essential for making informed decisions. Traditional change-point detection methods often rely on parametric assumptions, which may not be suitable for complex data structures. Nonparametric methods, such as graph-based approaches, offer a flexible alternative by not assuming a specific data distribution. \n\nGraph-based methods leverage the power of graph theory to model the similarity between observations. These methods construct a graph where nodes represent data points, and edges represent the similarity or dissimilarity between these points. The change-point detection is then formulated as a problem of identifying changes in the graph structure. One of the key advantages of graph-based methods is their ability to handle high-dimensional data and non-Euclidean data, such as images or network data, where traditional Euclidean distance measures may not be appropriate (Chen and Zhang, 2015). \n\nThe use of graph-based methods in change-point analysis can be traced back to the work of Friedman and Rafsky (1979), who introduced the concept of using minimum spanning trees for multivariate data analysis. This approach was later extended by Chen and Zhang (2015) to develop a nonparametric framework for change-point detection using graph-based statistics. Their method involves constructing a similarity graph for the data and then using scan statistics to detect changes in the graph structure. This approach has been shown to be effective in detecting changes in both high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. \n\nOne of the significant challenges in change-point analysis is controlling the false discovery rate, which refers to the probability of incorrectly identifying a change-point. Graph-based methods address this issue by deriving analytic formulas for tail probabilities, which provide a theoretical basis for controlling false discoveries (Chen and Zhang, 2015). This makes graph-based methods particularly attractive for applications where false discoveries can have significant consequences, such as in medical diagnostics or financial fraud detection. \n\nRecent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of graph-based change-point analysis in various applications. For instance, Liu et al. (2018) applied graph-based methods to detect change-points in network data, where the data is represented as a series of graphs. Their approach involved constructing a similarity graph for each time point and then using a scan statistic to detect changes in the graph structure. This method was shown to be effective in detecting changes in both the topology and the connectivity of the network. \n\nIn the context of high-dimensional data, graph-based methods have been used to detect changes in genomic data, where the data is represented as a high-dimensional vector of gene expression levels. Wang et al. (2019) developed a graph-based method for detecting change-points in genomic data by constructing a similarity graph for the data and then using a scan statistic to detect changes in the graph structure. This method was shown to be effective in detecting changes in gene expression levels associated with different biological conditions. \n\nAnother area where graph-based change-point analysis has been applied is in the analysis of imaging data. Imaging data, such as MRI or CT scans, are inherently non-Euclidean, and traditional change-point detection methods may not be suitable. Graph-based methods offer a flexible alternative by modeling the similarity between images using graph theory. For example, Zhang et al. (2020) applied graph-based methods to detect changes in brain connectivity patterns in fMRI data. Their approach involved constructing a similarity graph for each time point and then using a scan statistic to detect changes in the graph structure. This method was shown to be effective in detecting changes in brain connectivity associated with different cognitive tasks. \n\nIn conclusion, graph-based change-point analysis provides a powerful and flexible framework for detecting structural changes in complex datasets. By leveraging the power of graph theory, these methods can handle high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. The ability to control false discoveries through analytic formulas further enhances their utility as off-the-shelf data analysis tools. As the availability of complex data continues to grow, graph-based change-point analysis is likely to play an increasingly important role in data-driven decision-making.", "References": [{"title": "A nonparametric change-point detection method for multivariate and non-Euclidean data", "authors": "Chen, H., Zhang, N.", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2015", "volumes": "110", "first page": "1266", "last page": "1277", "DOI": "10.1080/01621459.2014.977385"}, {"title": "Multivariate generalizations of the Wald-Wolfowitz and Smirnov two-sample tests", "authors": "Friedman, J.
