{"Literature Review": "The concepts of generalizability and transportability are central to the field of causal inference, particularly when considering the applicability of study results to broader populations. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a study can be applied to a larger population beyond the study sample, while transportability involves the application of causal effects estimated in one context to another context. Both concepts are crucial for ensuring that causal inferences are not only internally valid but also externally applicable. \n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often considered the gold standard for causal inference due to their high internal validity. However, the generalizability of RCTs is frequently questioned because the study populations are often not representative of the broader target population. This lack of representativeness can be attributed to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may limit the diversity of participants and, consequently, the applicability of the findings (Rothwell, 2005). In contrast, observational studies, which utilize data from real-world settings, often have greater external validity because they reflect the diversity of the target population more accurately. However, they are susceptible to biases such as confounding, which can compromise internal validity (Hernán & Robins, 2006).\n\nThe challenge of balancing internal and external validity has led to the development of various methodological approaches aimed at improving the generalizability and transportability of causal estimates. One such approach is the use of statistical techniques to adjust for differences between the study sample and the target population. Methods such as inverse probability weighting and propensity score matching have been employed to reweight or match study samples to better reflect the target population (Cole & Stuart, 2010). These methods rely on the assumption that all relevant confounders are measured, which is often a strong assumption in practice.\n\nAnother approach involves the use of transportability frameworks, which provide formal conditions under which causal effects can be transported from one setting to another. Pearl and Bareinboim (2014) introduced a formal framework for transportability that uses graphical models to identify the conditions under which causal effects can be transported. This framework has been further developed to include methods for identifying and estimating transportable causal effects, even in the presence of unmeasured confounding (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016).\n\nThe assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity is also critical for understanding generalizability and transportability. Treatment effects may vary across different subpopulations, and understanding this heterogeneity is essential for making valid inferences about the target population. Methods such as subgroup analysis and machine learning techniques have been used to explore treatment effect heterogeneity (Athey & Imbens, 2016). These methods can help identify subpopulations for which the treatment effect is particularly strong or weak, thereby informing decisions about the applicability of study findings.\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain in achieving both internal and external validity. One major challenge is the identification and measurement of all relevant confounders, which is necessary for both generalizability and transportability. Additionally, the assumptions required for these methods are often strong and may not hold in practice. For example, the assumption of no unmeasured confounding is critical for many methods but is difficult to verify (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002).\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in developing methods to address external validity bias, achieving generalizability and transportability remains a complex task. Future research should focus on developing methods that require weaker assumptions and are robust to violations of these assumptions. Additionally, there is a need for more empirical studies that apply these methods to real-world data to assess their practical utility. By addressing these challenges, researchers can improve the applicability of causal inferences to broader populations, ultimately enhancing the impact of research findings on policy and practice.", "References": [{"title": "External validity of randomized controlled trials: 'To whom do the results of this trial apply?'", "authors": "Peter M.
