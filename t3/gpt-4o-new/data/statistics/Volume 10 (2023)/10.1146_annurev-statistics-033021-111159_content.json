{"Literature Review": "The concept of three-decision methods in statistical testing, as proposed by John Tukey, offers a nuanced approach to hypothesis testing that diverges from the traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) framework. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of real-valued parameters, where the decision is not merely binary but involves a third option of withholding judgment. This literature review explores the development and application of three-decision methods, examining their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications in statistical analysis. \n\nTukey's three-decision framework is rooted in decision theory, which provides a structured approach to making choices under uncertainty. The framework allows for three possible outcomes: asserting that a parameter is greater than, less than, or not significantly different from a specified null value. This contrasts with the binary nature of NHST, which only allows for rejection or non-rejection of the null hypothesis. The three-decision approach aligns with the principles of decision theory, which emphasize the importance of considering all possible outcomes and their associated risks (Berger, 1985). \n\nOne of the key advantages of the three-decision framework is its ability to incorporate Bayesian methods, which offer a probabilistic interpretation of statistical evidence. Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing provide a natural complement to the three-decision framework, as they allow for the incorporation of prior information and the calculation of posterior probabilities. This integration of Bayesian and frequentist methods has been shown to enhance the interpretability and robustness of statistical tests (Gelman et al., 2013). \n\nThe three-decision framework also addresses some of the well-documented limitations of NHST, such as the reliance on p-values and the potential for Type I and Type II errors. By allowing for a third decision option, the framework reduces the risk of making incorrect inferences based on arbitrary significance thresholds. This is particularly important in the context of multiple testing, where the probability of false positives increases with the number of tests conducted. The three-decision approach provides a more flexible and nuanced method for controlling the family-wise error rate and improving the reliability of statistical conclusions (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). \n\nFurthermore, the three-decision framework offers a more intuitive interpretation of confidence intervals, which are often misunderstood in the context of NHST. Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for a parameter, but their interpretation is frequently conflated with hypothesis testing. The three-decision approach clarifies this relationship by explicitly linking confidence intervals to the decision-making process, thereby enhancing the clarity and transparency of statistical reporting (Morey et al., 2016). \n\nIn addition to its theoretical advantages, the three-decision framework has practical applications in a variety of fields, including medicine, psychology, and economics. For example, in clinical trials, the framework can be used to make more informed decisions about the efficacy of a treatment, taking into account the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. Similarly, in psychological research, the framework can help to address the replication crisis by providing a more robust method for evaluating the reliability of experimental findings (Ioannidis, 2005). \n\nDespite its potential benefits, the adoption of the three-decision framework has been limited by several factors, including the entrenched nature of NHST in statistical education and practice. However, recent advances in computational methods and software have made it easier to implement the three-decision approach, and there is growing interest in its application across a range of disciplines. As researchers continue to explore the limitations of traditional hypothesis testing, the three-decision framework offers a promising alternative that aligns with the principles of sound statistical reasoning and decision-making (Wagenmakers et al., 2018). \n\nIn conclusion, the three-decision framework represents a sensible and theoretically grounded approach to significance testing that addresses many of the limitations of NHST. By incorporating elements of decision theory and Bayesian analysis, the framework provides a more flexible and nuanced method for making statistical inferences. As the field of statistics continues to evolve, the three-decision approach offers a valuable tool for researchers seeking to improve the reliability and interpretability of their findings.", "References": [{"title": "Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis", "authors": "James O.
