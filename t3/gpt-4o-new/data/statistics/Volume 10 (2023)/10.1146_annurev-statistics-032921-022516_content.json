{"Literature Review": "The modeling of integer data has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the need to analyze data that are inherently discrete and often arise as differences between positive integers. This is particularly relevant in fields such as finance, clinical trials, sports analytics, and time-series analysis. The literature on models for integer data is vast, encompassing a variety of discrete distributions and time-series models that cater to both univariate and multivariate data. \n\nDiscrete distributions for integer data have been extensively studied, with the Poisson distribution being one of the most fundamental models. The Poisson distribution is particularly useful for modeling count data where events occur independently over a fixed period of time (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). However, when dealing with integer data that can take on both positive and negative values, the Skellam distribution becomes relevant. The Skellam distribution, which models the difference between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables, is particularly useful in applications such as sports analytics, where the difference in scores is of interest (Karlis and Ntzoufras, 2003). \n\nIn addition to these basic distributions, more complex models have been developed to handle overdispersion and zero-inflation, which are common in real-world data. The negative binomial distribution, for instance, is often used as an alternative to the Poisson distribution when the variance exceeds the mean (Hilbe, 2011). Zero-inflated models, such as the zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models, are employed when there is an excess of zero counts in the data (Lambert, 1992). \n\nTime-series models for integer data have also evolved significantly. Traditional autoregressive models, such as the ARIMA model, have been adapted to handle integer-valued data. The integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) model, for example, uses thinning operators to ensure that the model outputs integer values (Al-Osh and Alzaid, 1987). Thinning operators are a key component in these models, allowing for the incorporation of randomness while maintaining the discreteness of the data. \n\nMultivariate time-series models for integer data have also been developed, with applications in areas such as finance and epidemiology. The multivariate Poisson log-normal model, for instance, allows for the modeling of correlated count data (Aitchison and Ho, 1989). In the context of financial applications, models such as the autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (ARCH) and generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (GARCH) models have been extended to handle integer data. These models are particularly useful for capturing volatility clustering in financial time series (Engle, 1982; Bollerslev, 1986). \n\nStochastic processes for integer data have also been explored, with the Markov chain being a prominent example. Markov chains are used to model sequences of events where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. This is particularly useful in modeling time-series data where the order of events is important (Norris, 1998). \n\nOverall, the literature on models for integer data is rich and diverse, with numerous models available to cater to different types of data and applications. The choice of model depends on the specific characteristics of the data, such as the presence of overdispersion, zero-inflation, and correlation between variables. As the field continues to evolve, new models and methodologies are likely to emerge, further enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret integer data.", "References": [{"title": "Regression Analysis of Count Data", "authors": "Cameron, A.
