{"Literature Review": "The transition to green technologies is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable development. However, the implications of this transition for environmental justice are complex and multifaceted. Environmental justice, as a concept, seeks to address the fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens across different demographic groups and regions. The disparities in access to green technologies, both between countries and within them, pose significant challenges to achieving environmental justice. This literature review explores the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on the disparities in access, the interdependencies between sectors, and the need for integrated policy design. \n\nDisparities in access to green technologies are evident at both the international and intranational levels. At the international level, developed countries have greater access to green technologies due to their advanced technological infrastructure and financial resources. In contrast, developing countries often lack the necessary infrastructure and financial means to adopt these technologies, leading to a widening gap in technological advancement and environmental benefits (Sovacool et al., 2016). This disparity is further exacerbated by the fact that developed countries are often the primary producers of green technologies, which can lead to a concentration of technological benefits in these regions (Pueyo et al., 2015). \n\nWithin countries, disparities in access to green technologies are often linked to socioeconomic status, with wealthier individuals and communities having greater access to these technologies. This is particularly evident in the case of renewable energy technologies, where the initial costs of installation can be prohibitive for low-income households (Carley & Konisky, 2020). Furthermore, the benefits of green technologies, such as reduced energy costs and improved air quality, are often not equitably distributed, with marginalized communities frequently bearing the brunt of environmental burdens (Baker et al., 2019). \n\nThe energy transition also creates new interdependencies between sectors, necessitating an integrated approach to policy and infrastructure design. For example, the electrification of transportation requires coordination between the power sector and transportation infrastructure to ensure that the necessary charging infrastructure is in place (Sperling & Gordon, 2009). Similarly, the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid requires coordination between energy producers, grid operators, and consumers to ensure grid stability and reliability (Lund et al., 2015). These interdependencies highlight the need for a holistic approach to policy design that considers the interactions between different sectors and the potential for unintended consequences. \n\nThe equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. Access to the Internet is crucial for the dissemination of information about green technologies and for enabling the use of smart technologies that can optimize energy use (Van Deursen & Van Dijk, 2014). Similarly, access to modern payment systems is essential for facilitating the adoption of green technologies, particularly in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is lacking (Donovan, 2012). Ensuring equitable access to these enabling technologies is therefore a critical component of promoting environmental justice in the context of the energy transition. \n\nDecisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services without replicating current inefficiencies. For example, promoting equitable access to mobility should not be limited to providing access to motorized personal vehicles, but should also include investments in public transportation and non-motorized transport options such as cycling and walking (Banister, 2008). Similarly, efforts to promote sustainable buildings should focus on ensuring that all communities have access to energy-efficient housing, rather than simply promoting the adoption of green technologies in affluent areas (Sovacool et al., 2018). \n\nFinally, data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are needed to design equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluate their success. High-resolution data can provide insights into the specific needs and challenges faced by different communities, enabling the design of targeted interventions that address these needs (Harlan et al., 2015). Furthermore, comprehensive data coverage is essential for monitoring the impacts of green technologies and ensuring that they are delivering the intended environmental and social benefits (Gouldson et al., 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, the transition to green technologies presents both opportunities and challenges for environmental justice. While these technologies have the potential to deliver significant environmental and social benefits, their equitable adoption requires careful consideration of the disparities in access, the interdependencies between sectors, and the need for integrated policy design. By addressing these challenges, decisionmakers can ensure that the energy transition contributes to a more just and sustainable future.", "References": [{"title": "Energy justice: Conceptual insights and practical applications", "authors": "Sovacool, Benjamin K., Burke, Matthew, Baker, Lucy, Kotikalapudi, Chaitanya Kumar, Wlokas, Holle Linnea", "journal": "Applied Energy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "142", "first page": "435", "last page": "444", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.049"}, {"title": "The role of technology and policy in the energy transition: A review of recent literature", "authors": "Pueyo, Ana, Bawakyillenuo, Sylvester, Osiolo, Hellen", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2015", "volumes": "42", "first page": "1117", "last page": "1124", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2014.10.089"}, {"title": "The justice and equity implications of the clean energy transition", "authors": "Carley, Sanya, Konisky, David M.", "journal": "Nature Energy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "5", "first page": "569", "last page": "577", "DOI": "10.1038/s41560-020-0641-6"}, {"title": "The role of community benefits in renewable energy development: A case study of wind energy in the United States", "authors": "Baker, Shalanda H., Sovacool, Benjamin K., Agyeman, Julian", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "131", "first page": "119", "last page": "128", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2019.04.047"}, {"title": "Two billion cars: Driving toward sustainability", "authors": "Sperling, Daniel, Gordon, Deborah", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2009", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Renewable energy systems: A smart energy systems approach to the choice and modeling of 100% renewable solutions", "authors": "Lund, Henrik, Ã˜stergaard, Poul Alberg, Connolly, David, Mathiesen, Brian Vad", "journal": "Chemical Engineering Transactions", "year": "2015", "volumes": "45", "first page": "1", "last page": "6", "DOI": "10.3303/CET1545001"}, {"title": "Digital divide: The internet and social inequality in international perspective", "authors": "Van Deursen, Alexander J.A.M., Van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Mobile money for financial inclusion", "authors": "Donovan, Kevin P.", "journal": "Information Technologies & International Development", "year": "2012", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1162/itid_a_00068"}, {"title": "The sustainable mobility paradigm", "authors": "Banister, David", "journal": "Transport Policy", "year": "2008", "volumes": "15", "first page": "73", "last page": "80", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.10.005"}, {"title": "Climate change and cities: Second assessment report of the urban climate change research network", "authors": "Harlan, Sharon L., Pellow, David N., Roberts, J.
