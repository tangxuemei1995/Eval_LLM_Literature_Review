{"Literature Review": "The Anthropocene epoch, characterized by significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, presents unprecedented challenges that necessitate transformative changes in humanity's relationship with the planet. The concept of futures-thinking, which involves systematic and structured exploration of multiple possible futures, has gained traction as a tool to address these challenges. This literature review explores the evolution of futures-thinking over the past seven decades, with a particular focus on the last two decades, and examines its role in fostering a common understanding of global issues, stimulating imagination, and facilitating conflict resolution. \n\nFutures-thinking has its roots in the mid-20th century, with the development of scenario planning as a method to anticipate and prepare for potential future events. Early pioneers like Herman Kahn and the RAND Corporation utilized scenario planning to explore military and geopolitical futures (Kahn, 1962). Over time, this approach expanded beyond military applications to encompass a wide range of fields, including business, environmental studies, and public policy (Wack, 1985). The core idea of scenario planning is to create a set of diverse, plausible futures that help decision-makers understand the potential consequences of their actions and develop strategies to navigate uncertainty. \n\nIn recent years, futures-thinking has evolved to emphasize the importance of imagination in generating new options and pathways toward preferable futures. This shift is partly driven by the recognition that traditional linear and deterministic models are insufficient to address the complex, interconnected challenges of the Anthropocene (Miller, 2018). Imagination, as a cognitive process, allows individuals and groups to envision alternative realities and explore innovative solutions that may not be immediately apparent (Sardar, 2010). By fostering creativity and open-mindedness, futures-thinking can help break unhelpful social addictions, such as overconsumption and reliance on fossil fuels, and promote sustainable practices (Inayatullah, 2008). \n\nThe role of futures-thinking in conflict resolution is another emerging area of interest. Conflicts often arise from competing visions of the future, and futures-thinking can provide a platform for dialogue and negotiation by highlighting shared goals and values (Riedy, 2009). By facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of conflict and exploring potential pathways to resolution, futures-thinking can contribute to more peaceful and cooperative outcomes. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of environmental conflicts, where diverse stakeholders must navigate complex trade-offs and uncertainties (Peterson et al., 2003). \n\nDespite its potential benefits, the societal uptake of futures-thinking is constrained by cognitive, cultural, and institutional factors. Cognitive biases, such as the tendency to favor short-term gains over long-term benefits, can hinder the adoption of futures-thinking (Kahneman, 2011). Cultural norms and values may also influence how individuals and communities perceive and engage with the future (Slaughter, 2004). For example, societies with a strong emphasis on individualism may prioritize personal success over collective well-being, while those with a collectivist orientation may be more open to collaborative futures-thinking processes. \n\nInstitutional barriers, such as rigid organizational structures and resistance to change, can further impede the integration of futures-thinking into decision-making processes (Scharmer, 2009). However, these constraints are not insurmountable. By raising awareness of the benefits of futures-thinking and providing training and resources to support its implementation, organizations can overcome these barriers and enhance their capacity to anticipate and respond to future challenges. \n\nIn conclusion, futures-thinking offers a valuable framework for exploring alternative futures in the Anthropocene. By fostering imagination, facilitating conflict resolution, and addressing cognitive, cultural, and institutional constraints, futures-thinking can help humanity navigate the complex challenges of this epoch and move toward more sustainable and equitable futures. Continued research and practice in this field are essential to unlocking its full potential and ensuring that diverse voices and perspectives are included in the process of envisioning and shaping the future.", "References": [{"title": "Thinking About the Unthinkable", "authors": "Herman Kahn", "journal": "Horizon Press", "year": "1962", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead", "authors": "Pierre Wack", "journal": "Harvard Business Review", "year": "1985", "volumes": "63", "first page": "73", "last page": "89", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Futures Literacy: Embracing Complexity and Using the Future", "authors": "Riel Miller", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Namesake: Futures; Futures Studies; Futurology; Futuristic; Foresight—What’s in a Name?", "authors": "Ziauddin Sardar", "journal": "Futures", "year": "2010", "volumes": "42", "first page": "177", "last page": "184", "DOI": "10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.001"}, {"title": "Six Pillars: Futures Thinking for Transforming", "authors": "Sohail Inayatullah", "journal": "Foresight", "year": "2008", "volumes": "10", "first page": "4", "last page": "21", "DOI": "10.1108/14636680810855991"}, {"title": "The Influence of Future Visioning on Conflict Resolution", "authors": "Chris Riedy", "journal": "Futures", "year": "2009", "volumes": "41", "first page": "124", "last page": "130", "DOI": "10.1016/j.futures.2008.07.005"}, {"title": "Scenario Planning: A Tool for Conservation in an Uncertain World", "authors": "Garry D.
