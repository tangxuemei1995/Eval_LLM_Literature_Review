{"Literature Review": "The concept of 30×30, which aims to protect 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030, has gained significant traction as a global conservation strategy. This initiative is seen as a critical step in mitigating biodiversity loss and addressing climate change. The integration of climate change considerations into conservation strategies has been a growing focus since the early 2000s. The seminal work by Thomas et al. (2004) highlighted the potential extinction risks posed by climate change, emphasizing the need for adaptive conservation strategies. This study was pivotal in shifting the conservation paradigm to include climate change as a central component of biodiversity management (Thomas et al., 2004). \n\nThe concept of 'species on the move' due to climate change has been extensively documented. Parmesan and Yohe (2003) provided early evidence of species shifting their ranges in response to changing climates, a phenomenon that has only accelerated with increasing global temperatures. This movement necessitates a reevaluation of conservation strategies to ensure that protected areas are not only static but also dynamic, allowing for species migration and adaptation (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003). \n\nThe velocity of climate change, a term coined to describe the rate at which climate zones are shifting, has become a critical factor in conservation planning. Loarie et al. (2009) quantified this velocity and demonstrated its implications for biodiversity, suggesting that traditional conservation areas may not suffice in the face of rapid climate shifts. This has led to the development of strategies such as assisted migration, where species are actively relocated to areas with suitable climates (Loarie et al., 2009). \n\nSystematic conservation planning has evolved to incorporate climate change projections, with regional modeling playing a crucial role. Araújo et al. (2011) discussed the importance of using climate models to predict biodiversity changes and inform conservation priorities. These models help identify potential refugia and corridors that facilitate species movement, ensuring that conservation efforts are proactive rather than reactive (Araújo et al., 2011). \n\nDespite advancements in integrating climate change into conservation planning, regional coordination remains a significant challenge. The lack of consistent management across political and ecological boundaries can hinder the effectiveness of conservation strategies. As highlighted by Hannah et al. (2007), there is a need for improved regional coordination to manage species movements effectively and ensure that conservation efforts are aligned across different jurisdictions (Hannah et al., 2007). \n\nThe focus on warming scenarios has dominated climate change biology, but the potential for overshooting and then cooling back to target temperatures presents new challenges. This double transition requires innovative conservation strategies that can accommodate both warming and subsequent cooling phases. Williams et al. (2007) emphasized the importance of flexible conservation frameworks that can adapt to these changing conditions, ensuring that biodiversity is protected throughout the entire climate transition process (Williams et al., 2007). \n\nThe 30×30 initiative represents an unprecedented opportunity to integrate climate change considerations into global conservation efforts. However, achieving this goal requires addressing several key challenges. First, there is a need for more comprehensive regional coordination to manage species movements effectively. Second, conservation strategies must be adaptable to both warming and cooling scenarios, ensuring that biodiversity is protected throughout the entire climate transition process. Finally, there is a need for continued research and innovation in conservation planning to address the complex and dynamic nature of climate change. \n\nIn conclusion, the integration of climate change into conservation strategies has evolved significantly over the past two decades. The 30×30 initiative provides a framework for further advancing these efforts, but success will depend on addressing the challenges of regional coordination, adaptive management, and innovative conservation planning. As the world moves towards 2030, it is imperative that conservation strategies continue to evolve to meet the demands of a changing climate.", "References": [{"title": "Extinction risk from climate change", "authors": "Chris D.
