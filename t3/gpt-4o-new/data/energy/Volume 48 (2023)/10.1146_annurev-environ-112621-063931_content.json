{"Literature Review": "The transition to zero-carbon cities is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable development. This transition is not only about reducing carbon emissions but also about achieving co-benefits in health, well-being, equity, and climate resilience, collectively referred to as WHER outcomes. The integration of these outcomes into urban decarbonization strategies is essential for creating sustainable and livable cities. However, the scientific understanding of the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes is still developing. This literature review explores the current state of knowledge on these linkages, identifies key gaps, and suggests directions for future research. \n\nUrban metabolism frameworks provide a useful lens for understanding the complex interactions between urban systems and their environmental impacts. These frameworks consider cities as systems of energy and material flows, which can be optimized to reduce carbon emissions and enhance WHER outcomes. For instance, Kennedy et al. (2011) highlight the importance of urban metabolism in understanding the energy and material flows in cities and their implications for sustainability. By applying such frameworks, cities can identify opportunities for decarbonization that also promote health, well-being, equity, and resilience. \n\nHealth co-benefits of urban decarbonization are well-documented in the literature. For example, reducing air pollution through cleaner energy sources and transportation options can lead to significant health improvements, as noted by Anenberg et al. (2012). Similarly, promoting active transportation, such as walking and cycling, not only reduces emissions but also enhances physical health and reduces the risk of chronic diseases (Woodcock et al., 2009). These health co-benefits are crucial for gaining public support for decarbonization policies and for achieving broader sustainability goals. \n\nThe linkages between decarbonization and well-being are less well understood. While some studies suggest that sustainable urban environments can enhance quality of life, the evidence is limited. For instance, the provision of green spaces and improved urban design can contribute to mental well-being and social cohesion (Hartig et al., 2014). However, more research is needed to understand how these factors interact with decarbonization efforts and to quantify their impacts on well-being. \n\nClimate resilience is another critical outcome of urban decarbonization, but the evidence for its co-benefits is uncertain. Resilience involves the capacity of urban systems to withstand and recover from climate-related shocks and stresses. While decarbonization can reduce the severity of climate impacts, it does not automatically enhance resilience. As noted by Meerow et al. (2016), resilience requires intentional planning and design, including the integration of climate adaptation measures into urban infrastructure and policies. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach that combines mitigation and adaptation strategies. \n\nEquity is a fundamental consideration in urban transitions, yet it is often overlooked in decarbonization efforts. Achieving equitable outcomes requires addressing distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects of equity. Distributional equity involves ensuring that the benefits and burdens of decarbonization are shared fairly across different social groups. Procedural equity focuses on inclusive decision-making processes, while recognitional equity emphasizes the acknowledgment of diverse identities and experiences. As highlighted by Agyeman et al. (2003), intentional design is necessary to advance equity in urban transitions, and this requires a deep understanding of the social dynamics and power relations within cities. \n\nThe evidence base for co-beneficial decarbonization is strong for health, limited for well-being, uncertain for resilience, and requires intentional design to advance equity. To address these gaps, there is a need for fine-scale data that encompasses all seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems across scales. This data should be accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models that can capture the complex interactions between decarbonization and WHER outcomes. Such models can provide valuable insights into the trade-offs and synergies between different policy options and help guide decision-making processes. \n\nIn conclusion, achieving zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits is a complex and multifaceted challenge. While significant progress has been made in understanding the health co-benefits of decarbonization, more research is needed to explore the linkages with well-being, resilience, and equity. By advancing urban nexus science and developing comprehensive models, researchers and policymakers can better navigate the complexities of urban transitions and create sustainable, equitable, and resilient cities.", "References": [{"title": "The study of urban metabolism and its applications to urban planning and design", "authors": "Christopher Kennedy, John Cuddihy, Joshua Engel-Yan", "journal": "Environmental Pollution", "year": "2011", "volumes": "159", "first page": "1965", "last page": "1973", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.022"}, {"title": "Global air quality and health co-benefits of mitigating near-term climate change through methane and black carbon emission controls", "authors": "Susan C.
