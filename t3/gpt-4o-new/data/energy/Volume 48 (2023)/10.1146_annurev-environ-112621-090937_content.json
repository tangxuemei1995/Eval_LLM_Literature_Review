{"Literature Review": "Fungi, as a kingdom, represent a significant portion of Earth's biodiversity, yet they remain one of the least understood groups of organisms. The estimated number of fungal species has been a subject of debate, with recent estimates suggesting a range of 2 to 3 million species, with a 'best estimate' of 2.5 million (Hawksworth and Lücking, 2017). This estimate underscores the vast unknown diversity of fungi, as only about 120,000 species have been formally described (Blackwell, 2011). The discrepancy between known and estimated species highlights the need for innovative approaches to fungal taxonomy and conservation.\n\nThe distribution of fungi is influenced by a variety of ecological and environmental factors. Fungi are ubiquitous, found in virtually all ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, and play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, symbiotic relationships, and as decomposers (Peay et al., 2016). The global distribution of fungi is uneven, with tropical and temperate regions exhibiting the highest diversity (Tedersoo et al., 2014). This pattern is consistent with the distribution of plant diversity, as fungi often form symbiotic relationships with plants, such as mycorrhizal associations, which are critical for plant nutrient uptake (Smith and Read, 2008).\n\nThe use of DNA-based methods, such as metabarcoding, has revolutionized the study of fungal diversity and distribution. These methods allow for the identification of fungi from environmental samples without the need for culturing, thus revealing a hidden diversity that was previously inaccessible (Nilsson et al., 2019). Metabarcoding has been particularly useful in uncovering the diversity of early diverging fungi, which are often overlooked in traditional surveys (Tedersoo et al., 2017). However, the reliance on DNA data also presents challenges, such as the need for comprehensive reference databases and the difficulty in linking DNA sequences to described species (Kõljalg et al., 2013).\n\nConservation of fungi has historically been neglected, despite their ecological importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List includes only a small fraction of fungal species, and there is a lack of specific conservation guidelines for fungi (Dahlberg and Mueller, 2011). The recognition of fungi in conservation efforts is crucial, as they are integral to ecosystem functioning and resilience. In situ conservation, which involves protecting fungi in their natural habitats, is essential for maintaining fungal diversity (Heilmann-Clausen et al., 2015). Ex situ conservation, such as the establishment of fungal culture collections, also plays a role in preserving fungal genetic resources (Smith et al., 2018).\n\nThe fungus:plant ratio is an important consideration in understanding fungal diversity and distribution. Studies have shown that the ratio of fungal species to plant species can vary widely, with estimates ranging from 6:1 to 33:1 (Hawksworth, 1991). This ratio is influenced by factors such as habitat type, climate, and the presence of specific plant hosts. Understanding the fungus:plant ratio is important for predicting fungal diversity in different ecosystems and for informing conservation strategies.\n\nThe call for large-scale sampling campaigns is a critical step in advancing fungal biodiversity research. Such campaigns would provide the data needed to refine estimates of fungal diversity, improve our understanding of fungal distribution, and inform conservation efforts (Abarenkov et al., 2010). These campaigns should prioritize regions with high fungal diversity, such as tropical and temperate ecoregions, and should incorporate both traditional and DNA-based methods to capture the full spectrum of fungal diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, fungi represent a frontier of biodiversity research with many unanswered questions. Their diversity, distribution, and conservation are interconnected issues that require a multidisciplinary approach. By integrating traditional taxonomy with modern DNA-based methods, and by prioritizing fungal conservation, we can begin to unveil the hidden diversity of fungi and ensure their preservation for future generations.", "References": [{"title": "The number of fungi: is the descriptive phase of fungal taxonomy over?", "authors": "David L.
