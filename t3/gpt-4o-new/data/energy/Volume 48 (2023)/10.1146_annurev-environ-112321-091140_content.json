{"Literature Review": "The transition to renewable electricity is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change and address environmental challenges. Understanding the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity is essential for effective policy and investment decisions. This literature review synthesizes findings from various studies on the potential of different renewable energy technologies, including utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean energy technologies such as wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), and salinity gradient energy. \n\nThe technical potential of renewable energy refers to the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated using current technologies, considering geographical and technical limitations and conversion efficiencies. Studies have shown that the technical potential for utility-scale solar PV, CSP, onshore wind, and offshore wind exceeds 100 PWh/year (Jacobson et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2009). These technologies benefit from vast resource availability and significant advancements in technology that have improved efficiency and reduced costs. For instance, solar PV and wind energy have seen substantial cost reductions over the past decade, making them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources (IRENA, 2019). \n\nHydropower, geothermal electricity, and OTEC have technical potentials above 10 PWh/year (Kumar et al., 2011; Tester et al., 2006). Hydropower is a mature technology with a well-established infrastructure, but its expansion is often limited by environmental and social concerns, such as ecosystem disruption and displacement of communities (Zarfl et al., 2015). Geothermal energy, while having a smaller footprint, is geographically constrained to regions with suitable geological conditions (Lund et al., 2010). OTEC, still in the experimental stage, offers significant potential but faces technical and economic challenges that need to be addressed before large-scale deployment (Vega, 2010). \n\nRooftop solar PV, wave, and tidal energy have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year, while salinity gradient energy has a technical potential above 0.1 PWh/year (Gielen et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2011). Rooftop solar PV is particularly attractive for urban areas, providing a decentralized energy source that can reduce transmission losses and enhance energy security (Zhang et al., 2015). Wave and tidal energy are promising but are still in the early stages of development, with significant technological and economic barriers to overcome (Lewis et al., 2011). Salinity gradient energy, which exploits the energy released when freshwater and seawater mix, is a novel concept with potential but requires further research and development (Post et al., 2007). \n\nThe economic potential of renewable energy considers the cost of each resource and its competitiveness with other energy sources. Studies indicate that the economic potential of renewables is higher than current and near-future electricity demand, driven by declining costs and technological advancements (IRENA, 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). However, the economic potential varies significantly across regions due to differences in resource availability, infrastructure, and market conditions (Lu et al., 2009). \n\nFewer studies have assessed the global feasible potential of renewables, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints. These constraints include land use conflicts, environmental impacts, and social acceptance, which can significantly limit the deployment of renewable energy technologies (Zarfl et al., 2015; Gielen et al., 2019). For example, while the technical potential for wind and solar is vast, their deployment can be hindered by land availability and public opposition to large-scale installations (Zhang et al., 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, the literature highlights the substantial technical and economic potential of renewable energy technologies, which can meet and exceed global electricity demand. However, realizing this potential requires addressing societal and environmental constraints and investing in research and development to overcome technological and economic barriers. Policymakers and stakeholders must consider these factors when planning for a sustainable energy future, ensuring that the transition to renewable energy is both effective and equitable.", "References": [{"title": "100% clean and renewable wind, water, and sunlight all-sector energy roadmaps for 139 countries of the world", "authors": "Mark Z.
