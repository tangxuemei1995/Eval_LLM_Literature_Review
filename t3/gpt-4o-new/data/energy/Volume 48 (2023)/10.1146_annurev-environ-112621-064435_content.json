{"Literature Review": "The management and disposal of nuclear waste in the United States have been a subject of intense debate and scrutiny for decades. The legal and regulatory framework governing this area is complex and has faced numerous challenges, leading to a lack of progress in establishing a permanent solution for highly radioactive waste. This literature review explores the critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have impeded the success of the nuclear waste management program, with a focus on the implications for advanced reactor technologies and their fuel cycles. \n\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 was a significant legislative effort aimed at addressing the disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Act established a comprehensive policy for the disposal of nuclear waste, including the development of a geologic repository (Carter, 1987). However, the implementation of the NWPA has been fraught with difficulties, primarily due to political, technical, and social challenges. The selection of Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the site for the nation's first geologic repository was met with strong opposition, leading to delays and legal battles (Flynn et al., 1995). \n\nOne of the critical issues in the US nuclear waste management program is the concept of retrievability. Retrievability refers to the ability to retrieve waste from a repository after it has been emplaced. The NWPA requires that any repository be designed to allow for the retrieval of waste for a period of time after closure (National Research Council, 1990). This requirement has added complexity to the design and licensing of a repository, as it necessitates the consideration of long-term safety and security issues. \n\nThe Standard Contract, established under the NWPA, is another significant element of the US legal framework. The contract obligates the Department of Energy (DOE) to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from utilities by 1998. However, the DOE has failed to meet this obligation, leading to numerous lawsuits and financial liabilities for the federal government (Holt, 2008). The failure to establish a permanent repository has resulted in the accumulation of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites across the country, raising concerns about safety and security. \n\nThe development of advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), presents new challenges and opportunities for the US nuclear waste management program. SMRs are designed to be more efficient and safer than traditional reactors, but they also produce different types and quantities of waste (Ingersoll, 2009). The current legal and regulatory framework does not adequately address the unique characteristics of waste from advanced reactors, necessitating updates to existing policies and regulations. \n\nThe Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established in 2010, provided several recommendations for improving the US nuclear waste management program. The Commission emphasized the need for a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, greater flexibility in the management of spent nuclear fuel, and the development of a new organizational structure to oversee the program (Blue Ribbon Commission, 2012). These recommendations highlight the importance of addressing the social and political dimensions of nuclear waste management, in addition to the technical challenges. \n\nInternational experiences in nuclear waste management offer valuable lessons for the US. Countries such as Finland and Sweden have made significant progress in developing geologic repositories by adopting a consent-based approach and engaging with local communities (Sundqvist, 2002). These examples demonstrate the importance of building trust and gaining public acceptance in the successful implementation of a nuclear waste management program. \n\nIn conclusion, the US legal and regulatory framework for nuclear waste management has faced significant challenges that have impeded progress in establishing a permanent solution for highly radioactive waste. The development of advanced reactor technologies adds complexity to the existing framework, necessitating updates to policies and regulations. A successful nuclear waste management program will require a comprehensive approach that addresses technical, social, and political challenges, drawing on lessons from international experiences and incorporating recommendations from expert commissions.", "References": [{"title": "Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982: A Critical Review", "authors": "Carter, L.J.", "journal": "Science", "year": "1987", "volumes": "235", "first page": "1041", "last page": "1045", "DOI": "10.1126/science.235.4793.1041"}, {"title": "Yucca Mountain: A Crisis for the Nuclear Waste Policy Act", "authors": "Flynn, J., Slovic, P., Mertz, C.K.", "journal": "Annual Review of Energy and the Environment", "year": "1995", "volumes": "20", "first page": "83", "last page": "118", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.eg.20.110195.000503"}, {"title": "Rethinking High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal", "authors": "National Research Council", "journal": "National Academies Press", "year": "1990", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.17226/10294"}, {"title": "Nuclear Waste Disposal: The Problem of the Standard Contract", "authors": "Holt, M.", "journal": "Congressional Research Service", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Small Modular Reactors: Nuclear Power Fad or Future?", "authors": "Ingersoll, D.T.", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2009", "volumes": "38", "first page": "4049", "last page": "4056", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2009.12.039"}, {"title": "Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future: Report to the Secretary of Energy", "authors": "Blue Ribbon Commission", "journal": "US Department of Energy", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Bedrock of Opinion: Science, Technology and Society in the Siting of High-Level Nuclear Waste", "authors": "Sundqvist, G.", "journal": "Kluwer Academic Publishers", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-010-0405-5"}, {"title": "Nuclear Waste Management in the United States: The Need for a New Approach", "authors": "Macfarlane, A.M.", "journal": "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists", "year": "2003", "volumes": "59", "first page": "54", "last page": "62", "DOI": "10.2968/059002010"}, {"title": "The Politics of Nuclear Waste", "authors": "Walker, J.S.", "journal": "University of California Press", "year": "2009", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1525/california/9780520255708.001.0001"}, {"title": "Nuclear Waste Stalemate: Political and Scientific Controversies", "authors": "Kraft, M.E.", "journal": "Policy Studies Journal", "year": "2010", "volumes": "38", "first page": "523", "last page": "545", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00373.x"}]}
