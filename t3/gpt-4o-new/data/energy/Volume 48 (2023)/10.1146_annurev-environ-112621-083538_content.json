{"Literature Review": "The attribution of extreme weather events to climate change has become a pivotal area of research, particularly in the context of understanding the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. This field has gained significant traction over the past decade, as it provides a scientific basis for linking specific extreme weather events to broader climate change trends. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has incorporated these studies into its assessment reports, underscoring their importance in understanding present-day climate impacts (Stott et al., 2016). \n\nAttribution studies typically employ two main approaches: event-based and probabilistic methods. Event-based attribution focuses on specific extreme events, analyzing the extent to which climate change has influenced their occurrence or intensity. Probabilistic methods, on the other hand, assess how climate change alters the likelihood of such events occurring. These methods have been used to attribute a range of extreme events, including heatwaves, floods, and hurricanes, to climate change (Otto et al., 2015). \n\nOne of the key challenges in this field is the integration of different attribution methods. While the academic discourse often highlights the differences between these methods, the IPCC has found that these differences are smaller than previously thought (Bindoff et al., 2013). This suggests that a more unified approach to attribution could be developed, which would enhance the reliability and applicability of attribution studies. \n\nThe necessity of individual attribution studies is another area of ongoing research. While some argue that existing studies provide sufficient information to inform policy and societal responses, others contend that new studies are needed to address specific questions or regions. This is particularly true in the Global South, where there is a significant gap in attribution research (Hulme, 2014). This gap raises ethical questions about the role of attribution in informing adaptation and loss and damage policies, as well as the need to consider vulnerability in these contexts. \n\nVulnerability is a critical factor in the attribution of extreme events. It influences the extent to which communities are affected by such events and their capacity to respond. Studies have shown that vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, highlighting the need for attribution studies to consider vulnerability alongside climate change (Field et al., 2012). This is particularly important in the Global South, where vulnerability is often higher due to socio-economic and environmental factors. \n\nThe role of attribution in policy contexts is another important consideration. Attribution studies can inform adaptation strategies by identifying the specific impacts of climate change on extreme weather events. They can also support loss and damage assessments by providing evidence of the link between climate change and extreme events. However, the use of attribution in policy contexts raises ethical questions about responsibility and compensation, particularly in the Global South (Hulme, 2014). \n\nIn conclusion, the attribution of extreme events to climate change is a rapidly evolving field that provides valuable insights into the impacts of climate change. While significant progress has been made in developing attribution methods and integrating them into policy contexts, important gaps remain, particularly in the Global South. Addressing these gaps will require a concerted effort to develop more comprehensive and inclusive attribution studies that consider vulnerability and ethical considerations. This will be essential for informing effective adaptation and loss and damage policies in the face of increasing climate change impacts.", "References": [{"title": "Attribution of extreme weather and climate-related events", "authors": "Peter A.
