{"Literature Review": "The concept of energy justice has gained significant traction in recent years, as scholars and policymakers recognize the importance of equitable energy distribution and access. Energy justice is often framed through three primary dimensions: distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice (Jenkins et al., 2016). Distributive justice focuses on the equitable allocation of energy resources and services, procedural justice emphasizes fair and inclusive decision-making processes, and recognition justice addresses the acknowledgment and respect of diverse identities and needs within energy systems (Sovacool et al., 2017). These dimensions provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating energy equity metrics. \n\nEnergy equity metrics are essential tools for assessing and promoting energy justice. They enable stakeholders to measure and analyze disparities in energy access, affordability, and sustainability. One of the key areas of focus in energy equity metrics is vulnerability, which examines the susceptibility of certain populations to energy-related hardships. For instance, Bouzarovski and Simcock (2017) highlight the importance of identifying vulnerable groups, such as low-income households and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately affected by energy poverty. Metrics that assess vulnerability can inform targeted interventions and policies to alleviate energy-related inequalities. \n\nWealth creation is another critical aspect of energy equity metrics. The transition to sustainable energy systems presents opportunities for economic development and job creation. Metrics that evaluate the distribution of economic benefits from renewable energy projects can help ensure that these benefits are equitably shared among different communities. Heffron and McCauley (2018) argue that energy justice should encompass not only the fair distribution of energy resources but also the equitable distribution of economic opportunities arising from the energy transition. \n\nEnergy poverty is a well-documented issue that energy equity metrics aim to address. Energy poverty refers to the inability of individuals or households to access adequate energy services at an affordable cost. Metrics that measure energy poverty often consider factors such as energy expenditure as a percentage of income, access to modern energy services, and the quality of energy infrastructure (Bouzarovski and Petrova, 2015). These metrics provide valuable insights into the extent and severity of energy poverty, enabling policymakers to design targeted interventions to alleviate this issue. \n\nLife cycle analysis is another important component of energy equity metrics. This approach considers the environmental and social impacts of energy systems throughout their entire life cycle, from resource extraction to disposal. By incorporating life cycle analysis into energy equity metrics, stakeholders can assess the sustainability and equity implications of different energy technologies and policies. Sovacool et al. (2016) emphasize the need for comprehensive life cycle assessments that account for both environmental and social dimensions to ensure that energy systems are truly equitable and sustainable. \n\nComparative country-level dynamics provide valuable insights into the global landscape of energy equity. Metrics that compare energy access, affordability, and sustainability across countries can highlight disparities and identify best practices. For example, the World Bank's Global Tracking Framework provides a comprehensive set of indicators for assessing energy access and sustainability at the national level (World Bank, 2018). Such comparative metrics can inform international cooperation and policy development to promote energy justice on a global scale. \n\nDespite the progress made in developing energy equity metrics, several limitations and gaps remain. One of the main challenges is the lack of standardized metrics and methodologies, which can hinder comparability and consistency across studies and contexts (Jenkins et al., 2016). Additionally, many existing metrics focus primarily on distributive justice, with less attention given to procedural and recognition justice. This imbalance can limit the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of energy equity assessments. \n\nTrade-offs are also inherent in the design and implementation of energy equity metrics. For instance, efforts to improve energy access and affordability may conflict with environmental sustainability goals, leading to difficult decisions and compromises (Heffron and McCauley, 2018). Balancing these trade-offs requires careful consideration of the diverse and sometimes competing objectives of energy justice. \n\nIn conclusion, energy equity metrics are vital tools for advancing energy justice and informing decision-making processes. By incorporating dimensions of vulnerability, wealth creation, energy poverty, life cycle analysis, and comparative country-level dynamics, these metrics provide a comprehensive framework for assessing and promoting energy equity. However, further research and development are needed to address existing limitations and gaps, and to ensure that energy equity metrics effectively capture the complex and multifaceted nature of energy justice.", "References": [{"title": "Energy justice: A conceptual review", "authors": "Kirsten Jenkins, Darren McCauley, Raphael Heffron, Hannes Stephan, Robert Rehner", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "174", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2015.10.004"}, {"title": "Energy justice and the capability approach: An empirical exploration", "authors": "Benjamin K.
