{"Literature Review": "The concept of deforestation-free commodity supply chains has gained significant attention over the past two decades, driven by the urgent need to address the environmental impacts of deforestation. Zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs) have been adopted by various stakeholders, including private companies, public-private coalitions, and governments, with the aim of eliminating deforestation from commodity supply chains. Despite these efforts, the effectiveness of ZDCs remains a subject of debate, as high rates of deforestation persist globally. This literature review examines the current state of ZDCs, their successes and limitations, and the broader policy context in which they operate. \n\nThe emergence of ZDCs can be traced back to the early 2000s, when the growing awareness of the environmental and social impacts of deforestation led to increased pressure on companies to adopt sustainable practices. The Consumer Goods Forum, a global industry network, played a pivotal role in promoting ZDCs by encouraging its members to commit to zero net deforestation by 2020 (Lambin et al., 2018). These commitments were further reinforced by initiatives such as the New York Declaration on Forests, which aimed to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030 (Seymour & Busch, 2016). \n\nDespite these high-profile commitments, the effectiveness of ZDCs in reducing deforestation has been mixed. On the one hand, some region- and commodity-specific ZDCs have led to significant reductions in deforestation. For example, the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Amazon, which prohibits the purchase of soy grown on recently deforested land, has been credited with reducing deforestation rates in the region (Gibbs et al., 2015). Similarly, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has made progress in promoting sustainable palm oil production, although its impact on deforestation remains contested (Carlson et al., 2018). \n\nOn the other hand, the overall impact of ZDCs on global deforestation rates has been limited. One reason for this is the issue of leakage, where deforestation is displaced to areas not covered by ZDCs. For instance, while the Soy Moratorium has been successful in the Brazilian Amazon, deforestation has increased in the Cerrado, a neighboring biome not covered by the moratorium (Nepstad et al., 2014). Additionally, ZDCs often cover only a small share of tropical deforestation, as they are typically limited to specific commodities and regions (Garrett et al., 2019). \n\nAnother challenge facing ZDCs is the lack of comprehensive monitoring and traceability systems. While progress has been made in developing tools to track deforestation, such as satellite imagery and supply chain mapping, these systems are not yet fully integrated or universally adopted (Hansen et al., 2013). This makes it difficult to verify compliance with ZDCs and hold companies accountable for their commitments. Furthermore, the complexity of global supply chains, with multiple intermediaries and opaque sourcing practices, adds to the difficulty of ensuring deforestation-free commodities (Gardner et al., 2019). \n\nThe role of governments in supporting ZDCs is also crucial. While some governments have implemented policies to support deforestation-free supply chains, such as Brazil's Forest Code, others have been less proactive or even counterproductive (Boucher et al., 2011). For example, recent policy changes in Brazil have weakened environmental protections, potentially undermining the effectiveness of ZDCs in the region (Fearnside, 2017). To enhance the impact of ZDCs, it is essential for governments to align their policies with private sector commitments and provide the necessary regulatory and enforcement frameworks. \n\nTo address these challenges, scholars and practitioners have called for a more comprehensive approach to ZDCs that covers entire biomes, supply bases of companies, and both export and domestic markets (Lambin et al., 2018). This would require greater collaboration between companies, governments, and civil society organizations, as well as the inclusion of marginal producers who are often excluded from current initiatives. Additionally, integrating ZDCs into broader policy mixes that address the underlying drivers of deforestation, such as land tenure insecurity and agricultural expansion, is crucial for achieving lasting reductions in deforestation (Nepstad et al., 2014). \n\nIn conclusion, while ZDCs have made some progress in reducing deforestation and raising awareness of the issue, their overall impact remains limited. To transform ZDCs from a myth into reality, it is essential to address the challenges of leakage, monitoring, and government support, and to adopt a more holistic approach that integrates ZDCs into broader policy frameworks. By doing so, it may be possible to achieve the ambitious goal of deforestation-free commodity supply chains.", "References": [{"title": "The role of supply-chain initiatives in reducing deforestation", "authors": "Eric F.
