{"Literature Review": "The past three decades have witnessed a significant evolution in climate mitigation policies, with a marked increase in the number and diversity of policy instruments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This literature review synthesizes empirical studies to assess the impact of these policies on GHG emissions, proximate emission drivers, and the development of low-carbon technologies. The review highlights the effectiveness of various policy instruments and underscores the need for enhanced policy monitoring and evaluation to achieve the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. \n\nThe initial efforts in climate mitigation during the 1990s were characterized by a limited number of policies, primarily in developed countries. However, the subsequent decades have seen a proliferation of policies across the globe, driven by international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (Höhne et al., 2017). These policies have been implemented through a variety of instruments, including carbon pricing, renewable energy mandates, and energy efficiency standards. The effectiveness of these instruments has been the subject of extensive empirical research, with studies generally finding positive impacts on emissions reductions and the promotion of low-carbon technologies (Aldy & Stavins, 2012). \n\nOne of the key outcomes of climate mitigation policies is their impact on GHG emissions. Empirical studies have shown that policies such as carbon pricing and emissions trading systems have led to significant reductions in emissions in several countries. For instance, the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has been credited with reducing emissions by approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2eq between 2005 and 2019 (Ellerman et al., 2016). Similarly, carbon taxes implemented in countries like Sweden and British Columbia have been associated with substantial emissions reductions (Andersson, 2019). These findings suggest that well-designed carbon pricing mechanisms can be effective tools for reducing GHG emissions. \n\nIn addition to direct emissions reductions, climate mitigation policies have also influenced proximate emission drivers such as energy intensity and land use. Policies promoting energy efficiency have led to significant reductions in energy use across various sectors. For example, energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings have been shown to reduce energy consumption and associated emissions (Gillingham et al., 2018). Furthermore, policies aimed at reducing deforestation, such as Brazil's Amazon Fund, have contributed to declines in deforestation rates and associated emissions (Nepstad et al., 2014). These findings highlight the importance of addressing proximate emission drivers as part of comprehensive climate mitigation strategies. \n\nThe development and deployment of low-carbon technologies have been another critical area of focus for climate mitigation policies. Empirical studies have documented the impact of policies such as renewable energy mandates and subsidies on the growth of low-carbon technologies. For instance, feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards have been instrumental in driving the expansion of wind and solar power in countries like Germany and the United States (Johnstone et al., 2010). Additionally, policies supporting research and development have contributed to cost reductions and technological advancements in low-carbon technologies (Nemet, 2009). These findings underscore the role of policy in fostering innovation and scaling up low-carbon technologies. \n\nDespite the positive impacts of climate mitigation policies, the current level of ambition falls short of what is required to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. Studies have shown that while policies have led to emissions reductions, the overall rate of emissions growth has only slowed, rather than reversed (Rogelj et al., 2016). This suggests that existing policies need to be strengthened and expanded to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Moreover, there is a need for improved policy monitoring, evaluation, and learning to enhance the effectiveness of future policies and ensure that they are based on robust empirical evidence (Jordan & Huitema, 2014). \n\nIn conclusion, the empirical literature provides ample evidence of the positive impacts of climate mitigation policies on GHG emissions, proximate emission drivers, and low-carbon technologies. However, to achieve the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, there is a need for more ambitious and comprehensive policy efforts. Enhanced policy monitoring and evaluation will be crucial in strengthening the basis for future policy and ensuring that it is informed by empirical evidence. As the global community continues to grapple with the challenge of climate change, the lessons learned from past policy experiences will be invaluable in guiding future efforts.", "References": [{"title": "The Paris Agreement: resolving the inconsistency between global goals and national contributions", "authors": "Niklas Höhne, Michel den Elzen, Joeri Rogelj, Bert Metz, Michel Schaeffer, Bill Hare, Malte Meinshausen, Nicolai Meinshausen", "journal": "Climatic Change", "year": "2017", "volumes": "142", "first page": "271", "last page": "285", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-017-1961-y"}, {"title": "The Promise and Problems of Pricing Carbon: Theory and Experience", "authors": "Joseph E.
