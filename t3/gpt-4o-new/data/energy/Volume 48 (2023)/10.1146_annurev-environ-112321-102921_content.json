{"Literature Review": "The building sector is a significant contributor to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for approximately 40% of total energy use and 30% of GHG emissions worldwide (IEA, 2020). As such, reducing energy demand in buildings is critical for achieving climate and sustainability targets. This literature review examines the current state of building sector models, identifies best practices, and highlights critical gaps in representing transformations toward low energy demand (LED) futures. It focuses on three key dimensions of intervention: socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological, as well as three megatrends: digitalization, the sharing economy, and the circular economy.\n\nSocio-behavioral interventions are crucial for reducing energy demand in buildings. Studies have shown that changes in occupant behavior can lead to significant energy savings (Delzendeh et al., 2017). For instance, energy-efficient behaviors such as adjusting thermostat settings, turning off lights, and using energy-efficient appliances can reduce energy consumption by up to 20% (Abrahamse et al., 2005). However, current building sector models often fail to adequately capture the impact of socio-behavioral changes on energy demand. This is partly due to the complexity of human behavior and the difficulty in predicting how individuals will respond to interventions (Wilson & Dowlatabadi, 2007).\n\nInfrastructural interventions, such as retrofitting existing buildings and constructing new energy-efficient buildings, are also essential for reducing energy demand. Retrofitting can improve the energy performance of buildings by enhancing insulation, upgrading heating and cooling systems, and installing energy-efficient windows (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2012). New construction can incorporate passive design strategies, such as natural ventilation and daylighting, to minimize energy use (Gou et al., 2013). However, the potential of infrastructural interventions is often underrepresented in building sector models, which tend to focus on technological solutions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2015).\n\nTechnological interventions, including the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy systems, are critical for achieving LED futures. Technologies such as heat pumps, solar panels, and smart meters can significantly reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions (IEA, 2019). However, the integration of these technologies into building sector models is often limited by data availability and the complexity of modeling interactions between different technologies (Pérez-Lombard et al., 2008).\n\nDigitalization, the sharing economy, and the circular economy are three megatrends that have the potential to transform energy demand in buildings. Digitalization can enhance energy efficiency through smart building technologies that optimize energy use in real-time (Zhou et al., 2016). The sharing economy can reduce energy demand by promoting shared use of resources, such as co-working spaces and shared housing (Heinrichs, 2013). The circular economy can minimize waste and resource use by promoting the reuse and recycling of building materials (Pomponi & Moncaster, 2017). However, the impact of these megatrends on energy demand is not well-represented in current building sector models, which often lack the flexibility to incorporate emerging trends (Röck et al., 2020).\n\nDecent living standards are an important consideration in modeling LED futures for buildings. Ensuring that all individuals have access to adequate housing, heating, and cooling is essential for social equity and well-being (Rao & Min, 2018). However, current models often prioritize energy efficiency over social equity, leading to potential trade-offs between reducing energy demand and maintaining decent living standards (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014).\n\nTo better assess LED transformations in buildings and support decision-making toward sustainability targets, several model developments are needed. First, models should incorporate a more comprehensive representation of socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological interventions. This includes integrating behavioral insights, capturing the potential of retrofitting and new construction, and modeling interactions between different technologies. Second, models should be flexible enough to incorporate emerging megatrends, such as digitalization, the sharing economy, and the circular economy. Finally, models should balance energy efficiency with social equity by considering decent living standards in their assessments.\n\nIn conclusion, while building sector models are essential tools for decision support on strategies to reduce energy demand and GHG emissions, they currently have significant limitations in their ability to assess the transformations required for LED futures. By addressing these limitations and incorporating a more comprehensive representation of interventions, megatrends, and decent living standards, models can better support decision-making toward sustainability targets.", "References": [{"title": "Energy use in buildings: A review of change drivers", "authors": "Delzendeh, E., Wu, S., Lee, A., Zhou, Y.", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2017", "volumes": "66", "first page": "178", "last page": "189", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.085"}, {"title": "The effect of tailored information, goal setting, and tailored feedback on household energy use, energy-related behaviors, and behavioral antecedents", "authors": "Abrahamse, W., Steg, L., Vlek, C., Rothengatter, T.", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Psychology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "25", "first page": "273", "last page": "291", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvp.2005.08.002"}, {"title": "Models of decision making and residential energy use", "authors": "Wilson, C., Dowlatabadi, H.", "journal": "Annual Review of Environment and Resources", "year": "2007", "volumes": "32", "first page": "169", "last page": "203", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.energy.32.053006.141137"}, {"title": "Energy end-use: Buildings", "authors": "Ürge-Vorsatz, D., Cabeza, L.
