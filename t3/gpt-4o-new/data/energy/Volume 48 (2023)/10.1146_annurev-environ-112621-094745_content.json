{"Literature Review": "Brine, a highly concentrated solution of salts in water, is a significant natural resource with a wide distribution across the globe, particularly in salt lakes located on the world's major plateaus. The genesis and sustainable recovery of brine resources have garnered increasing attention due to their potential in contributing to clean energy transitions and resource sustainability. Brines are classified into three primary types based on their chemical composition: sulfate-type, chloride-type, and carbonate-type brines. Each type of brine is formed through distinct geological processes, which influence their chemical makeup and potential for resource recovery. \n\nSulfate-type brines are typically found in salt lakes and are characterized by high concentrations of sulfate ions. These brines are formed through the evaporation of saline waters, which leads to the precipitation of sulfate minerals. The presence of sulfate ions in these brines makes them a valuable source of potassium, which is essential for potash production. Potash is a critical agricultural input, and its demand is expected to rise with the increasing global population and food production needs (Garrett, 2004). \n\nChloride-type brines, on the other hand, are formed in deep basins through the reduction and transformation of buried brine. These brines are rich in chloride ions and are often associated with the presence of lithium, a key element in the production of lithium-ion batteries. The extraction of lithium from chloride-type brines has become a focal point in the context of clean energy transitions, as lithium-ion batteries are crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems (Flexer et al., 2018). \n\nCarbonate-type brines are typically associated with magmatic and hydrothermal activities. These brines contain high concentrations of carbonate ions and are often found in geothermal regions. The genesis of carbonate-type brines is linked to the interaction of magmatic fluids with carbonate rocks, leading to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the formation of brine (Munk et al., 2016). \n\nThe sustainable recovery of resources from brine has been a subject of extensive research, with a focus on developing efficient extraction techniques and promoting comprehensive utilization. Recent advancements in lithium extraction technologies have shown promise in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of lithium recovery from brine. Techniques such as solvent extraction, ion exchange, and membrane processes have been explored to improve lithium recovery rates and reduce environmental impacts (Zhang et al., 2020). \n\nIn addition to lithium, the recovery of other valuable elements from brine, such as potassium, magnesium, and boron, has also been a focus of research. The comprehensive development of brine resources involves the integration of multiple extraction processes to maximize the recovery of these elements while minimizing waste generation. This approach aligns with the principles of a circular economy, which emphasizes resource efficiency and waste reduction (Wang et al., 2019). \n\nThe development of a recycling economic model for brine resources has been proposed as a means to enhance the sustainability of brine utilization. This model involves the integration of resource recovery processes with environmental management practices to ensure the efficient use of brine resources while minimizing environmental impacts. The recycling economic model has the potential to contribute to CO2 emission reduction by promoting the use of brine-derived materials in place of more carbon-intensive alternatives (Liu et al., 2021). \n\nThe global distribution of brine resources presents both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. While the abundance of brine resources offers significant potential for resource recovery, the environmental impacts of brine extraction and processing must be carefully managed. The development of sustainable brine utilization practices requires a comprehensive understanding of the geological, chemical, and environmental factors that influence brine formation and resource recovery (Cheng et al., 2019). \n\nIn conclusion, the genesis and sustainable recovery of brine resources are critical to addressing the growing demand for clean energy and resource sustainability. The development of efficient extraction techniques and comprehensive utilization strategies is essential for maximizing the potential of brine resources while minimizing environmental impacts. Future research should focus on advancing extraction technologies, promoting the integration of resource recovery processes, and developing sustainable management practices to ensure the long-term viability of brine resources.", "References": [{"title": "Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium Chloride", "authors": "Donald E.
