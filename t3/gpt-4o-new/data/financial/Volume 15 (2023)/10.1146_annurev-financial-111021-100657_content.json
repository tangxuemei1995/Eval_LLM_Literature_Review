{"Literature Review": "The landscape of initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) has undergone significant transformations in recent years, particularly in the United States. This review examines the recent developments in IPOs and SPACs, focusing on the surge in activity in 2021, the subsequent decline in 2022, and the implications of these trends for private companies, especially unicorns. Additionally, it explores the alternative mechanisms for going public, including traditional IPOs, SPAC mergers, and direct listings, and discusses the prevalence of dual-class share structures among newly public companies. \n\nThe IPO market experienced a remarkable boom in 2021, driven by a combination of factors including favorable market conditions, low interest rates, and a surge in retail investor participation. According to Ritter (2021), the number of IPOs in the U.S. reached levels not seen since the dot-com bubble, with both traditional IPOs and SPACs contributing to this surge. SPACs, in particular, gained popularity as an alternative route to public markets, offering a faster and potentially less costly process compared to traditional IPOs (Gahng et al., 2022). However, this boom was short-lived, as the market experienced a sharp decline in 2022, attributed to increased regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and rising interest rates (Kim et al., 2022).\n\nThe rise of unicorns, private companies valued at $1 billion or more, has been a significant trend in the private equity and venture capital landscape. Many unicorns have opted to go public through IPOs, often employing dual-class share structures to retain control while accessing public capital (Cumming et al., 2021). Dual-class shares allow founders and early investors to maintain voting control, which can be attractive for companies seeking to preserve their strategic vision post-IPO (Bebchuk & Kastiel, 2017). However, this structure has also raised concerns about corporate governance and the potential for entrenchment of management (Gompers et al., 2010).\n\nSPACs have emerged as a popular alternative to traditional IPOs, particularly for unicorns seeking a quicker path to public markets. SPACs are shell companies that raise capital through an IPO with the intention of acquiring a private company, thereby taking it public. This mechanism can offer advantages such as reduced market risk and greater flexibility in deal structuring (Klausner et al., 2021). However, the SPAC market has faced challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and concerns about the alignment of incentives between SPAC sponsors and investors (Ritter, 2021).\n\nDirect listings represent another alternative for companies going public, allowing them to list their shares on a stock exchange without raising new capital through an IPO. This method can be advantageous for companies with strong brand recognition and sufficient liquidity, as it avoids the traditional underwriting process and associated fees (Slack et al., 2020). However, direct listings may not be suitable for all companies, particularly those seeking to raise capital or lacking a well-established market presence (Kim & Ritter, 1999).\n\nDespite the rise of SPACs and direct listings, traditional IPOs remain the most common exit strategy for venture capital-backed companies. This preference is partly due to the established nature of the IPO process and the ability to raise significant capital while gaining public market exposure (Gompers & Lerner, 2001). However, the choice of exit strategy is influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company characteristics, and investor preferences (Bayar & Chemmanur, 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, the recent developments in IPOs and SPACs reflect a dynamic and evolving market environment. The surge in IPO activity in 2021, followed by a decline in 2022, highlights the impact of external factors such as regulatory changes and market volatility. Unicorns continue to play a significant role in the IPO landscape, often opting for dual-class share structures to balance control and capital access. While SPACs and direct listings offer alternative paths to public markets, traditional IPOs remain a dominant exit strategy for venture capital-backed companies. As the market continues to evolve, understanding the implications of these trends is crucial for investors, regulators, and companies considering going public.", "References": [{"title": "Initial Public Offerings: Updated Statistics", "authors": "Jay R.
