{"Literature Review": "The selection of an appropriate social discount rate (SDR) is a critical component in the evaluation of public projects and policies, particularly those with long-term impacts such as climate change mitigation. The SDR is used to convert future costs and benefits into present values, thereby influencing the perceived desirability of projects. The literature on SDR is extensive, encompassing theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical dimensions. This review synthesizes key insights from the literature, focusing on the principles-based approach to SDR selection, the implications of risk-adjusted rates, and the discrepancies between government practices and financial economics principles. \n\nThe theoretical foundation of SDR is rooted in the Ramsey formula, which posits that the discount rate should reflect the rate of time preference, the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, and the expected growth rate of consumption (Ramsey, 1928). This framework suggests that the SDR should be lower for projects with long-term benefits, such as those addressing climate change, due to the ethical consideration of intergenerational equity (Arrow et al., 2013). However, the application of the Ramsey formula is complicated by uncertainties in estimating its parameters, particularly the growth rate of consumption and the rate of time preference (Weitzman, 2001). \n\nRisk-adjusted discount rates are advocated to account for the uncertainty and risk associated with long-term projects. The literature suggests that projects with higher risk should be discounted at higher rates to reflect the risk premium (Gollier, 2012). However, this approach is not without controversy, as it may lead to the undervaluation of projects with significant long-term benefits, such as climate change mitigation (Stern, 2007). The challenge lies in balancing the need for a risk premium with the ethical considerations of intergenerational equity. \n\nThe practical application of SDRs by governments often deviates from the principles of financial economics. Governments tend to use a single discount rate for all projects, regardless of their risk profile, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions (Hepburn, 2006). Moreover, there is a tendency to select artificially low discount rates to justify public investments, which can distort resource allocation and lead to inefficiencies (Nordhaus, 2007). The literature calls for a more nuanced approach that considers the specific characteristics of each project, including its risk profile and time horizon. \n\nLegal and philosophical considerations also play a role in SDR selection. The legal framework within which governments operate can constrain their ability to adopt flexible discount rates. For instance, statutory requirements may mandate the use of specific discount rates, limiting the ability to tailor rates to individual projects (Sunstein, 2014). Philosophically, the choice of SDR is influenced by ethical considerations, particularly the weight given to future generations. The debate over intergenerational equity is central to the discussion of SDR, with some arguing for lower rates to reflect the moral obligation to future generations (Dasgupta, 2008). \n\nIn summary, the literature on SDR highlights the complexity of selecting an appropriate rate for public project evaluation. A principles-based approach that incorporates risk-adjusted rates and considers intergenerational equity is advocated. However, practical, legal, and philosophical challenges remain, leading to a disconnect between theory and practice. The need for a more nuanced and flexible approach to SDR selection is evident, particularly in the context of long-term projects such as climate change mitigation. This review underscores the importance of aligning government practices with the principles of financial economics to enhance social welfare and ensure the efficient allocation of resources.", "References": [{"title": "A Note on the Pure Theory of Consumer's Behaviour", "authors": "Frank P.
