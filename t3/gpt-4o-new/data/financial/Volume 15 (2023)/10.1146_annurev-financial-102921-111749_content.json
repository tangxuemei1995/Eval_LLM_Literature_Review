{"Literature Review": "The practice of using a single discount rate for evaluating public investments and policies has been a subject of debate among economists and policymakers. This approach, prevalent in most Western countries, often overlooks the differential cost of risk, leading to potential misallocations of capital and significant welfare costs. The asset pricing literature provides a compelling argument for risk-adjusting discount rates, which could lead to more efficient and equitable allocation of resources. \n\nThe traditional approach to discounting in public policy is rooted in the concept of time preference, which reflects the idea that people prefer to receive benefits sooner rather than later. This is typically represented by a single discount rate, which is applied uniformly across different projects and policies. However, this method fails to account for the varying levels of risk associated with different projects, which can lead to suboptimal investment decisions (Weitzman, 2001). \n\nThe asset pricing literature offers a normative framework for addressing this issue by advocating for the use of project-specific discount rates that are adjusted for risk. This approach is grounded in the concept of the 'price of risk,' which refers to the additional return that investors require to compensate for the risk of an investment. In most risk markets, the price of risk is surprisingly large, indicating that the current discounting guidelines may not adequately reflect the true cost of risk (Campbell & Cochrane, 1999). \n\nOne of the key insights from the asset pricing literature is the importance of income elasticity in determining the appropriate discount rate for a given project. Income elasticity measures the responsiveness of the net benefit of a project to changes in income. Projects with high income elasticity are those whose benefits are more valuable in low-income states, providing an insurance benefit that should be recognized ex ante (Gollier, 2012). By using a higher discount rate for projects with low income elasticity, policymakers can prioritize investments that provide greater welfare benefits in adverse economic conditions. \n\nThe concept of risk-adjusted discount rates is not new, but its application in public policy has been limited. One reason for this is the complexity of estimating income elasticity and other parameters required for risk adjustment. However, recent advances in econometric techniques and data availability have made it more feasible to incorporate these factors into cost-benefit analysis (Arrow et al., 2014). \n\nMoreover, the welfare benefits of adopting risk-adjusted discount rates are substantial. By aligning discount rates with the true cost of risk, policymakers can improve the allocation of resources, leading to higher overall welfare. This is particularly important in the context of climate change and other long-term challenges, where the benefits of investments may not be realized for many years (Stern, 2007). \n\nIn addition to improving resource allocation, risk-adjusted discount rates can also enhance the equity of public investments. By favoring projects that provide greater benefits in low-income states, this approach can help to reduce income inequality and promote social welfare. This is consistent with the broader goal of public policy to promote equity and social justice (Dasgupta, 2008). \n\nIn conclusion, the current practice of using a single discount rate for public investments and policies is inadequate in a world where risk markets exhibit large prices of risk. The asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification for risk-adjusting discount rates, which can lead to more efficient and equitable allocation of resources. By incorporating income elasticity and other risk factors into cost-benefit analysis, policymakers can improve the welfare benefits of public investments and address long-term challenges such as climate change. It is time to reform our public discounting systems to reflect the true cost of risk and promote social welfare.", "References": [{"title": "Gamma Discounting", "authors": "Martin L.
