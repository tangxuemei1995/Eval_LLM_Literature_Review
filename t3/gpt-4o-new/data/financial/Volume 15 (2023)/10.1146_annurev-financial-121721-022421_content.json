{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is pivotal in evaluating the long-term impacts of government policies, particularly in the context of intertemporal and intergenerational considerations. The SDR is used to convert future costs and benefits into present values, thereby influencing policy decisions that have deferred impacts. The legal and philosophical underpinnings of the SDR have been the subject of extensive debate and litigation, reflecting its complexity and significance in public policy. \n\nLegally, the practice of discounting future impacts at a nonzero rate has gained general acceptance, as evidenced by numerous court rulings that emphasize the need for transparent and scientifically justified discount rates. Courts have often required that the selection of the discount rate be based on established scientific principles, ensuring that the rate reflects a balance between present and future interests (Arrow et al., 2013). This legal framework underscores the importance of a methodical approach to discounting, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of benefit-cost analyses (Weitzman, 2001).\n\nPhilosophically, the debate surrounding the SDR is more nuanced, encompassing a range of issues such as whether nonmonetary impacts should be discounted and the appropriate basis for determining the discount rate. The opportunity cost of capital and the social rate of time preference are two primary approaches to setting the SDR, each with its own implications for policy evaluation (Freeman & Groom, 2016). The opportunity cost of capital approach suggests that the SDR should reflect the return on investment that could be earned if resources were allocated elsewhere, while the social rate of time preference approach considers the rate at which society is willing to trade off present for future consumption (Gollier, 2012).\n\nThe time frame for setting the discount rate is another critical consideration, particularly in the context of intergenerational equity. Intergenerational issues pose significant challenges, as they raise questions about which generation's preferences should be prioritized and how to address potential dynamic inconsistencies that may arise from preferential discount rates (Stern, 2007). The ethical implications of discounting future generations' welfare are profound, as they touch upon the moral responsibility of current generations to future ones (Dasgupta, 2008).\n\nBenefit-cost analyses that incorporate the SDR play a crucial role in recognizing the long-term effects of policies on social welfare. These analyses provide a structured framework for evaluating the trade-offs between present and future benefits and costs, thereby facilitating informed decision-making (Arrow et al., 2014). However, the challenge lies in ensuring that these analyses adequately capture the full spectrum of impacts, including nonmonetary and intergenerational effects (Nordhaus, 2007).\n\nThe determination of whose preferences should have standing in setting the SDR is another contentious issue. This involves considering the diverse values and priorities of different stakeholders, including future generations, and balancing these against the immediate needs and preferences of the current population (Heal, 2005). The potential for intertemporal inequities further complicates this process, as it requires a careful assessment of how different discount rates may disproportionately affect various groups over time (Weitzman, 1998).\n\nIn conclusion, the legal and philosophical underpinnings of the social discount rate are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the intricate interplay between economic, ethical, and legal considerations. The ongoing debate highlights the need for a nuanced approach to discounting that takes into account both the scientific principles underlying the selection of the discount rate and the broader ethical implications of intertemporal and intergenerational equity. As such, the SDR remains a critical tool in the evaluation of government policies, providing a mechanism for recognizing and addressing the long-term impacts on social welfare.", "References": [{"title": "Intertemporal Equity, Discounting, and Economic Efficiency", "authors": "Kenneth J.
