{"Literature Review": "Smart contracts have emerged as a pivotal innovation in the realm of blockchain technology, offering a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The concept of smart contracts was first introduced by Nick Szabo in 1994, who envisioned them as a way to formalize and secure relationships over computer networks (Szabo, 1997). The advent of blockchain technology, particularly Ethereum, has provided the infrastructure necessary for the widespread implementation of smart contracts, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to flourish. \n\nSmart contracts are lauded for their ability to overcome commitment problems by ensuring that contractual obligations are automatically enforced without the need for a trusted intermediary (Buterin, 2014). This feature is particularly beneficial in financial transactions, where trust is paramount. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, smart contracts reduce transaction costs and increase efficiency (Catalini & Gans, 2016). However, the reliance on blockchain technology also introduces certain limitations. One significant challenge is the difficulty of accessing information external to the blockchain, often referred to as the 'oracle problem' (Zhang et al., 2020). Oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external data, but they introduce potential points of failure and trust issues, which can undermine the decentralized nature of the system.\n\nAnother limitation of smart contracts is their integration with traditional legal systems. While smart contracts can automate the execution of contractual terms, they cannot interpret legal nuances or resolve disputes in the same way a human arbitrator or court might (Werbach & Cornell, 2017). This limitation poses challenges for the enforceability of smart contracts in jurisdictions where legal recognition is required. Furthermore, the absence of a trusted intermediary in blockchain applications can inflate implementation costs, as users must rely on complex cryptographic protocols to ensure security and trust (Cong & He, 2019).\n\nDespite these challenges, smart contracts have found significant applications in decentralized finance. One of the most prominent applications is token issuance, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). ICOs allow companies to raise capital by issuing tokens on a blockchain, which can be traded or used within a specific ecosystem (Adhami et al., 2018). NFTs, on the other hand, represent unique digital assets and have gained popularity in the art and gaming industries (Dowling, 2021).\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) are another critical application of smart contracts in DeFi. Unlike traditional exchanges, DEXs operate without a central authority, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another. This peer-to-peer trading model is facilitated by smart contracts, which automate the matching and execution of trades (Zhang et al., 2021). DEXs offer increased privacy and security compared to centralized exchanges, but they also face challenges such as liquidity issues and susceptibility to front-running attacks (Daian et al., 2020).\n\nProtocols for loanable funds, such as lending and borrowing platforms, are also powered by smart contracts. These platforms allow users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies without the need for a traditional financial institution. Smart contracts automate the process of collateral management and interest calculation, ensuring that loans are secure and transparent (Schär, 2021). However, the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities pose significant risks to these platforms (Kumar et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, smart contracts have revolutionized the financial industry by enabling decentralized finance applications that operate without intermediaries. While they offer numerous benefits, such as increased efficiency and reduced costs, they also face challenges related to external data access, legal integration, and security. As the technology continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial for the sustainable growth of DeFi and the broader adoption of smart contracts.", "References": [{"title": "Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks", "authors": "Nick Szabo", "journal": "First Monday", "year": "1997", "volumes": "2", "first page": "9", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.5210/fm.v2i9.548"}, {"title": "Ethereum: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform", "authors": "Vitalik Buterin", "journal": "Ethereum White Paper", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain", "authors": "Christian Catalini, Joshua S.
