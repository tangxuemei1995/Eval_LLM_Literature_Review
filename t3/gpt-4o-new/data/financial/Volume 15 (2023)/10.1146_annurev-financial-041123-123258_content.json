{"Literature Review": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a critical component in the evaluation of public projects, particularly those with long-term impacts such as infrastructure development and climate change mitigation. The principles of financial economics offer valuable insights into the optimal choice of discount rates, yet these principles are often overlooked by governments, which typically use their borrowing rate as the cost of capital. This literature review explores the arguments for and against current discounting practices, the methodologies available for risk adjustment, and the limitations of financial economics in addressing long-term policy decisions. \n\nThe traditional approach to discounting in public sector decision-making is to use the government's borrowing rate as the discount rate. This practice is based on the assumption that the borrowing rate reflects the opportunity cost of capital for the government. However, this approach has been criticized for failing to account for the risk and uncertainty associated with public investments (Arrow et al., 2013). Financial economics suggests that the discount rate should reflect the risk-adjusted cost of capital, which would typically be higher than the borrowing rate due to the inclusion of a risk premium (Weitzman, 2001). \n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of using the borrowing rate is its simplicity and ease of application. It provides a clear and consistent benchmark for evaluating public projects. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of potentially underestimating the true cost of capital, leading to suboptimal investment decisions (Gollier, 2012). The use of a risk-adjusted discount rate, on the other hand, would better align the evaluation of public projects with the principles of financial economics, potentially leading to more efficient allocation of resources (Hepburn, 2007). \n\nSeveral methodologies have been proposed for risk adjustment in the context of public sector discounting. One such approach is the use of a 'fair value' discount rate, which incorporates market-based risk adjustments into the discount rate (Lucas and Moore, 2010). This approach is consistent with the principles of fair value accounting, which aim to provide a more accurate reflection of the economic value of assets and liabilities (Brealey et al., 2011). The fair value approach has been advocated as a means of improving the accuracy and transparency of public sector accounting, thereby enhancing the quality of decision-making (Moore et al., 2013). \n\nDespite the advantages of a fair value approach, there are significant challenges associated with its implementation. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in estimating the appropriate risk premium for public sector projects, which often have unique risk profiles that are not easily comparable to private sector investments (Gollier, 2012). Additionally, the use of market-based risk adjustments may not be appropriate for projects with significant social or environmental impacts, where market prices may not fully capture the societal value of the project (Arrow et al., 2013). \n\nThe limitations of financial economics become particularly apparent in the context of long-term policy decisions, such as those related to climate change. For these types of decisions, the uncertainty surrounding future cash flows and discount rates is significantly higher, making present value calculations an unreliable measure of value (Weitzman, 2001). Furthermore, intergenerational concerns become paramount, as the impacts of these policies will be felt by future generations who are not represented in current decision-making processes (Hepburn, 2007). \n\nIn light of these challenges, alternative decision criteria have been proposed for evaluating long-term public projects. One such approach is the use of a declining discount rate, which reflects the increasing uncertainty and intergenerational equity considerations associated with long-term projects (Gollier, 2012). Another approach is the use of cost-benefit analysis that incorporates non-market values and distributional impacts, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the project's societal value (Arrow et al., 2013). \n\nIn conclusion, while the principles of financial economics provide valuable insights into the optimal choice of discount rates, they are not sufficient to address the complexities of long-term public policy decisions. Governments must consider a range of factors, including risk adjustment, intergenerational equity, and non-market values, in their evaluation of public projects. The adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment, such as the fair value approach, could significantly improve social welfare by aligning public sector decision-making with the principles of financial economics. However, for decisions involving very long time horizons, alternative decision criteria may be necessary to ensure that the societal value of public projects is accurately assessed.", "References": [{"title": "Intertemporal Equity, Discounting, and Economic Efficiency", "authors": "Kenneth J.
