{"Literature Review": "The issue of unfunded public pension obligations has been a persistent challenge for state and local governments in the United States. These obligations represent a significant financial liability, with the total reported unfunded liabilities reaching $1.076 trillion as of fiscal year 2021. However, when assessed using market-based valuations, the unfunded liability is estimated to be approximately $6.501 trillion, highlighting a stark contrast between reported figures and market realities (Novy-Marx & Rauh, 2011). This discrepancy is largely due to the use of assumed discount rates based on expected returns, which remain elevated compared to risk-free rates, despite a general decline since 2014 (Brown & Wilcox, 2009). The use of these optimistic discount rates results in an understatement of both the unfunded pension liability and the annual pension cost for newly accruing liabilities (Biggs, 2012).\n\nThe funding ratio, which is a measure of a pension plan's assets relative to its liabilities, is reported at 82.5% but falls to 43.8% under a market-based valuation. This significant drop underscores the precarious financial position of many public pension plans and the potential risks they pose to state and local government finances (Munnell et al., 2010). The market values reflect the reality that accrued pension promises are akin to government debt, carrying strong statutory and contractual rights (Novy-Marx & Rauh, 2011).\n\nTo address the funding shortfalls, many pension funds have increasingly turned to riskier investment strategies, particularly in alternative investments such as private equity, hedge funds, and real estate (Andonov et al., 2017). While these investments offer the potential for higher returns, they also introduce greater volatility and uncertainty into pension fund portfolios (Ang et al., 2014). The shift towards riskier assets is driven by the need to achieve high returns to meet assumed discount rates, but it also exposes pension funds to significant market risks (Rauh, 2009).\n\nThe reliance on high-risk investment strategies has raised concerns about the sustainability of public pension systems. The volatility associated with alternative investments can lead to substantial fluctuations in pension fund performance, potentially exacerbating funding shortfalls during economic downturns (Bauer et al., 2010). Moreover, the complexity and opacity of alternative investments can make it difficult for pension fund managers and stakeholders to fully understand and manage the associated risks (Andonov et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition to investment strategies, demographic factors also play a critical role in the financial health of public pension systems. An aging population and increasing life expectancy have led to higher pension liabilities, as retirees draw benefits for longer periods (Munnell et al., 2010). This demographic shift places additional pressure on pension funds, necessitating higher contributions from employers and employees to maintain solvency (Biggs, 2012).\n\nPolicy responses to the challenges facing public pension systems have varied across states and localities. Some governments have implemented reforms aimed at reducing pension liabilities, such as increasing employee contributions, raising retirement ages, and modifying benefit formulas (Brown & Wilcox, 2009). However, these measures often face legal and political hurdles, as pension benefits are typically protected by state constitutions and collective bargaining agreements (Rauh, 2009).\n\nThe debate over the appropriate discount rate for valuing pension liabilities remains contentious. Proponents of using expected returns argue that it reflects the long-term investment horizon of pension funds, while critics advocate for a risk-free rate to provide a more accurate measure of the true cost of pension promises (Novy-Marx & Rauh, 2011). The choice of discount rate has significant implications for the reported funding status of pension plans and the perceived urgency of reform efforts (Ang et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in state and local pension funds highlight the complex interplay between investment strategies, demographic factors, and policy decisions. The reliance on optimistic discount rates and high-risk investments has contributed to the understatement of unfunded pension liabilities, posing significant challenges for the sustainability of public pension systems. Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach, including prudent investment management, demographic adjustments, and policy reforms to ensure the long-term viability of public pension plans.", "References": [{"title": "Public Pension Promises: How Big Are They and What Are They Worth?", "authors": "Robert Novy-Marx, Joshua D.
