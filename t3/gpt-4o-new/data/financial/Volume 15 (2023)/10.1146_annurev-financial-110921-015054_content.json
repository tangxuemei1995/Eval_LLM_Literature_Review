{"Literature Review": "The cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in June 2023 marked a significant shift in the landscape of global financial benchmarks. LIBOR had been a cornerstone of the financial system for over four decades, serving as a reference rate for an estimated $200 trillion in financial contracts (Duffie & Stein, 2015). However, its downfall was precipitated by a combination of low interbank loan volumes, manipulation scandals, and the absence of fallback rates in many LIBOR-dependent instruments (Hou & Skeie, 2014). This literature review explores the rise and fall of LIBOR, the transition to risk-free rate benchmarks like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and the ongoing debate over the merits of single versus multi-benchmark regimes.\n\nThe LIBOR scandal, which came to light in 2012, revealed that several banks had manipulated the rate to benefit their trading positions (Wheatley, 2012). This manipulation was possible due to the subjective nature of LIBOR submissions, which were based on estimates rather than actual transaction data (Abrantes-Metz et al., 2012). The scandal underscored the need for more transparent and reliable benchmarks, prompting regulators to seek alternatives (Duffie & Stein, 2015).\n\nIn response to these challenges, regulators and market participants have shifted towards risk-free rate benchmarks, which are based on actual transaction data and are less susceptible to manipulation (Schrimpf & Sushko, 2019). In the United States, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been adopted as the primary replacement for LIBOR. SOFR is based on overnight repurchase agreement (repo) transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, providing a robust and transparent benchmark (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2018).\n\nThe transition to SOFR and other risk-free rates has been met with both support and criticism. Proponents argue that these rates are more stable and less prone to manipulation, as they are grounded in actual market transactions (Schrimpf & Sushko, 2019). However, critics point out that risk-free rates do not incorporate credit risk, which can be a significant component of interest rates in financial markets (Duffie & Stein, 2015). This has led to calls for the development of credit-sensitive benchmarks that better reflect the cost of borrowing for financial institutions (Hou & Skeie, 2014).\n\nThe debate over risk-free versus credit-sensitive benchmarks is further complicated by the potential for a single-benchmark regime to stifle competition and innovation in the financial markets (Duffie & Stein, 2015). Some scholars argue that a multi-benchmark approach, which includes both risk-free and credit-sensitive rates, could provide greater flexibility and resilience in the financial system (Hou & Skeie, 2014). For instance, Ameribor and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) have been proposed as potential credit-sensitive alternatives to SOFR (Schrimpf & Sushko, 2019).\n\nThe transition from LIBOR to SOFR and other benchmarks has also raised questions about the impact on interest rate derivatives markets. Derivatives contracts often rely on term rates, which are not yet widely available for risk-free benchmarks like SOFR (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2018). This has led to concerns about the liquidity and pricing of derivatives in the post-LIBOR era (Duffie & Stein, 2015).\n\nDespite these challenges, the shift towards risk-free rate benchmarks is seen as a necessary step to enhance the integrity and stability of the financial system. However, the transition is still in its early stages, and further research is needed to assess the long-term implications of a single-benchmark regime versus a multi-benchmark approach (Schrimpf & Sushko, 2019). Future studies could explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating credit-sensitive rates alongside risk-free benchmarks, as well as the impact on financial stability and market efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the post-LIBOR era presents both opportunities and challenges for the global financial system. While the adoption of risk-free rate benchmarks like SOFR addresses some of the shortcomings of LIBOR, it also raises new questions about the role of credit risk in interest rate benchmarks and the potential for a multi-benchmark regime. As the transition continues, ongoing research and dialogue will be crucial to ensuring that the new benchmark landscape meets the needs of market participants and supports the stability of the financial system.", "References": [{"title": "Reforming LIBOR and Other Financial Market Benchmarks", "authors": "Darrell Duffie, Jeremy C.
