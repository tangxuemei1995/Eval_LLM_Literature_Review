{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is pivotal in evaluating long-term public projects and policies, particularly those with intergenerational impacts. The SDR is used to convert future costs and benefits into present values, thereby influencing decisions on investments in infrastructure, environmental conservation, and social programs. The determination of an appropriate SDR is complex, involving considerations of market interest rates, borrowing constraints, intergenerational equity, altruism, and legacy motivations. This literature review explores these dimensions, drawing on existing research to elucidate the factors influencing the SDR and the implications of missing market participants. \n\nMarket interest rates are typically used as a proxy for the SDR, reflecting the time preferences of current market participants. However, this approach assumes that all relevant agents are represented in the market, which is often not the case. Constrained borrowers, for instance, are unable to participate fully in the market due to credit limitations, leading to an average discount rate that is higher than the market rate (Gollier, 2012). This discrepancy arises because constrained borrowers would prefer to borrow at lower rates if they had access, thus indicating a lower personal discount rate than what is observed in the market. \n\nConversely, future generations are inherently absent from current markets, which can result in an average discount rate that is lower than the market rate. This is because future generations would likely value long-term benefits more highly than current market participants, who may prioritize immediate returns (Arrow et al., 2013). The absence of future generations in market transactions suggests that the market interest rate may not fully capture the social value of long-term investments, particularly those related to environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation. \n\nThe government, with its ability to redistribute wealth across different agents and time periods, faces the challenge of selecting an appropriate SDR that balances these competing interests. One argument for using a lower SDR is based on intrapersonal considerations: individuals tend to discount future benefits more heavily than past benefits, a phenomenon known as hyperbolic discounting (Laibson, 1997). This suggests that a lower SDR could better align with the long-term welfare of society by giving greater weight to future benefits. \n\nAltruism and the desire for legacy also play significant roles in shaping the SDR. Altruistic behavior, where individuals derive utility from the well-being of others, particularly future generations, supports the use of a lower SDR (Becker, 1974). This is because altruistic individuals are more likely to value future benefits, even if they do not directly experience them. Similarly, the desire for legacy, or the motivation to leave a positive impact for future generations, can justify a lower SDR. Individuals who are concerned about their legacy may support policies that prioritize long-term benefits, even at the expense of short-term gains (Phelps, 1997). \n\nThe literature also highlights the importance of considering incomplete markets when determining the SDR. Incomplete markets, where not all risks can be traded or insured against, can lead to inefficiencies in resource allocation and affect the observed market interest rates (Arrow & Lind, 1970). In such cases, the market rate may not accurately reflect the true social opportunity cost of capital, necessitating adjustments to the SDR to account for these market imperfections. \n\nFurthermore, the role of intergenerational transfers in shaping the SDR cannot be overlooked. Intergenerational transfers, whether through bequests, social security systems, or public investments, influence the distribution of resources across generations and can affect the perceived fairness of the SDR (Kotlikoff & Summers, 1981). Policies that facilitate intergenerational transfers can help align the SDR with societal preferences for equity and sustainability. \n\nIn conclusion, the determination of the SDR is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of market dynamics, borrowing constraints, intergenerational equity, altruism, and legacy motivations. While market interest rates provide a useful starting point, they may not fully capture the social value of long-term investments, particularly in the presence of missing market participants. A lower SDR, informed by intrapersonal considerations and altruistic motivations, may better reflect the societal preference for sustainable and equitable development. Policymakers must therefore weigh these factors carefully to ensure that the SDR aligns with the long-term welfare of society.", "References": [{"title": "Pricing the Planet's Future: The Economics of Discounting in an Uncertain World", "authors": "Christian Gollier", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "How Should Benefits and Costs Be Discounted in an Intergenerational Context?
