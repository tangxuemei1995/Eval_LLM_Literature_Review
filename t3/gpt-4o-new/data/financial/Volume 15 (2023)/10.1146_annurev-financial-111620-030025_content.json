{"Literature Review": "The study of sovereign debt has long been a critical area of economic research, given its implications for global financial stability and economic development. The canonical model of sovereign debt, which typically involves a government borrowing from international markets and repaying based on its future income, has been instrumental in understanding the dynamics of sovereign borrowing and default. However, this model often fails to align with empirical observations, leading to a series of puzzles that challenge existing theoretical frameworks. This literature review aims to explore these puzzles, categorizing them into three main areas: the issuance of sovereign debt, the pricing of sovereign debt, and the processes surrounding sovereign default and resolution. \n\nThe first category of puzzles pertains to how sovereigns issue debt. Traditional models suggest that sovereigns should issue debt in a manner that minimizes costs and maximizes flexibility. However, empirical evidence indicates that many countries issue debt in ways that appear suboptimal. For instance, sovereigns often issue debt in foreign currencies despite the associated exchange rate risks (Eichengreen, Hausmann, & Panizza, 2005). This phenomenon, known as 'original sin,' suggests that some countries are unable to borrow in their own currency, which contradicts the predictions of the canonical model. Additionally, sovereigns frequently issue short-term debt even when long-term debt would be more beneficial in terms of reducing rollover risk (Broner, Lorenzoni, & Schmukler, 2013). These practices raise questions about the factors influencing sovereign debt issuance decisions, such as market access, investor preferences, and institutional constraints.\n\nThe second category involves puzzles related to the pricing of sovereign debt. The canonical model posits that sovereign debt should be priced based on the risk of default and the expected recovery rate. However, sovereign debt yields often do not reflect these fundamentals. For example, during periods of financial distress, sovereign spreads can widen significantly, even for countries with relatively stable economic fundamentals (Longstaff, Pan, Pedersen, & Singleton, 2011). This suggests that factors such as market sentiment, liquidity, and global risk aversion play a more significant role in sovereign debt pricing than previously thought. Furthermore, the presence of 'debt intolerance,' where countries with similar debt levels face vastly different borrowing costs, indicates that historical and institutional factors may also influence pricing (Reinhart, Rogoff, & Savastano, 2003).\n\nThe third category of puzzles concerns sovereign default and the resolution of defaults. The canonical model assumes that sovereigns default when they are unable to meet their debt obligations, and that the resolution process involves negotiations with creditors to restructure the debt. However, the reality is often more complex. Sovereigns sometimes choose to default even when they have the capacity to pay, possibly due to political considerations or strategic motives (Tomz & Wright, 2007). Additionally, the process of resolving defaults is often protracted and contentious, with outcomes that vary widely across cases. The role of international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, and the legal frameworks governing sovereign debt restructuring, such as collective action clauses, are critical factors that influence the resolution process (Guzman & Stiglitz, 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, the sovereign debt literature reveals a multitude of puzzles that challenge the assumptions of the canonical model. These puzzles highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks that incorporate a broader range of factors, including political economy considerations, market imperfections, and institutional constraints. Future research should focus on developing models that better capture the complexities of sovereign debt markets and provide insights into the mechanisms driving sovereign borrowing, pricing, and default. By addressing these puzzles, researchers can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of sovereign debt dynamics and inform policy decisions aimed at enhancing financial stability and economic resilience.", "References": [{"title": "Original Sin: The Pain, the Mystery, and the Road to Redemption", "authors": "Barry Eichengreen, Ricardo Hausmann, Ugo Panizza", "journal": "International Finance", "year": "2005", "volumes": "8", "first page": "169", "last page": "189", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-2362.2005.00158.x"}, {"title": "Why Do Emerging Economies Borrow Short Term?", "authors": "Fernando Broner, Guido Lorenzoni, Sergio L.
