{"Literature Review": "The rapid growth of corporate debt in China has been a subject of significant academic and policy interest, particularly in the context of default and bankruptcy resolution. The literature on this topic has expanded considerably, reflecting the complexities and challenges associated with China's evolving financial landscape. The increase in corporate debt in China has been driven by several factors, including the expansion of shadow banking, the liberalization of bond markets, and the strategic use of debt by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to finance growth (Allen et al., 2019). This growth has led to a rise in nonperforming loans (NPLs) and defaults, necessitating a robust framework for bankruptcy resolution.\n\nThe composition of corporate debt in China has shifted over the years, with a notable increase in bond issuance and shadow banking activities. Shadow banking, which includes trust loans, entrusted loans, and wealth management products, has played a significant role in providing credit to firms that may not have access to traditional bank loans (Elliott et al., 2015). This has led to a more complex debt structure, complicating the resolution of defaults and bankruptcies. The rise in NPLs has been a particular concern, as it reflects the underlying financial distress in the corporate sector (Huang et al., 2016).\n\nChina's legal and political institutions play a crucial role in the restructuring and liquidation of financially distressed firms. The country's bankruptcy law, which was significantly reformed in 2007, provides the legal framework for resolving corporate insolvency. These reforms aimed to create a more market-oriented approach to bankruptcy, aligning with international standards (Lubman, 2016). However, the implementation of these laws has faced several challenges, including inconsistencies in judicial enforcement and the influence of local governments in bankruptcy proceedings (Li et al., 2018).\n\nJudicial enforcement remains a significant friction in the implementation of bankruptcy reforms in China. The courts often lack the independence and expertise required to handle complex bankruptcy cases effectively. This has led to delays and inconsistencies in the resolution process, undermining the effectiveness of the legal framework (Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, local governments frequently intervene in bankruptcy cases, prioritizing social stability and employment over the efficient resolution of financial distress. This intervention can distort the bankruptcy process, leading to suboptimal outcomes for creditors and debtors alike (Zhang et al., 2020).\n\nRecent reforms have sought to address these challenges by enhancing the capacity and independence of the judiciary and promoting the use of professional insolvency practitioners. The establishment of specialized bankruptcy courts and the introduction of guidelines for the appointment of insolvency practitioners are steps in the right direction (Chen et al., 2021). However, further efforts are needed to ensure consistent application of the law across different regions and to reduce the influence of local governments in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe literature also highlights the role of bond markets in the context of default and bankruptcy resolution. The liberalization of bond markets in China has provided firms with an alternative source of financing, but it has also introduced new risks. The default of corporate bonds has become more common, raising concerns about the adequacy of the existing legal framework to handle such defaults (Gao et al., 2017). The development of a robust bond market is crucial for the efficient allocation of capital and the resolution of financial distress, but it requires a supportive legal and regulatory environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in reforming China's bankruptcy law, several challenges remain. The effective implementation of these reforms is crucial for addressing the rising levels of corporate debt and ensuring the stability of the financial system. Future research could explore the impact of these reforms on the behavior of firms and creditors, the role of local governments in bankruptcy proceedings, and the development of alternative mechanisms for resolving financial distress. Additionally, comparative studies with other jurisdictions could provide valuable insights into best practices and potential areas for improvement in China's bankruptcy framework.", "References": [{"title": "The Evolution of Corporate Debt in China: Causes, Consequences, and Policy Implications", "authors": "Franklin Allen, Jun Qian, Meijun Qian", "journal": "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "year": "2019", "volumes": "33", "first page": "29", "last page": "52", "DOI": "10.1257/jep.33.4.29"}, {"title": "Shadow Banking in China: A Primer", "authors": "Douglas J.
