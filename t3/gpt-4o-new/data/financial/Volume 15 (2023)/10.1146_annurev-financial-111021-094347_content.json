{"Literature Review": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a pivotal area of interest for both scholars and practitioners, particularly in understanding the motivations behind shareholder interest in CSR activities. The debate centers on whether these interests are driven by pecuniary motives, such as abnormal rates of return, or nonpecuniary motives, such as a willingness to sacrifice returns to address firm externalities. This literature review synthesizes findings from various studies that have employed different methodologies to explore this question. \n\nOne of the primary areas of investigation is the cost of capital associated with CSR activities. Studies have shown that firms with strong CSR practices often enjoy a lower cost of capital. For instance, El Ghoul et al. (2011) found that firms with better CSR scores have lower equity costs, suggesting that investors are willing to accept lower returns for investments in socially responsible firms. This finding supports the notion that nonpecuniary motives play a significant role in shareholder interest in CSR. \n\nAnother approach to understanding shareholder motives is through the performance of portfolios that include CSR-focused firms. Derwall et al. (2005) demonstrated that portfolios of high CSR firms can outperform those of low CSR firms, indicating that CSR can be aligned with financial performance. However, the outperformance is not always consistent, and some studies suggest that the returns are not significantly different from conventional portfolios, implying that nonpecuniary motives might still be at play. \n\nOwnership by types of institutions also provides insights into shareholder motives. Institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds, have increasingly incorporated CSR criteria into their investment decisions. According to a study by Cox et al. (2004), socially responsible investment funds have grown significantly, driven by both ethical considerations and the belief that CSR can mitigate risks and enhance long-term returns. This dual motivation suggests a blend of pecuniary and nonpecuniary motives. \n\nSurveys and experiments have been used to directly assess shareholder preferences. For example, a survey by McLachlan and Gardner (2004) found that a significant proportion of investors are willing to accept lower financial returns in exchange for investments that align with their social and environmental values. Experimental studies, such as those by Bauer and Smeets (2015), have corroborated these findings, showing that investors often prioritize ethical considerations over financial returns. \n\nManagerial motives for engaging in CSR activities also shed light on shareholder interests. Managers may pursue CSR initiatives to align with shareholder values or to enhance the firm's reputation and long-term sustainability. A study by Bénabou and Tirole (2010) suggests that managers often act as agents of change, driven by both personal values and the perceived expectations of shareholders. This indicates that nonpecuniary motives are influential in shaping corporate strategies. \n\nShareholder proposals related to CSR provide another lens through which to examine shareholder motives. Proposals that focus on environmental and social issues have increased in recent years, reflecting growing shareholder activism. According to a study by Flammer (2015), such proposals are often supported by a significant portion of shareholders, even when they do not promise immediate financial returns, highlighting the importance of nonpecuniary motives. \n\nFinally, firm inclusion in responsibility indices, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, can influence shareholder interest. Research by Cheung (2011) indicates that firms included in these indices often experience positive stock price reactions, suggesting that investors value CSR as a signal of firm quality and sustainability. However, the long-term financial impact of such inclusion remains mixed, further supporting the role of nonpecuniary motives. \n\nIn conclusion, the literature predominantly indicates that shareholder interest in CSR is driven by nonpecuniary motives, although pecuniary motives are not entirely absent. The willingness of shareholders to forego returns for ethical considerations, as evidenced by the growth of investments in the decarbonization sector, underscores the importance of nonpecuniary motives. Future research should continue to explore the welfare implications of CSR, particularly in the context of global challenges such as climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Does corporate social responsibility affect the cost of capital?", "authors": "Sadok El Ghoul, Omrane Guedhami, Chuck C.Y.
