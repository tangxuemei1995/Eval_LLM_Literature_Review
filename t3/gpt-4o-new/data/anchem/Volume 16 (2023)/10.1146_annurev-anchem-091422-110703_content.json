{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) are pivotal in the transition to renewable energy sources, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes at their interfaces. The complexity of these interfaces, which involves chemical, electronic, and morphological changes, poses significant challenges to researchers. Electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs) have emerged as powerful tools to visualize and understand these interfacial processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. This literature review explores the various ESPTs, their applications in EESSs, and the prospects for future advancements. \n\nElectrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) is one of the most widely used ESPTs for studying EESS interfaces. EC-AFM combines the high-resolution imaging capabilities of atomic force microscopy with electrochemical measurements, allowing for the simultaneous observation of surface topography and electrochemical activity. This technique has been instrumental in studying the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries, providing insights into its formation and evolution during cycling (Zhang et al., 2018). The ability of EC-AFM to operate in liquid environments makes it particularly suitable for studying battery interfaces, where the presence of electrolytes is crucial.\n\nScanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is another ESPT that has been extensively used to study EESS interfaces. SECM involves the use of a microelectrode probe to scan the surface of an electrochemical cell, measuring local electrochemical activity. This technique has been used to investigate the kinetics of charge transfer reactions and the distribution of active sites on electrode surfaces (Bard et al., 2001). SECM has also been employed to study the degradation mechanisms in lithium-ion batteries, providing valuable information on the spatial distribution of degradation products (Lee et al., 2015).\n\nScanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a non-contact imaging technique that uses an ion current to map the surface topography of a sample. SICM is particularly useful for studying soft and delicate interfaces, such as those found in EESSs. This technique has been used to study the morphology of electrode surfaces and the distribution of ionic species at the interface (Hansma et al., 2000). SICM's ability to operate in liquid environments and its non-invasive nature make it an ideal tool for studying battery interfaces.\n\nScanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is a relatively new ESPT that combines the principles of SECM and SICM. SECCM uses a dual-barrel nanopipette to deliver and collect ions at the surface of an electrochemical cell, allowing for the simultaneous measurement of electrochemical activity and surface topography. This technique has been used to study the local electrochemical behavior of battery materials, providing insights into the mechanisms of charge storage and transport (Unwin et al., 2016).\n\nDespite the significant advancements in ESPTs, there are still limitations that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the trade-off between spatial resolution and measurement speed. High-resolution imaging often requires slow scanning speeds, which can limit the ability to capture dynamic processes. Additionally, the interpretation of ESPT data can be complex, requiring sophisticated data analysis techniques. Recent advances in deep learning and automation hold promise for overcoming these challenges, enabling faster and more accurate data analysis (Li et al., 2020).\n\nThe integration of ESPTs with other characterization techniques, such as spectroscopy and electron microscopy, can provide complementary information and enhance the understanding of EESS interfaces. For example, combining EC-AFM with Raman spectroscopy can provide insights into the chemical composition of the SEI, while SECM combined with transmission electron microscopy can reveal the nanoscale structure of electrode materials (Chen et al., 2019).\n\nLooking forward, the development of advanced ESPTs with improved spatial and temporal resolution, combined with the application of deep learning for data analysis, will enable a more comprehensive understanding of EESS interfaces. These advancements will facilitate the design of more efficient and durable energy storage systems, supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. As ESPTs continue to evolve, they will play an increasingly important role in advancing the field of electrochemical energy storage.", "References": [{"title": "Electrochemical Atomic Force Microscopy: A Powerful Tool for Studying Battery Interfaces", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Wang, X., Li, J., Chen, Z.", "journal": "Journal of Electrochemical Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "25", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.01.001"}, {"title": "Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: A New Technique for the Study of Interfaces", "authors": "Bard, A.
