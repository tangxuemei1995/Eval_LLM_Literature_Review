{"Literature Review": "The use of gels in microscale electrophoresis has been a cornerstone in the analysis of biopolymers, providing a versatile platform for the separation and analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. The development of capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microchannel gel electrophoresis systems has significantly advanced the field of bioanalytical chemistry, offering high-resolution separation capabilities and efficient analysis of complex biological samples. These systems leverage the unique properties of gel matrices to facilitate the electrophoretic transport of biomolecules, which is critical for applications in biotherapeutics and molecular biology.\n\nCapillary gel electrophoresis, a technique that combines the principles of gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis, has been instrumental in enhancing the resolution and speed of biomolecular separations. The use of gel matrices in capillaries allows for the sieving of molecules based on size, providing a high degree of separation efficiency. This technique has been widely applied in the analysis of nucleic acids and proteins, where the gel matrix acts as a molecular sieve, allowing smaller molecules to migrate faster than larger ones (Karger et al., 1991). The development of microchannel gel electrophoresis, on the other hand, has enabled the miniaturization of electrophoretic systems, allowing for the integration of multiple analytical functions on a single microfluidic chip (Harrison et al., 1993).\n\nTraditional gel matrices, such as polyacrylamide and agarose, have been extensively used in microscale electrophoresis due to their well-characterized properties and ease of use. Polyacrylamide gels, in particular, are favored for their tunable pore sizes and mechanical stability, making them suitable for a wide range of applications (Righetti, 1983). Agarose gels, while less mechanically robust, offer the advantage of being non-toxic and easy to prepare, making them ideal for the separation of larger biomolecules such as DNA fragments (Serwer, 1983).\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of nontraditional gel matrices that offer enhanced functionality and performance. Selective polymers, for example, have been modified to include specific functional groups that can interact with target molecules, providing additional separation mechanisms beyond size-based sieving (Barron et al., 1994). Thermally responsive gels, which undergo phase transitions in response to temperature changes, have also been explored for their potential to facilitate dynamic control over electrophoretic separations (Hoffman, 1995).\n\nThe application of these advanced gel matrices has led to significant improvements in the analysis of complex biological samples. In DNA and RNA analysis, for instance, the use of modified gels has enabled the separation of closely related sequences with high precision, facilitating applications in genomics and transcriptomics (Liu et al., 1999). In protein analysis, the development of gels with specific binding sites has allowed for the selective separation of proteins based on their chemical properties, enhancing the resolution of proteomic analyses (Righetti et al., 2001).\n\nGlycan analysis, a challenging area due to the structural complexity and diversity of glycans, has also benefited from advances in gel electrophoresis. The use of gels with tailored pore sizes and chemical functionalities has enabled the separation of glycans based on their size and charge, providing valuable insights into glycosylation patterns and their biological implications (Ruhaak et al., 2010).\n\nEmerging techniques in microscale electrophoresis are focused on the development of multifunctional assays that integrate multiple analytical processes within a single platform. These techniques leverage the unique properties of gel matrices to enable real-time biochemical processing and analysis, offering new opportunities for high-throughput screening and diagnostics (Whitesides, 2006). The integration of three-dimensional gel structures within microfluidic devices, for example, has allowed for the simultaneous separation and detection of multiple analytes, providing a powerful tool for comprehensive biomolecular analysis (Sia et al., 2004).\n\nIn conclusion, the use of gels in microscale electrophoresis continues to be a vital area of research, driving innovations in bioanalytical chemistry and expanding the capabilities of electrophoretic techniques. The development of advanced gel matrices and the integration of multifunctional assays hold great promise for the future of biomolecular analysis, offering new solutions to complex analytical challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Capillary electrophoresis of proteins", "authors": "Karger, Barry L., Cohen, Alan S., Guttman, Andras", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "1991", "volumes": "63", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1021/ac00014a001"}, {"title": "Microchip capillary electrophoresis", "authors": "Harrison, D.
