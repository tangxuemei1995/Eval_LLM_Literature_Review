{"Literature Review": "Ion mobility (IM) spectrometry, when coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for the separation and characterization of gas-phase ions of biomolecules. The recent advancements in IM technology have significantly enhanced the resolution and dimensionality of analyses, providing deeper insights into complex biomolecular systems. This literature review explores the application of high-resolution and multidimensional IM in the fields of glycomics, lipidomics, peptidomics, and proteomics, highlighting the transformative impact of these technologies on biomolecular analyses. \n\nThe integration of IM with MS has been particularly beneficial in the field of proteomics, where the separation of isobaric and conformationally similar ions is crucial. The development of high-resolution IM-MS platforms has enabled the detailed characterization of protein conformations and the identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Lanucara et al., 2014). These platforms utilize advanced instrument architectures and innovative electric field applications to achieve unprecedented separation capabilities, allowing for the resolution of complex protein mixtures and the elucidation of subtle structural differences (Giles et al., 2011). \n\nIn glycomics, the structural diversity of glycans poses significant analytical challenges. The application of IM-MS has facilitated the separation of glycan isomers, which is critical for understanding their biological functions (Pagel et al., 2014). The use of multidimensional IM approaches, such as traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS), has further enhanced the resolution of glycan analyses, enabling the detailed characterization of glycan structures and their interactions with proteins (Harvey et al., 2015). These advancements have provided new insights into the role of glycans in cellular processes and disease mechanisms. \n\nLipidomics has also benefited from the application of next-generation IM technologies. The structural complexity of lipids, with their diverse head groups and fatty acid chains, requires high-resolution analytical techniques for accurate characterization. IM-MS has proven to be an effective tool for the separation of lipid isomers and the elucidation of lipid structures (Zhou et al., 2016). The use of high-resolution IM-MS has enabled the identification of novel lipid species and the investigation of lipid metabolism in various biological contexts (Kyle et al., 2016). \n\nIn peptidomics, the ability to resolve peptide isomers and conformers is essential for understanding peptide function and activity. The application of IM-MS has facilitated the separation of peptide ions based on their shape and size, providing valuable information on peptide structure and dynamics (Valentine et al., 1999). The use of multidimensional IM approaches has further enhanced the resolution of peptidomic analyses, enabling the detailed characterization of complex peptide mixtures and the identification of bioactive peptides (Gabelica et al., 2019). \n\nThe advancements in IM technology have been driven by innovations in instrument design and the application of novel electric field configurations. The development of structures for lossless ion manipulations (SLIM) and cyclic ion mobility spectrometry (cIMS) has expanded the capabilities of IM-MS platforms, allowing for extended ion path lengths and improved resolution (Smith et al., 2018). These innovations have opened new avenues for the analysis of complex biomolecular systems, providing deeper insights into their structure and function. \n\nDespite the significant progress in IM technology, challenges remain in the analysis of highly complex biomolecular systems. The integration of IM with other analytical techniques, such as chromatography and spectroscopy, holds promise for further enhancing the depth of analyses (Ridgeway et al., 2018). The development of hybrid platforms that combine the strengths of different analytical techniques could provide comprehensive solutions for the characterization of complex biomolecules. \n\nIn conclusion, the next generation of ion mobility experiments has significantly enhanced the depth of analyses in biomolecular research. The application of high-resolution and multidimensional IM technologies has provided new insights into the structure and function of complex biomolecules, with significant implications for the fields of glycomics, lipidomics, peptidomics, and proteomics. Continued innovation in IM technology and its integration with other analytical techniques will further expand the capabilities of biomolecular analyses, providing deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Ion mobility mass spectrometry: separating and identifying isomers", "authors": "Lanucara, F., Holman, S.
