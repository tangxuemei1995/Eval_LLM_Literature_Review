{"Literature Review": "The advent of nondestructive 3D pathology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) represents a significant leap forward in the field of medical diagnostics and translational research. Traditional 2D histopathology, while invaluable, is limited by its inability to provide comprehensive spatial context, which is crucial for understanding complex biological processes and disease progression. The integration of LSFM into pathology offers a transformative approach by allowing for the visualization of entire tissue volumes in their natural state, thus preserving the spatial relationships that are often lost in 2D sections. This review explores the technological advancements that have facilitated the rise of 3D pathology, the challenges that remain, and the potential applications in clinical and research settings.\n\nOne of the primary drivers of the shift towards 3D pathology is the development of advanced tissue-clearing techniques. These methods, such as CLARITY, CUBIC, and iDISCO, have been instrumental in rendering tissues transparent, thereby enabling the penetration of light and the acquisition of high-resolution images throughout the entire volume of the sample (Chung et al., 2013; Susaki et al., 2014; Renier et al., 2014). These techniques have been optimized to preserve the structural integrity and molecular composition of tissues, which is critical for accurate analysis and interpretation.\n\nIn parallel, the evolution of LSFM has provided the necessary imaging capabilities to exploit these cleared tissues. LSFM offers several advantages over traditional microscopy techniques, including reduced photobleaching and phototoxicity, faster acquisition times, and the ability to capture large volumes of data with high resolution (Tomer et al., 2012). These features make LSFM particularly well-suited for the demands of 3D pathology, where the goal is to obtain detailed images of entire organs or large tissue sections.\n\nThe integration of computational tools has further enhanced the utility of 3D pathology. Advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques are now being employed to manage and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by LSFM (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017). These tools facilitate the extraction of meaningful biological information, such as the identification of cellular and subcellular structures, and the quantification of spatial relationships within tissues. The ability to automate these processes is crucial for the scalability of 3D pathology in both research and clinical settings.\n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in the widespread adoption of 3D pathology. One of the primary obstacles is the standardization of tissue-clearing protocols and imaging parameters, which is necessary to ensure reproducibility and comparability of results across different studies and laboratories (Richardson & Lichtman, 2015). Additionally, the sheer volume of data generated by LSFM poses significant storage and computational challenges, necessitating the development of efficient data management and analysis pipelines.\n\nThe potential applications of 3D pathology are vast and varied. In translational research, 3D pathology can provide insights into the spatial organization of tissues and the interactions between different cell types, which are critical for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets (Ueda et al., 2020). In preclinical drug development, 3D pathology can be used to assess the efficacy and safety of new compounds by providing detailed information on their effects at the tissue and organ levels (Ertürk et al., 2014). In the clinical setting, 3D pathology has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic workflows by providing more comprehensive and accurate assessments of tissue samples, thereby improving patient outcomes (Glaser et al., 2019).\n\nLooking to the future, the continued development of 3D pathology will likely be driven by advances in imaging technology, computational methods, and tissue engineering. The integration of multimodal imaging techniques, such as combining LSFM with other modalities like MRI or CT, could provide even richer datasets and more comprehensive insights into tissue architecture and function (Keller & Dodt, 2012). Furthermore, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to 3D pathology holds great promise for automating and enhancing the analysis of complex datasets, ultimately leading to more precise and personalized medical interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, nondestructive 3D pathology using LSFM represents a paradigm shift in the way we study and diagnose diseases. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of this approach are immense, offering new opportunities for advancing our understanding of biology and improving patient care. Continued investment in research and development, as well as collaboration across disciplines, will be essential to fully realize the potential of 3D pathology in both research and clinical contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Structural and molecular interrogation of intact biological systems", "authors": "Chung, K., Wallace, J., Kim, S.
