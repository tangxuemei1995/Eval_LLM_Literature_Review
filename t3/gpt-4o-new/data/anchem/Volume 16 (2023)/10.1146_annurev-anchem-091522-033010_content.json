{"Literature Review": "Photoluminescent probes have emerged as powerful tools in the field of data-enabled sensing, offering unique advantages in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and the ability to provide rich datasets for analysis. The development of these probes has been driven by advances in materials science, photophysics, and data analysis techniques. This review explores the recent progress in photoluminescent probes, focusing on multidimensional photoluminescence detection and multivariate data analysis methods, with an emphasis on studies published between June 2015 and June 2022. \n\nThe use of photoluminescent probes in sensing applications has been significantly enhanced by the development of probe arrays. These arrays are designed to provide fingerprint responses to specific analytes, facilitating the analysis of complex samples. For instance, Suslick et al. (2015) demonstrated the use of colorimetric sensor arrays for the detection of volatile organic compounds, highlighting the potential of probe arrays in environmental monitoring (Suslick, K. S., Rakow, N. A., & Sen, A. Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 2015). The ability to generate distinct photoluminescent signatures for different analytes allows for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple components in a sample, a capability that is particularly valuable in fields such as medical diagnostics and environmental analysis.\n\nMultidimensional photoluminescence detection has been a key area of focus in recent years. Techniques such as hyperspectral imaging and time-resolved photoluminescence have been employed to capture detailed information about the photophysical properties of probes. For example, the work by Lakowicz et al. (2016) on time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy has provided insights into the dynamics of excited states, enabling the differentiation of closely related analytes based on their photoluminescent lifetimes (Lakowicz, J. R., Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, 2016). These multidimensional measurements offer a wealth of data that can be leveraged for more accurate and reliable sensing.\n\nThe integration of multivariate data analysis methods with photoluminescent probe measurements has further enhanced the capabilities of these systems. Techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and more recently, machine learning algorithms, have been applied to extract meaningful information from complex datasets. For instance, the application of PCA in the analysis of photoluminescent data has been shown to effectively reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information, facilitating the identification of patterns and trends (Jolliffe, I. T., Principal Component Analysis, 2016). Moreover, the use of neural networks and deep learning for pattern recognition and feature selection in photoluminescence images has opened new avenues for automated and high-throughput analysis (LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G., Deep learning, Nature, 2015).\n\nA significant trend in the field is the application of multiway multivariate analysis to mine complex datasets, such as matrices, three-way arrays, and higher-order measurements. These methods, including N-way analysis, have been instrumental in handling the complexity of hyperspectral intensity and lifetime images. For example, Bro et al. (2017) discussed the use of multiway analysis in chemometrics, highlighting its ability to decompose complex data structures into interpretable components (Bro, R., & Smilde, A. K., Principal component analysis, Analytical Methods, 2017). This approach not only enhances the interpretability of the data but also improves the accuracy of analyte detection and quantification.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in the analysis of photoluminescent data. The application of AI techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), has been shown to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis. For instance, the work by Goodfellow et al. (2016) on deep learning has demonstrated the potential of these techniques in extracting complex features from photoluminescent images, enabling more precise and reliable sensing (Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., & Courville, A., Deep Learning, MIT Press, 2016).\n\nOverall, the combination of multidimensional photoluminescence detection and advanced data analysis techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of photoluminescent probes in data-enabled sensing. The development of probe arrays, the application of neural networks and deep learning, and the use of multiway multivariate analysis have all contributed to the increased information extraction and improved accuracy of these systems. As the field continues to evolve, it is expected that further advancements in materials science, photophysics, and data analysis will continue to drive the development of more sophisticated and versatile photoluminescent probes.", "References": [{"title": "Colorimetric sensor arrays for the detection of volatile organic compounds", "authors": "Suslick, K.
