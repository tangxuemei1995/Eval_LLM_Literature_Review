{"Literature Review": "The CRISPR-Cas system, originally discovered as an adaptive immune mechanism in bacteria and archaea, has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering and molecular biology. Its application in biosensing is a relatively recent development, yet it has already shown significant promise due to its unique biochemical properties. The CRISPR-Cas system's programmability, high specificity, and efficiency make it an ideal candidate for developing next-generation biosensors. This literature review explores the technical advancements and application prospects of CRISPR-based biosensing strategies, focusing on nucleic acid and non-nucleic acid detection methods. \n\nThe core biochemical properties of the CRISPR-Cas system that facilitate its use in biosensing include its ability to operate at diverse reaction temperatures, its programmability, high reaction efficiency, and recognition specificity. These properties have been harnessed to develop a variety of biosensing platforms. For instance, the CRISPR-Cas12 and Cas13 systems have been employed for nucleic acid detection due to their collateral cleavage activity, which is activated upon target recognition (Chen et al., 2018). This property allows for the amplification of the detection signal, thereby enhancing sensitivity. \n\nRecent efforts have focused on improving the sensitivity and quantification capabilities of CRISPR-based biosensors. One approach has been the integration of CRISPR systems with isothermal amplification techniques such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These combinations have been shown to significantly enhance the sensitivity of CRISPR-based assays, enabling the detection of low-abundance targets (Gootenberg et al., 2017). Additionally, the development of multiplex assays has been a key area of research, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets. This is particularly useful in clinical diagnostics where multiple pathogens or biomarkers need to be detected in a single sample (Kellner et al., 2019). \n\nThe development of convenient one-pot assays has also been a significant advancement in CRISPR-based biosensing. These assays simplify the detection process by combining all necessary reagents and steps into a single reaction vessel, reducing the risk of contamination and the need for complex laboratory equipment. This has been achieved through the careful optimization of reaction conditions and the use of lyophilized reagents, which are stable at room temperature (Li et al., 2019). \n\nCRISPR-based biosensors have also been extended to the detection of non-nucleic acid targets, such as proteins and small molecules. This has been achieved by coupling CRISPR systems with aptamers or other recognition elements that can bind to the target of interest. For example, CRISPR-Cas systems have been used in conjunction with aptamers to detect proteins by converting the protein binding event into a nucleic acid signal that can be recognized by the CRISPR system (Zhou et al., 2020). This approach has expanded the range of applications for CRISPR-based biosensors beyond nucleic acid detection. \n\nDespite these advancements, several obstacles remain in the commercial application of CRISPR detection technology. One major challenge is the need for further optimization to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of CRISPR-based assays in diverse settings. Additionally, the cost of CRISPR reagents and the complexity of the assays may limit their widespread adoption. Addressing these challenges will require continued research and development, as well as collaboration between academia and industry. \n\nLooking forward, the development opportunities for CRISPR-based biosensing are vast. The integration of CRISPR systems with advanced sensor technologies, such as microfluidics and nanotechnology, holds great potential for creating highly sensitive and portable biosensors. Furthermore, the application of CRISPR-based biosensors in fields such as environmental monitoring, food safety, and personalized medicine could have a significant impact on public health and safety. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that CRISPR-based biosensing will become an increasingly important tool in the detection and diagnosis of a wide range of targets.", "References": [{"title": "Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2", "authors": "Chen, J.
