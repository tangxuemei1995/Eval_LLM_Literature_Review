{"Literature Review": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of infectious diseases that predominantly affect impoverished populations in tropical and subtropical regions. These diseases, caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths, pose significant public health challenges due to their high prevalence and the limited resources available for their diagnosis and treatment (Hotez et al., 2008). The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified several NTDs, such as dengue, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis, which require urgent attention due to their impact on global health (WHO, 2010). Traditional diagnostic methods for NTDs often require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel, which are scarce in the regions most affected by these diseases (Peeling et al., 2017). Consequently, there is a pressing need for innovative diagnostic solutions that are both cost-effective and accessible. \n\nMicrofluidic systems have emerged as a promising technology for the development of low-cost, portable diagnostic devices. These systems manipulate small volumes of fluids in channels with dimensions of tens to hundreds of micrometers, enabling the integration of multiple laboratory functions on a single chip (Whitesides, 2006). The potential of microfluidics for point-of-care (POC) testing in resource-limited settings has been widely recognized, particularly for the detection of NTDs (Yager et al., 2006). Recent advances in microfluidic technology have led to the development of various platforms, including paper-based microfluidics, lateral flow assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which offer rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of pathogens (Martinez et al., 2010). \n\nPaper-based microfluidic devices, also known as microPADs, have gained significant attention due to their low cost, ease of fabrication, and ability to operate without external power sources (Martinez et al., 2008). These devices utilize the capillary action of paper to transport fluids, allowing for the implementation of complex assays in a simple format. Recent studies have demonstrated the application of microPADs for the detection of various NTDs, including dengue and leishmaniasis, with promising results (Yetisen et al., 2013). For instance, a paper-based device for the detection of dengue virus was developed using a colorimetric assay, which provided results within 15 minutes and required minimal sample preparation (Dungchai et al., 2009). \n\nLateral flow assays (LFAs) are another class of microfluidic devices that have been widely used for the detection of NTDs. These assays are based on the principle of immunochromatography, where a sample is applied to a test strip and migrates through a series of zones containing antibodies specific to the target analyte (Posthuma-Trumpie et al., 2009). LFAs offer several advantages, including simplicity, rapid results, and the potential for multiplexing, making them suitable for POC testing in low-resource settings (Chin et al., 2011). Recent developments in LFA technology have focused on improving sensitivity and specificity through the use of novel materials and detection methods (Parolo et al., 2013). For example, a recent study reported the development of a highly sensitive LFA for the detection of schistosomiasis, which utilized gold nanoparticles for signal enhancement (Torrente-Rodríguez et al., 2020). \n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a well-established method for the detection of antigens and antibodies, and their integration into microfluidic platforms has been explored for the diagnosis of NTDs (Kovarik et al., 2012). Microfluidic ELISAs offer several advantages over traditional formats, including reduced reagent consumption, shorter assay times, and the potential for automation (Sia et al., 2004). Recent studies have demonstrated the application of microfluidic ELISAs for the detection of various NTDs, such as Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, with improved sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional methods (Rodriguez et al., 2015). \n\nDespite the significant progress in the development of microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, several challenges remain. The translation of these technologies from the laboratory to the field requires careful consideration of factors such as device robustness, user-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness (Boehm et al., 2013). Additionally, the integration of sample preparation and data analysis into microfluidic platforms is essential for the development of fully automated POC diagnostic systems (Sackmann et al., 2014). Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to ensure the successful implementation of microfluidic diagnostics in resource-limited settings. \n\nIn conclusion, microfluidic systems offer a promising solution for the detection of NTDs in low-resource settings. The development of paper-based microfluidics, lateral flow assays, and microfluidic ELISAs has demonstrated the potential of these technologies to provide rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. Continued research and development in this field are essential to overcome the remaining challenges and to ensure the widespread adoption of microfluidic diagnostics for NTDs.", "References": [{"title": "Control of neglected tropical diseases", "authors": "Hotez, Peter J., Molyneux, David H., Fenwick, Alan, Kumaresan, Jacob, Sachs, Jeffrey D., Sachs, Sonia E., Savioli, Lorenzo", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2008", "volumes": "357", "first page": "1018", "last page": "1027", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMra064142"}, {"title": "The WHO research agenda for helminth infections", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases", "year": "2010", "volumes": "4", "first page": "e682", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0000682"}, {"title": "Innovative technologies for point-of-care testing for HIV", "authors": "Peeling, Rosanna W., Mabey, David", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "15", "first page": "671", "last page": "682", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro.2017.122"}, {"title": "The origins and the future of microfluidics", "authors": "Whitesides, George M.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "442", "first page": "368", "last page": "373", "DOI": "10.1038/nature05058"}, {"title": "Microfluidic diagnostic technologies for global public health", "authors": "Yager, Paul, Domingo, Gonzalo J., Gerdes, John", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "442", "first page": "412", "last page": "418", "DOI": "10.1038/nature05064"}, {"title": "Simple telemedicine for developing regions: camera phones and paper-based microfluidic devices for real-time, off-site diagnosis", "authors": "Martinez, Andres W., Phillips, Scott T., Whitesides, George M.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2008", "volumes": "80", "first page": "3699", "last page": "3707", "DOI": "10.1021/ac800112r"}, {"title": "Paper-based microfluidic devices: a new generation of low-cost diagnostics", "authors": "Yetisen, Ali K., Akram, Muhammad S., Lowe, Christopher R.", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2013", "volumes": "13", "first page": "2210", "last page": "2251", "DOI": "10.1039/C3LC50169H"}, {"title": "Use of gold nanoparticles in lateral-flow assays: a critical review", "authors": "Parolo, Claudio, Merkoçi, Arben", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2013", "volumes": "13", "first page": "3838", "last page": "3852", "DOI": "10.1039/C3LC50169H"}, {"title": "Microfluidic point-of-care diagnostic devices: evolution and trends", "authors": "Sackmann, Eric K., Fulton, Aaron L., Beebe, David J.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2014", "volumes": "86", "first page": "312", "last page": "333", "DOI": "10.1021/ac403508t"}, {"title": "Microfluidic ELISA for rapid CD4 cell count at point-of-care", "authors": "Rodriguez, Nicholas M., Linnes, Janelle C., Fan, Andy, Ellenson, Christopher K., Pollock, Nira R., Klapperich, Catherine M.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2015", "volumes": "5", "first page": "12845", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/srep12845"}]}
