{"Literature Review": "The study of environmental effects on political behavior has gained significant traction in recent years, with a particular focus on how local contexts influence interpersonal contact with social out-groups. This line of inquiry is deeply rooted in contact theory, which posits that intergroup contact under appropriate conditions can reduce prejudice and foster positive intergroup relations (Allport, 1954). However, contemporary research has expanded beyond the traditional boundaries of social psychology to explore new empirical cases and questions, particularly in diverse socio-economic and cultural settings. \n\nOne of the foundational studies in this area is Pettigrew and Tropp's (2006) meta-analysis, which confirmed that intergroup contact generally reduces prejudice across a wide range of contexts. Their work highlighted the importance of equal status, common goals, intergroup cooperation, and support from authorities as key conditions for successful contact. However, recent studies have begun to question the universality of these conditions, suggesting that the effects of contact may vary significantly depending on the specific environmental and contextual factors at play. \n\nFor instance, Enos (2017) demonstrated that the presence of out-group members in one's local environment can influence political attitudes and behaviors, even in the absence of direct interpersonal contact. His study on the effects of demographic changes in neighborhoods showed that mere exposure to diversity can lead to increased political polarization, challenging the assumption that contact always leads to positive outcomes. This finding underscores the need to consider the broader context in which contact occurs, including the socio-economic and political climate. \n\nMoreover, the role of built environments in shaping political behavior has been increasingly recognized. Studies have shown that urban design and infrastructure can facilitate or hinder intergroup contact, thereby influencing political attitudes. For example, Talen (2008) argued that mixed-use neighborhoods and public spaces can promote social interaction and reduce segregation, potentially leading to more inclusive political outcomes. Similarly, the digital environment has emerged as a critical context for political behavior, with online platforms providing new opportunities for intergroup contact and political engagement (Boulianne, 2015). \n\nIn addition to the physical and digital environments, the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact has been identified as a crucial area for future research. Studies have shown that socio-economic inequality can exacerbate intergroup tensions and influence political behavior. For instance, Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) found that economic disparities within racially diverse communities can lead to increased support for exclusionary policies. This suggests that the effects of contact are not only shaped by ethnic diversity but also by the socio-economic context in which it occurs. \n\nFurthermore, the political effects of intergroup contact are not limited to attitudes towards out-groups. Research has shown that contact can also influence broader political behaviors, such as voting patterns and civic engagement. For example, Hopkins (2010) found that local demographic changes can affect political participation, with individuals in more diverse communities being more likely to engage in political activities. This highlights the need to consider the multifaceted nature of political behavior and the various ways in which context and contact can influence it. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of environmental effects on political behavior is a rapidly evolving field that has moved beyond the traditional focus on contact theory. By considering a wider range of contexts and mechanisms, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how local environments shape political behavior. Future research should continue to explore the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact, as well as the role of built and digital environments, in mediating the effects of demographic contexts. This will not only enhance our understanding of the political effects of intergroup contact but also inform policies aimed at promoting social cohesion and political inclusion.", "References": [{"title": "The Nature of Prejudice", "authors": "Gordon W.
