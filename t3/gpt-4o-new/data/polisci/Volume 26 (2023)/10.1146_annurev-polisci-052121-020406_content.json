{"Literature Review": "The study of power sharing in authoritarian regimes has gained significant attention in political science, particularly in understanding how rulers maintain control while managing potential threats from within their ranks. Authoritarian power sharing involves complex interactions between rulers and challengers, where the distribution of power and resources is negotiated to prevent internal conflict and ensure regime stability. This literature review explores the concepts, mechanisms, and strategies of power sharing in authoritarian contexts, drawing on existing research to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. \n\nOne of the foundational concepts in the study of authoritarian power sharing is the notion of 'spoils sharing,' where rulers distribute resources and privileges to potential challengers to secure their loyalty and prevent coups. Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) argue that the distribution of spoils is a critical mechanism for maintaining regime stability, as it aligns the interests of key elites with those of the ruler. However, this approach is not without its challenges, as it requires a delicate balance between rewarding loyalty and preventing the accumulation of power that could threaten the ruler's position.\n\nThe enforcement of power-sharing agreements is another critical aspect of authoritarian politics. Svolik (2012) highlights the importance of credible commitment in power-sharing arrangements, noting that without mechanisms to enforce these agreements, rulers may renege on their promises, leading to instability and potential regime collapse. Institutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control or empowering third-party enforcers, can serve as enforcement mechanisms by reallocating power and making it costly for rulers to break their commitments. However, the effectiveness of these institutions is often limited by their inherent weaknesses in authoritarian regimes, creating a Catch-22 situation where credible commitment is difficult to achieve.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by weak institutions, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible in authoritarian regimes. Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) suggest that challengers with coercive capabilities can defend their spoils and deter rulers from reneging on power-sharing agreements. This dynamic creates a double-edged sword, as challengers can also leverage their coercive power to overthrow the ruler. As a result, strategic dictators are likely to share power only under specific conditions, such as when challengers can credibly punish the ruler for reneging and when challengers are willing to forgo harmful actions in exchange for power sharing.\n\nThe role of institutions in authoritarian power sharing is further complicated by the presence of commitment problems. Geddes (1999) argues that commitment problems arise when rulers cannot credibly commit to power-sharing agreements due to the lack of institutional constraints on their power. This issue is exacerbated in authoritarian regimes, where institutions are often weak or manipulated to serve the ruler's interests. To address these challenges, some scholars have proposed the use of 'institutionalized power sharing,' where formal institutions are established to facilitate power sharing and reduce the likelihood of conflict. However, the effectiveness of such institutions is contingent on their ability to function independently of the ruler's influence.\n\nIn addition to institutional mechanisms, the strategic behavior of rulers and challengers plays a crucial role in authoritarian power sharing. Boix and Svolik (2013) emphasize the importance of strategic interactions between rulers and challengers, noting that power-sharing arrangements are often the result of bargaining processes where both parties seek to maximize their interests. This perspective highlights the dynamic nature of power sharing in authoritarian regimes, where the balance of power is constantly negotiated and renegotiated based on the changing interests and capabilities of the actors involved.\n\nThe literature on authoritarian power sharing also explores the impact of external factors, such as international pressure and economic conditions, on power-sharing arrangements. Levitsky and Way (2010) argue that external actors can influence power-sharing dynamics by providing support to either the ruler or challengers, thereby altering the balance of power and affecting the stability of the regime. Economic conditions, such as resource wealth or economic crises, can also impact power-sharing arrangements by affecting the availability of spoils and the incentives for cooperation among elites.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of authoritarian power sharing provides valuable insights into the mechanisms and strategies used by rulers to maintain control and manage internal threats. While the distribution of spoils and the enforcement of power-sharing agreements are central to this process, the role of institutions, strategic interactions, and external factors also play a significant role in shaping power-sharing dynamics. As authoritarian regimes continue to evolve, further research is needed to understand the complex interplay of these factors and their implications for regime stability and change.", "References": [{"title": "The Logic of Political Survival", "authors": "Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Alastair Smith, Randolph M.
