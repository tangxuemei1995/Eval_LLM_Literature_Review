{"Literature Review": "The study of gender and international relations (IR) has evolved significantly over the past three decades, with feminist scholars contributing to a rich body of literature that interrogates the intersections of gender, sexuality, and global politics. This literature review explores four key areas within this field: gender and political economy, gender and security, queer approaches, and feminist foreign policy. Each area is examined through recent scholarship and its broader scholarly context, highlighting both enduring themes and emerging trends. \n\nGender and political economy is a critical area of inquiry that examines how gendered power dynamics shape economic policies and practices on a global scale. Feminist scholars have long argued that traditional economic theories often overlook the gendered dimensions of economic life, leading to policies that perpetuate gender inequalities (Peterson, 2005). Recent scholarship has expanded this critique by exploring how global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbate existing gender disparities in economic participation and outcomes (Alon et al., 2020). The pandemic has highlighted the disproportionate impact on women, particularly in terms of job losses and increased caregiving responsibilities, underscoring the need for gender-sensitive economic policies (Power, 2020). Furthermore, feminist political economists have called for a rethinking of economic recovery strategies to ensure they address the structural inequalities that disadvantage women and other marginalized groups (Elson, 2021).\n\nIn the realm of gender and security, feminist scholars have challenged traditional security studies by emphasizing the importance of considering gendered experiences and perspectives in understanding global security issues. The concept of 'human security,' which prioritizes the protection of individuals over state-centric security, has been a significant contribution of feminist scholarship (Tickner, 1992). Recent research has further explored how gendered power relations influence conflict dynamics and peacebuilding efforts. For instance, the war in Ukraine has brought attention to the gendered dimensions of conflict, including the roles of women in resistance movements and the impact of war on gender-based violence (True, 2022). Feminist scholars argue that incorporating gender perspectives into security policies can lead to more comprehensive and effective peacebuilding strategies (Shepherd, 2017).\n\nQueer approaches to international relations have emerged as a vibrant area of scholarship that challenges heteronormative assumptions in global politics. Queer theorists critique the binary understanding of gender and sexuality, advocating for a more inclusive and fluid conceptualization of identity (Weber, 2016). This perspective has been instrumental in highlighting the ways in which global political structures marginalize LGBTQ+ communities. Recent studies have examined the intersection of queer identities with issues such as migration, asylum, and human rights, revealing the unique vulnerabilities faced by queer individuals in these contexts (Luibhéid, 2020). By centering queer experiences, scholars argue for a reimagining of international relations that is more inclusive and equitable (Sjoberg, 2015).\n\nFeminist foreign policy is an emerging area of research that seeks to integrate feminist principles into the practice of international diplomacy and statecraft. This approach advocates for foreign policies that prioritize gender equality, human rights, and social justice (Aggestam & Bergman-Rosamond, 2016). Countries such as Sweden and Canada have adopted feminist foreign policies, providing case studies for scholars to analyze the implementation and impact of such approaches (Thompson & Clement, 2019). Recent scholarship has explored the challenges and opportunities of feminist foreign policy, including the tension between feminist ideals and geopolitical realities (Prügl, 2020). Scholars argue that while feminist foreign policy holds transformative potential, it requires a commitment to addressing systemic inequalities and power imbalances at both the domestic and international levels (Wibben, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the study of gender and international relations is a dynamic and multifaceted field that continues to evolve in response to global challenges and opportunities. By examining the intersections of gender, sexuality, and global politics, feminist scholars provide critical insights into the complexities of international relations. As the field continues to grow, it is essential to engage with diverse perspectives and interdisciplinary approaches to address the persistent gender inequities that shape our world.", "References": [{"title": "A Critical Rewriting of Global Political Economy: Integrating Reproductive, Productive and Virtual Economies", "authors": "V.
