{"Literature Review": "The intersection of international energy politics and climate change has become a focal point of scholarly inquiry, as the global community grapples with the dual challenges of energy security and environmental sustainability. The transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources is not merely a technical or economic issue but is deeply embedded in the political fabric of nations and international relations. This literature review explores the complexities of international energy politics in the context of climate change, highlighting the roles of various stakeholders, the geopolitical implications, and the distributive politics involved in the clean energy transition. \n\nThe clean energy transition is often framed as a zero-sum game, with clear 'winners' and 'losers' (Meckling et al., 2015). Countries rich in fossil fuel resources, such as oil and coal, face significant economic and political challenges as the world shifts towards renewable energy sources. These nations, often referred to as 'losers' in the transition, must navigate the economic impacts of declining fossil fuel revenues and the political pressures to diversify their economies (Friedrichs and Inderwildi, 2013). Conversely, countries with abundant renewable resources or advanced technological capabilities are positioned as 'winners', potentially gaining economic and geopolitical advantages (Sovacool, 2016). \n\nHowever, the dichotomy of winners and losers oversimplifies the complex realities of the energy transition. Political scientists argue that the transition is not just about shifting energy sources but involves a fundamental restructuring of political and economic power (Newell and Paterson, 2010). The transition to clean energy is fraught with political obstacles, including entrenched interests in the fossil fuel industry, regulatory challenges, and the need for substantial investment in new infrastructure (Kuzemko et al., 2016). These challenges are compounded by the varying capacities of states to implement and manage the transition, leading to significant disparities in progress and outcomes (Cherp et al., 2011). \n\nThe geopolitics of energy is also undergoing a transformation as climate change reshapes the global energy landscape. Traditional energy geopolitics, centered around oil and gas, is being challenged by the rise of renewable energy sources, which are more geographically dispersed and less subject to the control of a few dominant players (Overland, 2019). This shift has implications for international relations, as countries seek to secure access to critical materials for renewable technologies, such as lithium and rare earth elements, and to establish themselves as leaders in the emerging clean energy economy (Månsson et al., 2014). \n\nMoreover, the politics of energy transition are deeply intertwined with issues of justice and equity. The distributive politics of energy transition highlight the uneven impacts of climate policies on different social groups and regions (Sovacool et al., 2019). For instance, policies that promote renewable energy can lead to job losses in fossil fuel industries, disproportionately affecting workers and communities dependent on these sectors (Carley and Konisky, 2020). Addressing these distributive impacts requires careful policy design and the inclusion of affected stakeholders in decision-making processes (Jenkins et al., 2018). \n\nThe role of international institutions and agreements is also critical in shaping the politics of energy transition. The Paris Agreement, for example, has been a significant driver of national and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy (Falkner, 2016). However, the effectiveness of such agreements depends on the political will of participating countries and their ability to implement and enforce commitments (Keohane and Victor, 2016). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of international energy politics in the age of climate change reveals a complex and dynamic landscape. The transition to clean energy is not only a technical and economic challenge but also a deeply political process that involves a wide range of actors, interests, and power dynamics. Understanding these complexities is essential for developing effective policies and strategies to navigate the transition and achieve a sustainable energy future.", "References": [{"title": "Winning coalitions and the political economy of energy transitions: Explaining the rise of renewable energy in Germany", "authors": "Jonas Meckling, Nina Kelsey, Eric Biber, John Zysman", "journal": "Global Environmental Politics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "15", "first page": "52", "last page": "71", "DOI": "10.1162/GLEP_a_00310"}, {"title": "The end of fossil energy: The reality of the decline of oil and coal", "authors": "Jörg Friedrichs, Oliver Inderwildi", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2013", "volumes": "52", "first page": "297", "last page": "310", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2012.09.040"}, {"title": "How long will it take?
