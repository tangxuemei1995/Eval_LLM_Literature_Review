{"Literature Review": "The political landscape of Asian Americans in the twenty-first century is a multifaceted subject that encompasses racial formation, civic engagement, political participation, partisanship, and representation. Understanding the racial formation and position of Asian Americans is crucial to comprehending their political dynamics. Historically, Asian Americans have been perceived as a 'model minority,' a stereotype that has both facilitated and hindered their political engagement (Kim, 1999). This racial positioning has often placed Asian Americans in a unique intermediary status within the racial hierarchy, affecting their political alliances and activism (Tuan, 1998). The racial formation of Asian Americans is not static; it evolves with demographic changes and socio-political contexts. The increasing diversity within the Asian American community, with significant populations from China, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, among others, complicates a monolithic understanding of their racial identity (Omi & Winant, 2014). This diversity necessitates a nuanced approach to studying their political behavior and civic engagement. Civic engagement among Asian Americans has a rich history, often rooted in the struggles for civil rights and against racial discrimination. The early twentieth century saw Asian Americans, particularly Chinese and Japanese immigrants, fighting for citizenship rights and against exclusionary laws (Ngai, 2004). These historical struggles laid the groundwork for contemporary civic engagement, which has expanded to include a wide range of issues from immigration reform to education and healthcare (Lien, 2001). The political participation of Asian Americans has been steadily increasing, although it still lags behind other racial groups. Factors such as language barriers, cultural differences, and a lack of targeted outreach by political parties contribute to lower participation rates (Ramakrishnan, 2005). However, recent elections have shown a significant increase in Asian American voter turnout, driven by issues such as immigration, healthcare, and racial justice (Wong et al., 2011). Partisanship and vote choice among Asian Americans are influenced by a variety of factors, including socioeconomic status, generational differences, and issue orientations. Historically, Asian Americans have leaned towards the Democratic Party, largely due to its stance on immigration and civil rights (Lien, 1997). However, there is considerable variation within the community, with some subgroups showing strong support for Republican candidates, particularly on issues related to business and taxation (Tam Cho, 1999). Political representation of Asian Americans has been increasing, although it remains disproportionately low compared to their population size. The election of Asian American politicians at local, state, and national levels has been a significant milestone in increasing visibility and influence (Junn & Masuoka, 2008). These representatives often face the challenge of balancing the diverse interests within the Asian American community while addressing broader national issues. The racial position of Asian Americans continues to play a central role in their political activism and future research. The rise of anti-Asian sentiment and violence, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has galvanized a new wave of activism focused on combating racism and advocating for policy changes (Jeung et al., 2021). This activism highlights the importance of understanding the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, and politics in shaping the experiences and political behavior of Asian Americans. Future research should continue to explore these intersections, with a focus on the impact of transnational ties, intergenerational differences, and the role of technology and social media in political mobilization. In conclusion, the politics of Asian Americans in the twenty-first century is a dynamic field that reflects broader trends in racial and ethnic politics in the United States. As the Asian American population continues to grow and diversify, their political influence is likely to increase, making it essential for scholars and policymakers to understand the complexities of their political behavior and engagement.", "References": [{"title": "The Racial Triangulation of Asian Americans", "authors": "Claire Jean Kim", "journal": "Politics & Society", "year": "1999", "volumes": "27", "first page": "105", "last page": "138", "DOI": "10.1177/0032329299027001005"}, {"title": "Forever Foreigners or Honorary Whites?
