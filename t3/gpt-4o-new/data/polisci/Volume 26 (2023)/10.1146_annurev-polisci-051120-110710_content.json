{"Literature Review": "The study of the South in American political development has undergone significant transformation in recent years, with scholars increasingly challenging the traditional narrative of the South's eventual convergence with the political patterns of the post-New Deal North. This shift in focus has brought to light the enduring influence of the South on national politics, particularly through its commitment to white supremacy and its unique political regimes. This literature review examines the recent scholarship on southern distinctiveness, the pathways of southern influence, and the debates surrounding these issues. \n\nHistorically, the South has been characterized by its distinct political and social systems, most notably the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation and disenfranchised African Americans. The traditional view in political science was that the South would gradually align with the rest of the nation, particularly following the New Deal era, which brought about significant social and economic reforms (Key, 1949). However, recent scholarship has challenged this notion, arguing that the South has maintained a distinct political identity that continues to shape national politics. \n\nOne of the key themes in recent literature is the South's enduring commitment to white supremacy and its impact on American political development. Scholars such as Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen (2018) have demonstrated how the legacy of slavery and segregation continues to influence political attitudes and behaviors in the South. Their research shows that areas with a higher concentration of enslaved people in the past are more likely to exhibit conservative political attitudes today, highlighting the long-lasting effects of racial hierarchies. \n\nAnother significant area of research is the South's influence on national political institutions and policies. Mickey (2015) argues that the South has played a crucial role in shaping American political development through its unique political regimes, which he describes as 'authoritarian enclaves' within a democratic nation. These regimes have been characterized by limited political competition, restricted voting rights, and the dominance of a single party, often the Democratic Party, which historically upheld white supremacy. This has had profound implications for national politics, as southern politicians have wielded considerable power in Congress and influenced key policy decisions. \n\nThe debates over the sources of southern influence have also been a focal point of recent scholarship. Some scholars argue that the South's political distinctiveness is primarily a result of its historical legacy of slavery and segregation, while others emphasize the role of economic factors, such as the region's reliance on agriculture and its resistance to industrialization (Black and Black, 2002). These debates highlight the complexity of southern politics and the need for a nuanced understanding of the region's influence on national political development. \n\nRecent works have also focused on the concept of 'southern regimes' and the debates they have provoked. Scholars such as Shafer and Johnston (2006) have examined the transformation of southern politics in the post-civil rights era, particularly the shift from Democratic to Republican dominance. This shift has been attributed to a variety of factors, including the realignment of party ideologies, the rise of conservative social movements, and the strategic mobilization of racial and cultural issues. These studies have sparked debates over the extent to which southern politics have changed and the implications for national political dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, the recent scholarship on the South in American political development has provided valuable insights into the region's enduring influence on national politics. By challenging the traditional narrative of convergence, these works have highlighted the importance of understanding the South's unique political identity and its impact on American political institutions and policies. However, there are still limitations to this body of work, particularly in terms of its sweeping interpretive claims and foundational premises. Future research should aim to address these limitations by adopting a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to the study of southern politics and its influence on American political development.", "References": [{"title": "Southern Politics in State and Nation", "authors": "V.
