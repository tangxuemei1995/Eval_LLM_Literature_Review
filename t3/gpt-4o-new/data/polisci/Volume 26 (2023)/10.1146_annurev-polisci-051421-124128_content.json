{"Literature Review": "The study of nonviolent resistance has gained significant traction in recent years, with scholars examining the dynamics and outcomes of movements that primarily employ nonviolent tactics. Nonviolent resistance is characterized by the use of protests, strikes, and boycotts to achieve political or social change without the use of physical force. However, the presence of violence within these movements, whether in the form of unarmed collective violence or organized armed action, complicates the analysis of their effectiveness. This literature review explores the role of violence in nonviolent resistance, focusing on the effects of violent flanks on movement outcomes and the directionality of these relationships. \n\nThe concept of nonviolent resistance is rooted in the work of scholars like Gene Sharp, who identified a range of nonviolent tactics that have been employed throughout history (Sharp, 1973). Sharp's framework has been instrumental in understanding how nonviolent movements can exert pressure on regimes and bring about change. However, the presence of violence within these movements, often referred to as 'violent flanks,' poses a challenge to the traditional understanding of nonviolent resistance. \n\nResearch has shown that the presence of violent flanks can have a detrimental effect on the success of nonviolent movements. Chenoweth and Stephan (2011) found that movements that maintain nonviolent discipline are more likely to achieve their goals than those that resort to violence. Their study, which analyzed over 300 campaigns from 1900 to 2006, concluded that nonviolent movements are twice as likely to succeed as violent ones. The presence of violence can undermine the legitimacy of a movement, alienate potential supporters, and provide justification for state repression (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011). \n\nHowever, the effects of unarmed collective violence, such as riots, are more ambiguous. Some scholars argue that such violence can draw attention to a movement's grievances and increase pressure on authorities to negotiate (Tilly, 2003). Others suggest that unarmed violence can lead to increased repression and delegitimize the movement in the eyes of the public (Della Porta, 1995). The impact of unarmed collective violence on movement outcomes is thus context-dependent and influenced by factors such as the political environment, media framing, and the movement's ability to maintain a coherent narrative (Della Porta, 1995; Tilly, 2003). \n\nThe directionality of the relationship between violence and nonviolent resistance is also a subject of debate. Some scholars argue that violence is a response to state repression and the failure of nonviolent tactics to achieve desired outcomes (Davenport, 2007). Others contend that the presence of violence within a movement can be a strategic choice, aimed at increasing leverage over opponents (McAdam, 1983). The decision to employ violence is often influenced by the movement's leadership, organizational structure, and the availability of resources (McAdam, 1983; Davenport, 2007). \n\nMedia framing plays a crucial role in shaping public perception of violent flanks within nonviolent movements. Studies have shown that media coverage can amplify the effects of violence, either by portraying the movement as illegitimate or by highlighting the grievances that led to the violence (Gamson & Wolfsfeld, 1993). The way in which violence is framed can influence public support for the movement and affect its chances of success (Gamson & Wolfsfeld, 1993). \n\nIn conclusion, the presence of violence within nonviolent movements presents a complex challenge for scholars and practitioners alike. While organized armed violence tends to reduce the chances of success for nonviolent movements, the effects of unarmed collective violence are more nuanced and context-dependent. Future research should focus on developing a more precise analytical framework for understanding the role of violence in nonviolent resistance, taking into account factors such as the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity. By doing so, scholars can provide more nuanced insights into the dynamics of nonviolent resistance and the conditions under which it can succeed.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Nonviolent Action", "authors": "Gene Sharp", "journal": "Porter Sargent Publishers", "year": "1973", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", "authors": "Erica Chenoweth, Maria J.
