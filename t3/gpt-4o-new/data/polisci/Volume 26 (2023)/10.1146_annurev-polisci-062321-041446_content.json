{"Literature Review": "The politics of racist dehumanization in the United States is a critical area of study for understanding the enduring nature and impact of racial prejudice. Racist dehumanization involves processes that categorize individuals based on race, often positioning white individuals as fully human and others, particularly Black and Indigenous people, as less than human. This review explores the historical and contemporary dimensions of these processes, emphasizing their role in race-making and the exploitation of racialized groups. \n\nHistorically, the dehumanization of Black and Indigenous people in the United States has been deeply intertwined with colonial and slavery practices. The construction of racial hierarchies was essential for justifying the subjugation and exploitation of these groups. Scholars such as Smith (2012) have argued that the dehumanization of Indigenous people was a fundamental aspect of settler colonialism, which sought to erase Indigenous presence and claim their lands for white settlers. This process involved not only physical violence but also cultural erasure and the imposition of Eurocentric norms (Smith, 2012). \n\nSimilarly, the dehumanization of Black people was central to the institution of slavery. As articulated by Patterson (1982), slavery was not merely an economic system but a social institution that relied on the dehumanization of enslaved Africans to maintain control and justify their exploitation. The legacy of slavery continues to influence racial attitudes today, as the remnants of these dehumanizing ideologies persist in various forms of systemic racism (Patterson, 1982). \n\nIn contemporary society, racist dehumanization manifests in both overt and subtle ways. Research by Goff et al. (2008) highlights how Black individuals are often perceived as more animalistic than their white counterparts, a perception that can influence how they are treated by law enforcement and the criminal justice system. This dehumanization is not only a matter of individual prejudice but is also embedded in institutional practices that disproportionately target and penalize Black communities (Goff et al., 2008). \n\nThe dehumanization of Indigenous people also continues in modern contexts, often through the marginalization and stereotyping of Indigenous cultures. As noted by Wolfe (2006), the logic of elimination that characterized settler colonialism persists in contemporary policies and attitudes that seek to assimilate or erase Indigenous identities. This ongoing dehumanization is evident in the underrepresentation of Indigenous voices in political and social spheres and the continued neglect of Indigenous rights and sovereignty (Wolfe, 2006). \n\nUnderstanding the politics of racist dehumanization requires an examination of how these processes are maintained and reproduced. Bonilla-Silva (2010) argues that color-blind racism, which purports to ignore race while perpetuating racial inequalities, is a modern form of dehumanization. By denying the significance of race, color-blind ideologies obscure the historical and structural factors that contribute to racial disparities, effectively dehumanizing those who are marginalized by these systems (Bonilla-Silva, 2010). \n\nMoreover, the media plays a significant role in perpetuating dehumanizing stereotypes. Dixon and Linz (2000) found that news coverage often portrays Black individuals as criminals, reinforcing negative stereotypes and contributing to public perceptions of Black people as inherently dangerous. This media representation not only dehumanizes Black individuals but also influences public policy and attitudes towards racial justice (Dixon and Linz, 2000). \n\nAddressing the politics of racist dehumanization requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges both historical legacies and contemporary realities. Scholars such as Alexander (2012) emphasize the need for systemic change, arguing that dismantling racist structures requires a comprehensive understanding of how dehumanization operates across different domains. This includes reforming criminal justice systems, challenging media representations, and promoting policies that recognize and address the unique challenges faced by Black and Indigenous communities (Alexander, 2012). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of racist dehumanization offers valuable insights into the persistence of white racial prejudice in the United States. By examining the historical roots and contemporary manifestations of dehumanization, researchers can better understand the mechanisms that sustain racial hierarchies and work towards more equitable and inclusive societies. This approach not only enriches the study of racial attitudes but also provides a framework for addressing the systemic inequalities that continue to affect marginalized groups.", "References": [{"title": "Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples", "authors": "Linda Tuhiwai Smith", "journal": "Zed Books", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study", "authors": "Orlando Patterson", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "1982", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Not Yet Human: Implicit Knowledge, Historical Dehumanization, and Contemporary Consequences", "authors": "Phillip Atiba Goff, Jennifer L.
