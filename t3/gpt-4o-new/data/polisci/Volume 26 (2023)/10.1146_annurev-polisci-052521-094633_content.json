{"Literature Review": "The politics of global health governance have evolved significantly over the past century, reflecting broader geopolitical shifts and the changing nature of health challenges. The literature identifies seven distinct eras in the field, each characterized by different political dynamics and priorities. The first era, rooted in imperialism and colonialism, saw health governance as an extension of state power, with colonial powers imposing health measures to protect their interests and populations (Packard, 2016). This period was marked by a focus on infectious diseases, which were seen as threats to both colonial economies and the health of European settlers. \n\nThe post-World War II era marked a shift towards a more cooperative approach to global health, with the establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948. This period saw the emergence of a state-centered approach to global health governance, with the WHO playing a central role in coordinating international responses to health crises (Brown et al., 2006). However, this approach was often criticized for its focus on infectious diseases and its failure to address broader health system strengthening, which is essential for tackling noncommunicable diseases and other health challenges (Frenk & Moon, 2013).\n\nThe late 20th century saw the emergence of a more cosmopolitan vision of global health, driven by the recognition that health challenges are inherently transnational and require coordinated global responses. This period was characterized by increased attention to health system strengthening and the social determinants of health, as well as a growing recognition of the importance of noncommunicable diseases (Kickbusch, 2000). However, the focus on infectious diseases remained central, particularly in the wake of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which highlighted the need for a more comprehensive approach to global health governance (Piot et al., 2009).\n\nThe early 2000s marked a 'golden age' of global health governance, characterized by an influx of new financing and political attention to addressing HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other infectious diseases. This period saw the establishment of major global health initiatives, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which brought significant resources and attention to global health issues (Buse & Harmer, 2007). However, this period also highlighted the tensions between state-centered approaches and more cosmopolitan visions of global health, as debates continued over the appropriate balance between disease-specific interventions and broader health system strengthening (Garrett, 2007).\n\nThe 2010s saw a growing recognition of the importance of noncommunicable diseases and the need for more integrated approaches to global health governance. This period was marked by increased attention to the social determinants of health and the need for multisectoral approaches to health challenges (Beaglehole et al., 2011). However, the focus on infectious diseases remained central, particularly in the wake of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which highlighted the weaknesses of global health governance and the need for more effective coordination and response mechanisms (Moon et al., 2015).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases in global health governance. The pandemic has highlighted the limitations of existing global health governance structures and the need for more effective coordination and response mechanisms (Gostin & Wiley, 2020). It has also underscored the importance of health system strengthening and the need for more integrated approaches to global health challenges (Horton, 2020). Despite the increased awareness of noncommunicable diseases and the importance of health systems, the pandemic has reinforced the focus on infectious diseases and the central role of states in global health governance.\n\nIn conclusion, the politics of global health governance have evolved significantly over the past century, reflecting broader geopolitical shifts and the changing nature of health challenges. While there has been progress towards more integrated and coordinated approaches to global health, the focus on infectious diseases and the central role of states remain dominant. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for more effective global health governance structures and the importance of health system strengthening in addressing both infectious and noncommunicable diseases.", "References": [{"title": "A History of Global Health: Interventions into the Lives of Other Peoples", "authors": "Randall M.
