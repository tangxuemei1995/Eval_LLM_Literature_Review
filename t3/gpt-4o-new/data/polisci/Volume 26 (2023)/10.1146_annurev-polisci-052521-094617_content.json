{"Literature Review": "Political inequality in rich democracies is a multifaceted issue that has garnered significant scholarly attention. This review examines two primary dimensions of political inequality: participation and representation. Both dimensions are crucial for understanding how democratic processes may be skewed in favor of certain social groups, particularly in the context of rising income inequality and the weakening of collective organizations such as trade unions. \n\nParticipation in democratic processes is a fundamental aspect of political equality. However, research indicates that rising income inequality has exacerbated disparities in political participation. Individuals with fewer resources, such as lower income and education levels, are less likely to engage in political activities compared to their wealthier counterparts (Verba, Schlozman, & Brady, 1995). This participation gap is further widened by the decline of trade unions, which historically served as a mobilizing force for lower-income groups (Rosenfeld, 2014). The weakening of these collective organizations has diminished their capacity to counteract the participation inequality driven by individual resource disparities. \n\nThe relationship between income inequality and political participation is complex. Solt (2008) argues that higher levels of income inequality reduce political engagement among the less affluent, as they perceive the political system to be unresponsive to their needs. This perception of inefficacy discourages participation, creating a vicious cycle where political inequality reinforces economic inequality. Moreover, the decline in union membership and influence has further eroded the political power of lower-income groups, as unions have traditionally played a critical role in advocating for policies that benefit these populations (Western & Rosenfeld, 2011). \n\nIn terms of representation, political inequality manifests in both substantive and descriptive forms. Substantive representation refers to the alignment of policy outcomes with the preferences of the populace, while descriptive representation concerns the extent to which elected officials reflect the demographic characteristics of their constituents. Research consistently shows that the opinions and preferences of decision-makers are more aligned with those of higher-income individuals (Bartels, 2008). This congruence between policymakers and affluent citizens results in policy choices that disproportionately favor the interests of the wealthy, further entrenching political inequality. \n\nThe concept of responsiveness is central to understanding substantive representation. Gilens (2012) demonstrates that policymakers are more responsive to the preferences of affluent citizens, while the preferences of lower-income individuals are often overlooked. This lack of responsiveness to the needs of the less affluent contributes to a growing social distance between rulers and the ruled, undermining the democratic ideal of equal representation. \n\nDescriptive representation also plays a role in political inequality. Studies have shown that when elected officials share demographic characteristics with their constituents, they are more likely to advocate for policies that reflect the interests of those groups (Mansbridge, 1999). However, the underrepresentation of lower-income and minority groups in political offices means that their interests are less likely to be prioritized in policy decisions. This underrepresentation is both a cause and a consequence of political inequality, as it limits the ability of these groups to influence the political agenda. \n\nThe interplay between participation and representation highlights the systemic nature of political inequality in rich democracies. As income inequality rises and collective organizations weaken, the political system becomes increasingly biased in favor of higher-status social groups. This bias not only affects who participates in the political process but also whose interests are represented in policy decisions. Addressing political inequality requires a multifaceted approach that includes strengthening collective organizations, enhancing political engagement among lower-income groups, and ensuring that elected officials are representative of the diverse populations they serve. \n\nIn conclusion, political inequality in rich democracies is a pressing issue that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The disparities in participation and representation are driven by structural factors such as income inequality and the decline of trade unions. To mitigate these inequalities, it is essential to promote policies that enhance political engagement and ensure that the voices of all citizens are heard and represented in the political process.", "References": [{"title": "Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics", "authors": "Sidney Verba, Kay Lehman Schlozman, Henry E.
