{"Literature Review": "The governance of global supply chains has been a focal point of research due to its significant impact on social and environmental outcomes. The traditional literature on supply chain governance has predominantly adopted an actor-centric approach, focusing on the roles and strategies of transnational firms. This approach has provided valuable insights into firm- and nation-level outcomes, but it often overlooks the complex interactions between local, national, and global actors and institutions that influence localized social and environmental outcomes. This literature review aims to explore the existing body of work on supply chain governance, emphasizing the need for a multi-level and multi-actor perspective to better understand the drivers of variation in outcomes across different production sites.\n\nThe concept of supply chain governance has evolved significantly over the years, with early studies primarily focusing on the power dynamics and control mechanisms within supply chains. Gereffi et al. (2005) introduced the concept of global value chains (GVCs), highlighting the role of lead firms in coordinating and controlling production activities across borders. This framework has been instrumental in understanding how governance structures influence economic and social outcomes at the firm and national levels (Gereffi, Humphrey, & Sturgeon, 2005).\n\nHowever, the actor-centric approach has its limitations. It often fails to account for the complex interactions between various actors and institutions at different levels, which can significantly influence localized outcomes. For instance, the role of local governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and community groups in shaping social and environmental outcomes is often underexplored. As a result, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more holistic approach that considers the interplay between multiple actors and levels of governance (Ponte & Sturgeon, 2014).\n\nThe concept of polycentric governance, which emphasizes the importance of multiple centers of decision-making authority, offers a promising framework for understanding the complexity of supply chain governance. Ostrom (2010) argues that polycentric systems can enhance the capacity for collective action and improve the management of common-pool resources. Applying this concept to supply chain governance can help identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers between social and environmental outcomes at different levels (Ostrom, 2010).\n\nRecent studies have begun to explore the implications of polycentric governance for supply chain management. For example, Schouten et al. (2012) examine the role of multi-stakeholder initiatives in promoting sustainable supply chain practices. They find that these initiatives can facilitate collaboration between different actors and levels of governance, leading to improved social and environmental outcomes. Similarly, Fransen and Kolk (2007) highlight the importance of transnational private regulation in shaping supply chain governance, emphasizing the need for coordination between different regulatory frameworks (Fransen & Kolk, 2007).\n\nThe integration of environmental and social considerations into supply chain governance has also gained increasing attention. The concept of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) emphasizes the need to balance economic, social, and environmental objectives. Carter and Rogers (2008) propose a framework for SSCM that incorporates the principles of sustainability into supply chain management practices. This framework highlights the importance of considering the interdependencies between different levels of governance and the potential for synergies between social and environmental outcomes (Carter & Rogers, 2008).\n\nDespite these advancements, there is still a need for more empirical research on the localized social and environmental consequences of networked production. Existing studies often focus on firm-level outcomes, neglecting the broader context in which supply chains operate. For instance, the role of local labor markets, environmental regulations, and cultural norms in shaping supply chain governance is often overlooked. Addressing these gaps requires a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between different actors and levels of governance (Locke, 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on supply chain governance has made significant strides in understanding the roles and strategies of transnational firms. However, there is a growing need for a more comprehensive approach that considers the complex interactions between local, national, and global actors and institutions. By adopting a multi-level and multi-actor perspective, researchers can better understand the drivers of variation in localized social and environmental outcomes and identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers. This approach can ultimately contribute to more effective and sustainable supply chain governance.", "References": [{"title": "The governance of global value chains", "authors": "Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, Timothy Sturgeon", "journal": "Review of International Political Economy", "year": "2005", "volumes": "12", "first page": "78", "last page": "104", "DOI": "10.1080/09692290500049805"}, {"title": "Polycentric systems for coping with collective action and global environmental change", "authors": "Elinor Ostrom", "journal": "Global Environmental Change", "year": "2010", "volumes": "20", "first page": "550", "last page": "557", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.07.004"}, {"title": "Sustainable supply chain management: Theory and practice", "authors": "Craig R.
