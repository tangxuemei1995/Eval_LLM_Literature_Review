{"Literature Review": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet provides a unique geological record of continental crustal growth processes in a collision zone, specifically the India-Asia collision. This region is characterized by an overthickened crust, with a felsic upper layer and a granulite-eclogite lower layer, which has been shaped by magmatic activities spanning from 245 to 10 Ma. The magmatic history of the Gangdese Batholith is marked by three significant flare-ups at 185−170, 90−75, and 55−45 Ma, driven by both external and internal geodynamic factors. These flare-ups are critical in understanding the processes of crustal growth and stabilization in collision zones. \n\nThe magmatic processes in the Gangdese Batholith are initially dominated by fractional crystallization, leading to the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction. This is followed by crustal melting during late-subduction and collision phases, influenced by changes in convergence rates. This accumulation-melting process results in the vertical stratification and density sorting of the crust, a phenomenon observed in other thickened collision zones as well. This process is crucial for the stabilization of continental crust, as it leads to the formation of a stratified crust with a stable felsic upper layer and a denser mafic lower layer (Ducea et al., 2015). \n\nThe Gangdese Batholith's magmatic history is punctuated by three major flare-ups, each associated with distinct tectonic events. The first flare-up at 185−170 Ma is linked to the subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic plate beneath the Lhasa terrane, which initiated the formation of the magmatic arc (Ji et al., 2009). The second flare-up at 90−75 Ma corresponds to the rollback of the subducting slab, which increased the mantle wedge's melting and resulted in extensive magmatism (Zhu et al., 2011). The final flare-up at 55−45 Ma marks the arrival of the Indian plate, leading to crustal thickening and the development of the world's thickest crust, exceeding 70 km after 32 Ma (Kapp et al., 2005). \n\nThe processes observed in the Gangdese Batholith are not unique to southern Tibet but are indicative of a general mechanism of crustal growth and stabilization in collision zones. Similar processes have been documented in other regions, such as the Andes and the North American Cordillera, where magmatic arcs have contributed to crustal thickening and stabilization (DeCelles et al., 2009). These regions also exhibit a pattern of magmatic flare-ups associated with changes in subduction dynamics and crustal thickening, supporting the idea that the accumulation-melting process is a fundamental mechanism in continental crustal evolution. \n\nThe vertical stratification of the crust in the Gangdese Batholith, resulting from the accumulation-melting process, is a key factor in its stabilization. The formation of a felsic upper crust and a mafic lower crust creates a density contrast that enhances the crust's buoyancy and stability (Hacker et al., 2011). This stratification is further reinforced by the emplacement of granitoid intrusions, which contribute to the crust's thermal and mechanical stability (Lee et al., 2006). \n\nIn conclusion, the Gangdese Batholith provides a comprehensive record of continental crustal growth processes in a collision zone. The magmatic history of this region, characterized by three major flare-ups, highlights the importance of the accumulation-melting process in crustal stratification and stabilization. The insights gained from the Gangdese Batholith can be applied to other collision zones, offering a general model for understanding the evolution of continental crust in response to tectonic processes.", "References": [{"title": "The role of arc magmatism in continental crustal evolution: Insights from the Central Andes", "authors": "Ducea, M.
