{"Literature Review": "The exploration of Mars' internal structure through seismology has been a significant milestone in planetary science, primarily facilitated by NASA's InSight mission. The mission, which began in early 2019 and concluded in late 2022, marked the first time that Mars' shallow and deep interiors were explored using seismological methods. The InSight mission's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) has provided unprecedented insights into the Martian subsurface and interior, detecting 1,319 seismic events, including approximately 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances (Banerdt et al., 2020). This review synthesizes the findings from the InSight mission and contextualizes them within the broader field of planetary seismology.\n\nThe detection of marsquakes has been a pivotal achievement of the InSight mission. Prior to this, our understanding of Mars' seismic activity was largely speculative, based on indirect evidence and comparisons with Earth and the Moon. The InSight mission has confirmed that Mars is seismically active, with a significant number of marsquakes originating from the Cerberus Fossae region, indicating active regional tectonics (Giardini et al., 2020). This finding is crucial as it suggests that Mars, like Earth, has ongoing tectonic processes, albeit at a different scale and intensity.\n\nThe seismic data collected by InSight have allowed for the development of the first interior models of Mars. These models have provided estimates of crustal thickness, crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state (Khan et al., 2021). The crust of Mars is found to be thinner than previously thought, with estimates ranging from 20 to 37 kilometers, and it is composed of multiple layers. The mantle structure suggests a relatively simple composition, and the core is believed to be larger and less dense than earlier models predicted, with a radius of approximately 1,830 kilometers (Stähler et al., 2021).\n\nIn addition to marsquakes, the InSight mission has recorded seismic signals from meteorite impacts, providing valuable data on impact dynamics on Mars. These impacts, some of which have created craters larger than 130 meters, have been imaged from orbit, allowing for a direct correlation between seismic data and surface features (Daubar et al., 2022). This capability enhances our understanding of the frequency and effects of impacts on Mars, which is essential for assessing the planet's geological history and potential habitability.\n\nThe InSight mission has also contributed to comparative seismology by enabling the first comparative studies of seismic data from Mars, Earth, and the Moon. This comparison has revealed differences in seismic wave propagation and attenuation, which are influenced by the distinct compositions and structures of these planetary bodies (Lognonné et al., 2020). Such studies are crucial for understanding the geophysical processes that shape terrestrial planets and for refining models of planetary formation and evolution.\n\nThe inversion of seismic travel times and waveforms has been instrumental in constructing Mars' interior model. This technique, which involves analyzing the time it takes for seismic waves to travel through the planet, has provided insights into the planet's internal structure down to the core (Panning et al., 2021). The data suggest that Mars has a partially liquid core, which has implications for its magnetic field history and thermal evolution.\n\nThe InSight mission's findings have significant implications for our understanding of Mars and other terrestrial planets. The confirmation of active tectonics and the detailed interior models challenge previous assumptions about Mars' geological activity and thermal history. These insights are not only crucial for understanding Mars itself but also for informing future missions and the search for life beyond Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the InSight mission has revolutionized our understanding of Mars' internal structure and seismic activity. The data collected have provided the first comprehensive models of Mars' interior, revealing a seismically active planet with a complex internal structure. These findings have broad implications for planetary science, offering new perspectives on the geophysical processes that shape terrestrial planets and informing future exploration efforts.", "References": [{"title": "Initial results from the InSight mission on Mars", "authors": "Banerdt, W.
