{"Literature Review": "The formation of planets through giant impacts is a critical phase in planetary evolution, characterized by energetic collisions that significantly alter the mass, composition, and thermal history of the involved bodies. The giant impact hypothesis, particularly in the context of the Moon's formation, has been a focal point of planetary science, yet it remains a subject of debate and ongoing research. This literature review explores the role of giant impacts in planet formation, examining the theoretical frameworks, simulation methodologies, and experimental approaches that have advanced our understanding of these cataclysmic events. \n\nGiant impacts are believed to be a common occurrence in the late stages of planet formation, as protoplanets collide and coalesce to form larger planetary bodies. These impacts can result in a variety of outcomes, including accretion, erosion, and even the formation of satellite systems. The diversity of these outcomes is influenced by several factors, including the size, velocity, and angle of the colliding bodies, as well as their material properties (Asphaug, 2010). Theoretical models have been developed to predict the conditions under which different outcomes occur, providing a framework for interpreting observational data from planetary systems (Canup, 2004).\n\nComputer simulations have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of giant impacts. These simulations, often informed by laboratory experiments, allow researchers to explore the complex dynamics of collisions in a controlled environment. Advances in computational power and algorithms have enabled the simulation of increasingly detailed scenarios, capturing the intricate interplay of gravitational, thermal, and material forces during an impact (Genda et al., 2012). For instance, simulations have been used to investigate the formation of the Moon, supporting the hypothesis that it resulted from a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized body (Canup & Asphaug, 2001).\n\nDespite these advances, many questions remain unanswered. The formation of the Moon, for example, is still debated, with alternative hypotheses suggesting different impact scenarios or even multiple impacts (Ćuk & Stewart, 2012). The challenge lies in reconciling the isotopic similarities between Earth and the Moon with the expected outcomes of a giant impact, a task that requires further refinement of both theoretical models and simulation techniques.\n\nThe outcomes of giant impacts are not limited to the formation of moons. They can also lead to significant changes in the mass and composition of the colliding bodies. For instance, impacts can strip away a planet's atmosphere or mantle, altering its density and surface conditions (Marcus et al., 2009). In some cases, impacts can result in the complete merger of two bodies, forming a single, larger planet. The probability of such outcomes depends on the relative sizes and velocities of the colliding bodies, as well as the angle of impact (Leinhardt & Stewart, 2012).\n\nThe use of probability theory has become increasingly important in evaluating different formation hypotheses. Given the diverse possible outcomes of giant impacts, it is often difficult to determine the exact sequence of events that led to the formation of a particular planetary system. By applying statistical methods, researchers can assess the likelihood of different scenarios, providing a more nuanced understanding of planetary formation (Kokubo & Genda, 2010).\n\nLaboratory experiments have also contributed to our understanding of giant impacts, providing empirical data to validate and refine theoretical models. These experiments often involve high-velocity impacts between small-scale analogs of planetary materials, allowing researchers to observe the effects of different impact conditions in a controlled setting (Stewart & Leinhardt, 2009). The insights gained from these experiments have been instrumental in improving the accuracy of computer simulations, bridging the gap between theory and observation.\n\nLooking to the future, there are several promising avenues for advancing giant-impact theory. Continued improvements in computational power and simulation techniques will enable more detailed and accurate modeling of impact scenarios. Additionally, the integration of observational data from missions to other planetary systems will provide new opportunities to test and refine existing models. By combining these approaches, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the role of giant impacts in planet formation, shedding light on the complex processes that shape our universe.", "References": [{"title": "Giant impacts and the formation of planetary systems", "authors": "Erik Asphaug", "journal": "Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences", "year": "2010", "volumes": "38", "first page": "113", "last page": "139", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152513"}, {"title": "Simulations of a late lunar-forming impact", "authors": "Robin M.
