{"Literature Review": "The global fight against HIV/AIDS has seen remarkable progress over the past few decades, primarily due to the development and widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART has transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality rates (Palella et al., 1998). The introduction of combination ART in the mid-1990s marked a turning point in the epidemic, leading to a dramatic decline in AIDS-related deaths and new infections (Hammer et al., 1997). Despite these advances, achieving universal access to ART remains a formidable challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of HIV is highest (UNAIDS, 2020).\n\nOne of the key strategies in the global response to HIV is the 90-90-90 targets set by UNAIDS, which aim to diagnose 90% of all HIV-positive individuals, provide ART to 90% of those diagnosed, and achieve viral suppression in 90% of those treated by 2020 (UNAIDS, 2014). While significant progress has been made towards these targets, gaps remain, particularly in the areas of diagnosis and treatment initiation. Late diagnosis and delayed treatment initiation are common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where healthcare infrastructure is often inadequate (Kranzer et al., 2010). Innovative approaches, such as community-based testing and self-testing, have been proposed to increase the uptake of HIV testing and early diagnosis (Johnson et al., 2017).\n\nPediatric and adolescent populations present unique challenges in the context of HIV treatment. Children and adolescents are less likely to be diagnosed and treated compared to adults, and they often face barriers such as stigma, lack of access to healthcare, and difficulties in adhering to treatment regimens (Ferrand et al., 2017). The development of child-friendly formulations and dosing strategies is crucial to improving ART coverage and outcomes in these populations (Penazzato et al., 2015). Furthermore, the transition from pediatric to adult care is a critical period that requires careful management to ensure continuity of care and adherence to treatment (Hazra et al., 2010).\n\nAs the HIV-positive population ages, the management of comorbidities becomes increasingly important. People living with HIV (PLWH) are at higher risk for a range of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and certain cancers, due to both the virus itself and the long-term effects of ART (Deeks et al., 2013). Understanding the interactions between HIV, ART, and these comorbidities is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and improving the quality of life for aging PLWH (Guaraldi et al., 2011). Research into the mechanisms of ART-related toxicities and the development of safer, more tolerable drugs is ongoing (Carr et al., 2010).\n\nThe advent of long-acting antiretrovirals represents a promising development in the field of HIV treatment and prevention. These agents, which can be administered less frequently than daily oral tablets, have the potential to improve adherence and reduce the burden of treatment for PLWH (Margolis et al., 2017). Long-acting formulations are also being explored for use in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), offering a new tool for HIV prevention (Landovitz et al., 2018). However, the implementation of long-acting therapies will require careful consideration of factors such as cost, accessibility, and patient preferences (Orkin et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, achieving universal ART coverage remains a complex challenge. Efforts must continue to focus on improving access to diagnosis and treatment, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents. Additionally, addressing the comorbidities associated with aging in PLWH and exploring new treatment modalities, such as long-acting antiretrovirals, will be crucial in the ongoing effort to control the HIV epidemic. Continued investment in research, healthcare infrastructure, and public health initiatives will be essential to achieving the goal of universal ART access and ultimately ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic.", "References": [{"title": "Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection", "authors": "Palella, F.
