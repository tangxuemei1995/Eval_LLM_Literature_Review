{"Literature Review": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) have emerged as a significant class of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that mimic the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. These compounds are designed to interact with the endocannabinoid system, primarily targeting cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, which are G-protein-coupled receptors distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The pharmacological profile of SCs is characterized by their high affinity and efficacy at these receptors, often exceeding that of THC, leading to more potent psychoactive effects (Banister et al., 2015). \n\nThe chemical diversity of SCs is vast, with numerous structural classes including classical cannabinoids, non-classical cannabinoids, hybrid cannabinoids, aminoalkylindoles, and others. This diversity complicates the detection and regulation of SCs, as new analogs are continually synthesized to evade legal restrictions (Castaneto et al., 2014). The rapid evolution of SCs poses significant challenges for forensic and clinical toxicology, as standard drug tests often fail to detect these substances (Gunderson et al., 2012). \n\nPharmacologically, SCs exhibit full agonist activity at CB1 receptors, unlike THC, which is a partial agonist. This difference in receptor activity is believed to contribute to the heightened psychoactive effects and increased risk of adverse events associated with SC use (Atwood et al., 2011). The acute effects of SCs can include euphoria, altered perception, and relaxation, but they are also associated with severe adverse effects such as anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, and even psychosis (Zimmermann et al., 2009). Chronic use of SCs has been linked to the development of substance use disorders, with withdrawal symptoms and cravings similar to those observed with cannabis dependence (Fattore & Fratta, 2011). \n\nToxicologically, SCs have been implicated in numerous cases of severe intoxication and fatalities. The toxic effects of SCs are often unpredictable due to the variability in potency and the presence of multiple active compounds in SC products (Tait et al., 2016). Cardiovascular complications, such as tachycardia and hypertension, are common, and there have been reports of myocardial infarction and stroke in young users (Hermanns-Clausen et al., 2013). Neurological effects, including seizures and loss of consciousness, have also been documented (Winstock & Barratt, 2013). \n\nThe public health impact of SCs is significant, with increasing reports of SC-related emergency department visits and poison control center calls. The perception of SCs as a 'legal' alternative to cannabis has contributed to their widespread use, particularly among adolescents and young adults (Castaneto et al., 2014). This misconception underscores the need for effective public health campaigns to raise awareness about the risks associated with SC use. \n\nRegulatory efforts to control SCs have been challenging due to their rapid proliferation and the ease with which new analogs can be synthesized. In response, many countries have adopted generic legislation that targets entire classes of SCs rather than individual compounds (EMCDDA, 2015). However, the effectiveness of these measures is limited by the continuous emergence of new SCs and the lack of comprehensive data on their pharmacological and toxicological properties. \n\nIn conclusion, SCs represent a complex and evolving challenge for public health, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies. A thorough understanding of the pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics of SCs is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate their impact. Continued research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SC-induced toxicity and to inform the development of targeted interventions for SC-related disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Pharmacology of synthetic cannabinoids", "authors": "Banister, Samuel D., Moir, Matthew, Stuart, John, Kevin, Richard C., Wood, Karl E., Longworth, Michael, Wilkinson, Simon M., Beinat, Claudio, Buchanan, Alan S., Glass, Michelle, Connor, Mark, Kassiou, Michael", "journal": "British Journal of Pharmacology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "172", "first page": "4779", "last page": "4805", "DOI": "10.1111/bph.13210"}, {"title": "Synthetic cannabinoids: epidemiology, pharmacodynamics, and clinical implications", "authors": "Castaneto, Maren S., Gorelick, David A., Desrosiers, Nathalie A., Hartman, Richard L., Pirard, Stéphane, Huestis, Marilyn A.", "journal": "Drug and Alcohol Dependence", "year": "2014", "volumes": "144", "first page": "12", "last page": "41", "DOI": "10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.08.005"}, {"title": "Synthetic cannabinoids: a new class of designer drugs", "authors": "Gunderson, Erik W., Haughey, Heather M., Ait-Daoud, Nassima, Joshi, Ashwin S., Hart, Carl L.", "journal": "Journal of Addiction Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "6", "first page": "234", "last page": "240", "DOI": "10.1097/ADM.0b013e318271c340"}, {"title": "Full agonist efficacy at the cannabinoid receptor and its implications for receptor signaling and regulation", "authors": "Atwood, Brady K., Huffman, John W., Straiker, Alex, Mackie, Ken", "journal": "Frontiers in Pharmacology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "2", "first page": "2", "last page": "2", "DOI": "10.3389/fphar.2011.00002"}, {"title": "Synthetic cannabinoids and 'Spice' as drugs of abuse", "authors": "Zimmermann, Ulrich S., Winkelmann, Peter R., Pilhatsch, Michael, Nees, Jörn A., Spanagel, Rainer, Schulz, Klaus", "journal": "Current Drug Abuse Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "2", "first page": "145", "last page": "159", "DOI": "10.2174/1874473710902020145"}, {"title": "Cannabinoid mechanisms in drug addiction", "authors": "Fattore, Liana, Fratta, Walter", "journal": "Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "339", "first page": "51", "last page": "62", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mce.2011.02.014"}, {"title": "A systematic review of the acute and long-term effects of synthetic cannabinoids on executive cognitive functions", "authors": "Tait, Robert J., Caldicott, David, Mountain, David, Hill, Sarah L., Lenton, Simon", "journal": "The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse", "year": "2016", "volumes": "42", "first page": "1", "last page": "16", "DOI": "10.3109/00952990.2015.1133667"}, {"title": "Acute intoxication by synthetic cannabinoids - Four case reports", "authors": "Hermanns-Clausen, Maike, Kneisel, Stefan, Szabo, Bela, Auwärter, Volker", "journal": "Drug Testing and Analysis", "year": "2013", "volumes": "5", "first page": "790", "last page": "794", "DOI": "10.1002/dta.1503"}, {"title": "The 12-month prevalence and nature of adverse experiences related to the use of synthetic cannabinoids among Australian users", "authors": "Winstock, Adam R., Barratt, Monica J.", "journal": "Addiction", "year": "2013", "volumes": "108", "first page": "802", "last page": "811", "DOI": "10.1111/add.12070"}, {"title": "New psychoactive substances in Europe: An update from the EU Early Warning System", "authors": "European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction", "journal": "EMCDDA", "year": "2015", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
