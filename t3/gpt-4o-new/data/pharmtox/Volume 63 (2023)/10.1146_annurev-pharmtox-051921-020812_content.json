{"Literature Review": "Air pollution is a pervasive environmental issue that has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including neurotoxicity. The complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and ultrafine particles, poses significant risks to the central nervous system (CNS) across the human lifespan. This literature review explores the current understanding of air pollution-related neurotoxicity, focusing on its impact on neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, and the underlying mechanisms involving inflammation, oxidative stress, and brain metal dyshomeostasis. \n\nEpidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated associations between air pollution exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. For instance, research has shown that prenatal exposure to air pollutants is linked to cognitive deficits and behavioral problems in children (Perera et al., 2019). These findings are supported by animal studies, which have revealed that exposure to particulate matter during critical periods of brain development can lead to alterations in brain structure and function (Allen et al., 2017). The mechanisms underlying these effects are thought to involve inflammation and oxidative stress, which can disrupt normal brain development and lead to long-term cognitive and behavioral impairments. \n\nIn addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, air pollution has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Epidemiological studies have found that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of developing these conditions (Chen et al., 2017). The proposed mechanisms include the induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which can lead to neuronal damage and the accumulation of pathological proteins in the brain (Block et al., 2012). Furthermore, air pollution has been shown to disrupt brain metal homeostasis, which is a critical factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2013). \n\nThe role of specific air pollutants in neurotoxicity is an area of active research. Ultrafine particles, which are capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, have been identified as particularly harmful to the CNS (Oberdörster et al., 2004). These particles can carry adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants, which may contribute to their neurotoxic effects. For example, studies have shown that exposure to ultrafine particles can lead to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in the brain (Levesque et al., 2011). Additionally, PM2.5, a major component of air pollution, has been associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia (Power et al., 2016). \n\nThe concept of brain metal dyshomeostasis has emerged as a key factor in air pollution-related neurotoxicity. Metals such as iron, copper, and zinc play essential roles in brain function, but their dysregulation can lead to neurodegenerative processes (Barnham et al., 2004). Air pollution has been shown to alter metal homeostasis in the brain, potentially contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2013). This disruption may occur through the direct deposition of metal-containing particles in the brain or through systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which can affect metal transport and storage. \n\nFuture research is needed to identify the specific contaminants in air pollution that are responsible for neurotoxicity and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they affect the CNS. This knowledge is critical for developing effective strategies to mitigate the health impacts of air pollution and protect vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly. Additionally, understanding the interactions between air pollution and genetic and environmental factors that influence susceptibility to neurotoxicity will be important for developing personalized approaches to prevention and treatment. \n\nIn conclusion, air pollution is a significant risk factor for neurotoxicity across the lifespan, with implications for both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The shared mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and brain metal dyshomeostasis highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the health impacts of air pollution. Continued research in this area will be essential for protecting public health and improving outcomes for individuals affected by air pollution-related neurotoxicity.", "References": [{"title": "Prenatal exposure to air pollution and childhood behavior: A cohort study", "authors": "Perera, F., Wang, S., Rauh, V., Zhou, H., Stigter, L., Camann, D., Jedrychowski, W.", "journal": "Environmental Health Perspectives", "year": "2019", "volumes": "127", "first page": "57001", "last page": "57001", "DOI": "10.1289/EHP4387"}, {"title": "Developmental neurotoxicity of traffic-related air pollution: Focus on autism", "authors": "Allen, J.
