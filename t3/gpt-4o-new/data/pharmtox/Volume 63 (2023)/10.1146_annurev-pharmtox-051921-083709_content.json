{"Literature Review": "The study of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids has been a burgeoning field of research, particularly over the last few decades. This interest is largely due to the discovery of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and its significant role in various physiological processes. The ECS is composed of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands, and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. The two primary endocannabinoids, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), have been the focus of extensive research due to their involvement in numerous physiological functions, including pain modulation, appetite regulation, and immune response (Di Marzo et al., 1998). \n\nAnandamide was first isolated and characterized in 1992, marking a significant milestone in cannabinoid research (Devane et al., 1992). It acts as a partial agonist at the CB1 receptor, which is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, and to a lesser extent at the CB2 receptor, which is primarily found in peripheral tissues (Pertwee, 2008). Anandamide's role in the modulation of mood, memory, and pain perception has been well-documented, and its dysregulation is implicated in various pathological conditions, including anxiety and depression (Hill et al., 2009). \n\n2-AG, another major endocannabinoid, was identified shortly after anandamide and is present in higher concentrations in the brain (Mechoulam et al., 1995). It acts as a full agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and its physiological roles overlap with those of anandamide, although it is more involved in the regulation of immune function and inflammation (Sugiura et al., 2006). The biosynthesis and degradation pathways of 2-AG and anandamide are distinct, involving different sets of enzymes, which adds complexity to the regulation of the ECS (Piomelli, 2003). \n\nPlant-derived cannabinoids, particularly Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been extensively studied for their therapeutic potential. THC, the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, exerts its effects mainly through CB1 receptor activation, leading to alterations in mood, perception, and cognition (Pertwee, 2008). In contrast, CBD does not produce psychoactive effects and has been shown to modulate the ECS indirectly, possibly by inhibiting the degradation of anandamide and acting on non-cannabinoid receptors (Campos et al., 2012). The therapeutic applications of THC and CBD are diverse, with approved uses in the treatment of conditions such as chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy (Whiting et al., 2015). \n\nDespite the progress in understanding plant cannabinoids, the pharmacology of endogenous cannabinoids and anandamide-like compounds in humans remains less explored. These compounds, often referred to as endocannabinoid-like molecules, include N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA), virodhamine, and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), among others. They share structural similarities with anandamide and 2-AG but have distinct receptor affinities and physiological roles (Di Marzo et al., 2001). For instance, OEA is known to regulate feeding behavior and energy metabolism through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) rather than cannabinoid receptors (Fu et al., 2003). \n\nThe therapeutic potential of modulating the ECS is vast, yet challenges remain in translating preclinical findings into clinical applications. The complexity of the ECS, with its diverse ligands and receptors, necessitates a nuanced approach to drug development. Moreover, the psychoactive effects of THC pose limitations for its use, highlighting the need for non-psychoactive alternatives like CBD and other endocannabinoid-like compounds (Izzo et al., 2009). \n\nIn conclusion, the chemistry and pharmacology of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids represent a rich area of research with significant implications for human health. While plant cannabinoids like THC and CBD have established therapeutic roles, the full potential of endogenous cannabinoids and related compounds is yet to be realized. Continued research in this field promises to uncover new insights into the ECS and its role in health and disease, offering hope for novel therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Endocannabinoids and their pharmacological actions", "authors": "Di Marzo, V., Bifulco, M., De Petrocellis, L.", "journal": "Trends in Pharmacological Sciences", "year": "1998", "volumes": "19", "first page": "537", "last page": "542", "DOI": "10.1016/S0165-6147(98)01275-7"}, {"title": "Isolation and structure of a brain constituent that binds to the cannabinoid receptor", "authors": "Devane, W.
