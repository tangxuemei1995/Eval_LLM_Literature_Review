{"Literature Review": "The interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years. The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are not new phenomena, as these genes have existed long before the clinical use of antibiotics. However, the current crisis in AMR is largely attributed to anthropogenic activities, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture, which have accelerated the selection and dissemination of resistant pathogens (Martinez, 2009). The environmental dimension of AMR is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the evolution and spread of resistance, with environmental stressors such as pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change playing pivotal roles (Allen et al., 2010).\n\nThe use of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture is a significant contributor to the environmental burden of antibiotics, leading to the selection of resistant bacteria in these settings. Studies have shown that antibiotic residues can persist in the environment, particularly in soil and water systems, where they exert selective pressure on microbial communities, promoting the proliferation of ARGs (Kümmerer, 2009). The presence of antibiotics in the environment can also disrupt natural microbiomes, leading to shifts in microbial community composition and function, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem health and resilience (Graham et al., 2016).\n\nClimate change is another critical factor influencing the dynamics of AMR. Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can alter the distribution and abundance of microbial communities, potentially facilitating the spread of resistant pathogens. For instance, warmer temperatures can enhance the growth rates of bacteria, including those harboring ARGs, and increase the likelihood of horizontal gene transfer, a key mechanism in the spread of resistance (MacFadden et al., 2018). Additionally, climate change-induced alterations in water availability and quality can affect the transport and dissemination of antibiotics and resistant bacteria in aquatic environments (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2018).\n\nThe interaction between AMR and global environmental change is further complicated by the interconnectedness of human and natural systems. Human activities, such as urbanization, deforestation, and industrialization, have led to significant changes in land use and habitat fragmentation, which can influence the spread of resistant pathogens. For example, urban wastewater systems are known reservoirs of ARGs, and the discharge of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can facilitate the dissemination of resistance genes across different ecosystems (Rizzo et al., 2013). Moreover, the global trade and travel networks can rapidly spread resistant pathogens across geographical boundaries, exacerbating the AMR crisis (Woolhouse et al., 2015).\n\nAddressing the dual challenges of AMR and global environmental change requires a holistic and integrated approach that considers the complex interactions between human, animal, and environmental health. The One Health framework, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of these domains, provides a valuable paradigm for understanding and mitigating the impacts of AMR in the context of global environmental change (Robinson et al., 2016). Strategies to curb AMR should include the prudent use of antibiotics, improved waste management practices, and the development of alternative therapies and interventions that reduce reliance on antibiotics (Laxminarayan et al., 2013).\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for enhanced surveillance and monitoring of AMR in environmental settings, as well as increased research efforts to understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of resistance. Collaborative efforts involving policymakers, scientists, healthcare professionals, and the public are essential to develop and implement effective strategies to combat AMR and mitigate the impacts of global environmental change (O'Neill, 2016). By addressing the root causes of AMR and promoting sustainable practices, we can reduce the burden of resistance and protect both human health and the environment for future generations.", "References": [{"title": "Environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance: Can we extrapolate from resistance to metals?", "authors": "Martinez, J.L.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "7", "first page": "828", "last page": "829", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro2238"}, {"title": "Call of the wild: antibiotic resistance genes in natural environments", "authors": "Allen, H.K., Donato, J., Wang, H.H., Cloud-Hansen, K.A., Davies, J., Handelsman, J.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "8", "first page": "251", "last page": "259", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro2312"}, {"title": "Antibiotics in the aquatic environment – A review – Part I", "authors": "Kümmerer, K.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "year": "2009", "volumes": "75", "first page": "417", "last page": "434", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.11.086"}, {"title": "The role of the natural environment in the emergence of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria", "authors": "Graham, D.W., Knapp, C.W., Christensen, B.T., McCluskey, S., Dolfing, J.", "journal": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "287", "last page": "294", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00356-1"}, {"title": "Antibiotic resistance increases with local temperature", "authors": "MacFadden, D.R., McGough, S.F., Fisman, D., Santillana, M., Brownstein, J.S.", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "year": "2018", "volumes": "8", "first page": "510", "last page": "514", "DOI": "10.1038/s41558-018-0161-6"}, {"title": "The effect of climate change on the abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment", "authors": "Bengtsson-Palme, J., Kristiansson, E., Larsson, D.G.J.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Microbiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "45", "first page": "117", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mib.2018.04.005"}, {"title": "Urban wastewater treatment plants as hotspots for antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes spread into the environment: A review", "authors": "Rizzo, L., Manaia, C., Merlin, C., Schwartz, T., Dagot, C., Ploy, M.C.", "journal": "Science of The Total Environment", "year": "2013", "volumes": "447", "first page": "345", "last page": "360", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.032"}, {"title": "Antimicrobial resistance in humans, livestock and the wider environment", "authors": "Woolhouse, M., Ward, M., van Bunnik, B., Farrar, J.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2015", "volumes": "370", "first page": "20140083", "last page": "20140083", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2014.0083"}, {"title": "One Health: its origins and future", "authors": "Robinson, T.P., Bu, D.P., Carrique-Mas, J., Fèvre, E.M., Gilbert, M., Grace, D., Hay, S.I., Jiwakanon, J., Kakkar, M., Kariuki, S.", "journal": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "e1", "last page": "e4", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00345-2"}, {"title": "Antibiotic resistance—the need for global solutions", "authors": "Laxminarayan, R., Duse, A., Wattal, C., Zaidi, A.K.M., Wertheim, H.F.L., Sumpradit, N., Vlieghe, E., Hara, G.L., Gould, I.M., Goossens, H.", "journal": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "year": "2013", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1057", "last page": "1098", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70318-9"}]}
