{"Literature Review": "Environmental justice (EJ) has emerged as a critical field of study and activism, addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities. The concept of EJ gained prominence in the 1980s, with the recognition that low-income and minority communities often bear the brunt of environmental hazards, a phenomenon termed 'environmental racism' (Bullard, 1993). This literature review explores the evolution of EJ, its coalitional nature, its interaction with formal institutions, and its influence on scientific research, while also considering future directions for the field. \n\nThe coalitional nature of EJ activism is a defining characteristic. EJ activists have historically formed alliances with a diverse array of stakeholders, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, and environmental groups. These coalitions are essential for amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and for exerting pressure on policymakers (Pellow, 2000). However, these alliances are not without challenges. Differences in priorities and strategies can lead to tensions within coalitions, necessitating careful negotiation and compromise (Cole & Foster, 2001). Despite these challenges, the coalitional approach has been instrumental in advancing EJ goals, as it allows for a broader base of support and resources. \n\nEngagement with formal institutions, such as courts and regulatory agencies, is another critical aspect of EJ activism. Legal frameworks have been both a tool and a barrier for EJ claims. The landmark case of Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management Corp. in 1979 marked one of the first instances where environmental racism was addressed in court, setting a precedent for future litigation (Bullard, 1993). However, the success of EJ claims in courts has been mixed, with many cases dismissed due to the difficulty of proving intentional discrimination (Konisky, 2009). Regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have also played a role in addressing EJ concerns. The establishment of the Office of Environmental Justice within the EPA in 1992 signaled a commitment to integrating EJ into federal policy (Schlosberg, 2007). Yet, the effectiveness of these efforts has been questioned, with critics arguing that regulatory agencies often lack the resources and political will to enforce EJ policies effectively (Holifield, 2001). \n\nScientific research has been significantly influenced by EJ, particularly in the areas of public health and environmental science. Studies have documented the health disparities faced by communities exposed to environmental hazards, highlighting the intersection of environmental and racial justice (Morello-Frosch et al., 2002). This body of research has been crucial in providing empirical evidence to support EJ claims and in shaping public policy. Moreover, EJ has encouraged a more participatory approach to research, involving community members in the research process to ensure that their concerns and knowledge are incorporated (Corburn, 2005). This shift towards community-based participatory research has been instrumental in democratizing the production of scientific knowledge and in empowering communities to advocate for their rights. \n\nLooking to the future, several trends and challenges are likely to shape the trajectory of EJ. One is the changing nature of EJ coalitions. As the field expands, there is a risk of fragmentation, both within EJ and between EJ and other related fields, such as climate justice and health advocacy (Schlosberg & Collins, 2014). This fragmentation could weaken the collective power of EJ movements, underscoring the need for continued coalition-building and collaboration. Another challenge is addressing the historical roots of environmental injustice. Understanding the historical context of EJ is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat it, as it reveals the structural and systemic factors that perpetuate environmental inequalities (Pulido, 2000). Finally, there are opportunities for a stronger infusion of the EJ lens into other areas of research and policy. By integrating EJ principles into broader discussions of sustainability and resilience, scholars and activists can ensure that equity and justice remain central to environmental decision-making (Agyeman et al., 2002). \n\nIn conclusion, environmental justice is a dynamic and multifaceted field that continues to evolve in response to new challenges and opportunities. Its coalitional nature, engagement with formal institutions, and influence on scientific research have been instrumental in advancing its goals. As the field moves forward, it will be essential to address the challenges of fragmentation and historical injustice, while also seizing opportunities to integrate EJ principles into broader environmental and social justice movements.", "References": [{"title": "Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices from the Grassroots", "authors": "Robert D.
