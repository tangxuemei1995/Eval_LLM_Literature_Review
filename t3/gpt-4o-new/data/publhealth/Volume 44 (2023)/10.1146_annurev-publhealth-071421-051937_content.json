{"Literature Review": "The intersection of climate change and health care is a burgeoning field of research, driven by the increasing recognition of climate change as a significant threat to global health. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing health vulnerabilities and challenging the capacity of health systems to provide continuous, high-quality care (Watts et al., 2018). The health care sector itself is a notable contributor to climate change, responsible for approximately 4.4% of global net emissions (Karliner et al., 2019). Thus, the dual challenge for health care systems is to adapt to the impacts of climate change while simultaneously reducing their own carbon footprint.\n\nAdaptation strategies in health care systems are critical to enhancing resilience against climate-related disruptions. These strategies include improving infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, developing emergency preparedness plans, and ensuring the continuity of care during disasters (Ebi et al., 2018). For instance, hospitals and clinics can be designed or retrofitted to be more energy-efficient and resilient to flooding, heatwaves, and other climate-related events (Chowdhury et al., 2019). Additionally, the integration of climate change considerations into health care planning and policy is essential for building resilient health systems (Haines et al., 2019).\n\nEmergency preparedness is a key component of resilient health care systems. Health care facilities must be equipped to respond to the increased frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves (Paterson et al., 2014). This includes having robust disaster response plans, adequate supplies, and trained personnel to manage emergencies effectively. Moreover, health care systems should engage in community-based resilience planning, which involves collaborating with local governments, non-governmental organizations, and community members to develop comprehensive emergency response strategies (Runkle et al., 2018).\n\nSupply chain resilience is another critical aspect of sustainable health care in the face of climate change. Disruptions to supply chains can have severe consequences for health care delivery, particularly during emergencies (McKinnon, 2018). Health care systems must diversify their supply sources, maintain strategic stockpiles of essential medical supplies, and develop contingency plans to ensure the availability of critical resources during climate-related disruptions (Thompson et al., 2018). Furthermore, the adoption of sustainable procurement practices can reduce the environmental impact of health care supply chains and contribute to overall system sustainability (Practice Greenhealth, 2019).\n\nDespite the clear need for adaptation and mitigation strategies, several barriers hinder the transition to sustainable and resilient health care systems. Financial constraints, lack of awareness, and insufficient policy support are significant obstacles (Xie et al., 2018). Health care facilities often operate on tight budgets, making it challenging to invest in sustainable infrastructure and technologies. Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness and education among health care professionals and policymakers about the impacts of climate change on health and the importance of sustainable practices (Watts et al., 2018).\n\nPolicy interventions are crucial to overcoming these barriers and facilitating the transition to sustainable health care systems. Governments can play a pivotal role by providing financial incentives, setting regulatory standards, and supporting research and innovation in sustainable health care practices (Haines et al., 2019). International collaboration and knowledge sharing are also essential for developing effective strategies and solutions to address the global challenge of climate change in health care (Ebi et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the health care sector must take proactive steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change while reducing its own environmental footprint. This requires a multifaceted approach that includes infrastructure improvements, emergency preparedness, supply chain resilience, and policy support. By addressing these challenges, health care systems can become more sustainable and resilient, ultimately improving health outcomes in the face of a changing climate.", "References": [{"title": "The 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: shaping the health of nations for centuries to come", "authors": "Watts, Nick; Amann, Markus; Arnell, Nigel; Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja; Belesova, Kristine; Berry, Helen; Bouley, Timothy; Boykoff, Maxwell; Byass, Peter; Cai, Wenjia", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2018", "volumes": "392", "first page": "2479", "last page": "2514", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32594-7"}, {"title": "Health care's climate footprint: How the health sector contributes to the global climate crisis and opportunities for action", "authors": "Karliner, Joshua; Slotterback, Scott; Boyd, Robert; Ashby, Benjamin; Steele, Kim", "journal": "Health Care Without Harm", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Adaptation and resilience in the context of climate change and health", "authors": "Ebi, Kristie L.; Anderson, Virginia; Berry, Peter; Paterson, Jaclyn; Yusa, Aki", "journal": "Climate Change and Health", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-814447-3.00007-5"}, {"title": "Climate change and health: Impacts and adaptation", "authors": "Haines, Andy; Ebi, Kristie L.", "journal": "Health Affairs", "year": "2019", "volumes": "38", "first page": "2056", "last page": "2062", "DOI": "10.1377/hlthaff.2019.01035"}, {"title": "Building climate-resilient health systems: A framework for action", "authors": "Chowdhury, Md.
