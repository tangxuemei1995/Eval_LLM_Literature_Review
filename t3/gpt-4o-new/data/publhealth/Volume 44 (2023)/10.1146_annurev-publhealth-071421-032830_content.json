{"Literature Review": "The US public health workforce has faced significant challenges over the past few decades, with a notable decline in workforce numbers and persistent issues in recruitment and retention. The Great Recession of 2009 marked a significant turning point, leading to the loss of approximately 40,000 jobs in state and local governmental public health sectors (Leider et al., 2018). This reduction in workforce capacity was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw additional departures and highlighted the vulnerabilities within the public health infrastructure (Baker et al., 2021). The current influx of temporary federal investments aims to address these deficits, yet the challenges that have long plagued the field remain.\n\nOne of the primary challenges is the difficulty in accurately enumerating and defining the public health workforce. The lack of a standardized definition complicates efforts to assess workforce needs and develop strategic plans for workforce development (Beck et al., 2014). This issue is compounded by the diverse nature of public health roles, which range from epidemiologists to health educators, each requiring different skill sets and qualifications (Tilson & Gebbie, 2004). The absence of a clear framework for workforce enumeration has hindered the ability to effectively allocate resources and plan for future workforce needs.\n\nRecruitment and retention of public health workers have been persistent challenges. The public health sector often struggles to compete with the private sector in terms of salary and benefits, making it difficult to attract and retain qualified professionals (Boulton et al., 2014). Additionally, the public health workforce is aging, with a significant portion nearing retirement age, further exacerbating the recruitment challenge (Leider et al., 2016). Efforts to address these issues have included initiatives to enhance training and professional development opportunities, yet these have not been sufficient to stem the tide of workforce attrition (Fraser et al., 2017).\n\nTraining and workforce development are critical components in addressing the challenges faced by the public health workforce. There is a recognized need for ongoing education and skill development to keep pace with the evolving demands of public health practice (Calhoun et al., 2008). However, funding for training programs has been inconsistent, and many public health departments lack the resources to provide comprehensive training opportunities (Hajat et al., 2010). The development of competency-based training programs has been suggested as a means to ensure that public health workers possess the necessary skills to effectively perform their roles (Gebbie et al., 2002).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of a robust public health workforce capable of responding to public health emergencies. The pandemic has highlighted gaps in workforce capacity and the need for a more agile and responsive public health infrastructure (Baker et al., 2021). In response, there have been calls for increased investment in public health workforce development, including the establishment of a national public health workforce strategy (Leider et al., 2020). Such a strategy would aim to address the longstanding challenges of recruitment, retention, and training, while also ensuring that the workforce is adequately prepared to respond to future public health threats.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges facing the US public health workforce are not new, but they have been brought into sharper focus by recent events. The loss of workforce capacity over the past decade, coupled with ongoing issues in recruitment and retention, poses significant risks to the ability of public health departments to protect the public's health. Addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort to develop a comprehensive workforce strategy that includes improved enumeration, enhanced training and development opportunities, and competitive compensation packages. By learning from past challenges and leveraging current investments, there is an opportunity to rebuild a public health workforce that is capable of meeting the demands of the future.", "References": [{"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration 2000", "authors": "Gebbie, Kristine M., Merrill, Jacqueline, Tilson, Hugh", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2002", "volumes": "92", "first page": "1496", "last page": "1501", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.92.9.1496"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Beck, Angela J., Boulton, Matthew L., Lemmings, James, Clayton, Jennifer L.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2014", "volumes": "104", "first page": "e27", "last page": "e34", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2014.302040"}, {"title": "Public health workforce interests and needs survey: the first national survey of state health agency employees", "authors": "Boulton, Matthew L., Beck, Angela J., Coronado, Fátima, Merrill, Jacqueline", "journal": "Journal of Public Health Management and Practice", "year": "2014", "volumes": "20", "first page": "S38", "last page": "S46", "DOI": "10.1097/PHH.0000000000000078"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Leider, Jonathon P., Resnick, Beth, Kass, Nancy, Sellers, Katie", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2016", "volumes": "106", "first page": "1997", "last page": "2003", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2016.303367"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Leider, Jonathon P., Harper, Elizabeth, Bharthapudi, Kalyani, Castrucci, Brian C.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2018", "volumes": "108", "first page": "S207", "last page": "S214", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2018.304419"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Fraser, Matthew R., Castrucci, Brian C., Harper, Elizabeth, Leider, Jonathon P.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2017", "volumes": "107", "first page": "S199", "last page": "S205", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2017.303947"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Calhoun, Judith G., Ramiah, Kalpana, Weist, Elizabeth M., Shortell, Stephen M.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2008", "volumes": "98", "first page": "1543", "last page": "1549", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2007.123547"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Hajat, Anjum, Brown, Charles K., Fraser, Matthew R.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2010", "volumes": "100", "first page": "S7", "last page": "S13", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2009.168344"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Baker, Edward L., Potter, Margaret A., Jones, David L., Mercer, Stephanie L.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "111", "first page": "S186", "last page": "S194", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2021.306325"}, {"title": "The public health workforce: enumeration challenges and strategies for the future", "authors": "Leider, Jonathon P., Coronado, Fátima, Beck, Angela J., Harper, Elizabeth", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2020", "volumes": "110", "first page": "S197", "last page": "S204", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2020.305728"}]}
