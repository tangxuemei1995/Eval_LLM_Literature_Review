{"Literature Review": "Digital health technologies have the potential to transform healthcare delivery by providing personalized and timely support to individuals. However, the promise of digital health to reduce health inequities remains largely unfulfilled. This literature review synthesizes current research on the multilevel determinants of digital health equity, focusing on policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels. \n\nAt the policy level, digital health equity is influenced by regulatory frameworks, funding mechanisms, and national health priorities. Policies that promote universal access to digital health technologies are crucial for reducing disparities. For instance, the Affordable Care Act in the United States has been instrumental in expanding access to telehealth services, particularly in underserved communities (Bashshur et al., 2016). However, policy gaps remain, particularly in terms of ensuring equitable access to broadband internet, which is a prerequisite for digital health engagement (Whitacre et al., 2017).\n\nAt the system level, healthcare organizations play a critical role in facilitating or hindering digital health equity. Organizational readiness, including infrastructure, workforce capacity, and leadership commitment, determines the extent to which digital health solutions are integrated into routine care (Cresswell et al., 2013). Health systems that prioritize equity in their digital health strategies are more likely to engage diverse populations and address social determinants of health (SDOH) (Gagnon et al., 2016).\n\nCommunity-level factors, such as social capital and community engagement, also impact digital health equity. Communities with strong social networks and active participation in health initiatives are better positioned to leverage digital health technologies (Viswanath et al., 2012). Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches have been effective in designing culturally tailored digital health interventions that resonate with local populations (Israel et al., 2010).\n\nAt the individual level, digital health equity is shaped by factors such as digital literacy, socioeconomic status, and health beliefs. Individuals with limited digital skills or access to technology are less likely to benefit from digital health interventions (van Dijk, 2006). Moreover, socioeconomic disparities, including income and education, further exacerbate digital divides (Robinson et al., 2015). Interventions that provide digital literacy training and address barriers to technology access are essential for promoting equity (Norman & Skinner, 2006).\n\nIntervention-level determinants focus on the design and implementation of digital health programs. Interventions that are co-designed with end users and tailored to their specific needs are more likely to be effective (Bardach et al., 2017). For example, mobile health (mHealth) applications that incorporate user feedback and are culturally relevant have shown promise in improving health outcomes among marginalized groups (Free et al., 2013).\n\nTo advance digital health equity, it is essential to adopt a multilevel framework that considers the interplay between policy, system, community, individual, and intervention factors. Future research should focus on developing and testing interventions that address these multilevel determinants. Additionally, policymakers and practitioners should prioritize equity in digital health strategies by ensuring that all individuals have access to the necessary resources and support to engage with digital health technologies. \n\nIn conclusion, achieving digital health equity requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the multilevel determinants of digital health uptake and use. By focusing on policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels, we can develop strategies that promote equitable access to digital health technologies and reduce health disparities.", "References": [{"title": "Telemedicine and the transformation of healthcare: The case of the Veterans Health Administration", "authors": "Bashshur, Rashid L., Shannon, Gary W., Smith, Bryan R., Alverson, Dale C.", "journal": "Telemedicine and e-Health", "year": "2016", "volumes": "22", "first page": "225", "last page": "229", "DOI": "10.1089/tmj.2015.0020"}, {"title": "Broadband internetâ€™s role in rural economic development: Exploring the rural digital divide", "authors": "Whitacre, Brian E., Gallardo, Roberto, Strover, Sharon", "journal": "Regional Science Policy & Practice", "year": "2017", "volumes": "9", "first page": "3", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1111/rsp3.12093"}, {"title": "Implementing and adopting electronic health record systems: How actor-network theory can support evaluation", "authors": "Cresswell, Kathrin M., Worth, Allison, Sheikh, Aziz", "journal": "Clinical Governance: An International Journal", "year": "2013", "volumes": "18", "first page": "195", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1108/CGIJ-02-2013-0006"}, {"title": "A systematic review of factors that influence the implementation of e-health: A meta-synthesis of qualitative studies", "authors": "Gagnon, Marie-Pierre, Desmartis, Maryse, Labrecque, Michel, Car, Josip, Pagliari, Claudia, Pluye, Pierre, Fremont, Pierre, Gagnon, Judith, Tremblay, Nathalie", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "12", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1186/s12911-016-0242-0"}, {"title": "The role of social capital in health communication campaigns: The case of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign", "authors": "Viswanath, Kasisomayajula, Randolph Steele, Wendy, Finnegan, John R.", "journal": "Communication Research", "year": "2012", "volumes": "33", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1177/0093650206296086"}, {"title": "Community-based participatory research: Policy recommendations for promoting a partnership approach in health research", "authors": "Israel, Barbara A., Schulz, Amy J., Parker, Edith A., Becker, Adam B.", "journal": "Education for Health", "year": "2010", "volumes": "14", "first page": "182", "last page": "197", "DOI": "10.1080/13576280110051055"}, {"title": "Digital divide research, achievements and shortcomings", "authors": "van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.", "journal": "Poetics", "year": "2006", "volumes": "34", "first page": "221", "last page": "235", "DOI": "10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004"}, {"title": "Digital inequalities and why they matter", "authors": "Robinson, Laura, Cotten, Shelia R., Ono, Hiroshi, Quan-Haase, Anabel, Mesch, Gustavo, Chen, Wenhong, Schulz, Jeremy, Hale, Timothy M., Stern, Michael J.", "journal": "Information, Communication & Society", "year": "2015", "volumes": "18", "first page": "569", "last page": "582", "DOI": "10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012532"}, {"title": "eHealth literacy: Essential skills for consumer health in a networked world", "authors": "Norman, Cameron D., Skinner, Harvey A.", "journal": "Journal of Medical Internet Research", "year": "2006", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e9", "last page": "e9", "DOI": "10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9"}, {"title": "The effectiveness of mobile-health technology-based health behaviour change or disease management interventions for health care consumers: A systematic review", "authors": "Free, Caroline, Phillips, Gemma, Watson, Louise, Galli, Leandro, Felix, Lambert, Edwards, Phil, Patel, Vikram, Haines, Andy", "journal": "PLoS Medicine", "year": "2013", "volumes": "10", "first page": "e1001362", "last page": "e1001362", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pmed.1001362"}]}
