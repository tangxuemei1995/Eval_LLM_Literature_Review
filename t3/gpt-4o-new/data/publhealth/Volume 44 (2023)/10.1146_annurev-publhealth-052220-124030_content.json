{"Literature Review": "Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a significant proportion of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. The concept of the population attributable fraction (PAF) is central to this understanding, as it quantifies the proportion of cancer cases that could be prevented by eliminating exposure to a specific risk factor. This literature review explores the associations between modifiable risk factors and cancer, highlighting both successful and suboptimal prevention efforts. \n\nTobacco smoking is one of the most well-documented modifiable risk factors for cancer. It is responsible for approximately 22% of cancer deaths globally, with lung cancer being the most affected (World Health Organization, 2020). The link between smoking and cancer was first established in the mid-20th century, and subsequent research has consistently reinforced this association (Doll & Hill, 1950). Despite the clear evidence, smoking cessation efforts have met with mixed success. Policies such as taxation, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions have led to significant reductions in smoking rates in some countries (Jha et al., 2013). However, global smoking prevalence remains high, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where tobacco control measures are less stringent (Ng et al., 2014).\n\nOccupational exposures also contribute significantly to cancer risk. Industries such as mining, construction, and manufacturing expose workers to carcinogens like asbestos, benzene, and formaldehyde. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified these substances as Group 1 carcinogens, indicating sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans (IARC, 2012). Efforts to reduce occupational cancer risk have included regulatory measures to limit exposure and improve workplace safety. However, enforcement of these regulations varies widely, and many workers, particularly in developing countries, remain at risk (Rushton et al., 2012).\n\nInfections are another modifiable risk factor for cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Helicobacter pylori are among the most significant infectious agents linked to cancer (Plummer et al., 2016). Vaccination programs, such as those for HPV, have shown promise in reducing infection rates and, consequently, the incidence of related cancers (Drolet et al., 2015). However, vaccine coverage is uneven, and access remains limited in many parts of the world, hindering the full potential of these preventive measures (Bruni et al., 2016).\n\nAir pollution is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for cancer, particularly lung cancer. The IARC has classified outdoor air pollution as a Group 1 carcinogen, with particulate matter (PM) being a major component (Loomis et al., 2013). Efforts to reduce air pollution have included regulatory measures to limit emissions from industrial and vehicular sources. While these measures have led to improvements in air quality in some regions, global air pollution levels remain high, and the burden of disease attributable to air pollution continues to rise (Cohen et al., 2017).\n\nAlcohol consumption is another well-established risk factor for cancer, linked to cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colorectum, and breast (Bagnardi et al., 2015). Public health strategies to reduce alcohol-related cancer risk have included taxation, advertising restrictions, and public education campaigns. However, the effectiveness of these measures is often limited by cultural and social factors that influence drinking behavior (Rehm et al., 2010).\n\nDiet and obesity are also significant contributors to cancer risk. Diets high in red and processed meats, low in fruits and vegetables, and high in caloric intake are associated with increased cancer risk (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research, 2018). Obesity is linked to several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer (Lauby-Secretan et al., 2016). Efforts to promote healthy eating and physical activity have had limited success, with obesity rates continuing to rise globally (Ng et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in identifying modifiable risk factors for cancer, translating this knowledge into effective prevention strategies remains challenging. Successes in tobacco control and vaccination programs demonstrate the potential for reducing cancer burden through targeted interventions. However, the persistence of high-risk behaviors and exposures highlights the need for comprehensive, multi-faceted approaches that address the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. Continued research is essential to refine our understanding of cancer etiology and to develop innovative strategies for prevention.", "References": [{"title": "Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors", "authors": "Doll, R., Hill, A.
