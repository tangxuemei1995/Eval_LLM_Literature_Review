{"Literature Review": "The discourse surrounding physical activity has predominantly been shaped by research and practices originating from high-income countries (HICs), where the emphasis has been on choice-based models of physical activity. This model assumes that individuals have the autonomy to choose when, where, and how they engage in physical activity, often for leisure or health benefits. However, this perspective does not adequately capture the reality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where physical activity is often driven by necessity rather than choice. In LMICs, physical activity is frequently a byproduct of daily survival activities, such as walking long distances for water, work, or other essential tasks (Bauman et al., 2012). This literature review explores the necessity versus choice framework in understanding physical activity in LMICs and its implications for public health research and promotion.\n\nThe necessity-based model of physical activity in LMICs is characterized by activities that are integral to daily living and economic survival. For instance, active transport, such as walking or cycling, is often the primary mode of transportation due to the lack of affordable and accessible public transport options (Sallis et al., 2016). This contrasts with HICs, where active transport is often a lifestyle choice aimed at improving health or reducing environmental impact. In LMICs, the necessity-driven physical activity is not only a means of transportation but also a critical component of occupational activities, particularly in agricultural and informal sectors (Guthold et al., 2018).\n\nThe implications of this necessity-driven model are significant for public health initiatives. Traditional interventions that promote physical activity as a leisure activity may not be applicable or effective in LMICs, where the primary concern is often the improvement of conditions under which necessity-driven activities occur. For example, ensuring safe and accessible routes for walking and cycling can enhance the quality of necessity-driven physical activity and reduce associated health risks (Hallal et al., 2012). Moreover, public health policies should aim to integrate physical activity into daily life in a way that is culturally and contextually relevant, rather than imposing models developed in HICs (Pratt et al., 2012).\n\nThe necessity versus choice framework also highlights issues of health equity and social justice. In many LMICs, the burden of necessity-driven physical activity falls disproportionately on marginalized groups, including women and low-income populations, who may have limited access to resources and opportunities for leisure-based physical activity (Kohl et al., 2012). Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the social determinants of health and aims to create environments that support both necessity-driven and choice-based physical activity (Bull et al., 2020).\n\nFurthermore, the promotion of physical activity in LMICs should not only focus on increasing levels of activity but also on improving the conditions under which it occurs. This includes addressing infrastructural barriers, such as poor road conditions and lack of pedestrian pathways, as well as social barriers, such as safety concerns and cultural norms that may restrict certain groups from engaging in physical activity (Trost et al., 2014). By improving these conditions, public health initiatives can enhance the health benefits of necessity-driven physical activity and promote greater equity in physical activity opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, the necessity versus choice framework provides a valuable lens for understanding physical activity in LMICs. It underscores the importance of contextually relevant public health strategies that recognize the unique challenges and opportunities in these settings. By prioritizing the improvement of conditions for necessity-driven physical activity and promoting equitable access to choice-based activities, public health initiatives can better support the health and well-being of populations in LMICs. Future research should continue to explore the complex interplay between necessity and choice in physical activity and develop interventions that are responsive to the diverse needs and contexts of LMIC populations.", "References": [{"title": "Physical activity 2: The role of the built environment in promoting physical activity", "authors": "Bauman, Adrian, Reis, Rodrigo S., Sallis, James F., Wells, Jacinta C., Loos, R.
