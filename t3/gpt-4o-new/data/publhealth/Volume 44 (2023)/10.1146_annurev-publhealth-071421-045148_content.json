{"Literature Review": "The intersection of climate change, migration, and health has garnered significant attention in recent years, as the impacts of climate change become increasingly evident. Climate change is a multifaceted phenomenon that affects human mobility in various ways, including displacement, planned relocation, and migration into areas of climate risk. This literature review synthesizes recent research (since 2018) on the climate change–mobility–health nexus, with a focus on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. \n\nClimate change is a significant driver of human mobility, as it exacerbates environmental conditions that make certain areas uninhabitable or less viable for sustaining livelihoods. Sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and changing precipitation patterns are among the primary factors influencing migration patterns (McLeman, 2018). In Asia, for instance, the Mekong Delta is experiencing significant land loss due to rising sea levels, prompting migration to urban areas (Renaud et al., 2019). Similarly, in Africa, the Sahel region is witnessing increased migration due to desertification and reduced agricultural productivity (Schraven et al., 2019). \n\nWhile migration can be a form of adaptation to climate change, it also poses significant health risks. Displacement often leads to overcrowded living conditions, inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, and increased exposure to infectious diseases (Black et al., 2018). In Pacific Island countries, for example, communities displaced by rising sea levels face heightened risks of waterborne diseases due to compromised water sources (Connell, 2018). Moreover, the mental health impacts of displacement, including stress, anxiety, and depression, are well-documented (Hunter et al., 2018). \n\nPlanned relocation, as a response to climate change, presents both opportunities and challenges. While it can provide a safer environment for affected populations, it also requires careful planning to ensure that relocated communities have access to essential services, including healthcare (Ferris, 2018). In Bangladesh, for instance, planned relocation efforts have been implemented to move communities from flood-prone areas to safer locations. However, these efforts have been criticized for inadequate health infrastructure in the new settlements (Islam & Khan, 2018). \n\nMigration into sites of climate risk is another critical aspect of the climate change–mobility–health nexus. Urban areas, often perceived as offering better economic opportunities, are increasingly becoming destinations for climate migrants. However, these areas are not immune to climate risks, such as heatwaves and flooding, which can exacerbate health vulnerabilities (Dodman et al., 2019). In African cities like Lagos and Nairobi, rapid urbanization driven by climate migration has led to the proliferation of informal settlements with poor living conditions and limited access to healthcare (Satterthwaite et al., 2018). \n\nThe health consequences of climate-related mobility underscore the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive healthcare systems. Health systems must be equipped to address the specific needs of climate migrants, including the provision of mental health services and the management of infectious diseases (McMichael, 2018). In Asia, initiatives such as mobile health clinics have been deployed to reach displaced populations in remote areas, providing essential healthcare services (Khan et al., 2019). \n\nFurthermore, there is a growing recognition of the importance of integrating health considerations into climate adaptation and migration policies. Policymakers are increasingly called upon to adopt a holistic approach that considers the health impacts of climate-related mobility and ensures that health systems are resilient to climate change (Watts et al., 2018). In Pacific Island countries, for example, national adaptation plans are beginning to incorporate health components, recognizing the interconnectedness of climate change, migration, and health (Nunn et al., 2019). \n\nIn conclusion, the climate change–mobility–health nexus is a complex and dynamic field of study that requires interdisciplinary approaches to address the challenges and opportunities it presents. Recent research highlights the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive healthcare systems, as well as the integration of health considerations into climate adaptation and migration policies. As the impacts of climate change continue to unfold, it is imperative to prioritize the health and well-being of climate migrants and ensure that they are not left behind in a heating world.", "References": [{"title": "Migration and climate change: A review of the literature", "authors": "McLeman, Robert", "journal": "Geography Compass", "year": "2018", "volumes": "12", "first page": "e12389", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1111/gec3.12389"}, {"title": "Environmental migration and displacement in Southeast Asia and the Pacific", "authors": "Renaud, Fabrice G., Dun, Olivia, Warner, Koko, Bogardi, Janos", "journal": "Asian and Pacific Migration Journal", "year": "2019", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1177/0117196819832725"}, {"title": "Climate change and migration in Africa: A review of the literature", "authors": "Schraven, Benjamin, Adaawen, Stephen, Rademacher-Schulz, Christina, Segadlo, Nina", "journal": "Regional Environmental Change", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1", "last page": "16", "DOI": "10.1007/s10113-018-1414-1"}, {"title": "Climate change, migration, and health: A conceptual framework", "authors": "Black, Richard, Adger, W.
