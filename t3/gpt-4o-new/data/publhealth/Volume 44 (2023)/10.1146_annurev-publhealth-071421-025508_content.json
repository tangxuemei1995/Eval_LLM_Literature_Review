{"Literature Review": "Extreme heat events (EHEs) pose significant public health challenges, exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of such events due to climate change. The health impacts of EHEs are multifaceted, including acute heat illnesses, exacerbation of chronic diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries (Anderson & Bell, 2009). The need for effective public health preparedness and response strategies is critical to mitigate these impacts. This literature review explores the current state of public health preparedness for EHEs, focusing on the development and implementation of heat action plans (HAPs) as a form of disaster risk reduction. \n\nThe relationship between climate change and the increasing frequency of EHEs is well-documented. Studies have shown that climate change is a significant driver of the rising incidence of heat-related mortality (Gasparrini et al., 2015). This necessitates the development of climate-resilient health systems that can effectively respond to EHEs. Climate-resilient health systems are characterized by their ability to anticipate, respond to, and recover from climate-related health impacts, thereby reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacity (Ebi et al., 2018). \n\nHeat action plans (HAPs) are a critical component of public health preparedness for EHEs. These plans typically include a range of interventions aimed at reducing heat-related health risks. HAPs are often structured around the three phases of prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary prevention focuses on reducing vulnerability before an EHE occurs, through measures such as public education and infrastructure improvements (Lowe et al., 2011). Secondary prevention involves early warning systems and rapid response measures to protect vulnerable populations during an EHE. Tertiary prevention focuses on minimizing health impacts and facilitating recovery after an EHE (Matthies et al., 2008). \n\nThe effectiveness of HAPs depends on several factors, including the level of community engagement, the integration of HAPs into broader disaster risk reduction strategies, and the use of evidence-based interventions. Community engagement is crucial for the successful implementation of HAPs, as it ensures that interventions are tailored to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of local populations (Hess et al., 2014). Integrating HAPs into broader disaster risk reduction strategies can enhance their effectiveness by ensuring that they are part of a comprehensive approach to managing climate-related risks (Bittner et al., 2014). \n\nEvidence-based interventions are essential for the success of HAPs. These interventions should be informed by the latest scientific research on the health impacts of EHEs and the effectiveness of different prevention strategies. For example, studies have shown that early warning systems can significantly reduce heat-related mortality by providing timely information to vulnerable populations (Lowe et al., 2011). Similarly, public education campaigns can increase awareness of heat-related health risks and promote protective behaviors (Matthies et al., 2008). \n\nPost-event evaluation activities, such as after-action reports, are critical for the adaptive management of HAPs. These evaluations provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of interventions and identify areas for improvement. Adaptive management is a dynamic process that involves continuously updating and refining HAPs based on new evidence and changing conditions (Ebi et al., 2018). This approach ensures that HAPs remain relevant and effective in the face of evolving climate-related health risks. \n\nIn conclusion, public health preparedness for EHEs is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a coordinated and evidence-based approach. Heat action plans are a key component of this preparedness, providing a framework for reducing heat-related health risks through primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies. The success of HAPs depends on community engagement, integration into broader disaster risk reduction strategies, and the use of evidence-based interventions. Post-event evaluations are essential for the adaptive management of HAPs, ensuring that they remain effective in the face of changing climate-related health risks. As climate change continues to drive the increasing frequency and intensity of EHEs, the need for effective public health preparedness and response strategies will become even more critical.", "References": [{"title": "Heat-related mortality: a review and exploration of heterogeneity", "authors": "Anderson, G.
