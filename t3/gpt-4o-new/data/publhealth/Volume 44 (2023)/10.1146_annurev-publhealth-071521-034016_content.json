{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of mass incarceration in the United States has been a subject of extensive research, particularly in relation to its impact on public health. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with over 2 million individuals currently incarcerated, a situation that has been described as a public health crisis (Wildeman & Wang, 2017). The roots of mass incarceration are deeply embedded in historical and sociostructural factors, including racial discrimination, economic exploitation, and the criminalization of certain behaviors, particularly those associated with mental illness and substance use disorders (Alexander, 2012). \n\nHistorically, the enslavement of African Americans and the genocide and displacement of Indigenous peoples have laid the groundwork for systemic inequalities that persist in the criminal justice system today (Davis, 2003). The War on Drugs, initiated in the 1980s, further exacerbated these inequalities by disproportionately targeting communities of color, leading to a significant increase in incarceration rates for non-violent drug offenses (Tonry, 1995). This policy shift not only increased the prison population but also contributed to the stigmatization and marginalization of individuals with substance use disorders, framing them as criminals rather than individuals in need of medical treatment (Mauer & King, 2007).\n\nThe conditions within prisons often exacerbate existing health issues and create new ones. Overcrowding, inadequate healthcare, and poor living conditions contribute to the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV (Hammett, Harmon, & Rhodes, 2002). Mental health issues are also prevalent, with a significant proportion of the incarcerated population suffering from mental illnesses that are often untreated or inadequately managed within the prison system (James & Glaze, 2006). The lack of access to appropriate healthcare services in prisons is a critical public health concern, as it not only affects the health of incarcerated individuals but also has broader implications for community health upon their release (Binswanger et al., 2007).\n\nIn response to these challenges, public health scholars and practitioners have advocated for a range of interventions aimed at improving the health and dignity of incarcerated individuals. One such approach is the implementation of decarceral strategies, which seek to reduce the prison population through alternatives to incarceration, such as drug treatment programs, mental health services, and community-based interventions (Cloud et al., 2014). These strategies not only address the root causes of criminal behavior but also promote rehabilitation and reintegration into society, ultimately reducing recidivism rates (Pew Center on the States, 2011).\n\nFurthermore, there is a growing recognition of the need for comprehensive healthcare services within prisons, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services (Wilper et al., 2009). The integration of telemedicine and other innovative healthcare delivery models has been proposed as a means of overcoming the barriers to healthcare access in correctional settings (Young et al., 2014). Additionally, the training of correctional staff in health-related issues and the establishment of partnerships between correctional facilities and public health agencies are essential components of a holistic approach to correctional health (Rich et al., 2011).\n\nThe role of public health research in addressing the health needs of incarcerated individuals cannot be overstated. Research efforts should focus on identifying effective interventions, evaluating existing programs, and advocating for policy changes that prioritize the health and well-being of this vulnerable population (Wang et al., 2014). Moreover, there is a need for a paradigm shift in the way society views incarceration, moving away from punitive approaches and towards a more rehabilitative and restorative justice model (Clear, 2007).\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of public health and mass incarceration presents significant challenges and opportunities for health scholars, practitioners, and activists. By addressing the underlying sociostructural factors that contribute to mass incarceration and implementing evidence-based interventions, it is possible to improve the health outcomes of incarcerated individuals and promote a more equitable and just society. The pursuit of decarceral solutions and the enhancement of correctional healthcare services are critical steps towards achieving these goals.", "References": [{"title": "Mass Incarceration, Public Health, and Widening Inequality in the USA", "authors": "Wildeman, Christopher; Wang, Emily A.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2017", "volumes": "389", "first page": "1464", "last page": "1474", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30259-3"}, {"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Alexander, Michelle", "journal": "The New Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Are Prisons Obsolete?", "authors": "Davis, Angela Y.", "journal": "Seven Stories Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Malign Neglect: Race, Crime, and Punishment in America", "authors": "Tonry, Michael", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1995", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A 25-Year Quagmire: The War on Drugs and Its Impact on American Society", "authors": "Mauer, Marc; King, Ryan S.", "journal": "The Sentencing Project", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Burden of Infectious Disease Among Inmates of and Releasees from US Correctional Facilities, 1997", "authors": "Hammett, Theodore M.; Harmon, Patricia; Rhodes, William", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2002", "volumes": "92", "first page": "1789", "last page": "1794", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.92.11.1789"}, {"title": "Mental Health Problems of Prison and Jail Inmates", "authors": "James, Doris J.; Glaze, Lauren E.", "journal": "Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Release from Prison â€” A High Risk of Death for Former Inmates", "authors": "Binswanger, Ingrid A.; Stern, Marc F.; Deyo, Richard A.; Heagerty, Patrick J.; Cheadle, Allen; Elmore, Joann G.; Koepsell, Thomas D.", "journal": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2007", "volumes": "356", "first page": "157", "last page": "165", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMsa064115"}, {"title": "The Revolving Door: A Report on U.S. Prisoner Reentry", "authors": "Pew Center on the States", "journal": "Pew Charitable Trusts", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Health and Health Care of US Prisoners: Results of a Nationwide Survey", "authors": "Wilper, Andrew P.; Woolhandler, Steffie; Boyd, J.
