{"Literature Review": "The relationship between housing quality and health outcomes has been a subject of extensive research, underscoring the critical role that housing plays in shaping health and well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) has long recognized the importance of housing as a determinant of health, as evidenced by its Housing and Health Guidelines, which provide a framework for interventions aimed at mitigating health risks associated with poor housing conditions (World Health Organization, 2018). These guidelines emphasize the need for adequate ventilation, thermal comfort, and safety measures to protect occupants from environmental hazards. \n\nResearch has consistently shown that poor housing quality is linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. For instance, a study by Thomson et al. (2013) found that housing improvements, such as better insulation and heating, were associated with significant reductions in respiratory symptoms and improved mental health. Similarly, a systematic review by Krieger and Higgins (2002) highlighted the impact of housing interventions on reducing asthma and other respiratory conditions, particularly in children. These findings underscore the importance of retrofitting existing housing and constructing new homes to high-quality standards to promote health and well-being.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical role of housing quality in health outcomes, particularly in relation to ventilation standards. Poor ventilation has been identified as a key factor in the transmission of airborne diseases, including COVID-19 (Morawska et al., 2020). This has led to renewed calls for improved ventilation standards in residential buildings to reduce the risk of disease transmission and improve indoor air quality. \n\nDespite the robust evidence linking housing quality to health outcomes, housing standards remain unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally. This is particularly concerning given the disproportionate impact of poor housing quality on vulnerable populations, including Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and low-income households. These groups often face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by substandard housing conditions, leading to higher rates of housing-related illnesses and injuries (Marmot et al., 2008). \n\nCommunity-based programs have been identified as a promising approach to improving housing quality and reducing health inequalities. These programs often involve partnerships between local governments, non-profit organizations, and community members to address housing-related health issues. For example, a study by Jacobs et al. (2010) demonstrated the effectiveness of community-based interventions in reducing lead exposure and improving indoor air quality in low-income housing. Such programs are particularly beneficial for children and older adults, who are more vulnerable to housing-related health issues and are often hospitalized more frequently as a result (Krieger et al., 2010).\n\nThere is also growing interest among policymakers and researchers in the health and well-being of individuals living in public and subsidized housing. These populations are disproportionately affected by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve housing quality in these settings (Fenelon et al., 2017). Improving the quality of public and subsidized housing not only has the potential to enhance health outcomes but also offers multiple co-benefits, including reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability (Fuller et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is clear that housing quality is a critical determinant of health and well-being. Improving the quality of new and existing housing, particularly for vulnerable populations, is essential for reducing health inequalities and promoting broader societal well-being. Policymakers and researchers must continue to prioritize housing quality as a key component of public health strategies, with a focus on implementing and monitoring effective housing standards and interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Housing and health guidelines", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Health impacts of housing improvement: systematic review of intervention studies", "authors": "H.
