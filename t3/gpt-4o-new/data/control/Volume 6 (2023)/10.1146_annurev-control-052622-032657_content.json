{"Literature Review": "The transition from traditional fossil fuel-based power plants to low-inertia systems, primarily driven by renewable energy resources and power electronics, presents significant challenges in the control and stability of electric power systems. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of classical control concepts and the development of novel strategies to ensure system reliability and efficiency. Low-inertia systems, characterized by reduced mechanical inertia due to the replacement of synchronous generators with power electronic converters, exhibit distinct dynamic behaviors that require advanced control methodologies. \n\nOne of the primary challenges in low-inertia power systems is maintaining frequency stability. Traditional power systems rely on the inertia of rotating masses in synchronous generators to buffer frequency fluctuations. However, in low-inertia systems, this natural damping is absent, leading to faster and potentially more severe frequency deviations (Milano et al., 2018). Consequently, the control of grid-connected power converters becomes crucial. These converters must be designed to provide synthetic inertia and fast frequency response to mimic the behavior of traditional generators (Ulbig et al., 2014). \n\nThe modeling of low-inertia systems is another critical area of research. Accurate models are essential for designing effective control strategies and predicting system behavior under various operating conditions. However, traditional models often fail to capture the fast dynamics and interactions of power electronic devices. Recent studies have focused on developing detailed models that incorporate the dynamics of power converters and their control systems (Rocabert et al., 2012). These models are essential for understanding the complex interactions between different components in a low-inertia system and for designing robust control strategies. \n\nGrid-forming control is a promising approach for managing low-inertia systems. Unlike grid-following converters, which rely on the grid to set the frequency and voltage, grid-forming converters can establish and regulate these parameters independently. This capability is crucial for maintaining stability in systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources (D'Arco et al., 2015). Grid-forming control strategies, such as droop control and virtual synchronous machine (VSM) control, have been extensively studied for their ability to provide inertia and damping to the system (Beck and Hesse, 2007). These strategies enable converters to emulate the behavior of synchronous machines, thereby enhancing system stability. \n\nDynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) represent another innovative concept in the control of low-inertia systems. DVPPs aggregate multiple distributed energy resources, such as wind turbines, solar panels, and battery storage, to operate as a single controllable entity. This aggregation allows for more efficient management of resources and enhances the system's ability to respond to fluctuations in demand and supply (Lund et al., 2015). DVPPs can provide ancillary services, such as frequency regulation and voltage support, which are essential for maintaining grid stability in low-inertia systems. \n\nSystem-level services from a control perspective are also crucial for the successful integration of low-inertia systems. These services include frequency control, voltage control, and congestion management. Advanced control strategies, such as model predictive control (MPC) and robust control, have been proposed to address these challenges (Zhang et al., 2013). These strategies leverage real-time data and predictive models to optimize system performance and ensure stability under varying conditions. \n\nIn conclusion, the transition to low-inertia power systems requires a paradigm shift in control strategies and system modeling. A system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge the gap between different research communities and to understand the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls. By developing advanced control methodologies and accurate models, researchers can ensure the reliable and efficient operation of low-inertia power systems, paving the way for a sustainable energy future.", "References": [{"title": "Foundations and Challenges of Low-Inertia Systems", "authors": "Federico Milano, Florian Dörfler, Goran Hug, David J.
