{"Literature Review": "Networked control systems (NCS) have become a pivotal area of research due to their extensive applications in various domains such as smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. The integration of control and communication layers in these systems presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in the context of cyber-physical systems (CPS). The interaction between these layers is crucial as it influences the overall system performance, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of information flow and constraints. This literature review delves into the multifaceted role of information in networked estimation and control, highlighting key findings and emerging challenges. \n\nThe foundational work by Hespanha et al. (2007) laid the groundwork for understanding the stability and performance of NCS under communication constraints. They explored the impact of limited bandwidth and packet loss on control performance, establishing a framework for analyzing the trade-offs between communication and control. This study underscored the importance of designing control strategies that are robust to communication imperfections, a theme that has been extensively explored in subsequent research (Hespanha, J. P., Naghshtabrizi, P., & Xu, Y. 2007). \n\nA significant advancement in the field was the introduction of event-triggered control strategies, which aim to reduce communication load by transmitting information only when necessary. This approach was pioneered by Astrom and Bernhardsson (2002), who demonstrated that event-triggered sampling could achieve similar performance to periodic sampling while significantly reducing communication requirements. This paradigm shift has led to numerous studies exploring various event-triggering mechanisms and their implications for system stability and performance (Astrom, K. J., & Bernhardsson, B. M. 2002). \n\nThe concept of decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems has also gained traction. Olfati-Saber (2007) provided a comprehensive analysis of consensus algorithms for distributed estimation, highlighting their potential for achieving accurate state estimation in a decentralized manner. This work has been instrumental in advancing the understanding of how information can be effectively shared and utilized in networked systems, paving the way for more resilient and scalable control architectures (Olfati-Saber, R. 2007). \n\nInformation theory has played a crucial role in shaping the understanding of networked control systems. Tatikonda and Mitter (2004) explored the fundamental limits of control under communication constraints, providing insights into the minimum data rates required for stabilizing a system. Their work has been pivotal in establishing the theoretical underpinnings of control over networks, influencing a wide range of studies that seek to optimize information flow in NCS (Tatikonda, S., & Mitter, S. K. 2004). \n\nRecent developments have focused on the information-theoretic value of event timing in networked control. The work by Rabi et al. (2009) highlighted the significance of timing information in enhancing control performance, particularly in systems with asynchronous communication. This research has opened new avenues for exploring how temporal information can be leveraged to improve estimation and control in networked environments (Rabi, M., Moustakides, G. V., & Baras, J. S. 2009). \n\nThe integration of machine learning techniques into networked control systems has emerged as a promising direction for addressing the challenges posed by complex and dynamic environments. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of reinforcement learning and neural networks in optimizing control strategies under communication constraints, offering new tools for enhancing system performance (Kiumarsi, B., Lewis, F. L., Modares, H., Karimpour, A., & Naghibi-Sistani, M. B. 2017). \n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of networked estimation and control. The increasing complexity of CPS, coupled with the need for real-time decision-making, necessitates the development of more sophisticated algorithms that can efficiently handle large-scale systems with heterogeneous components. Additionally, ensuring the security and privacy of information in networked control systems is an ongoing concern that requires further investigation (Zhang, W., & Shi, L. 2013). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of information in networked estimation and control has evolved significantly over the past two decades, driven by the need to address the unique challenges posed by CPS. The interplay between control and communication layers continues to be a rich area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop more efficient, robust, and secure systems. As the field progresses, it is essential to build on the foundational insights provided by previous studies while embracing new technologies and methodologies to tackle emerging challenges.", "References": [{"title": "A survey of recent results in networked control systems", "authors": "Hespanha, Joao P., Naghshtabrizi, Payam, Xu, Yonggang", "journal": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "year": "2007", "volumes": "95", "first page": "138", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.1109/JPROC.2006.887288"}, {"title": "Event-based control of linear systems", "authors": "Astrom, Karl J., Bernhardsson, Bo M.", "journal": "Proceedings of the 41st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "2010", "last page": "2014", "DOI": "10.1109/CDC.2002.1184662"}, {"title": "Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems", "authors": "Olfati-Saber, Reza", "journal": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "year": "2007", "volumes": "95", "first page": "215", "last page": "233", "DOI": "10.1109/JPROC.2006.887293"}, {"title": "Control under communication constraints", "authors": "Tatikonda, Sekhar, Mitter, Sanjoy K.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": "2004", "volumes": "49", "first page": "1056", "last page": "1068", "DOI": "10.1109/TAC.2004.832203"}, {"title": "Adaptive sampling for linear state estimation", "authors": "Rabi, M., Moustakides, G.
