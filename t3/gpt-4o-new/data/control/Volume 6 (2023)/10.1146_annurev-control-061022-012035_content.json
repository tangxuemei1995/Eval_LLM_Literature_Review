{"Literature Review": "Soft robotics is an emerging field that leverages the unique properties of soft materials to create systems capable of complex, adaptive, and safe interactions with their environment. The integration of additive manufacturing, particularly 3D printing, into the fabrication of soft robots has opened new avenues for innovation and customization. This literature review explores the current state of research in soft actuators and robots enabled by additive manufacturing, focusing on the various types of actuation mechanisms, the role of 3D and 4D printing technologies, and the challenges and future directions in this field. \n\nSoft actuators are a critical component of soft robotic systems, providing the necessary movement and force generation. Pneumatic actuators, which use air pressure to induce motion, are among the most common types used in soft robotics due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Recent advancements in 3D printing have enabled the creation of complex pneumatic networks within soft materials, allowing for more precise control and a wider range of motion (Wehner et al., 2016). Electrically activated actuators, such as those using dielectric elastomers, offer another avenue for soft robotics. These actuators can be directly integrated into 3D-printed structures, providing rapid response times and high energy densities (Keplinger et al., 2018). \n\nMagnetically driven actuators represent another promising area of research. These actuators use magnetic fields to induce motion, offering advantages in terms of remote control and the ability to operate in enclosed environments. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of 3D printing to create complex magnetic structures within soft materials, enabling new functionalities and applications (Kim et al., 2019). \n\nThe advent of 4D printing, which involves the use of materials that change shape or properties over time in response to external stimuli, has further expanded the capabilities of soft robotics. 4D printing allows for the creation of structures that can self-assemble or change shape in response to environmental changes, offering new possibilities for adaptive and reconfigurable robots (Momeni et al., 2017). \n\nIntegrated soft actuators and sensors are another area of active research. The ability to embed sensors within soft robotic structures allows for real-time feedback and control, enhancing the functionality and adaptability of these systems. Additive manufacturing techniques have been instrumental in the development of integrated systems, enabling the seamless incorporation of sensors into soft materials (Shintake et al., 2018). \n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of soft robotics. One of the primary challenges is the realization of multimaterial, multiscale, and multifunctional 3D-printed soft robots. The integration of different materials with varying properties into a single structure is a complex task that requires precise control over the printing process and material properties (Truby and Lewis, 2016). Additionally, the development of scalable manufacturing processes that can produce soft robots with consistent quality and performance is an ongoing challenge. \n\nFuture research in soft robotics is likely to focus on addressing these challenges, with an emphasis on developing new materials and printing techniques that enable greater control over the properties and functions of soft robots. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into the design and control of soft robots is another promising area of research, offering the potential for more intelligent and autonomous systems (Rus and Tolley, 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, additive manufacturing has played a pivotal role in the advancement of soft robotics, enabling the creation of complex, multifunctional, and customizable systems. While significant progress has been made, ongoing research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with multimaterial and multiscale fabrication, as well as to explore new applications and functionalities for soft robots.", "References": [{"title": "An integrated design and fabrication strategy for entirely soft, autonomous robots", "authors": "Wehner, M., Truby, R.
