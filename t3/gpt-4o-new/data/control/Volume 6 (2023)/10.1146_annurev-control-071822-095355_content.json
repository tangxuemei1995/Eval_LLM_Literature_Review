{"Literature Review": "The CYBATHLON competition, first held in 2016, has emerged as a significant platform for advancing assistive technologies by fostering innovation and emphasizing user-centered design. This competition is unique in its approach, as it not only showcases technological advancements but also highlights the importance of involving end users in the development process. The competition consists of various disciplines, each designed to address specific daily-life challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. These disciplines include powered arm prosthesis race, powered leg prosthesis race, powered exoskeleton race, functional electrical stimulation bike race, powered wheelchair race, and brain-computer interface race. Each discipline is crafted to simulate real-world scenarios, thereby encouraging the development of practical and user-friendly solutions.\n\nThe powered arm prosthesis race, for instance, challenges participants to complete tasks that require dexterity and fine motor skills, such as opening jars or hanging clothes. This discipline has spurred advancements in prosthetic design, focusing on improving the functionality and intuitiveness of prosthetic limbs. Research has shown that user-centered design in prosthetics can significantly enhance user satisfaction and device adoption (Biddiss & Chau, 2007). By involving end users in the design process, developers can better understand the specific needs and preferences of prosthetic users, leading to more effective and widely accepted solutions.\n\nSimilarly, the powered leg prosthesis race addresses the challenges of mobility and balance. This discipline has led to innovations in prosthetic knee and ankle joints, which are crucial for providing a natural gait and reducing the energy expenditure of users. Studies have demonstrated that prosthetic devices that closely mimic natural limb movement can improve mobility and reduce the risk of falls (Hafner et al., 2007). The CYBATHLON competition has encouraged developers to focus on these aspects, resulting in more advanced and user-friendly leg prostheses.\n\nThe powered exoskeleton race is another discipline that has significantly contributed to the field of assistive technology. Exoskeletons are designed to assist individuals with mobility impairments, enabling them to walk and perform daily activities. The competition has driven advancements in exoskeleton design, particularly in terms of weight, comfort, and ease of use. Research indicates that lightweight and comfortable exoskeletons are more likely to be adopted by users, as they reduce fatigue and improve overall user experience (Dollar & Herr, 2008). By simulating real-world challenges, the CYBATHLON competition has pushed developers to create exoskeletons that are not only functional but also practical for everyday use.\n\nThe functional electrical stimulation (FES) bike race focuses on the use of electrical stimulation to activate paralyzed muscles, allowing individuals with spinal cord injuries to pedal a bicycle. This discipline has highlighted the potential of FES technology in rehabilitation and mobility enhancement. Studies have shown that FES can improve muscle strength, cardiovascular health, and overall quality of life for individuals with spinal cord injuries (Johnston et al., 2009). The CYBATHLON competition has encouraged the development of more efficient and user-friendly FES systems, making this technology more accessible to end users.\n\nThe powered wheelchair race addresses the challenges faced by wheelchair users in navigating various terrains and obstacles. This discipline has led to innovations in wheelchair design, focusing on improving maneuverability, stability, and user control. Research has demonstrated that user-centered design in wheelchairs can enhance mobility and independence for users (Cooper et al., 2002). By involving end users in the design process, developers can create wheelchairs that better meet the needs and preferences of users, leading to increased satisfaction and adoption.\n\nFinally, the brain-computer interface (BCI) race explores the potential of BCIs in enabling individuals with severe disabilities to control devices using their brain signals. This discipline has driven advancements in BCI technology, particularly in terms of accuracy, speed, and ease of use. Studies have shown that BCIs can significantly improve communication and interaction for individuals with severe disabilities (Wolpaw et al., 2002). The CYBATHLON competition has encouraged the development of more user-friendly and reliable BCI systems, making this technology more accessible to end users.\n\nDespite the significant advancements driven by the CYBATHLON competition, challenges remain in the user-centered development of assistive technologies. One of the primary challenges is ensuring that the needs and preferences of end users are adequately considered throughout the development process. Research has shown that involving end users in the design process can lead to more effective and widely accepted solutions (Pape et al., 2002). However, achieving meaningful user involvement can be challenging, particularly when working with diverse user groups with varying needs and preferences.\n\nAnother challenge is ensuring that assistive technologies are affordable and accessible to all users. While the CYBATHLON competition has driven significant advancements in assistive technology, the cost of these technologies can be prohibitive for many users. Research indicates that affordability is a key factor in the adoption of assistive technologies (Federici et al., 2016). Therefore, developers must consider cost-effectiveness and accessibility when designing new devices.\n\nIn conclusion, the CYBATHLON competition has played a crucial role in advancing assistive technologies by fostering innovation and emphasizing user-centered design. By simulating real-world challenges, the competition has encouraged the development of practical and user-friendly solutions that address the specific needs of individuals with disabilities. However, challenges remain in ensuring meaningful user involvement and making assistive technologies affordable and accessible to all users. Continued efforts in these areas are essential to further advance the field of assistive technology and improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.", "References": [{"title": "User satisfaction and prosthetic device use in lower-limb amputees: A long-term study", "authors": "Biddiss, Elaine, Chau, Tom", "journal": "Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation", "year": "2007", "volumes": "88", "first page": "763", "last page": "769", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apmr.2007.02.034"}, {"title": "Evaluation of function, performance, and preference as transfemoral amputees transition from mechanical to microprocessor control of the prosthetic knee", "authors": "Hafner, Brian J., Willingham, Laura L., Buell, Nancy C., Allyn, Karen J., Smith, Douglas G.", "journal": "Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation", "year": "2007", "volumes": "88", "first page": "207", "last page": "217", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apmr.2006.10.030"}, {"title": "Lower extremity exoskeletons and active orthoses: Challenges and state-of-the-art", "authors": "Dollar, Aaron M., Herr, Hugh", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Robotics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "24", "first page": "144", "last page": "158", "DOI": "10.1109/TRO.2008.915453"}, {"title": "Functional electrical stimulation for the rehabilitation of walking in spinal cord injury", "authors": "Johnston, Thomas E., Smith, Brian T., Oladeji, Olusegun, Betz, Randal R., Mulcahey, M.
