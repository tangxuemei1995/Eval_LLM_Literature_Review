{"Literature Review": "The control of multicarrier energy systems, which encompass various energy carriers such as electricity, heat, and gas, has become a focal point in the pursuit of sustainable energy management. The integration of these systems from individual buildings to larger networks presents unique challenges and opportunities for optimization, efficiency, and emissions reduction. Over the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in the control and management of these systems, driven by the need to address cost, efficiency, and environmental concerns. \n\nOne of the primary motivations for advanced control techniques in multicarrier energy systems is the potential for significant reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Studies have shown that by optimizing the operation of energy systems, it is possible to achieve substantial energy savings and emissions reductions. For instance, the work by Oldewurtel et al. (2012) demonstrated that predictive control strategies could lead to energy savings of up to 20% in building energy systems. This is achieved by anticipating future energy demands and adjusting the operation of energy systems accordingly, thus minimizing waste and improving efficiency.\n\nThe concept of energy hubs, which serve as nodes that integrate multiple energy carriers, has been instrumental in advancing the control of multicarrier energy systems. Energy hubs facilitate the conversion, storage, and distribution of energy, allowing for more flexible and efficient energy management. Geidl and Andersson (2007) introduced the concept of energy hubs and highlighted their potential in optimizing the flow of energy across different carriers. By leveraging the synergies between different energy carriers, energy hubs can enhance the overall efficiency of energy systems and reduce emissions.\n\nDistributed control and cooperative control strategies have also gained prominence in the management of multicarrier energy systems. These approaches involve the coordination of multiple control agents, each responsible for a specific part of the energy system, to achieve a common objective. Distributed control strategies, as discussed by Christofides et al. (2013), offer scalability and robustness, making them suitable for large-scale energy networks. Cooperative control, on the other hand, emphasizes collaboration between different control agents to optimize the performance of the entire system. This approach has been shown to improve the resilience and adaptability of energy systems, particularly in the face of uncertainties and dynamic changes in energy demand.\n\nPredictive control, particularly model predictive control (MPC), has emerged as a powerful tool for managing multicarrier energy systems. MPC involves the use of mathematical models to predict future system behavior and optimize control actions accordingly. This approach is well-suited for handling the dynamic interactions and constraints inherent in multicarrier energy systems. Ma et al. (2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of MPC in reducing energy consumption and improving the operational efficiency of building energy systems. By considering future energy demands and system constraints, MPC can optimize the scheduling and operation of energy systems, leading to significant energy and emissions savings.\n\nThe interconnection of multiple energy carriers, conversion devices, and energy storage systems provides increased flexibility and potential for energy and CO2 reduction. The dynamic interactions between these components occur over various timescales, ranging from minutes to seasons. This necessitates the use of optimization-based control approaches that can handle the complexity and constraints of multicarrier energy systems. Optimization techniques, such as those discussed by Parisio et al. (2014), enable the efficient allocation of resources and the coordination of energy flows across different carriers, leading to improved system performance and reduced emissions.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application of advanced control techniques to interconnected energy systems. These systems, which integrate multiple energy carriers and conversion devices, offer increased flexibility and potential for energy and emissions reduction. The work by Mancarella et al. (2016) highlights the importance of interconnection control in achieving these objectives. By coordinating the operation of interconnected energy systems, it is possible to optimize the use of available resources and minimize energy waste.\n\nOverall, the control of multicarrier energy systems from buildings to networks presents significant opportunities for improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The integration of advanced control techniques, such as predictive control, distributed control, and cooperative control, can enhance the performance of these systems and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As research in this field continues to evolve, it is expected that further advancements will be made in the optimization and management of multicarrier energy systems, leading to even greater energy and emissions savings.", "References": [{"title": "Predictive control of buildings for energy efficiency and comfort", "authors": "Oldewurtel, F., Parisio, A., Jones, C.
