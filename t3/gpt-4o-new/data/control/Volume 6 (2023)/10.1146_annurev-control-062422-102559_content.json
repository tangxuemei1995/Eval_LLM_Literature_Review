{"Literature Review": "The exploitation of liquid surface tension in microrobotics is a burgeoning field that leverages the dominant forces at the submillimeter scale to achieve precise and efficient micromanipulations. Surface tension, a fundamental physical phenomenon, has been extensively studied in the context of microrobotics, where it plays a crucial role in applications such as capillary picking, self-alignment, capillary sealing, and capillary bearings. The ability to manipulate liquid menisci through various stimuli, such as light and magnetic fields, has opened new avenues for the development of microrobotic systems. However, the inherent uncertainties associated with contact-angle hysteresis and the variability in liquid volume present significant challenges in the open-loop control of these systems. To address these challenges, researchers have focused on integrating advanced sensing and control schemes into microrobotic systems, enabling real-time feedback and improved performance.\n\nSurface tension effects are particularly pronounced at the microscale, where they can dominate over gravitational and inertial forces. This dominance makes surface tension an attractive mechanism for microrobotic applications. The physics of surface tension, including wetting, surface texturation, and coatings, has been well-documented in the literature. For instance, the work of De Gennes et al. (2004) provides a comprehensive overview of the principles of capillarity and wetting, which are fundamental to understanding how surface tension can be harnessed in microrobotics. The ability to control surface tension through external stimuli, such as electric fields, has been demonstrated by researchers like Jones et al. (2001), who explored the use of electrowetting to manipulate liquid droplets on surfaces.\n\nCapillary forces, which arise from surface tension, have been exploited in various microrobotic applications. Capillary picking, for example, utilizes the adhesive forces between a liquid meniscus and a solid object to pick and place small components. This technique has been successfully applied in the assembly of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), as demonstrated by the work of Fearing et al. (1998). Similarly, capillary self-alignment, which relies on the minimization of surface energy to achieve precise alignment of components, has been explored by researchers such as Syms et al. (2003). These applications highlight the potential of capillary forces to enable precise and efficient micromanipulations.\n\nDespite the advantages of using surface tension in microrobotics, there are significant challenges associated with open-loop control. Contact-angle hysteresis, which refers to the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles of a liquid on a surface, introduces variability in the capillary forces. This variability can lead to unpredictable behavior in microrobotic systems, as noted by Extrand and Kumagai (1995). Additionally, the volume of liquid involved in the manipulation can vary, further complicating the control of capillary forces. To overcome these challenges, researchers have focused on integrating sensors and developing advanced control schemes that provide real-time feedback and compensation for these uncertainties.\n\nThe integration of sensors into microrobotic systems has been a key area of research. For example, the use of optical sensors to monitor the position and shape of liquid menisci has been explored by researchers like Kim et al. (2008). These sensors provide valuable feedback that can be used to adjust the control parameters in real-time, improving the accuracy and reliability of microrobotic operations. In addition to optical sensors, other sensing technologies, such as capacitive and piezoelectric sensors, have been investigated for their potential to provide real-time feedback in microrobotic systems.\n\nAdvanced control schemes, such as model predictive control and adaptive control, have been developed to address the challenges associated with open-loop control of capillary forces. These control schemes leverage the real-time feedback provided by sensors to adjust the control inputs dynamically, compensating for the uncertainties introduced by contact-angle hysteresis and liquid volume variability. The work of De Volder et al. (2011) highlights the potential of these advanced control schemes to improve the performance of microrobotic systems by enabling precise and reliable manipulation of small components.\n\nIn conclusion, the exploitation of liquid surface tension in microrobotics offers significant potential for the development of advanced micromanipulation techniques. The integration of sensors and advanced control schemes is essential to overcoming the challenges associated with open-loop control and realizing the full potential of capillary forces in microrobotic applications. As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that new and innovative solutions will emerge, further expanding the capabilities of microrobotic systems.", "References": [{"title": "Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena: Drops, Bubbles, Pearls, Waves", "authors": "Pierre-Gilles De Gennes, Françoise Brochard-Wyart, David Quéré", "journal": "Springer", "year": "2004", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Electrowetting and electrowetting-on-dielectric for microscale liquid handling", "authors": "T.
