{"Literature Review": "The study of organizational crime, peace, and crisis prevention is a multifaceted field that intersects with various disciplines, including criminology, sociology, political science, and international relations. This literature review explores the complexities of these themes, drawing on a range of studies that have contributed to our understanding of how to foster freedom and prevent crime and war. The concept of 'predatory peace' refers to the paradoxical situation where peace is maintained through coercive or exploitative means, often leading to long-term instability and conflict. This notion challenges traditional views of peace as merely the absence of war, suggesting that peace must be actively constructed through justice and equity (Galtung, 1969). \n\nOrganizational crime, particularly in the context of cybercrime, has emerged as a significant threat to global security. The digital age has facilitated new forms of crime that transcend national borders, complicating efforts to prevent and prosecute such activities. Scholars like Wall (2007) have highlighted the challenges posed by cybercrime, emphasizing the need for international cooperation and robust legal frameworks to address these issues effectively. The rise of cybercrime underscores the importance of understanding the organizational structures that enable such activities, as well as the socio-economic factors that drive individuals to engage in cybercriminal behavior (Wall, 2007). \n\nThe prevention of war and the promotion of peace are central concerns in the field of international relations. Traditional approaches to peacebuilding have often focused on state-centric solutions, such as diplomacy and military intervention. However, recent scholarship has emphasized the importance of addressing underlying social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to conflict. For instance, Collier and Hoeffler (2004) argue that economic inequality and resource scarcity are significant drivers of conflict, suggesting that sustainable peace requires addressing these root causes. This perspective aligns with the broader field of peace and conflict studies, which advocates for a holistic approach to peacebuilding that includes social justice, economic development, and environmental sustainability (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004). \n\nEnvironmental crises, such as climate change and resource depletion, pose additional challenges to global peace and security. The intersection of environmental issues and conflict has been the subject of extensive research, with scholars like Homer-Dixon (1999) exploring how environmental stress can exacerbate existing tensions and lead to violence. The concept of 'environmental security' has gained traction in recent years, highlighting the need for integrated policies that address both environmental and security concerns. This approach recognizes that environmental degradation can undermine social stability and economic development, ultimately threatening peace (Homer-Dixon, 1999). \n\nThe autobiographical nature of this review reflects the personal and professional journey of a researcher dedicated to understanding these complex issues. The author's experiences underscore the challenges of conducting long-term research in a field characterized by rapid change and uncertainty. The notion of a 'messy kitchen' serves as a metaphor for the iterative and often chaotic process of scientific inquiry, where initial failures and setbacks are integral to the development of new insights and solutions. This perspective resonates with the broader academic community, which acknowledges that progress in research often requires embracing complexity and uncertainty (Kuhn, 1962). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of organizational crime, peace, and crisis prevention is a dynamic and evolving field that demands interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative approaches. While many ambitions in this area may remain 'half-baked,' the ongoing pursuit of knowledge and understanding is essential for addressing the pressing challenges of our time. By drawing on diverse perspectives and methodologies, researchers can contribute to the development of a more comprehensive macrocriminology of freedom, ultimately fostering a more just and peaceful world.", "References": [{"title": "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research", "authors": "Johan Galtung", "journal": "Journal of Peace Research", "year": "1969", "volumes": "6", "first page": "167", "last page": "191", "DOI": "10.1177/002234336900600301"}, {"title": "Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age", "authors": "David S.
