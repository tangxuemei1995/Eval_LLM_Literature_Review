{"Literature Review": "The role of victim advocacy in criminal justice reform in England and Wales has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the context of supporting victims of volume crime and domestic violence. Victim Support, a major institution in England and Wales, plays a crucial role in providing assistance to victims, yet their voices often remain marginalized in policy discussions (Goodey, 2005). This literature review explores the impact of victim advocacy on criminal justice reform, with a focus on the contributions of women's groups and the broader social movement advocating for victims' rights. \n\nVictim advocacy has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with a growing recognition of the need to incorporate victims' perspectives into the criminal justice system. The traditional focus on offenders has shifted towards a more balanced approach that considers the needs and rights of victims (Rock, 2004). This shift is partly due to the efforts of victim advocacy groups, which have worked tirelessly to highlight the challenges faced by victims and to push for reforms that address these issues. \n\nOne of the key areas where victim advocacy has made a significant impact is in the realm of domestic violence. Women's groups in England and Wales have been at the forefront of advocating for changes in the criminal justice system to better protect victims of domestic violence. These groups have been instrumental in raising awareness about the prevalence and severity of domestic violence, as well as the inadequacies of the existing legal framework in addressing this issue (Hester, 2013). Their efforts have contributed to the passage of important legislation, such as the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, which aims to provide greater protection and support for victims of domestic violence (Home Office, 2021). \n\nThe influence of women's groups on criminal justice reform is not limited to legislative changes. These groups have also played a crucial role in shaping public discourse around domestic violence and victim advocacy. By organizing campaigns, engaging with the media, and collaborating with policymakers, women's groups have succeeded in bringing the issue of domestic violence to the forefront of public consciousness (Kelly, 2005). This increased visibility has, in turn, created pressure on the government to take action and implement meaningful reforms. \n\nDespite these successes, there are still significant challenges that victim advocacy groups face in their efforts to influence criminal justice reform. One of the main obstacles is the lack of a unified front among victims' groups. While there are many organizations working to support victims, they often operate independently and lack a coordinated strategy for advocating for policy changes (Walklate, 2007). This fragmentation can weaken their collective impact and make it more difficult to achieve substantial reforms. \n\nAnother challenge is the limited resources available to victim advocacy groups. Many of these organizations rely on government funding, which can be unpredictable and subject to political priorities. This financial instability can hinder their ability to carry out their work effectively and to sustain long-term advocacy efforts (Mawby & Walklate, 1994). Additionally, the reliance on government funding can create tensions between advocacy groups and policymakers, as the former may be reluctant to criticize the latter for fear of jeopardizing their funding. \n\nDespite these challenges, there is evidence that victim advocacy is having a positive impact on criminal justice reform in England and Wales. For example, the introduction of victim impact statements, which allow victims to express how a crime has affected them, is a direct result of advocacy efforts (Hoyle, 2012). These statements provide victims with a voice in the criminal justice process and can influence sentencing decisions, thereby ensuring that victims' experiences are taken into account. \n\nIn conclusion, victim advocacy plays a crucial role in driving criminal justice reform in England and Wales. While there are significant challenges to overcome, the efforts of victim advocacy groups, particularly those focused on domestic violence, have led to important legislative and policy changes. To maximize their impact, it is essential for these groups to work together and to secure stable funding sources. By doing so, they can continue to advocate for the rights and needs of victims and contribute to a more just and equitable criminal justice system.", "References": [{"title": "Victims and Victimology: Research, Policy and Practice", "authors": "Goodey, Jo", "journal": "Pearson Education", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Understanding Victims and Restorative Justice", "authors": "Rock, Paul", "journal": "Open University Press", "year": "2004", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Who Does What to Whom?
