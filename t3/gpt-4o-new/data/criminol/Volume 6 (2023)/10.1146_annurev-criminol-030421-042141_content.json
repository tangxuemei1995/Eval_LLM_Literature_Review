{"Literature Review": "Carjacking, a violent crime that combines elements of robbery and motor vehicle theft, presents a unique challenge to law enforcement and researchers alike. The crime's complexity arises from its dual nature, requiring offenders to navigate both the immediate threat of violence and the subsequent management of a stolen vehicle. This literature review explores the scope, structure, process, and prevention of carjacking, drawing on official data and empirical research to illuminate the nuances of this urban menace. \n\nThe scope of carjacking is significant, with the crime being prevalent in urban areas where opportunities for such offenses are abundant. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, carjacking incidents are often underreported, leading to a gap in understanding the true extent of the problem (Klaus, 1999). The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) provides more detailed data, allowing for a better understanding of the crime's frequency and distribution (Addington, 2007). Studies have shown that carjacking is more common in areas with high vehicle density and where offenders can easily escape (Jacobs, 2010). \n\nThe structure of carjacking involves a complex interplay of factors, including the offender's motivation, the victim's characteristics, and the situational context. Offenders often target vehicles that are easy to steal and offer a quick getaway, such as those parked in isolated areas or at night (Copes, 2003). The decision-making process of offenders is influenced by a combination of rational choice theory and situational crime prevention strategies (Clarke, 1997). Offenders weigh the risks and rewards of the crime, considering factors such as the likelihood of apprehension and the potential value of the stolen vehicle (Wright & Decker, 1997). \n\nThe process of carjacking is typically rapid and opportunistic, with offenders often acting on impulse rather than premeditation. However, some carjackings are planned, with offenders using tactics such as bump-and-rob or staged accidents to catch victims off guard (Miethe & McCorkle, 1998). The element of surprise is crucial, as it reduces the victim's ability to resist and increases the offender's chances of success. The use of weapons is common in carjackings, with firearms being the most frequently used tool to intimidate victims (Tillyer & Eck, 2011). \n\nPrevention strategies for carjacking focus on both situational and community-based approaches. Situational crime prevention involves measures such as improved street lighting, surveillance cameras, and secure parking facilities to deter potential offenders (Clarke, 1997). Community-based strategies emphasize the importance of neighborhood watch programs and public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the risks and signs of carjacking (Bennett, 1990). Law enforcement agencies also play a critical role in prevention, with targeted patrols and sting operations aimed at disrupting carjacking networks (Braga, 2001). \n\nDespite these efforts, carjacking remains a persistent problem, partly due to the challenges in prosecuting offenders. The hybrid nature of the crime complicates legal proceedings, as it involves elements of both robbery and vehicle theft (Jacobs, 2010). Moreover, the transient nature of the crime, with vehicles often being quickly disposed of or altered, makes it difficult to trace and recover stolen property (Copes, 2003). \n\nIn conclusion, carjacking is a multifaceted crime that requires a comprehensive approach to understand and prevent. The existing body of research provides valuable insights into the crime's scope, structure, and process, but further studies are needed to develop more effective prevention strategies. By leveraging data from systems like NIBRS and engaging in interdisciplinary research, policymakers and law enforcement can better address the challenges posed by carjacking and reduce its impact on urban communities.", "References": [{"title": "The National Crime Victimization Survey: A Review", "authors": "Klaus, P.", "journal": "Journal of Quantitative Criminology", "year": "1999", "volumes": "15", "first page": "123", "last page": "150", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1007582821543"}, {"title": "Using NIBRS to Study Robbery and Carjacking: A Research Note", "authors": "Addington, L.
