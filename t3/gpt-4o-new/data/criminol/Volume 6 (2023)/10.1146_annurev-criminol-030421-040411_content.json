{"Literature Review": "The concept of overcriminalization has garnered significant attention in recent years, with scholars and practitioners across the political spectrum acknowledging its prevalence, particularly within the United States criminal justice system. Overcriminalization refers to the excessive and often unnecessary expansion of criminal laws, leading to a bloated penal system that criminalizes a wide array of behaviors, many of which may not warrant such severe legal responses. This literature review explores six critical questions surrounding overcriminalization, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue and its implications for criminal justice policy. \n\nFirstly, it is essential to define what constitutes criminal law. Criminal law is traditionally understood as a body of rules and statutes that define conduct prohibited by the state because it threatens public safety and welfare, and prescribes punishment for those who violate these laws (Ashworth, 2000). However, the boundaries of criminal law have expanded significantly, often encompassing behaviors that do not pose a direct threat to public safety, leading to debates about the appropriate scope of criminalization (Husak, 2008). \n\nThe second question addresses the meaning of overcriminalization. Overcriminalization is characterized by the proliferation of criminal statutes, often resulting in the criminalization of conduct that could be more effectively managed through civil or administrative means (Baker, 2004). This expansion is often driven by political, social, and economic factors, including the desire to appear tough on crime, respond to public moral panics, or protect economic interests (Lacey, 2009). \n\nThe third question explores why overcriminalization is considered pernicious. Overcriminalization can lead to several negative consequences, including the erosion of civil liberties, the overburdening of the criminal justice system, and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities (Alexander, 2010). It can also undermine the legitimacy of the legal system by criminalizing conduct that lacks a clear moral or social justification (Duff, 2007). \n\nThe fourth question examines whether overcriminalization is a de jure or de facto phenomenon. De jure overcriminalization refers to the existence of excessive criminal laws on the books, while de facto overcriminalization pertains to the enforcement practices that result in the over-application of these laws (Stuntz, 2001). Both aspects are critical to understanding the full scope of overcriminalization, as laws that are rarely enforced may still contribute to a culture of fear and compliance, while aggressive enforcement of existing laws can exacerbate the problem. \n\nThe fifth question considers the normative criteria that might be invoked to alleviate overcriminalization. Scholars have proposed various criteria for determining when conduct should be criminalized, including the harm principle, which suggests that only conduct that causes harm to others should be subject to criminal sanctions (Feinberg, 1984). Other criteria include the principle of legality, which emphasizes the need for clear and precise legal definitions, and the principle of proportionality, which advocates for punishments that are commensurate with the severity of the offense (von Hirsch, 1993). \n\nFinally, the sixth question addresses the extent to which overcriminalization is a serious concern in our penal system. While there is broad consensus that overcriminalization is a problem, opinions differ on its severity and the best approaches to address it. Some argue that the issue is primarily one of enforcement and discretion, suggesting that reforms should focus on reducing prosecutorial overreach and increasing judicial oversight (Luna, 2005). Others contend that the root of the problem lies in the legislative process, advocating for a more restrained approach to criminal lawmaking (Robinson, 2001). \n\nIn conclusion, a deep understanding of overcriminalization requires careful consideration of these six questions. While there is widespread agreement that overcriminalization is a significant issue, resolving the normative and conceptual uncertainties surrounding these questions is crucial for developing effective policy responses. By addressing these foundational issues, scholars and policymakers can work towards a more just and equitable criminal justice system that balances the need for public safety with the protection of individual rights.", "References": [{"title": "Principles of Criminal Law", "authors": "Andrew Ashworth", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Overcriminalization: The Limits of the Criminal Law", "authors": "Douglas Husak", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Overcriminalization Phenomenon", "authors": "Dennis J.
