{"Literature Review": "The American criminal justice system has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate, particularly in light of its distinctive characteristics and the challenges it faces. The system's reliance on mass incarceration, its high rates of police violence, and its entrenchment in systemic racism have prompted calls for radical reform. This literature review explores the structural underpinnings of these issues, situating them within the broader context of America's political economy and social structures. \n\nMass incarceration in the United States is a phenomenon that has garnered significant attention from scholars and policymakers alike. The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world, a fact that is often attributed to the country's punitive criminal justice policies (Garland, 2001). The rise of mass incarceration can be traced back to the 1970s, a period marked by a shift towards more punitive policies, including mandatory minimum sentences and three-strikes laws (Alexander, 2010). These policies disproportionately affect African American communities, reflecting the racialized nature of the American penal system (Wacquant, 2009). \n\nThe concept of 'defunding the police' has emerged as a response to the systemic issues within law enforcement agencies. This movement advocates for reallocating funds from police departments to community-based services that address the root causes of crime, such as poverty and lack of education (Vitale, 2017). The militarization of police forces and the prevalence of police violence, particularly against minority communities, have been well-documented (Balko, 2013). These issues are symptomatic of a broader trend towards using penal control as a primary means of social regulation, a trend that is deeply embedded in the American political economy (Beckett & Western, 2001). \n\nSystemic racism is a critical factor in understanding the American criminal justice system. The legacy of slavery and racial segregation has left an indelible mark on the country's social and economic structures, contributing to the racial disparities observed in the criminal justice system (Du Bois, 1935). The racialization of crime and punishment is evident in the overrepresentation of African Americans in prisons and the disproportionate impact of punitive policies on minority communities (Tonry, 2011). This racialized system of social control is not only a product of historical legacies but also a reflection of contemporary political and economic arrangements (Alexander, 2010). \n\nThe structural context of America's political economy plays a crucial role in shaping the criminal justice system. The United States' form of capitalism, characterized by high levels of inequality and limited social welfare provisions, contributes to social disorganization and criminal violence (Reiman & Leighton, 2016). The decline of manufacturing jobs and the rise of a precarious labor market have exacerbated economic insecurity, particularly among minority communities (Wilson, 1987). This economic marginalization is a significant driver of crime and social disorder, prompting state authorities to rely on penal control as a means of managing social problems (Wacquant, 2009). \n\nThe welfare state in the United States is notably less generous than in other developed nations, a factor that contributes to the country's reliance on penal control (Garland, 2001). The limited social safety net fails to address the root causes of crime, such as poverty and lack of access to education and healthcare (Western & Pettit, 2010). Instead, the state has increasingly turned to punitive measures as a means of social regulation, a trend that is both a cause and a consequence of the country's distinctive political economy (Beckett & Western, 2001). \n\nIn conclusion, the current crisis of American criminal justice is deeply rooted in the structural context of the country's political economy and social arrangements. The reliance on mass incarceration, the prevalence of police violence, and the entrenchment of systemic racism are not merely symptoms of a flawed system but are indicative of broader social and economic dynamics. Addressing these issues requires a fundamental rethinking of the role of the state in managing social problems and a commitment to addressing the root causes of crime and social disorder. This review highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to criminal justice reform that takes into account the structural factors that underpin the system's distinctive characteristics.", "References": [{"title": "The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society", "authors": "David Garland", "journal": "University of Chicago Press", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "The New Press", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Punishing the Poor: The Neoliberal Government of Social Insecurity", "authors": "Lo√Øc Wacquant", "journal": "Duke University Press", "year": "2009", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The End of Policing", "authors": "Alex S.
