{"Literature Review": "The events of January 6th, 2021, marked a significant moment in the history of domestic terrorism in the United States, drawing parallels and contrasts with the September 11th, 2001, jihadi attacks. This literature review explores the evolution of far-right and jihadi terrorism in the United States, examining the responses to these events and their implications for national unity and policy. The September 11th attacks were a watershed moment that unified the United States in its resolve against terrorism, leading to the implementation of extensive counterterrorism measures. The Bush administration's response, however, has been critiqued for its overreliance on deterrence strategies that disproportionately targeted Muslim communities, fostering anti-Muslim sentiments and inadvertently contributing to the rise of both jihadi and far-right extremism (Bergen, 2011). The Patriot Act, for instance, expanded surveillance capabilities and led to the profiling of Muslims, which many argue fueled anti-Muslim hate crimes and backlash (Chishti & Bergeron, 2011). This response, while effective in preventing further large-scale jihadi attacks, also legitimized anti-Muslim ideals, creating a fertile ground for far-right extremism to flourish (Blee, 2018). The rise of far-right extremism in the United States has been well-documented, with groups capitalizing on anti-Muslim rhetoric to recruit and radicalize individuals (Perry & Scrivens, 2016). The Southern Poverty Law Center has reported a significant increase in hate groups since 2001, many of which espouse far-right ideologies (Beirich, 2019). These groups have been emboldened by political rhetoric that echoes their beliefs, leading to an increase in far-right violence (Miller-Idriss, 2020). The events of January 6th can be seen as a culmination of these trends, with far-right extremists attempting to overturn a democratic election, an act that some have dismissed as legitimate political discourse (Pape, 2021). The contrasting responses to September 11th and January 6th highlight a significant divide in how terrorism is perceived and addressed in the United States. While the former unified the country against a common external enemy, the latter has exposed deep-seated divisions and a reluctance to confront domestic threats with the same vigor (Jones, 2021). This reluctance can be attributed to several factors, including political polarization and the normalization of far-right rhetoric in mainstream discourse (Glaeser, 2021). The empirical progression of violence between September 11th and January 6th underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to counterterrorism that addresses both jihadi and far-right extremism. Studies have shown that effective counterterrorism strategies must balance deterrence with community engagement and address the root causes of radicalization (Hoffman, 2006). This includes dismantling networks of hate and providing support for individuals at risk of radicalization (Simi & Futrell, 2015). Furthermore, there is a need to challenge the narratives that legitimize violence, whether they stem from jihadi or far-right ideologies (Neumann, 2013). This involves not only countering extremist propaganda but also addressing the socio-political factors that contribute to the appeal of these ideologies (Vidino, 2010). In conclusion, the events of January 6th and September 11th serve as stark reminders of the evolving nature of terrorism in the United States. While the response to September 11th unified the country against an external threat, it also sowed the seeds for future domestic extremism by legitimizing anti-Muslim sentiments. The rise of far-right extremism and the events of January 6th highlight the need for a nuanced approach to counterterrorism that addresses both external and internal threats. This requires a commitment to challenging extremist narratives, fostering community resilience, and promoting policies that unite rather than divide.", "References": [{"title": "The Longest War: The Enduring Conflict between America and Al-Qaeda", "authors": "Peter Bergen", "journal": "Free Press", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Patriot Act: Key Controversies", "authors": "Muzaffar Chishti, Claire Bergeron", "journal": "Migration Policy Institute", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Understanding Racist Activism: Theory, Methods, and Research", "authors": "Kathleen Blee", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Right-Wing Extremism in Canada", "authors": "Barbara Perry, Ryan Scrivens", "journal": "Palgrave Macmillan", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Hate Groups Increase for Second Consecutive Year as Trump Electrifies Radical Right", "authors": "Heidi Beirich", "journal": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Hate in the Homeland: The New Global Far Right", "authors": "Cynthia Miller-Idriss", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Capitol Rioters Arenâ€™t Like Other Extremists", "authors": "Robert Pape", "journal": "The Atlantic", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Rise of Far-Right Extremism in the United States", "authors": "Seth Jones", "journal": "Center for Strategic and International Studies", "year": "2021", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Political Economy of Hate", "authors": "Edward Glaeser", "journal": "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "year": "2021", "volumes": "35", "first page": "133", "last page": "150", "DOI": "10.1257/jep.35.2.133"}, {"title": "Inside Terrorism", "authors": "Bruce Hoffman", "journal": "Columbia University Press", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
