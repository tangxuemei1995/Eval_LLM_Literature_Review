{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of police killings in the United States has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate, particularly when viewed through a comparative lens with other nations. The United States is often highlighted for its high rates of fatal police violence (FPV) compared to other developed countries. However, this issue is not unique to the U.S., as several countries in the Americas also exhibit high levels of FPV. This literature review explores the factors contributing to these patterns, focusing on gun violence, ethnoracial inequality, and the structure of policing.\n\nOne of the primary factors associated with high FPV rates is the prevalence of gun violence. In the United States, the widespread availability of firearms and the high incidence of gun-related crimes create an environment where police officers often perceive a heightened threat to their safety. This perception can lead to a greater reliance on deadly force as a preemptive measure (Hemenway, 2017). The correlation between gun prevalence and police use of force is supported by studies that show a direct relationship between the number of guns in circulation and the frequency of police shootings (Kleck & Gertz, 1995).\n\nEthnoracial inequality and discord are also significant contributors to FPV. In the U.S., racial minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately affected by police violence. This disparity is rooted in historical and systemic inequalities that have fostered mistrust and tension between minority communities and law enforcement (Alexander, 2012). Comparative studies indicate that countries with pronounced ethnoracial divisions tend to experience higher levels of police violence, as these divisions often manifest in discriminatory policing practices (Smith & Holmes, 2014).\n\nThe structure of policing in the United States is another critical factor. The U.S. has a radically decentralized policing system, characterized by a multitude of local law enforcement agencies with significant autonomy. This decentralization can hinder the implementation of standardized training, policies, and accountability measures, potentially leading to inconsistent practices and higher FPV rates (Bayley & Stenning, 2016). In contrast, countries with more centralized policing structures, such as those in Northern Europe, often have lower FPV rates, attributed to uniform training and oversight (Waddington, 1999).\n\nHowever, decentralization is not a necessary condition for high FPV, as evidenced by some Latin American countries with centralized policing systems that still experience high levels of police violence. For instance, Brazil and Mexico have centralized police forces but report high FPV rates due to factors such as corruption, lack of accountability, and socio-economic disparities (Chevigny, 1995). This suggests that while decentralization can exacerbate FPV, it is not the sole determinant.\n\nConversely, countries like Spain and Chile demonstrate that low FPV can be achieved without the extensive resources and training found in wealthier nations. Spain, for example, has implemented community policing strategies and emphasizes de-escalation techniques, contributing to lower FPV rates (Reiner, 2010). Similarly, Chile has focused on police reform and accountability, which has helped reduce incidents of police violence (Frühling, 2003).\n\nThe role of police accountability and oversight is crucial in mitigating FPV. Effective accountability mechanisms, such as independent oversight bodies and transparent investigation processes, can deter excessive use of force and build public trust (Walker, 2005). In countries with robust accountability frameworks, police officers are more likely to adhere to established protocols and less likely to resort to deadly force (Goldsmith, 2005).\n\nIn conclusion, the high rates of police killings in the United States and other countries in the Americas can be attributed to a complex interplay of factors, including gun violence, ethnoracial inequality, and the structure of policing. While decentralization can contribute to higher FPV, it is not an inevitable outcome, as demonstrated by countries with centralized systems that still experience high police violence. Conversely, nations with effective accountability measures and community-oriented policing strategies can achieve lower FPV rates, even without extensive resources. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive reforms that address both structural and socio-cultural dimensions of policing to reduce FPV.", "References": [{"title": "Private Guns, Public Health", "authors": "David Hemenway", "journal": "University of Michigan Press", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Armed and Considered Dangerous: A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms", "authors": "Gary Kleck, Marc Gertz", "journal": "Transaction Publishers", "year": "1995", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "The New Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Race, Ethnicity, and the Criminal Justice System", "authors": "Brad W.
