{"Literature Review": "The study of immigration and crime has long been a subject of interest within the field of criminology. In the early twentieth century, ethnographic studies were at the forefront of this research, providing rich, qualitative insights into the lives of immigrants and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The Chicago School of Sociology, in particular, was instrumental in developing this line of inquiry, with scholars such as Robert E. Park and Ernest W. Burgess pioneering the use of ethnographic methods to study urban environments and the social dynamics within them (Park & Burgess, 1925). These early studies emphasized the importance of understanding the social contexts and lived experiences of immigrants, offering a nuanced perspective that quantitative methods often overlook.\n\nHowever, as the field of criminology evolved, there was a marked shift towards quantitative approaches, driven by the desire for generalizability and statistical rigor. This shift has been critiqued by scholars who argue that it has led to a 'collective amnesia' regarding the value of ethnographic methods (Rios, 2011). Ethnographic studies provide a depth of understanding that is crucial for capturing the complexities of immigration and crime, particularly in the context of contemporary issues such as 'crimmigration'—the intersection of immigration and criminal law (Stumpf, 2006).\n\nRecent ethnographic research has begun to address this gap, focusing on the policing of immigrant communities and the lived experiences of immigrants within deportation and detention regimes. For instance, De Genova (2002) explores the concept of 'deportability' and how it shapes the everyday lives of undocumented immigrants, highlighting the constant threat of deportation as a form of social control. Similarly, Coutin (2005) examines the experiences of Salvadoran immigrants in the United States, emphasizing the legal liminality and precariousness of their existence.\n\nThe integration experiences of Muslim immigrants, a particularly marginalized group, have also been the subject of recent ethnographic studies. These studies reveal the unique challenges faced by Muslim immigrants, including discrimination, social exclusion, and heightened surveillance in the post-9/11 era (Cainkar, 2009). Such research underscores the importance of ethnographic methods in capturing the lived realities of marginalized populations, providing insights that are often missed by quantitative analyses.\n\nMoreover, ethnographic studies have shed light on the vulnerabilities of immigrants to victimization. Immigrants often face unique risks due to their legal status, language barriers, and lack of familiarity with the legal system. Menjívar and Abrego (2012) discuss how these factors contribute to the victimization of immigrants, particularly in the context of domestic violence and labor exploitation. Ethnographic research is crucial for understanding these dynamics, as it allows for an in-depth exploration of the social and cultural factors that influence immigrants' experiences of crime and victimization.\n\nIn conclusion, while quantitative methods have dominated contemporary criminology, there is a growing recognition of the value of ethnographic approaches in the study of immigration and crime. Ethnographic studies provide a rich, contextualized understanding of the complexities of immigrants' lives, offering insights that are essential for developing effective policies and interventions. As the field continues to evolve, it is imperative that scholars embrace a diverse range of methodologies, including ethnography, to fully capture the nuances of immigration and crime in the modern era.", "References": [{"title": "The City", "authors": "Robert E.
