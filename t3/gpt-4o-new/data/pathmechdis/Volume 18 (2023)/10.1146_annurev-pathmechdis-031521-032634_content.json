{"Literature Review": "Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, in genetically predisposed individuals. The pathogenesis of CD is intricately linked to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, particularly the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, which are present in the majority of patients with the disease (Sollid et al., 2012). These molecules play a crucial role in the presentation of gluten-derived peptides to CD4+ T cells, which is a key step in the initiation of the immune response in CD (Molberg et al., 1998). \n\nThe immunobiology of CD involves a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses. Upon ingestion, gluten is partially digested in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the formation of immunogenic peptides. These peptides are deamidated by the enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which enhances their binding affinity to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules (Molberg et al., 1998). The presentation of these modified peptides to CD4+ T cells leads to their activation and proliferation, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Sollid et al., 2012). \n\nThe role of B cells and the production of autoantibodies are also critical in the pathogenesis of CD. B cells are activated by gluten-specific T cells and produce antibodies against TG2, which are highly specific for CD and serve as a key diagnostic marker (Dieterich et al., 1997). The presence of these autoantibodies is indicative of the autoimmune nature of the disease, as they target an enzyme that is normally involved in tissue repair and remodeling. \n\nRecent studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of CD. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota have been observed in patients with CD, suggesting that dysbiosis may contribute to the development and progression of the disease (Sjöberg et al., 2013). The gut microbiota is thought to influence the immune response to gluten, potentially by modulating the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and other immune cells (Sjöberg et al., 2013). \n\nThe pathogenesis of CD is also influenced by environmental factors, such as the timing and amount of gluten introduction in the diet, as well as infections and other stressors that may trigger the onset of the disease in genetically susceptible individuals (Lionetti et al., 2014). The interplay between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors underscores the complexity of CD and highlights the need for a multifaceted approach to its diagnosis and management. \n\nAdvances in our understanding of the immunobiology of CD have led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the immune response to gluten. These include the use of gluten-specific enzyme therapies to degrade immunogenic peptides, the development of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 blockers to prevent peptide presentation, and the use of probiotics to restore gut microbiota balance (Lindfors et al., 2008). \n\nIn conclusion, celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder with a well-characterized immunopathogenesis involving the interplay of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. The disease is characterized by a specific immune response to gluten, mediated by HLA-DQ2/DQ8-restricted T cells and the production of TG2 autoantibodies. Ongoing research into the immunobiology of CD continues to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the disease and offers hope for the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.", "References": [{"title": "Celiac disease: genetics, pathogenesis and complications", "authors": "Ludvig M.
