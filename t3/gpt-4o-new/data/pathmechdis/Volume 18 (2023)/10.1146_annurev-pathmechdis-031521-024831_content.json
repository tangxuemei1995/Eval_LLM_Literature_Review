{"Literature Review": "The liver is a central organ in metabolic regulation, responsible for a wide array of functions including nutrient metabolism, detoxification, and protein synthesis. The concept of metabolic liver zonation refers to the spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolic functions across different zones of the liver lobule. This zonation is crucial for the efficient execution of complex metabolic processes and is influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The spatial aspect of liver zonation is primarily dictated by the gradient of oxygen, hormones, and nutrients from the portal triad to the central vein, which results in distinct metabolic profiles in periportal and pericentral hepatocytes (Jungermann and Kietzmann, 1996). Periportal hepatocytes are primarily involved in gluconeogenesis, urea synthesis, and beta-oxidation, while pericentral hepatocytes are more active in glycolysis, lipogenesis, and xenobiotic metabolism (Gebhardt and Matz-Soja, 2014). This division of labor is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and is regulated by signaling pathways such as WNT/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and Notch (Benhamouche et al., 2006; Burke et al., 2009). The temporal aspect of liver zonation is closely linked to the circadian rhythm, which orchestrates the timing of metabolic processes to align with feeding and fasting cycles. The liver's circadian clock regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, thereby optimizing energy utilization and storage (Kornmann et al., 2007). Disruption of the circadian rhythm can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting the importance of temporal regulation in liver function (Panda et al., 2002). Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation. These technologies have revealed the existence of distinct gene expression profiles in different liver zones and have identified key regulatory networks involved in zonation (Halpern et al., 2017). For instance, the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway has been shown to play a pivotal role in establishing and maintaining pericentral zonation by regulating the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and ammonia detoxification (Benhamouche et al., 2006). Moreover, the interplay between circadian and metabolic signals is crucial for the dynamic regulation of liver zonation. The nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, a component of the circadian clock, has been implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis, linking circadian rhythms to metabolic liver zonation (Zhang et al., 2010). Disruption of spatiotemporal liver zonation can have profound consequences on liver pathophysiology. For example, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with altered zonation of lipid metabolism, leading to excessive lipid accumulation and inflammation in the liver (Govaere et al., 2014). Similarly, impaired zonation of glucose metabolism has been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, as it affects the liver's ability to regulate blood glucose levels (Rui, 2014). Furthermore, the loss of zonation in detoxification pathways can increase susceptibility to liver injury from drugs and environmental toxins (Gebhardt and Matz-Soja, 2014). Understanding the mechanisms that govern spatiotemporal liver zonation is therefore critical for developing therapeutic strategies for metabolic liver diseases. Targeting key signaling pathways involved in zonation, such as WNT/β-catenin and circadian regulators, holds promise for restoring normal liver function in disease states (Burke et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010). In conclusion, spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation is a fundamental aspect of liver physiology that ensures the efficient execution of metabolic processes. Disruption of this zonation can lead to a range of metabolic disorders, underscoring the importance of understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Recent technological advances have provided new insights into the molecular basis of liver zonation, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches to treat liver diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Liver zonation: Novel aspects of its regulation and its impact on homeostasis", "authors": "Gebhardt, R., Matz-Soja, M.", "journal": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "20", "first page": "8491", "last page": "8504", "DOI": "10.3748/wjg.v20.i26.8491"}, {"title": "Wnt/β-catenin signaling controls liver zonation and expansion of hepatocytes during liver development", "authors": "Benhamouche, S., Decaens, T., Godard, C., Chambrey, R., Rickman, D.
