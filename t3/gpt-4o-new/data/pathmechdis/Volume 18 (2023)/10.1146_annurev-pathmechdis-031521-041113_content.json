{"Literature Review": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major health concern worldwide, with its pathogenesis intricately linked to metabolic reprogramming. This reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, enabling CRC cells to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by optimizing nutrient uptake and waste removal. The primary cells of origin for CRC, intestinal stem cells (ISCs), undergo significant metabolic adaptations as they progress through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. These adaptations are influenced by the complex microenvironment of the intestine, which includes interactions with epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Understanding the metabolic pathways involved in CRC can provide insights into potential prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nThe Warburg effect, characterized by increased glycolysis and lactate production even in the presence of oxygen, is a well-documented metabolic feature of cancer cells, including CRC (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). This metabolic shift supports rapid cell proliferation by providing intermediates for biosynthetic pathways. In CRC, the Warburg effect is complemented by alterations in lipid metabolism, which are crucial for membrane synthesis and energy production (Santos and Schulze, 2012). Additionally, glutamine metabolism is upregulated in CRC, providing nitrogen for nucleotide synthesis and supporting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Wise and Thompson, 2010).\n\nISCs, the cells of origin for CRC, exhibit unique metabolic characteristics that are essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. These cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production under normal conditions but switch to glycolysis during rapid proliferation (Schepers et al., 2012). This metabolic flexibility is crucial for ISC function and is influenced by the surrounding microenvironment, including interactions with the microbiome and dietary components.\n\nDiet plays a significant role in CRC pathogenesis, with high-fat and low-fiber diets being associated with increased CRC risk (Brennan et al., 2010). Dietary components can modulate the gut microbiome, which in turn influences CRC metabolism. For instance, a high-fat diet can lead to dysbiosis, promoting the growth of pro-inflammatory bacteria that produce metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which have been implicated in CRC development (Louis et al., 2014). Conversely, diets rich in fiber promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties (Pryde et al., 2002).\n\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) in CRC is a dynamic entity composed of various cell types, including immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, as well as extracellular matrix components. The TME influences CRC metabolism by providing growth factors, cytokines, and metabolites that support tumor growth and survival (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). For example, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the TME can secrete lactate, which is taken up by CRC cells and used as an energy source (Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2011). Additionally, immune cells in the TME can produce cytokines that modulate CRC cell metabolism, promoting tumor progression (Gajewski et al., 2013).\n\nGenetic mutations in CRC also play a critical role in metabolic reprogramming. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, a common early event in CRC, lead to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is associated with increased glycolysis and glutamine metabolism (Sansom et al., 2007). Similarly, mutations in the KRAS and TP53 genes, which occur later in CRC progression, further enhance metabolic reprogramming by promoting anabolic pathways and inhibiting apoptosis (Yun et al., 2009).\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that modifiable environmental factors, such as diet, can influence CRC metabolism and the TME, thereby affecting tumorigenesis. For instance, dietary interventions that alter the gut microbiome composition can modulate CRC metabolism and reduce tumor growth (Zhu et al., 2013). Understanding the mechanistic links between diet, microbiome, and CRC metabolism is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the metabolism of CRC is a complex interplay between genetic mutations, dietary factors, and the tumor microenvironment. ISCs, as the cells of origin for CRC, exhibit metabolic flexibility that is crucial for tumor initiation and progression. Dietary components and the gut microbiome significantly influence CRC metabolism, highlighting the potential for dietary interventions in CRC prevention and treatment. Further research into the metabolic pathways involved in CRC and their interactions with environmental factors will provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic targets.", "References": [{"title": "Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation", "authors": "Matthew G.
