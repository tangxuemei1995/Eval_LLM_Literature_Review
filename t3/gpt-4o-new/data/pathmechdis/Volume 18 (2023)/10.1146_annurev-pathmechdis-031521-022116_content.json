{"Literature Review": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-bound particles released by cells, including tumor cells, into the extracellular environment. These vesicles are increasingly recognized as critical players in the tumor microenvironment, facilitating communication between cancer cells and their surroundings. EVs are classified into different types, including exosomes and microvesicles, based on their size, biogenesis, and release pathways. Exosomes, typically 30-150 nm in diameter, originate from the endosomal compartment, while microvesicles, ranging from 100 nm to 1 µm, bud directly from the plasma membrane (Théry et al., 2009). \n\nThe cargo of EVs is diverse and includes proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids such as mRNA, microRNA, and DNA. This cargo reflects the cell of origin and can influence recipient cells upon uptake. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to carry oncogenic proteins and RNAs that can modulate the behavior of recipient cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis (Peinado et al., 2012). For instance, EVs can transfer oncogenic microRNAs to stromal cells, reprogramming them to support tumor growth and invasion (Zhang et al., 2015). \n\nOne of the critical roles of tumor-derived EVs is in the preparation of the premetastatic niche. EVs can condition distant organs to become more receptive to metastatic cells by altering the local microenvironment. This process involves the modulation of immune cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, creating a supportive niche for incoming cancer cells (Hoshino et al., 2015). Additionally, EVs can facilitate immune evasion by carrying immune checkpoint molecules or by modulating the activity of immune cells, thereby allowing tumor cells to escape immune surveillance (Whiteside, 2016). \n\nThe heterogeneity of EVs is another aspect that has garnered significant attention. The composition and quantity of EVs can vary depending on the tumor type, stage, and response to treatment. This variability has led to the exploration of EVs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Liquid biopsies, which analyze EVs in body fluids, offer a non-invasive method to monitor tumor dynamics and treatment response (Kalluri, 2016). Studies have demonstrated that specific EV-associated proteins and RNAs can serve as indicators of disease state and progression, providing valuable insights into patient stratification and personalized therapy (Taylor and Gercel-Taylor, 2008). \n\nMoreover, the therapeutic potential of EVs is being explored. Engineered EVs can be used to deliver therapeutic agents directly to tumor cells, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing treatment efficacy. This approach leverages the natural targeting capabilities of EVs, which can be modified to carry drugs, RNA molecules, or proteins to specific cell types (El Andaloussi et al., 2013). \n\nDespite the promising applications of EVs in cancer, several challenges remain. The isolation and characterization of EVs require standardized methods to ensure reproducibility and accuracy. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms governing EV biogenesis, release, and uptake is crucial for harnessing their full potential in clinical settings (Yáñez-Mó et al., 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, tumor-derived EVs are multifunctional entities that play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment. They facilitate intercellular communication, modulate immune responses, and contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. The potential of EVs as biomarkers and therapeutic vehicles offers exciting opportunities for advancing cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, further research is needed to overcome current challenges and fully realize the clinical applications of EVs.", "References": [{"title": "Exosomes: composition, biogenesis and function", "authors": "Théry, Clotilde; Ostrowski, Matias; Segura, Elodie", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "581", "last page": "593", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2567"}, {"title": "Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET", "authors": "Peinado, Héctor; Alečković, Maša; Lavotshkin, Sergey; Matei, Irina; Costa-Silva, Bruno; Moreno-Bueno, Gema; Hergueta-Redondo, Marta; Williams, Caitlin; García-Santos, Guillermo; Ghajar, Cyrus M.", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "18", "first page": "883", "last page": "891", "DOI": "10.1038/nm.2753"}, {"title": "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells", "authors": "Zhang, Y; Liu, D; Chen, X; Li, J; Li, L; Bian, Z; Sun, F; Lu, J; Yin, Y; Cai, X", "journal": "Nature Cell Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "17", "first page": "728", "last page": "739", "DOI": "10.1038/ncb3164"}, {"title": "Tumour exosome integrins determine organotropic metastasis", "authors": "Hoshino, Ayuko; Costa-Silva, Bruno; Shen, Tang-Long; Rodrigues, Gonçalo; Hashimoto, Ayako; Tesic Mark, Martina; Molina, Henrik; Kohsaka, Shinji; Di Giannatale, Angela; Ceder, Staffan", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "527", "first page": "329", "last page": "335", "DOI": "10.1038/nature15756"}, {"title": "Exosomes and tumor-mediated immune suppression", "authors": "Whiteside, Theresa L.", "journal": "The Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2016", "volumes": "126", "first page": "1216", "last page": "1223", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI81137"}, {"title": "The biology, function, and biomedical applications of exosomes", "authors": "Kalluri, Raghu", "journal": "Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "367", "first page": "eaau6977", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aau6977"}, {"title": "MicroRNA signatures of tumor-derived exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers of ovarian cancer", "authors": "Taylor, Douglas D.; Gercel-Taylor, Beverly", "journal": "Gynecologic Oncology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "110", "first page": "13", "last page": "21", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ygyno.2008.04.033"}, {"title": "Exosome-mediated delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo", "authors": "El Andaloussi, Samir; Mäger, Imre; Breakefield, Xandra O.; Wood, Matthew J.
