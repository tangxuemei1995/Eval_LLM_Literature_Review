{"Literature Review": "Emotion regulation within intimate relationships is a complex and dynamic process that evolves across the lifespan. This review synthesizes current research on emotion regulation in couples, emphasizing its significance across different stages of adulthood. Emotion regulation in couples is characterized by its dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, and bivalent nature. These qualities underscore the complexity of emotional exchanges between partners, where emotions are not only regulated individually but also in response to each other (Butler & Randall, 2013). The dynamic nature of emotion regulation in couples is evident in how partners influence each other's emotional states, often leading to a coregulatory process where both partners work together to manage emotions (Schoebi, 2008). This bidirectional influence highlights the importance of understanding emotion regulation as a shared process rather than an individual endeavor. \n\nThe socioemotional selectivity theory provides a framework for understanding how emotion regulation in couples may change with age. According to this theory, as people age, they prioritize emotionally meaningful goals and experiences, which can lead to improved emotion regulation in relationships (Carstensen, 1995). Older adults tend to focus more on positive interactions and are better at avoiding conflicts, which can enhance relationship satisfaction and stability (Charles & Carstensen, 2010). This shift in focus is supported by findings that older couples exhibit greater emotional stability and are more adept at managing conflicts compared to younger couples (Birditt & Fingerman, 2003). \n\nA life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples reveals that the ability to regulate emotions evolves from infancy through late adulthood. In infancy, emotion regulation is primarily dependent on caregivers, but as individuals mature, they develop more sophisticated strategies for managing emotions (Thompson, 1994). During adolescence and young adulthood, individuals begin to form romantic relationships, where emotion regulation becomes crucial for relationship development and maintenance (Collins & Steinberg, 2006). In midlife, couples often face stressors such as parenting and career demands, which can challenge emotion regulation but also provide opportunities for growth and resilience (Repetti et al., 2009). In late life, emotion regulation in couples may become more important as partners rely on each other for emotional support and companionship (Antonucci et al., 2010). \n\nThe transition from 'me to us' in emotion regulation across adulthood suggests that as individuals age, they become more attuned to their partner's emotional needs and more skilled at regulating emotions in a way that benefits the relationship as a whole (Sbarra & Hazan, 2008). This shift is associated with better relationship outcomes, including increased relationship satisfaction, well-being, and health (Pietromonaco et al., 2013). Research indicates that effective emotion regulation in couples can buffer against the negative effects of stress and contribute to better physical and mental health outcomes (Kiecolt-Glaser & Wilson, 2017). \n\nDespite these advances, there are still gaps in our understanding of emotion regulation in couples across adulthood. Future research should explore the mechanisms underlying the shift from individual to dyadic emotion regulation and how these processes are influenced by cultural, social, and contextual factors. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed to examine how emotion regulation strategies evolve over time and their impact on relationship trajectories. Understanding these dynamics can inform interventions aimed at enhancing emotion regulation skills in couples, ultimately improving relationship quality and individual well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, emotion regulation in couples is a multifaceted process that plays a critical role in relationship functioning across adulthood. As individuals age, they become more adept at regulating emotions in a way that enhances relationship satisfaction and stability. The socioemotional selectivity theory provides a valuable framework for understanding these changes, highlighting the importance of emotionally meaningful interactions in later life. Future research should continue to explore the complexities of emotion regulation in couples, with a focus on the dynamic interplay between individual and dyadic processes.", "References": [{"title": "The dynamics of emotion regulation in couples: A contextual perspective", "authors": "Butler, Emily A., Randall, Ashley K.", "journal": "Emotion Review", "year": "2013", "volumes": "5", "first page": "202", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1177/1754073912461627"}, {"title": "The coregulation of emotions in marriage: A dynamic systems perspective", "authors": "Schoebi, Dominik", "journal": "Journal of Family Psychology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "22", "first page": "595", "last page": "604", "DOI": "10.1037/a0013176"}, {"title": "Motivation for social contact across the life span: A theory of socioemotional selectivity", "authors": "Carstensen, Laura L.", "journal": "Nebraska Symposium on Motivation", "year": "1995", "volumes": "42", "first page": "209", "last page": "254", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7_7"}, {"title": "Social and emotional aging", "authors": "Charles, Susan T., Carstensen, Laura L.", "journal": "Annual Review of Psychology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "61", "first page": "383", "last page": "409", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100448"}, {"title": "Age differences in interpersonal problems: How older and younger adults experience interpersonal tension", "authors": "Birditt, Kira S., Fingerman, Karen L.", "journal": "Psychology and Aging", "year": "2003", "volumes": "18", "first page": "540", "last page": "553", "DOI": "10.1037/0882-7974.18.3.540"}, {"title": "Emotion regulation: A theme in search of definition", "authors": "Thompson, Ross A.", "journal": "Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development", "year": "1994", "volumes": "59", "first page": "25", "last page": "52", "DOI": "10.2307/1166137"}, {"title": "Adolescent romantic relationships", "authors": "Collins, W.
