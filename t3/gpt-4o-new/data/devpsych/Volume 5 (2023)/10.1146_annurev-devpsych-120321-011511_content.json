{"Literature Review": "Adolescence is a critical developmental period characterized by significant biological, cognitive, and social changes. This phase is marked by the onset of puberty, which triggers a cascade of hormonal changes that influence brain development and behavior (Blakemore, 2012). The maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which continues into the mid-20s, is particularly important as it underpins executive functions such as decision-making, impulse control, and social cognition (Casey et al., 2008). However, adolescence is also a period of heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders, with many conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders often emerging during this time (Kessler et al., 2005). The neuroecosocial perspective integrates insights from developmental cognitive neuroscience with an understanding of the broader social and environmental contexts that influence adolescent development. This approach recognizes that brain development does not occur in isolation but is deeply embedded within social and cultural contexts (Steinberg, 2008). Socioeconomic inequality is a significant social determinant of adolescent mental health. Adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at increased risk for mental health problems, partly due to the stress associated with economic hardship and limited access to resources (Reiss, 2013). Neuroimaging studies have shown that socioeconomic status can influence brain development, with lower socioeconomic status being associated with differences in brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in stress regulation and cognitive control (Noble et al., 2015). Urbanicity, or living in urban environments, is another factor that has been linked to adolescent mental health. Urban living is associated with increased exposure to stressors such as noise, pollution, and social density, which can contribute to mental health problems (Peen et al., 2010). Research has shown that adolescents living in urban areas have a higher prevalence of mental health disorders compared to their rural counterparts (Vassos et al., 2012). The impact of urbanicity on brain development is an emerging area of research, with studies suggesting that urban living may affect brain regions involved in processing social stress (Lederbogen et al., 2011). The climate crisis and associated eco-anxiety represent a growing concern for adolescent mental health. Eco-anxiety refers to the chronic fear of environmental doom and is particularly prevalent among young people who are increasingly aware of the impacts of climate change (Clayton, 2020). The psychological impact of climate change on adolescents is profound, as they face the prospect of inheriting a planet in crisis. This anxiety can exacerbate existing mental health issues and contribute to new ones (Hickman et al., 2021). The neuroecosocial perspective emphasizes the importance of considering these broader environmental factors when examining adolescent brain development and mental health. Youth-led methods, which involve engaging young people in research and decision-making processes, are crucial for understanding the unique challenges faced by adolescents today. These methods empower young people to voice their concerns and contribute to solutions, fostering resilience and agency (Lansdown, 2010). Involving adolescents in research can provide valuable insights into their lived experiences and the social determinants of their mental health. In conclusion, the neuroecosocial perspective provides a comprehensive framework for understanding adolescent development by integrating biological, social, and environmental factors. This approach highlights the importance of considering the broader societal context in which adolescents develop, including socioeconomic inequality, urbanicity, and the climate crisis. By adopting this perspective, researchers and policymakers can better address the mental health challenges faced by adolescents and promote positive developmental outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Development of the adolescent brain: implications for executive function and social cognition", "authors": "Sarah-Jayne Blakemore", "journal": "Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "53", "first page": "336", "last page": "346", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02460.x"}, {"title": "The adolescent brain: A work in progress", "authors": "B.
