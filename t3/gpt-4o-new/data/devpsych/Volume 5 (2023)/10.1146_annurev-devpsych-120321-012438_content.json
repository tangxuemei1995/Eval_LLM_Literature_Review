{"Literature Review": "The journey from a non-traditional STEM field to a career in developmental science, particularly for an African American woman in the mid-20th century, is a narrative that intertwines personal resilience, identity formation, and the socio-political context of the time. This literature review explores the intersection of these themes through the lens of the phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST), a framework that emphasizes the dynamic interplay between individual experiences and broader ecological contexts. \n\nThe PVEST framework, developed by Margaret Beale Spencer, provides a comprehensive approach to understanding how individuals navigate high-vulnerability situations and express resilience (Spencer, 1995). This theory builds on Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, which posits that human development is influenced by different types of environmental systems (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). PVEST extends this by incorporating phenomenological perspectives, focusing on how individuals perceive and interpret their experiences within these systems. This is particularly relevant for understanding the experiences of African American women, whose developmental trajectories are often shaped by intersecting systems of race, gender, and socio-economic status (Spencer, 2006).\n\nThe historical context of the post-World War II era in the United States was marked by significant racial inequities, which profoundly affected the lives of African Americans. Policies such as redlining and segregation in education and employment created systemic barriers that required African American families to develop coping strategies to navigate these challenges (Massey & Denton, 1993). The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s further highlighted the resilience and agency of African Americans in challenging these inequities and advocating for social justice (Branch, 1988).\n\nIn this context, the role of family and community support systems becomes crucial. Research has shown that strong familial bonds and community networks can provide essential resources and emotional support, fostering resilience in the face of adversity (Hill, 1999). For African American women, these support systems often include extended family members and community leaders who serve as role models and mentors (Collins, 2000). These relationships can help individuals develop a positive sense of identity and self-efficacy, which are critical components of resilience (Spencer et al., 1997).\n\nThe concept of identity is central to PVEST and is particularly relevant for understanding the experiences of African American women in STEM fields. Identity formation is a complex process influenced by personal experiences, social interactions, and cultural contexts (Erikson, 1968). For African American women, this process is often complicated by the need to navigate multiple identities, including those related to race, gender, and professional roles (Settles, 2006). Research has shown that a strong sense of racial and gender identity can serve as a protective factor, enhancing resilience and promoting academic and career success (Cross, 1991).\n\nThe educational experiences of African American women in STEM fields also play a significant role in shaping their career trajectories. Historically, these fields have been characterized by a lack of diversity and inclusion, creating additional barriers for women of color (Ong et al., 2011). However, supportive learning environments that promote diversity and inclusion can help mitigate these challenges, providing opportunities for African American women to thrive in STEM careers (Johnson, 2007). Mentorship programs and initiatives that connect students with role models in their fields have been shown to be particularly effective in supporting the success of underrepresented groups in STEM (Maton et al., 2000).\n\nThe ongoing challenges faced by African American women in developmental science and other STEM fields underscore the importance of committed positionality, which involves acknowledging and addressing the persistent inequities that affect youth and communities of color. This commitment requires a critical examination of existing policies and practices, as well as the development of new strategies to promote equity and inclusion (Banks, 2006). By centering the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups, researchers and practitioners can contribute to a more just and equitable society.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey from a non-traditional STEM field to a career in developmental science for an African American woman is a testament to the power of resilience, identity, and community support. The PVEST framework provides a valuable lens for understanding this journey, highlighting the complex interplay between individual experiences and broader ecological contexts. As the field of developmental science continues to evolve, it is essential to recognize and address the unique challenges and opportunities faced by African American women and other underrepresented groups, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to reach their full potential.", "References": [{"title": "Phenomenology and ecological systems theory: Developmental implications", "authors": "Margaret Beale Spencer", "journal": "Child Development", "year": "1995", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1892", "last page": "1909", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00974.x"}, {"title": "The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design", "authors": "Urie Bronfenbrenner", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "1979", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "American apartheid: Segregation and the making of the underclass", "authors": "Douglas S.
