{"Literature Review": "The study of third-party helping interactions in infancy has garnered significant attention in developmental psychology, as it provides insights into the early development of social cognition and moral reasoning. Infants' ability to understand and interpret helping behaviors is a complex process that involves several cognitive prerequisites. This literature review aims to synthesize current research on how infants perceive and interpret helping interactions, and to explore theoretical frameworks that explain these processes. \n\nResearch has shown that infants as young as six months can distinguish between helping and hindering behaviors. Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom (2007) demonstrated that infants prefer individuals who help others over those who hinder them, suggesting an early sensitivity to prosocial behavior. This preference indicates that infants may possess an innate or early-developing ability to evaluate social interactions based on the actions' outcomes for others. \n\nThe mature concept of helping, as understood by adults, involves a second-order, goal-directed action aimed at increasing the utility of another agent by reducing the cost or increasing the reward of the Helpee's goal-directed action. This understanding requires complex cognitive processes, including goal attribution and utility calculus. However, it is unclear whether infants possess these sophisticated cognitive abilities. \n\nOne theoretical account suggests that infants understand helping as enabling, which involves second-order goal attribution but does not require utility calculus. This perspective posits that infants recognize the helper's action as facilitating the Helpee's goal achievement without necessarily evaluating the efficiency or utility of the action. Sommerville and Woodward (2005) found that infants can attribute goals to others and understand the means by which these goals are achieved, supporting the notion that infants may perceive helping as enabling. \n\nAnother account proposes that infants interpret helping as joint action, which requires an evaluation of efficiency or utility but does not demand second-order goal attribution. This perspective suggests that infants focus on the outcome of the interaction and the coordination between the helper and the Helpee. Warneken and Tomasello (2007) observed that infants engage in joint activities and can coordinate their actions with others to achieve a common goal, indicating that they may understand helping as a form of joint action. \n\nThe developmental pathway toward the mature concept of helping likely involves a gradual integration of these simpler understandings. Infants may initially perceive helping as enabling or joint action, and over time, develop the ability to integrate goal attribution and utility calculus into their understanding of helping interactions. This developmental trajectory aligns with the broader literature on the development of theory of mind and social cognition, which suggests that children's understanding of others' mental states becomes more sophisticated with age and experience (Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). \n\nDespite these insights, several open questions remain in the literature on infants' interpretation of helping interactions. For instance, it is unclear how cultural and environmental factors influence the development of helping concepts in infancy. Additionally, the role of language and communication in shaping infants' understanding of helping behaviors warrants further investigation. \n\nIn conclusion, the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy is a multifaceted process that involves various cognitive abilities. While infants may not possess the mature concept of helping, they demonstrate an early sensitivity to prosocial behaviors and can interpret helping actions through simpler frameworks such as enabling and joint action. Future research should continue to explore the developmental pathways and factors that contribute to the emergence of a mature understanding of helping in infancy.", "References": [{"title": "Social evaluation by preverbal infants", "authors": "Hamlin, J.
