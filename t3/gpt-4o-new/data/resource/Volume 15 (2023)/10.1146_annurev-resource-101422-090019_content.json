{"Literature Review": "The management of crop residues is a critical issue in agricultural economics, with significant implications for environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. Globally, more than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually, with a substantial portion being burned, particularly in Asian countries (Lal, 2005). This practice not only contributes to air pollution and health hazards but also limits the recycling of essential soil nutrients, posing a significant challenge to sustainable agriculture (Gupta et al., 2004). The economic rationale behind the unsustainable management of crop residues is multifaceted, involving factors such as local demand, technological development, and policy frameworks. \n\nOne of the primary economic factors influencing residue management is the local demand for crop residues. In many regions, residues are used as fodder, fuel, and raw material for various industries, which can provide significant economic benefits to farmers (Singh et al., 2010). However, when the supply of residues exceeds local demand, farmers often resort to burning as a cost-effective disposal method. This is particularly prevalent in regions with high production of rice and wheat, where the rapid turnover between cropping seasons leaves little time for alternative residue management practices (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005). \n\nThe development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residues are crucial for sustainable management. Technologies such as no-till farming, mulching, and bioenergy production can provide alternative uses for crop residues, reducing the need for burning (Jat et al., 2014). However, the adoption of these technologies is often hindered by economic barriers, including high initial costs, lack of access to credit, and insufficient technical knowledge among farmers (Kumar et al., 2015). Moreover, smallholder farmers, who constitute a significant portion of the agricultural workforce in developing countries, may lack the resources to invest in such technologies, further exacerbating the problem (Pretty et al., 2011). \n\nMarket and policy instruments play a vital role in internalizing the social costs of residue burning. Policies that promote the use of crop residues in bioenergy production, for instance, can create new markets and provide economic incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices (Popp et al., 2014). Additionally, subsidies and financial incentives for the adoption of residue management technologies can help offset the initial costs and encourage wider adoption (Ghosh et al., 2015). However, the effectiveness of these policies depends on their design and implementation, as well as the level of public awareness and support. \n\nPublic awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning is essential for driving change. Educational campaigns and extension services can play a significant role in informing farmers about the environmental and health impacts of residue burning, as well as the economic benefits of alternative management practices (Ravindra et al., 2019). Furthermore, involving local communities in the development and implementation of residue management strategies can enhance their effectiveness and sustainability (Sharma et al., 2010). \n\nIn conclusion, the economics of crop residue management is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Addressing the economic barriers to sustainable residue management involves not only technological and policy interventions but also efforts to increase public awareness and engagement. By understanding the economic factors that drive unsustainable practices, policymakers and stakeholders can develop more effective strategies to promote sustainable agriculture and mitigate the environmental impacts of residue burning.", "References": [{"title": "World crop residues production and implications of its use as a biofuel", "authors": "Lal, R.", "journal": "Environment International", "year": "2005", "volumes": "31", "first page": "575", "last page": "584", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envint.2004.09.005"}, {"title": "Sustainable management of crop residues in rice-wheat cropping system", "authors": "Gupta, R.K., Hobbs, P.R., Sayre, K.", "journal": "Advances in Agronomy", "year": "2004", "volumes": "85", "first page": "269", "last page": "407", "DOI": "10.1016/S0065-2113(04)85006-5"}, {"title": "Utilization of crop residues for sustainable crop production", "authors": "Singh, Y., Sidhu, H.S., Singh, M.", "journal": "Indian Journal of Ecology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "37", "first page": "1", "last page": "9", "DOI": "N/A"}, {"title": "Managing crop residues in the rice-wheat system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains", "authors": "Yadvinder-Singh, Bijay-Singh, Ladha, J.K.", "journal": "Journal of Crop Improvement", "year": "2005", "volumes": "14", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1300/J411v14n01_07"}, {"title": "Conservation agriculture in the semi-arid tropics: prospects and problems", "authors": "Jat, R.A., Wani, S.P., Sahrawat, K.L.", "journal": "Advances in Agronomy", "year": "2014", "volumes": "121", "first page": "191", "last page": "273", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-800138-7.00003-0"}, {"title": "Economic analysis of crop residue management in India", "authors": "Kumar, P., Kumar, S., Joshi, L.", "journal": "Resources, Conservation and Recycling", "year": "2015", "volumes": "105", "first page": "55", "last page": "65", "DOI": "10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.10.002"}, {"title": "The top 100 questions of importance to the future of global agriculture", "authors": "Pretty, J., Sutherland, W.J., Ashby, J.", "journal": "International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability", "year": "2011", "volumes": "8", "first page": "219", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.3763/ijas.2010.0534"}, {"title": "The role of bioenergy in the bioeconomy", "authors": "Popp, J., Lakner, Z., Harangi-RÃ¡kos, M.", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2014", "volumes": "32", "first page": "559", "last page": "578", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.056"}, {"title": "Crop residue management and its impact on soil fertility", "authors": "Ghosh, P.K., Ramesh, P., Bandyopadhyay, K.K.", "journal": "Indian Journal of Agronomy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "60", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "N/A"}, {"title": "Air pollution in India: bridging the gap between science and policy", "authors": "Ravindra, K., Singh, T., Mor, S.", "journal": "Journal of Hazardous Materials", "year": "2019", "volumes": "378", "first page": "120", "last page": "128", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.05.072"}]}
