{"Literature Review": "Obesity is a growing global health concern, with significant implications for life expectancy and overall public health. The prevalence of obesity has been increasing worldwide, with notable differences between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, obesity rates are often higher due to factors such as sedentary lifestyles, high-calorie diets, and urbanization (Ng et al., 2014). In contrast, developing countries are experiencing a rapid increase in obesity rates as they undergo economic transitions, leading to changes in dietary patterns and physical activity levels (Popkin, 2012). This literature review explores the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy, considering sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic consequences, health effects, and public policies.\n\nThe relationship between obesity and life expectancy is complex and multifaceted. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, which can negatively impact life expectancy (Flegal et al., 2013). A meta-analysis by Flegal et al. (2013) found that obesity is linked to a higher all-cause mortality risk, particularly among individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher. However, the impact of obesity on life expectancy can vary significantly between developed and developing countries due to differences in healthcare systems, access to medical care, and the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities (Kelly et al., 2008).\n\nIn developed countries, the healthcare infrastructure is generally better equipped to manage obesity-related health issues, potentially mitigating some of the negative effects of obesity on life expectancy (Kelly et al., 2008). For instance, advanced medical treatments and preventive care can help manage conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, which are common among obese individuals. However, despite these advantages, the overall life expectancy in developed countries can still be adversely affected by high obesity rates, as the healthcare system may become overburdened, leading to increased healthcare costs and reduced quality of care (Wang et al., 2011).\n\nIn contrast, developing countries often face challenges in addressing obesity-related health issues due to limited healthcare resources and infrastructure (Popkin, 2012). The rapid increase in obesity rates in these countries can exacerbate existing health disparities and strain already limited healthcare systems. Additionally, the double burden of malnutrition, where undernutrition and obesity coexist, further complicates the health landscape in developing countries (Popkin, 2012). This dual burden can lead to a paradoxical situation where life expectancy is negatively impacted by both undernutrition and obesity-related diseases.\n\nGender differences also play a crucial role in the relationship between obesity and life expectancy. Studies have shown that the impact of obesity on mortality risk can differ between men and women, with women often experiencing a higher risk of obesity-related diseases (Flegal et al., 2013). Hormonal differences, fat distribution patterns, and social factors may contribute to these gender disparities (Wang et al., 2011). For example, women are more likely to accumulate visceral fat, which is associated with a higher risk of metabolic diseases (Wang et al., 2011).\n\nAt the population level, the association between obesity and life expectancy can differ from individual-level associations. While individual-level studies often focus on the direct health effects of obesity, population-level studies consider broader factors such as socioeconomic status, environmental influences, and public health policies (Ng et al., 2014). For instance, socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and access to healthy foods can influence obesity rates and their impact on life expectancy (Kelly et al., 2008). Public health policies aimed at reducing obesity, such as promoting physical activity and healthy eating, can also play a significant role in mitigating the negative effects of obesity on life expectancy (Swinburn et al., 2011).\n\nVarious policies have been implemented worldwide to address the obesity epidemic, with varying degrees of success. In developed countries, policies often focus on promoting healthy lifestyles through public health campaigns, taxation of sugary drinks, and regulations on food advertising (Swinburn et al., 2011). In developing countries, efforts may include improving access to healthcare, addressing food insecurity, and promoting traditional diets (Popkin, 2012). However, the effectiveness of these policies can be influenced by cultural, economic, and political factors, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to address obesity in different contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, the effects of obesity on life expectancy are heterogeneous, influenced by factors such as country development status, gender, and public policies. While obesity poses a significant threat to life expectancy globally, the impact is more pronounced in developing countries due to limited healthcare resources and the dual burden of malnutrition. Addressing obesity requires comprehensive strategies that consider sociodemographic factors, health systems, and cultural contexts. By understanding the complex relationship between obesity and life expectancy, policymakers can develop more effective interventions to improve health outcomes and extend life expectancy worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980â€“2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013", "authors": "Ng, Marie, Fleming, Tom, Robinson, Margaret, Thomson, Blake, Graetz, Nicholas, Margono, Christopher, Mullany, Erin C., Biryukov, Stan, Abbafati, Cristiana, Abera, Semaw F.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2014", "volumes": "384", "first page": "766", "last page": "781", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8"}, {"title": "The nutrition transition and obesity in the developing world", "authors": "Popkin, Barry M.", "journal": "The Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2012", "volumes": "142", "first page": "871S", "last page": "873S", "DOI": "10.3945/jn.111.154484"}, {"title": "Association of all-cause mortality with overweight and obesity using standard body mass index categories: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Flegal, Katherine M., Kit, Brian K., Orpana, Heather, Graubard, Barry I.", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2013", "volumes": "309", "first page": "71", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2012.113905"}, {"title": "Global burden of obesity in 2005 and projections to 2030", "authors": "Kelly, T., Yang, W., Chen, C.
