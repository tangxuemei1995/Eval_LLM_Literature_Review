{"Literature Review": "Food insecurity in the United States is a multifaceted issue that has garnered significant attention from researchers, policymakers, and public health advocates. The development of the Food Security Module (FSM) has been pivotal in measuring and understanding food insecurity. The FSM, developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the prevalence and severity of food insecurity across the nation (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2019). This tool has enabled researchers to quantify food insecurity and examine its determinants and consequences, thereby informing policy interventions. \n\nThe conceptual model of food insecurity, grounded in consumer choice theory, highlights the qualityâ€“quantity trade-off that households face when resources are constrained. This model posits that food insecurity is not merely a lack of food but involves complex decisions about the quality and quantity of food consumed (Gundersen & Ziliak, 2015). Households experiencing food insecurity often prioritize caloric intake over nutritional quality, leading to diets that are energy-dense but nutrient-poor. This trade-off is influenced by various policy levers, including food assistance programs, which aim to alleviate food insecurity by providing financial resources or direct food aid to vulnerable populations.\n\nEmpirical studies have documented the disparities in food consumption patterns between food-secure and food-insecure households. Research indicates that adults in food-insecure households consume lower-quality diets and experience greater volatility in caloric intake compared to their food-secure counterparts (Leung et al., 2014). This volatility can have significant implications for health outcomes, as inconsistent access to adequate nutrition can exacerbate chronic health conditions and increase the risk of obesity and other diet-related diseases. Furthermore, demographic differences exist within food-insecure populations. For instance, males under 20 years in food-insecure households tend to consume fewer calories, while females in the same age group may consume adequate calories but with poorer nutritional quality (Hanson & Connor, 2014).\n\nFederal food assistance programs play a crucial role in mitigating food insecurity in the United States. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest federal nutrition assistance program, providing financial resources to low-income households to purchase food. Studies have consistently shown that SNAP participation is associated with reduced household food insecurity (Mabli et al., 2013). However, the impact of SNAP on nutritional quality is less clear, with some studies suggesting minimal improvements in diet quality among participants (Gregory et al., 2013).\n\nIn contrast, federal programs targeting children, such as the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP), have demonstrated positive effects on both food security and nutritional quality. These programs provide free or reduced-price meals to children from low-income families, ensuring access to nutritious meals during the school day. Research indicates that participation in these programs is associated with improved dietary intake and reduced food insecurity among children (Gundersen et al., 2012). Similarly, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been effective in enhancing the nutritional quality of diets for pregnant women, infants, and young children, while also reducing food insecurity (Bitler & Currie, 2005).\n\nThe effectiveness of these programs underscores the importance of targeted interventions in addressing food insecurity. While SNAP provides a broad safety net for low-income households, programs like NSLP, SBP, and WIC offer more tailored support that addresses the specific nutritional needs of vulnerable populations. However, challenges remain in ensuring that these programs reach all eligible individuals and that benefits are sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of participants. Additionally, there is a need for ongoing evaluation and adaptation of these programs to respond to changing economic conditions and demographic shifts.\n\nIn conclusion, food insecurity in the United States is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. The development of the FSM has been instrumental in measuring and understanding food insecurity, while federal food assistance programs have played a critical role in alleviating its impact. However, continued research and policy innovation are necessary to address the persistent challenges of food insecurity and to ensure that all Americans have access to sufficient, nutritious food.", "References": [{"title": "Household Food Security in the United States in 2018", "authors": "Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Matthew P.
