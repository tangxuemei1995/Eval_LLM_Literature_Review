{"Literature Review": "Food loss and food waste have become critical issues on the global agenda, particularly since the United Nations and the G20 highlighted their importance in 2015. Despite increased awareness and efforts to address these issues, the challenge remains significant due to the conflation of food loss and food waste in measurements and the lack of comprehensive data. This literature review explores the current understanding of food loss within agrifood systems, examining its measurements, causes, determinants, and potential interventions. \n\nFood loss refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by food suppliers in the chain, excluding retailers, food service providers, and consumers. It typically occurs at the production, post-harvest, and processing stages of the food supply chain. In contrast, food waste occurs at the retail and consumption stages. The distinction between food loss and food waste is crucial for developing targeted interventions, yet many studies and reports continue to aggregate these concepts, leading to a lack of clarity in addressing the specific challenges associated with each (Parfitt et al., 2010). \n\nThe measurement of food loss is fraught with challenges, primarily due to the lack of standardized methodologies and comprehensive data collection. Current estimates of food loss are often based on extrapolations from limited case studies or national statistics, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of global agrifood systems (Gustavsson et al., 2011). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has made efforts to standardize food loss measurements through the development of the Food Loss Index, yet discrepancies remain due to variations in definitions, data collection methods, and reporting standards across countries (FAO, 2019). \n\nThe causes of food loss are multifaceted and vary across different stages of the supply chain. At the production level, factors such as adverse weather conditions, pest infestations, and suboptimal harvesting techniques contribute to significant losses. Post-harvest losses are often attributed to inadequate storage facilities, poor transportation infrastructure, and inefficient processing methods (Hodges et al., 2011). Additionally, market dynamics, such as price volatility and supply chain inefficiencies, can exacerbate food loss by discouraging producers from harvesting or selling their produce (Stuart, 2009). \n\nDeterminants of food loss are influenced by a range of socioeconomic, environmental, and institutional factors. Socioeconomic determinants include the level of technological advancement, access to markets, and the availability of financial resources for investment in infrastructure and technology. Environmental determinants encompass climate variability, water scarcity, and land degradation, which can impact agricultural productivity and post-harvest handling (Kummu et al., 2012). Institutional determinants involve the regulatory framework, policy environment, and the capacity of institutions to implement and enforce food loss reduction strategies (Buzby and Hyman, 2012). \n\nInterventions to reduce food loss have been proposed at various levels of the agrifood system. Technological interventions, such as improved storage facilities, better packaging materials, and advanced processing techniques, can significantly reduce post-harvest losses (Kitinoja et al., 2011). Policy interventions, including the development of food loss reduction strategies, investment in infrastructure, and the promotion of market access for smallholder farmers, are essential for creating an enabling environment for food loss reduction (HLPE, 2014). Additionally, capacity-building initiatives aimed at enhancing the skills and knowledge of stakeholders across the supply chain can contribute to more efficient and sustainable agrifood systems (FAO, 2019). \n\nDespite these efforts, the integration of food loss reduction strategies into broader agrifood system frameworks remains limited. There is a need for improved microdata collection and standardized measurements to separate food loss from food waste, which would facilitate the identification of intervention hot spots, trade-offs, and synergies across the value chain (Parfitt et al., 2010). Furthermore, understanding the cascading effects of food loss reduction on socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals is crucial for developing holistic and sustainable solutions (Kummu et al., 2012). \n\nIn conclusion, addressing food loss within agrifood systems requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that considers the complex interactions between various determinants and stages of the supply chain. Improved data collection, standardized measurements, and targeted interventions are essential for effectively reducing food loss and achieving broader food security and sustainability goals.", "References": [{"title": "Food waste within food supply chains: quantification and potential for change to 2050", "authors": "Parfitt, Julian, Barthel, Mark, Macnaughton, Sarah", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2010", "volumes": "365", "first page": "3065", "last page": "3081", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2010.0126"}, {"title": "Global food losses and food waste: extent, causes and prevention", "authors": "Gustavsson, Jenny, Cederberg, Christel, Sonesson, Ulf, van Otterdijk, Robert, Meybeck, Alexandre", "journal": "FAO", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Postharvest losses and waste in developed and less developed countries: opportunities to improve resource use", "authors": "Hodges, Rick J., Buzby, Jean C., Bennett, Ben", "journal": "Journal of Agricultural Science", "year": "2011", "volumes": "149", "first page": "37", "last page": "45", "DOI": "10.1017/S0021859610000936"}, {"title": "Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal", "authors": "Stuart, Tristram", "journal": "W.
