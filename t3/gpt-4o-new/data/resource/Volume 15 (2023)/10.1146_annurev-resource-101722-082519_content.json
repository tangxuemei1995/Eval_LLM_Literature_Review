{"Literature Review": "The field of impact assessment in international agricultural research has undergone significant methodological transformations over the past few decades, particularly from 2006 to 2020. Historically, the assessment of agricultural research impacts was largely influenced by the partial equilibrium model of demand and supply of agricultural products, a framework initially conceptualized by Griliches (1958). This model provided a foundational approach for understanding the economic impacts of agricultural innovations. However, the increasing complexity of agricultural systems and the need for more robust evidence have driven a 'rigor revolution' in impact assessment methodologies. \n\nOne of the most significant advancements in this field has been the emphasis on causal inference. Traditional models often struggled to establish causality due to their reliance on observational data and simplistic assumptions. Recent methodological innovations have introduced more sophisticated techniques such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs, which have become gold standards for establishing causal relationships in agricultural research (Duflo et al., 2007). These methods allow researchers to isolate the effects of specific interventions from confounding factors, thereby providing more reliable evidence of impact. For instance, the use of RCTs in evaluating the impact of agricultural technologies has provided clearer insights into their effectiveness and scalability (Banerjee & Duflo, 2011).\n\nIn addition to causal inference, there has been a growing focus on valid measurement. Accurate measurement of outcomes is crucial for assessing the true impact of agricultural research. Advances in data collection technologies, such as remote sensing and mobile surveys, have enhanced the precision and reliability of data (Lobell et al., 2015). These technologies enable researchers to gather high-resolution data on agricultural practices and outcomes, facilitating more nuanced analyses. Moreover, the integration of qualitative methods with quantitative approaches has enriched the understanding of complex agricultural systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of impacts (Maxwell, 2012).\n\nStatistical representativeness is another critical domain where standards of evidence have been heightened. Ensuring that study samples are representative of the broader population is essential for generalizing findings. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of using stratified sampling techniques and large sample sizes to improve representativeness (Deaton & Cartwright, 2018). This approach helps to capture the diversity of agricultural contexts and ensures that impact assessments reflect the realities faced by different stakeholders.\n\nThe application of these rigorous methodologies has yielded valuable lessons for the field of agricultural research. One key insight is the importance of evidence at scale. While small-scale studies provide valuable insights, they often fail to capture the broader impacts of agricultural innovations. Large-scale studies, on the other hand, can provide more comprehensive evidence of impact, informing policy decisions and guiding resource allocation (Gollin et al., 2016). Furthermore, there is a growing recognition of the need to consider portfolios of innovations at a national level. Agricultural research often involves multiple innovations that interact in complex ways, and assessing their collective impact requires a holistic approach (Pingali, 2012).\n\nFinally, the challenge of accounting for innovations that are promoted as bundles has become increasingly apparent. Many agricultural interventions involve multiple components, such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and training programs. Evaluating the impact of these bundled innovations requires disentangling the effects of individual components, which can be methodologically challenging (Maredia & Raitzer, 2010). However, advances in experimental design and statistical analysis have provided new tools for addressing this challenge, enabling more accurate assessments of bundled interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, the rigor revolution in impact assessment of international agricultural research has led to significant methodological advancements in causal inference, valid measurement, and statistical representativeness. These developments have enhanced the reliability and relevance of impact assessments, providing valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners. As the field continues to evolve, it will be important to build on these advances and address emerging challenges, ensuring that agricultural research contributes effectively to sustainable development goals.", "References": [{"title": "The Experimental Approach to Development Economics", "authors": "Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster, Michael Kremer", "journal": "Annual Review of Economics", "year": "2007", "volumes": "1", "first page": "151", "last page": "178", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.economics.050708.143235"}, {"title": "Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty", "authors": "Abhijit V.
