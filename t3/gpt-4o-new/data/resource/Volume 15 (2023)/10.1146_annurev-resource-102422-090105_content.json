{"Literature Review": "Agroecology has emerged as a pivotal concept in the discourse on sustainable agriculture and food systems, offering a holistic framework that integrates ecological principles into agricultural practices. The potential of agroecology to transform the agri-food system into a more sustainable and resilient model has been widely discussed in the literature. This review synthesizes current research on the adoption of agroecology, focusing on its scalability, economic viability, and the role of technology and policy in its implementation. \n\nAgroecology is defined by its emphasis on ecological principles, biodiversity, and the integration of traditional knowledge with scientific innovation (Altieri, 1995). It promotes practices that enhance soil health, conserve water, and increase biodiversity, thereby contributing to the resilience of agricultural systems (Gliessman, 2015). The transition to agroecological practices is seen as a response to the environmental degradation and social inequities perpetuated by conventional agricultural systems (Wezel et al., 2009). \n\nThe scalability of agroecology is a critical issue. While agroecological practices have been successfully implemented at local levels, their adoption on a larger scale remains challenging. Research indicates that scaling up agroecology requires a multiscale systems approach that considers farm-level practices, regional dynamics, and global food systems (Tittonell, 2014). This approach necessitates the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, researchers, and consumers, to create a supportive environment for agroecological practices (Méndez et al., 2013). \n\nEconomic viability is another significant factor influencing the adoption of agroecology. For agroecology to become mainstream, it must be economically sustainable for farmers and other actors in the food system. Studies have shown that agroecological practices can lead to increased yields and reduced input costs, thereby improving farm profitability (Pretty et al., 2006). However, the transition to agroecology often requires initial investments and changes in management practices, which can be a barrier for small-scale farmers (Garnett et al., 2013). \n\nThe role of technology in agroecology is evolving. Emerging technologies, particularly in digitalization and breeding, offer new opportunities for enhancing agroecological practices. Digital tools can facilitate precision agriculture, optimize resource use, and improve decision-making processes (Wolfert et al., 2017). Similarly, advances in plant breeding can contribute to the development of crop varieties that are better suited to agroecological systems (Lammerts van Bueren et al., 2018). However, the integration of technology into agroecology must be carefully managed to ensure that it aligns with ecological principles and does not exacerbate existing inequalities (Klerkx et al., 2019). \n\nPolicy frameworks play a crucial role in supporting the large-scale adoption of agroecology. Effective policies can provide incentives for farmers to adopt agroecological practices, support research and development, and facilitate knowledge exchange among stakeholders (De Schutter, 2010). Multiscale policy design is essential to address the diverse needs and challenges of different regions and to ensure that agroecological practices are integrated into broader agricultural and food policies (Anderson et al., 2019). \n\nIn conclusion, the transition to agroecology as a mainstream model for sustainable agriculture requires a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological, economic, technological, and policy dimensions. The literature highlights the need for an analytical and operational framework that supports multiscale policy design and addresses the specific drivers of agroecological transformation. By focusing on these areas, agroecology can contribute to the development of a more sustainable and resilient agri-food system.", "References": [{"title": "Agroecology: The Science of Sustainable Agriculture", "authors": "Miguel A.
