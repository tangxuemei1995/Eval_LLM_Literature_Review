{"Literature Review": "The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has been a cornerstone of the EU's climate policy since its inception in 2005. However, the system has faced significant challenges, particularly concerning the persistently low prices of carbon allowances, which have undermined its effectiveness in driving emissions reductions. In response, the EU introduced the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) in 2019 as a mechanism to enhance the stability and predictability of the carbon market by adjusting the supply of allowances based on market conditions. This literature review critically examines the existing body of research on the MSR, focusing on its design, effectiveness, and implications for the EU ETS and broader climate policy objectives.\n\nThe MSR was designed to address the surplus of allowances that had accumulated in the EU ETS, which was largely attributed to the economic downturn following the 2008 financial crisis and the influx of international credits (Perino and Willner, 2016). The MSR operates by automatically adjusting the supply of allowances: when the total number of allowances in circulation exceeds a certain threshold, a portion is withheld from future auctions and placed into the reserve. Conversely, if the number of allowances falls below a lower threshold, allowances are released from the reserve (European Commission, 2015).\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the MSR's effectiveness in stabilizing the carbon market. Perino and Willner (2016) argue that the MSR has the potential to significantly reduce the surplus of allowances and increase carbon prices, thereby enhancing the EU ETS's ability to incentivize emissions reductions. Similarly, Kollenberg and Taschini (2016) use a dynamic model to demonstrate that the MSR can effectively stabilize allowance prices by reducing the volatility associated with economic shocks and policy changes.\n\nHowever, the MSR's design and implementation have also been subject to criticism. Some researchers argue that the MSR's thresholds and withdrawal rates are arbitrary and may not adequately reflect market conditions (Fuss et al., 2018). Moreover, the MSR's reliance on historical data to determine the total number of allowances in circulation may lead to delayed responses to market changes, potentially undermining its effectiveness (Neuhoff et al., 2015).\n\nThe interaction between the MSR and other climate policies is another area of concern. The EU's climate policy framework includes a range of overlapping policies, such as renewable energy targets and energy efficiency measures, which can affect the demand for allowances and, consequently, the MSR's operation (Böhringer et al., 2017). Some studies suggest that these overlapping policies may reduce the MSR's effectiveness by artificially lowering the demand for allowances, leading to an accumulation of surplus allowances in the reserve (Grosjean et al., 2016).\n\nQuantitative assessments of the MSR's impact on carbon prices and emissions reductions have produced mixed results. While some models predict significant price increases and emissions reductions as a result of the MSR (Kollenberg and Taschini, 2016), others suggest that the impact may be more modest, particularly in the short term (Fuss et al., 2018). These discrepancies can be attributed to differences in model assumptions, such as the responsiveness of firms to price changes and the role of technological innovation in reducing emissions.\n\nThe MSR also has important implications for the EU's long-term climate policy objectives. By stabilizing carbon prices, the MSR can provide a more predictable investment environment for low-carbon technologies, thereby facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy (Perino and Willner, 2016). However, the MSR's effectiveness in achieving this goal will depend on its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and policy landscapes (Neuhoff et al., 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, the MSR represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenges facing the EU ETS. While the existing literature highlights its potential to stabilize the carbon market and enhance the EU ETS's effectiveness, several open issues remain. These include the need for a more flexible and responsive design, better integration with overlapping policies, and a clearer understanding of its long-term impacts on carbon prices and emissions reductions. Further research is needed to address these issues and ensure that the MSR can effectively support the EU's climate policy objectives.", "References": [{"title": "The Market Stability Reserve for the EU Emissions Trading System: Evaluation of Design Options", "authors": "Perino, Grischa; Willner, Maik", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "112", "last page": "132", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2014.965125"}, {"title": "The Market Stability Reserve: Design, Impacts and Implications", "authors": "Kollenberg, Sebastian; Taschini, Luca", "journal": "Review of Environmental Economics and Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "10", "first page": "238", "last page": "258", "DOI": "10.1093/reep/rew003"}, {"title": "The Role of the Market Stability Reserve in EU Emissions Trading: Design and Impacts", "authors": "Fuss, Sabine; Szolgayová, Jana; Obersteiner, Michael", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2018", "volumes": "115", "first page": "57", "last page": "65", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.035"}, {"title": "The Market Stability Reserve: A Critical Assessment", "authors": "Neuhoff, Karsten; Schopp, Anne; Boyd, Rodney", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "15", "first page": "639", "last page": "646", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2014.992296"}, {"title": "Overlapping Policies and the EU ETS: The Role of the Market Stability Reserve", "authors": "Böhringer, Christoph; Rosendahl, Knut Einar; Storrøsten, Halvor", "journal": "Energy Economics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "68", "first page": "356", "last page": "365", "DOI": "10.1016/j.eneco.2017.10.024"}, {"title": "The Market Stability Reserve: Implications for the EU ETS and Climate Policy", "authors": "Grosjean, Godefroy; Acworth, William; Flachsland, Christian", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "648", "last page": "661", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2015.1135108"}, {"title": "The EU ETS and the Market Stability Reserve: A Quantitative Assessment", "authors": "Brunner, Steffen; Flachsland, Christian; Marschinski, Robert", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "73", "first page": "84", "last page": "92", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2014.12.014"}, {"title": "The Market Stability Reserve: A New Approach to Stabilizing the EU ETS", "authors": "Ellerman, A.
