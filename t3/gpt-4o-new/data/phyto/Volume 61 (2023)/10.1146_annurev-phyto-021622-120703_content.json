{"Literature Review": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a member of the Tobamovirus genus, which has become a significant threat to global agriculture, particularly affecting tomato and pepper crops. First identified in Jordan in 2015, ToBRFV has since spread to various regions worldwide, including Europe, North America, and Asia, posing a substantial risk to food security and agricultural economies (Salem et al., 2016). The virus is characterized by its high stability and infectivity, which facilitate its transmission through mechanical means and seeds, making it challenging to control and eradicate (Panno et al., 2019). \n\nThe epidemiology of ToBRFV is complex, as it can infect tomato plants that possess the Tm resistance genes, which were previously effective against other tobamoviruses like Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). This ability to overcome genetic resistance in host plants is a significant concern for breeders and farmers, as it limits the effectiveness of traditional resistance breeding strategies (Luria et al., 2017). Additionally, ToBRFV can infect pepper plants with L resistance alleles under certain conditions, further complicating control measures (Yan et al., 2019). \n\nDetection of ToBRFV is crucial for managing its spread. Various diagnostic methods have been developed, including serological assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and molecular techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Ling et al., 2019). These methods are essential for early detection and monitoring of the virus in both seeds and plants, enabling timely intervention to prevent widespread outbreaks. However, the development of rapid, cost-effective, and field-deployable diagnostic tools remains a priority for researchers (Panno et al., 2020). \n\nPrevention and control of ToBRFV involve a combination of strategies, including strict hygiene measures, seed testing, and the use of resistant cultivars. Hygiene practices, such as disinfection of tools and equipment, are critical in preventing mechanical transmission of the virus (Hanssen et al., 2010). Seed testing is also vital, as infected seeds are a primary source of long-distance spread. Implementing rigorous seed certification programs can help ensure that only virus-free seeds are distributed (Davino et al., 2017). \n\nBreeding for resistance remains a key focus in combating ToBRFV. Although the virus can overcome existing resistance genes, ongoing research aims to identify new sources of resistance and develop cultivars with durable resistance (Lapidot et al., 2020). Genetic engineering and biotechnological approaches, such as CRISPR/Cas9, offer promising avenues for developing resistant varieties by targeting specific viral genes or enhancing plant defense mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2020). \n\nIn addition to breeding efforts, integrated pest management (IPM) strategies that combine cultural, biological, and chemical control methods are being explored to manage ToBRFV. These strategies include crop rotation, use of biological control agents, and application of antiviral compounds (Alkowni et al., 2019). However, the effectiveness of these measures can vary depending on environmental conditions and the specific cropping system. \n\nThe economic impact of ToBRFV is significant, as infected plants produce fruits with reduced quality and yield, leading to substantial financial losses for growers (Salem et al., 2016). The virus's ability to spread rapidly and its resistance to conventional control measures necessitate a coordinated global response to mitigate its effects. International collaboration in research, surveillance, and information sharing is essential to develop effective strategies for managing the ToBRFV pandemic (Panno et al., 2020). \n\nIn conclusion, ToBRFV represents a formidable challenge to global agriculture, particularly for tomato and pepper production. Continued research into the virus's biology, transmission, and control is critical to developing effective management strategies. Advances in detection, breeding, and integrated pest management will be crucial in mitigating the impact of ToBRFV and ensuring the sustainability of affected crops.", "References": [{"title": "First report of a new tobamovirus infecting tomato crops in Jordan", "authors": "Salem, N., Mansour, A., Ciuffo, M., Falk, B.
