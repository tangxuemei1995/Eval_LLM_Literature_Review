{"Literature Review": "The global forest health crisis is a pressing issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its implications for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Forests are vital for maintaining ecological balance, providing habitat for countless species, and offering services such as carbon sequestration, water regulation, and soil stabilization (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). However, the introduction of non-native pathogens and insects through global trade has led to widespread forest degradation, posing a significant threat to these ecosystems (Liebhold et al., 2012). This literature review explores the nature of the forest health crisis as a public-good social dilemma and examines the potential for international collective action to address this challenge.\n\nThe concept of a public-good social dilemma arises when individual interests conflict with collective welfare, leading to suboptimal outcomes for society as a whole (Ostrom, 1990). In the context of forest health, the introduction of invasive species is often an unintended consequence of global trade, where the benefits of trade are enjoyed by a few, while the costs, in terms of ecological damage, are borne by the global community (Perrings et al., 2002). This situation is exacerbated by the fact that forest ecosystems provide public goods, such as biodiversity and climate regulation, which are non-excludable and non-rivalrous (Costanza et al., 1997). As a result, there is little incentive for individual countries to invest in biosecurity measures that would prevent the spread of invasive species, leading to a classic tragedy of the commons scenario (Hardin, 1968).\n\nThe need for international collective action to address the forest health crisis is underscored by the interconnected nature of global ecosystems and the transboundary movement of invasive species (Hulme, 2009). Effective management of forest health requires cooperation among countries to implement biosecurity measures, share information, and coordinate responses to pest outbreaks (Leung et al., 2002). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) provide frameworks for such cooperation, but their effectiveness is often limited by lack of enforcement mechanisms and varying levels of commitment among member states (Shine et al., 2000).\n\nA key component of addressing the forest health crisis is the inclusion of diverse stakeholders in decision-making processes. Broadly inclusive stakeholder engagement can help build trust, set common goals, and ensure that the interests of all parties are considered (Reed, 2008). This approach is particularly important in the context of forest health, where the impacts of invasive species can vary widely across regions and sectors (Simberloff et al., 2013). Engaging local communities, indigenous peoples, and private landowners in biosecurity efforts can enhance the effectiveness of management strategies and foster a sense of shared responsibility for forest health (Charnley et al., 2007).\n\nAccountability for the introduction of destructive pests is another critical aspect of collective action in forest health. Countries that are responsible for introducing invasive species should be held accountable for the ecological and economic damage caused by these organisms (Perrings et al., 2005). This could involve financial compensation for affected countries or the implementation of stricter biosecurity measures to prevent future introductions. Additionally, pooled support for weakest-link partners, such as developing countries with limited resources for biosecurity, can help strengthen global efforts to combat invasive species (Barrett, 2003).\n\nIncorporating intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems into risk assessment is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the forest health crisis (Daily et al., 2000). Traditional economic assessments often fail to capture the full range of benefits provided by forests, leading to undervaluation of these ecosystems and insufficient investment in their protection (Costanza et al., 1997). By recognizing the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the nonmarket benefits of ecosystem services, policymakers can make more informed decisions about resource allocation and prioritize actions that enhance forest resilience (Chan et al., 2006).\n\nIn conclusion, the global forest health crisis represents a complex public-good social dilemma that requires international collective action to address. By incorporating principles of collective action, such as inclusive stakeholder engagement, accountability, pooled support, and recognition of intrinsic values, the proposed response framework can help shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm to a more resilient state. Short-term measures, such as strengthening biosecurity protocols and enhancing international cooperation, can provide immediate benefits, while longer-term strategies, such as promoting sustainable land-use practices and restoring degraded ecosystems, can ensure the long-term health of global forests.", "References": [{"title": "Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Synthesis", "authors": "Millennium Ecosystem Assessment", "journal": "Island Press", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The impact of non-native forest insects in North America and Europe", "authors": "Andrew M.
