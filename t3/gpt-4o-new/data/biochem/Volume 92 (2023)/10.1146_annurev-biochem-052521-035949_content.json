{"Literature Review": "The study of mRNA modifications has emerged as a pivotal area of research in molecular biology, offering insights into the complex regulation of gene expression. These modifications, often referred to as the 'epitranscriptome', add a layer of regulation that complements the genetic code and the epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones. Among the most studied mRNA modifications are N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and pseudouridine (Ψ), each playing distinct roles in mRNA metabolism and function. \n\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA and has been shown to influence various aspects of mRNA metabolism, including splicing, export, translation, and decay. The m6A modification is dynamically regulated by 'writers' (methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14), 'erasers' (demethylases such as FTO and ALKBH5), and 'readers' (proteins that recognize m6A-modified mRNA, such as YTH domain-containing proteins) (Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014). Studies have demonstrated that m6A modifications can affect mRNA stability and translation efficiency, thereby influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and stress responses (Dominissini et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). \n\n5-methylcytosine (m5C) is another modification that has been identified in mRNA, although it is less abundant than m6A. The presence of m5C in mRNA is catalyzed by the NSUN family of methyltransferases, and it has been implicated in mRNA export and stability (Squires et al., 2012). Recent studies suggest that m5C modifications may also play a role in the regulation of translation, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Hussain et al., 2013). \n\nPseudouridine (Ψ) is a modification that involves the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine, and it is found in various types of RNA, including mRNA. Pseudouridylation is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases, and it has been shown to enhance mRNA stability and translation (Carlile et al., 2014). The presence of Ψ in mRNA can also affect the splicing of pre-mRNA, suggesting a multifaceted role in gene expression regulation (Schwartz et al., 2014). \n\nDespite the advances in understanding the roles of these modifications, many questions remain. For instance, the precise molecular mechanisms by which these modifications influence mRNA metabolism are not fully understood. Additionally, the interplay between different types of modifications and their collective impact on mRNA function is an area of active investigation. \n\nRecent technological advances, such as high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry, have facilitated the identification and quantification of RNA modifications on a transcriptome-wide scale. These tools have been instrumental in uncovering the dynamic nature of the epitranscriptome and its responsiveness to environmental cues and cellular states (Linder et al., 2015). However, challenges remain in accurately mapping modifications at single-nucleotide resolution and in understanding the functional consequences of these modifications in different cellular contexts. \n\nLooking forward, the field is poised to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting RNA modifications. Given their role in regulating gene expression, RNA modifications represent attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics, particularly in cancer and other diseases characterized by dysregulated gene expression (Zhao et al., 2017). Moreover, the development of small molecules that can modulate the activity of RNA modification enzymes offers a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. \n\nIn conclusion, mRNA modifications represent a critical layer of gene expression regulation, influencing various aspects of mRNA metabolism and function. While significant progress has been made in understanding the roles of these modifications, many questions remain, particularly regarding the molecular mechanisms and the interplay between different modifications. Continued research in this area is likely to yield important insights into the regulation of gene expression and the potential for therapeutic intervention.", "References": [{"title": "The epitranscriptome: m6A writers, readers, and erasers", "authors": "Meyer, K.
