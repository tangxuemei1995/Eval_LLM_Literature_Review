{"Literature Review": "Muscle contraction is a fundamental biological process that underpins movement and cardiac function. The molecular basis of muscle contraction involves the interaction between thin and thick filaments within muscle fibers. The thin filament is primarily composed of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and the troponin complex, while the thick filament is mainly constituted by myosin molecules. The sliding filament theory, first proposed by Huxley and Hanson in 1954, describes how these filaments slide past each other to produce muscle contraction (Huxley & Hanson, 1954). Recent advances in structural biochemistry, particularly through cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction.\n\nThe thin filament's structure is crucial for its role in muscle contraction. F-actin serves as the backbone of the thin filament, providing binding sites for myosin heads during contraction. Tropomyosin, a coiled-coil protein, lies in the grooves of the actin filament and regulates access to these binding sites. The troponin complex, composed of troponin C, I, and T, is responsible for calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction. Troponin C binds calcium ions, which induces conformational changes that move tropomyosin away from actin's myosin-binding sites, allowing contraction to occur (Gordon et al., 2000).\n\nThe thick filament is primarily composed of myosin, a motor protein that converts chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. Myosin molecules are arranged in a bipolar structure, with their heads protruding to interact with actin. The interaction between actin and myosin is the basis of the cross-bridge cycle, which is essential for muscle contraction. The myosin head binds to actin, undergoes a power stroke that pulls the actin filament, and then detaches to repeat the cycle (Rayment et al., 1993).\n\nRecent cryo-EM studies have provided high-resolution structures of the actin-myosin complex, revealing detailed interactions at the atomic level. These studies have elucidated the conformational changes in myosin during the power stroke and have identified key residues involved in actin binding and ATP hydrolysis (Zhao et al., 2015). Cryo-EM has also been instrumental in visualizing the regulatory proteins of the thin filament, offering insights into how calcium binding to troponin C leads to tropomyosin movement and actin-myosin interaction (Yamada et al., 2020).\n\nThe regulation of muscle contraction is tightly controlled by calcium ions, which are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the T-tubule membrane senses membrane depolarization and triggers RyR opening, leading to calcium release. Structural studies of RyR and DHPR have revealed their complex architecture and the conformational changes that occur during calcium release (Zalk et al., 2015). These studies have been pivotal in understanding excitation-contraction coupling and its dysregulation in muscle diseases.\n\nCryo-ET has further advanced our understanding of muscle structure by providing three-dimensional reconstructions of muscle fibers in situ. This technique has allowed researchers to visualize the spatial arrangement of filaments and associated proteins within the muscle cell, offering insights into the structural basis of muscle function and disease (Briggs, 2013).\n\nThe application of cryo-EM and cryo-ET in muscle research has not only enhanced our understanding of normal muscle function but has also shed light on the molecular basis of muscle diseases. Mutations in genes encoding muscle proteins can lead to cardiomyopathies and other muscle disorders. Structural studies have identified how these mutations alter protein function and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Spudich, 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the structural biochemistry of muscle contraction has been significantly advanced by high-resolution techniques such as cryo-EM and cryo-ET. These methods have provided detailed insights into the molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms that underpin muscle contraction. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold the promise of further elucidating the complex processes involved in muscle function and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Structural changes in actin-myosin cross-bridges during muscle contraction", "authors": "Huxley, H.
