{"Literature Review": "The stability and translational efficiency of messenger RNA (mRNA) are pivotal in determining the levels of protein synthesis within a cell. These processes are intricately regulated by various factors, including the sequence of codons within the mRNA. Codon optimality, a concept that has gained significant attention over the past decade, refers to the influence of codon sequences on mRNA stability and decay. This review explores the current understanding of codon optimality and its implications for mRNA stability and translation across different eukaryotic species. \n\nCodon optimality is primarily determined by the translation elongation rate, which is influenced by the availability and abundance of cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (Hanson and Coller, 2018). Codons that are translated quickly due to high tRNA availability are considered optimal, whereas those that are translated slowly are deemed non-optimal. The translation elongation rate affects mRNA stability, with slower translation rates often leading to increased mRNA decay (Presnyak et al., 2015). This relationship suggests that codon usage can serve as a cis-regulatory mechanism, influencing mRNA stability beyond the encoded amino acid sequence. \n\nThe role of tRNAs in regulating mRNA stability through codon optimality has been highlighted in several studies. For instance, the abundance of specific tRNAs correlates with the stability of mRNAs containing corresponding optimal codons (Gingold and Pilpel, 2011). This correlation suggests that tRNAs act as master regulators of gene expression by modulating the translation elongation rate and, consequently, mRNA stability. Moreover, the dynamic nature of tRNA pools in response to cellular conditions further underscores their regulatory potential (Rudolph et al., 2016). \n\nIn yeast, several factors have been identified that mediate the effects of codon optimality on mRNA stability. For example, the RNA-binding protein Pub1 has been shown to preferentially bind to mRNAs with non-optimal codons, promoting their decay (Radhakrishnan et al., 2016). However, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessarily share the same functions, indicating that the mechanisms of codon optimality may differ across species. This divergence highlights the complexity of post-transcriptional regulation and the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying codon optimality in different organisms. \n\nThe impact of codon usage on mRNA stability is not limited to yeast. In vertebrates, studies have demonstrated that codon optimality influences mRNA decay rates, although the specific factors involved remain to be fully characterized (Bazzini et al., 2016). The conservation of codon optimality effects across eukaryotes suggests a fundamental role for codon usage in gene regulation. However, the extent to which these effects are conserved and the specific mechanisms involved may vary, reflecting the diverse evolutionary pressures faced by different species. \n\nRecent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the study of codon optimality on a genome-wide scale. Ribosome profiling, for example, has provided insights into the translation dynamics of mRNAs with different codon compositions (Ingolia et al., 2011). These studies have revealed that codon optimality not only affects mRNA stability but also influences translation efficiency, further emphasizing the multifaceted role of codon usage in gene expression regulation. \n\nIn conclusion, codon optimality represents a critical layer of post-transcriptional regulation that influences mRNA stability and translation efficiency. The interplay between codon usage, tRNA availability, and translation elongation rate underscores the complexity of gene regulation at the mRNA level. While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of codon optimality in yeast, further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and factors involved in vertebrates and other eukaryotic species. The continued exploration of codon optimality will enhance our understanding of the regulatory networks that govern gene expression and may reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention.", "References": [{"title": "Codon optimality, bias and usage in translation and mRNA decay", "authors": "Graham Hanson, Jeff Coller", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "20", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm.2017.91"}, {"title": "Codon optimality is a major determinant of mRNA stability", "authors": "Vladimir Presnyak, Noah Alhusaini, Michael H.
