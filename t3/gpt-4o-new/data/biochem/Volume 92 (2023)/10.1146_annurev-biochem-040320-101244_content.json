{"Literature Review": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) is a pivotal enzyme in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, responsible for the fixation of carbon dioxide into organic compounds. Despite its central role in global carbon fixation, rubisco is characterized by a relatively slow catalytic rate and a propensity for oxygenation reactions, which can lead to photorespiration and reduced photosynthetic efficiency (Tcherkez et al., 2006). This paradox of rubisco's inefficiency despite its evolutionary importance has spurred extensive research into its function, evolution, and potential for engineering.\n\nThe evolutionary history of rubisco is complex, with evidence suggesting that it has undergone significant diversification across different photosynthetic lineages. Rubisco is found in various forms, classified into four main types (I, II, III, and IV), each with distinct structural and functional characteristics (Tabita et al., 2008). Type I rubisco, the most common form, is found in higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, and is composed of eight large and eight small subunits. Type II rubisco, found in some bacteria and dinoflagellates, consists only of large subunits and is generally less efficient than Type I (Andersson and Backlund, 2008).\n\nThe inefficiency of rubisco is often attributed to its dual activity as both a carboxylase and an oxygenase. The oxygenase activity leads to the production of 2-phosphoglycolate, a compound that must be recycled through the energetically costly process of photorespiration (Peterhansel et al., 2010). This dual activity is thought to be a result of evolutionary trade-offs, where rubisco's active site has been optimized for CO2 fixation under specific environmental conditions, but at the cost of increased oxygenase activity (Tcherkez et al., 2006).\n\nEfforts to improve rubisco's catalytic efficiency have focused on understanding these trade-offs and the structural basis of its function. Structural studies have revealed that rubisco's active site is highly conserved, with specific amino acid residues playing critical roles in substrate binding and catalysis (Whitney et al., 2011). Mutagenesis studies have identified several residues that can be altered to improve carboxylation efficiency or reduce oxygenation, although these modifications often result in trade-offs in other aspects of rubisco's function (Parry et al., 2013).\n\nOne promising approach to rubisco engineering involves the introduction of rubisco variants from different species into crop plants. For example, rubisco from red algae, which has a higher specificity for CO2 over O2, has been introduced into tobacco plants, resulting in increased photosynthetic efficiency under certain conditions (Lin et al., 2014). However, the successful expression and assembly of foreign rubisco in plants remain challenging due to the complex interactions between rubisco subunits and the chloroplast environment (Whitney et al., 2011).\n\nAnother strategy involves the use of directed evolution and synthetic biology to create rubisco variants with improved properties. Directed evolution techniques have been used to generate rubisco variants with enhanced catalytic rates or altered substrate specificity, although these approaches are often limited by the need for high-throughput screening methods (Wilson and Whitney, 2017). Synthetic biology approaches, such as the design of artificial carboxylases or the incorporation of rubisco into novel metabolic pathways, offer exciting possibilities for enhancing carbon fixation in plants (Erb et al., 2017).\n\nDespite these advances, significant challenges remain in the engineering of rubisco. The enzyme's complex quaternary structure and the intricate regulation of its activity in vivo complicate efforts to modify its function. Additionally, the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of introducing engineered rubisco variants into natural ecosystems must be carefully considered (Parry et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, rubisco remains a focal point of research due to its central role in carbon fixation and its potential for improvement through engineering. While significant progress has been made in understanding the structural and functional constraints of rubisco, further research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with its modification and to realize the potential benefits of enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in plants.", "References": [{"title": "The mechanism of Rubisco: The role of the active site residues", "authors": "Tcherkez, G.
