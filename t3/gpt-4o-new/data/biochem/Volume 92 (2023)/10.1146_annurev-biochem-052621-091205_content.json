{"Literature Review": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that specifically targets and repairs DNA lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. This process is crucial for maintaining transcriptional fidelity and cellular homeostasis, particularly in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, which induces bulky DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) (Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008). The recognition of these lesions is initiated by the stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at the site of damage, which serves as a signal for the recruitment of repair factors (Fousteri and Mullenders, 2008). \n\nThe stalling of RNAPII is a critical event in TC-NER, as it triggers the recruitment of Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), a key player in the repair process. CSB, in conjunction with Cockayne syndrome protein A (CSA), facilitates the displacement of RNAPII and the recruitment of additional repair factors, including UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) and the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex (van den Boom et al., 2004). UVSSA plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the repair complex and promoting the ubiquitylation of CSB, a modification that is essential for the progression of TC-NER (Nakazawa et al., 2012). \n\nProtein ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification that regulates various aspects of TC-NER, including the turnover of repair proteins and the resolution of stalled transcription complexes. The ubiquitylation of CSB, mediated by the CSA-DDB1-CUL4A-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is a critical step that facilitates the release of CSB from the DNA and allows for the recruitment of downstream repair factors (Groisman et al., 2006). This modification is also involved in the degradation of RNAPII, which is necessary for the clearance of transcription-blocking lesions and the resumption of transcription (Wilson et al., 2013). \n\nIn addition to its role in DNA repair, TC-NER is intricately linked to the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage. The stalling of RNAPII not only signals the need for repair but also triggers a transcriptional stress response that involves the activation of signaling cascades such as the p53 pathway (Ljungman and Zhang, 1996). This response is characterized by the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair, which collectively contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability (Fousteri and Mullenders, 2008). \n\nThe importance of TC-NER is underscored by the severe clinical manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS), two genetic disorders associated with defects in NER factors. XP is characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light and a predisposition to skin cancer, while CS is associated with developmental abnormalities and premature aging (Lehmann et al., 2011). Mutations in genes encoding TC-NER proteins, such as CSA and CSB, lead to impaired repair of transcription-blocking lesions and contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders (van Gool et al., 1997). \n\nIn summary, TC-NER is a critical DNA repair pathway that ensures the integrity of the transcribed genome in the face of UV-induced DNA damage. The interplay between RNAPII stalling, protein ubiquitylation, and transcriptional regulation highlights the complexity of this repair process and its integration with cellular stress responses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TC-NER and its associated diseases provides valuable insights into the maintenance of genomic stability and the prevention of cancer and other age-related disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Transcription-coupled repair: two decades of progress and surprises", "authors": "Hanawalt, Philip C., Spivak, Graciela", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "9", "first page": "958", "last page": "970", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm2549"}, {"title": "Transcription-coupled repair: a complex affair", "authors": "Fousteri, Maria, Mullenders, Leon H.
