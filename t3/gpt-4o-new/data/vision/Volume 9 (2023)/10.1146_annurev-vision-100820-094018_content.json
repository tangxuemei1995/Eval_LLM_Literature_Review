{"Literature Review": "The study of nonvisual opsins and their role in extraocular light sensing has gained significant attention in recent years. Opsins, a family of G protein-coupled receptors, are traditionally associated with visual photoreception. However, emerging evidence suggests that these proteins also play crucial roles in nonvisual light sensing, influencing various physiological processes beyond vision. This literature review explores the expanding role of nonvisual opsins, particularly encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5), in extraocular light sensing and their implications for human physiology. \n\nOpsins are integral to the phototransduction process, converting light into biochemical signals. While the visual function of opsins is well-documented, their nonvisual roles are increasingly recognized. Nonvisual opsins are expressed in various tissues, including the brain, skin, and adipose tissue, where they mediate light-dependent physiological responses. For instance, OPN3 and OPN5 have been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms and metabolic pathways, highlighting their significance in maintaining homeostasis (Koyanagi et al., 2013). \n\nThe concept of extraocular photoreception is not new. Invertebrates and lower vertebrates have long been known to possess light-sensitive structures outside the eyes, such as the pineal gland and skin photoreceptors. These structures contribute to the regulation of circadian rhythms and seasonal behaviors (Foster & Hankins, 2007). In mammals, however, the presence of extraocular photoreception was largely dismissed until recent discoveries challenged this notion. Studies have demonstrated that mice lacking ocular photoreceptors can still entrain their circadian clocks to light, suggesting the existence of extraocular light sensing mechanisms (Hattar et al., 2003). \n\nEncephalopsin (OPN3) is one of the nonvisual opsins that has garnered attention for its role in extraocular photoreception. OPN3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and adipose tissue, where it influences metabolic processes. Recent studies have shown that OPN3 mediates light-dependent regulation of lipolysis and glucose metabolism, suggesting a link between light exposure and metabolic health (Sato et al., 2014). This finding is particularly relevant in the context of modern lifestyles, where artificial lighting and irregular light exposure patterns may disrupt metabolic homeostasis. \n\nNeuropsin (OPN5) is another nonvisual opsin that plays a critical role in extraocular light sensing. OPN5 is expressed in the skin and has been shown to mediate photoentrainment of circadian clocks. This process involves the synchronization of peripheral clocks to environmental light cues, ensuring the proper timing of physiological processes (Buhr et al., 2015). The discovery of OPN5's role in skin photoreception underscores the importance of light exposure in regulating circadian rhythms and suggests potential therapeutic applications for circadian-related disorders. \n\nThe implications of nonvisual opsins in human physiology are profound. Disruptions in circadian rhythms and metabolic processes are associated with various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and mood disorders. Understanding the mechanisms by which nonvisual opsins mediate light-dependent physiological responses could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies. For example, targeted light therapy could be used to modulate circadian rhythms and improve metabolic health in individuals with disrupted light exposure patterns (Hatori et al., 2017). \n\nMoreover, the study of nonvisual opsins may provide insights into the evolutionary significance of extraocular photoreception. The presence of light-sensitive opsins in diverse tissues suggests that light sensing is a fundamental aspect of physiology, extending beyond vision. This perspective aligns with the broader understanding of light as a critical environmental cue that shapes the behavior and physiology of organisms (Peirson et al., 2009). \n\nIn conclusion, the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing represents a significant advancement in our understanding of photoreception. Encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5) are key players in mediating light-dependent physiological responses, influencing circadian rhythms and metabolic processes. These findings have important implications for human health, particularly in the context of modern lifestyles characterized by irregular light exposure. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonvisual opsins function and to explore their potential therapeutic applications.", "References": [{"title": "Evolution and diversity of opsins", "authors": "Koyanagi, M., Kubokawa, K., Tsukamoto, H., Shichida, Y., Terakita, A.", "journal": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Membrane Transport and Signaling", "year": "2013", "volumes": "2", "first page": "104", "last page": "111", "DOI": "10.1002/wmts.85"}, {"title": "Non-visual photoreception in the vertebrates", "authors": "Foster, R.
