{"Literature Review": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a pivotal subcortical structure in the primate brain, traditionally recognized for its role in motor control, particularly in orienting behaviors. However, recent research has increasingly highlighted its significant visual functions, suggesting a more integrated role in sensory processing and motor execution. This literature review explores the visual functions of the primate SC, emphasizing its anatomical and functional connections, and its role in active perception. \n\nHistorically, the SC has been primarily associated with the control of eye movements, such as saccades, which are rapid movements of the eye that adjust the line of sight. Early studies by Wurtz and Goldberg (1972) demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the SC in monkeys could evoke saccadic eye movements, establishing a direct link between SC activity and motor output (Wurtz & Goldberg, 1972). This motor-centric view was further supported by the work of Sparks (1986), who detailed the SC's role in the spatial transformation of visual information into motor commands (Sparks, 1986). \n\nDespite its established role in motor control, the SC is also a highly visual structure. It receives direct retinal inputs, as well as inputs from various visual cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex (V1). This dual input system allows the SC to integrate visual information from both subcortical and cortical sources. May (2006) highlighted the SC's layered structure, where superficial layers receive visual inputs, and deeper layers are involved in motor processing, suggesting a complex interplay between sensory and motor functions (May, 2006). \n\nRecent studies have expanded our understanding of the SC's visual capabilities. For instance, Boehnke and Munoz (2008) demonstrated that the SC is involved in the detection and localization of visual stimuli, even in the absence of overt eye movements. Their work showed that the SC can process visual information to guide covert attention, indicating its role in visual perception beyond mere motor control (Boehnke & Munoz, 2008). \n\nMoreover, the SC's role in active vision is underscored by its anatomical connections. The SC is strategically positioned to receive early visual inputs and send feedback to the cortex, facilitating a dynamic interaction between sensory processing and motor planning. This feedback loop is crucial for active perception, where the SC not only responds to visual stimuli but also anticipates and influences future sensory inputs. Krauzlis et al. (2013) emphasized the SC's involvement in this feedback mechanism, highlighting its contribution to the coordination of visual attention and eye movements (Krauzlis et al., 2013). \n\nThe SC's visual functions are further supported by its involvement in pattern analysis. Research by Basso and May (2017) revealed that the SC can discriminate between different visual patterns, suggesting a role in higher-order visual processing. This capability is essential for guiding orienting movements, as it allows the SC to prioritize certain stimuli over others based on their visual characteristics (Basso & May, 2017). \n\nAdditionally, the SC's integration of visual and motor functions is evident in its response to multisensory inputs. Wallace et al. (1996) demonstrated that the SC can integrate visual and auditory information to enhance the detection and localization of stimuli, a process known as multisensory integration. This ability to combine information from different sensory modalities further underscores the SC's role in active perception and orienting behaviors (Wallace et al., 1996). \n\nIn summary, the primate SC is a multifaceted structure with significant visual functions that complement its well-established role in motor control. Its ability to process visual information, guide attention, and integrate multisensory inputs positions the SC as a crucial component of the neural circuitry underlying active perception. Future research should continue to explore the SC's visual capabilities, particularly its interactions with cortical areas, to fully understand its contribution to sensory processing and motor execution in primates.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the superior colliculus in the control of saccadic eye movements", "authors": "Wurtz, R.
