{"Literature Review": "The basal ganglia (BG) are a group of subcortical nuclei that play a crucial role in a variety of brain functions, including motor control, learning, and decision-making. While the BG's involvement in motor control and value-based decision-making is well-documented, their role in visual perceptual decisions, particularly those based on uncertain visual evidence, is less understood. This review aims to synthesize recent findings on the contributions of the BG to visual perceptual decisions, focusing on the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons. \n\nThe striatum, the primary input nucleus of the BG, receives extensive projections from the cortex, including visual areas, and is thought to play a critical role in integrating sensory information to guide decision-making. Recent studies have shown that the striatum is involved in the accumulation of sensory evidence during perceptual decision-making tasks. For instance, Ding and Gold (2010) demonstrated that neuronal activity in the striatum reflects the accumulation of evidence for a decision, suggesting that the striatum may serve as a neural substrate for the integration of visual information over time (Ding & Gold, 2010). Furthermore, the striatum's role in decision-making is modulated by dopamine, which influences the gain of sensory evidence accumulation (Hikosaka et al., 2006).\n\nThe pallidum, which includes the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and externus (GPe), acts as a major output nucleus of the BG. It is involved in the regulation of motor actions and decision-making processes. The GPi, in particular, has been implicated in the selection and initiation of actions based on sensory input. Research by Schmidt et al. (2013) suggests that the GPi encodes the certainty of a decision, with neuronal activity correlating with the confidence level of a perceptual decision (Schmidt et al., 2013). This finding highlights the pallidum's role in evaluating the reliability of sensory information and adjusting decision-making strategies accordingly.\n\nThe subthalamic nucleus (STN) is another critical component of the BG network, known for its role in inhibiting premature responses and facilitating decision-making under conflict. The STN is thought to act as a brake during decision-making, allowing for the accumulation of additional evidence before committing to a choice. Studies by Frank et al. (2007) have shown that the STN is particularly active during high-conflict decisions, where it helps to delay responses until sufficient evidence is gathered (Frank et al., 2007). This function is crucial in perceptual decision-making tasks where visual evidence may be ambiguous or uncertain.\n\nMidbrain dopamine neurons, located in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, play a pivotal role in modulating BG activity and influencing decision-making processes. Dopamine is known to affect the speed and accuracy of decision-making by modulating the balance between exploration and exploitation. Research by Cools et al. (2009) indicates that dopamine levels can influence the threshold for decision-making, with higher dopamine levels promoting faster decisions at the expense of accuracy (Cools et al., 2009). This modulation is particularly relevant in tasks requiring rapid processing of visual information and quick decision-making.\n\nThe integration of these BG components supports a model of decision-making that involves the accumulation, evaluation, and adjustment of sensory evidence. The striatum integrates visual information, the pallidum evaluates decision certainty, the STN regulates response inhibition, and dopamine modulates decision thresholds. Together, these components form a network that facilitates the transformation of visual input into action, particularly under conditions of uncertainty.\n\nIn conclusion, the BG play a multifaceted role in visual perceptual decision-making, with each component contributing uniquely to the process. The striatum, pallidum, STN, and midbrain dopamine neurons work in concert to integrate, evaluate, and adjust decisions based on visual evidence. Understanding the BG's contributions to perceptual decision-making not only advances our knowledge of neural decision-making mechanisms but also has implications for disorders characterized by BG dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.", "References": [{"title": "Neural correlates of perceptual decision making in the striatum", "authors": "Ding, L., Gold, J.
