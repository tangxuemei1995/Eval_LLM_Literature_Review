{"Literature Review": "The advent of mobile technology has revolutionized the way individuals with visual impairments interact with their environment. Mobile apps, in particular, have emerged as versatile tools that offer a range of functionalities to assist visually impaired individuals in performing daily tasks. This literature review explores the impact of these apps as assistive devices, highlighting their advantages, challenges, and the need for rigorous evaluation studies. \n\nMobile apps provide several advantages over traditional assistive devices. They are generally more affordable, portable, and versatile, allowing users to access a wide range of functionalities through a single device (Kane et al., 2009). The ubiquity of smartphones means that users can carry these assistive tools with them at all times, increasing their independence and accessibility (Bigham et al., 2010). Furthermore, the continuous advancements in smartphone technology, such as improved camera quality and processing power, have enhanced the capabilities of these apps, making them more effective in assisting with visual tasks (Hub et al., 2013).\n\nSeveral categories of assistive apps have been identified, each serving different purposes. Text and object recognition apps, for instance, use optical character recognition (OCR) and image processing technologies to help users read printed text and identify objects in their surroundings (Kacorri et al., 2017). Navigation apps leverage GPS and other location-based services to provide directions and assist users in navigating unfamiliar environments (Ahmetovic et al., 2016). Digital accessibility apps focus on making digital content more accessible, while remote sighted service apps connect users with sighted volunteers or professionals who can provide real-time assistance through video calls (Brady et al., 2013).\n\nDespite the positive feedback from users, the scientific evaluation of these apps remains limited. Most studies rely on user reviews, which, while valuable, do not provide comprehensive insights into the apps' effectiveness or their impact on users' quality of life (Kane et al., 2009). Rigorous evaluation studies are necessary to assess the real-world benefits of these apps and to establish standardized criteria for their assessment. Such studies should consider the heterogeneity of visual tasks and the diverse needs of users, which can vary significantly depending on the severity and type of visual impairment (Hub et al., 2013).\n\nThe feasibility of conducting scientific research in this area is supported by the growing interest in understanding the visual needs of individuals with impairments. Researchers have called for more studies that focus on the usability, accessibility, and effectiveness of assistive apps, emphasizing the importance of involving visually impaired users in the design and evaluation processes (Bigham et al., 2010). Participatory design approaches, where users are actively involved in the development of apps, can lead to more user-centered solutions that better meet their needs (Kacorri et al., 2017).\n\nMoreover, the development of evaluation frameworks that consider both quantitative and qualitative measures is crucial. Quantitative measures, such as task completion time and error rates, can provide objective data on the apps' performance, while qualitative measures, such as user satisfaction and perceived usefulness, can offer insights into the users' experiences and preferences (Ahmetovic et al., 2016). Combining these approaches can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the apps' impact on users' daily lives.\n\nIn conclusion, mobile apps have the potential to significantly enhance the independence and quality of life of individuals with visual impairments. However, to fully realize this potential, there is a need for more rigorous scientific research that evaluates the effectiveness of these apps and addresses the diverse needs of users. By involving users in the design and evaluation processes and developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks, researchers can contribute to the development of more effective and user-friendly assistive technologies.", "References": [{"title": "Access overlays: Improving non-visual access to large touch screens for blind users", "authors": "Shaun K.
