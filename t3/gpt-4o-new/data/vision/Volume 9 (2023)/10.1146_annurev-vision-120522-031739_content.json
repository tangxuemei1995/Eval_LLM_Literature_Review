{"Literature Review": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a dominant force in the field of computer vision, achieving unprecedented success in tasks such as object classification, segmentation, and detection. This success has prompted researchers to explore the potential of DNNs as models of human visual perception, particularly in the domain of core object recognition. Core object recognition refers to the ability to rapidly and accurately identify objects in a visual scene, a fundamental aspect of human visual perception. The question of whether DNNs can serve as adequate behavioral models of human visual perception is complex and multifaceted, involving considerations of both the capabilities and limitations of these models. \n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of DNNs as models of human visual perception is their performance on object recognition tasks. Studies have shown that DNNs can achieve human-level accuracy on certain benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet, which involves classifying images into thousands of categories (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). This level of performance suggests that DNNs may capture some aspects of the visual processing mechanisms employed by the human brain. However, it is important to note that achieving high accuracy on specific datasets does not necessarily imply that DNNs replicate the underlying cognitive processes of human perception. \n\nA key distinction in evaluating DNNs as models of human perception is between statistical tools and computational models. While DNNs are powerful statistical tools capable of learning complex patterns from large datasets, this does not automatically qualify them as computational models of human cognition. A computational model should not only replicate the input-output behavior of a system but also provide insights into the underlying processes and mechanisms. In this regard, DNNs often function as 'black boxes,' offering little transparency into how they arrive at their decisions (Lipton, 2018). This lack of interpretability poses a significant challenge in assessing their adequacy as models of human perception. \n\nMoreover, the multidimensional nature of model quality must be considered. A model's adequacy is not solely determined by its performance on specific tasks but also by its ability to generalize across different conditions and its alignment with known cognitive and neural processes. Studies have shown that while DNNs can generalize well within the confines of their training data, they often struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, a hallmark of human perception (Geirhos et al., 2018). Humans can recognize objects under a wide range of conditions, including variations in lighting, occlusion, and viewpoint, whereas DNNs may fail when faced with such variations unless explicitly trained on them. \n\nPsychophysical studies comparing human and DNN performance on object recognition tasks have revealed both similarities and differences. For instance, both humans and DNNs exhibit similar patterns of errors when classifying objects, suggesting some overlap in the features used for recognition (Rajalingham et al., 2018). However, DNNs often rely on texture rather than shape for object recognition, a strategy that differs from human perception, which is more shape-oriented (Baker et al., 2018). This discrepancy highlights the importance of understanding the specific features and strategies employed by DNNs and how they compare to those used by humans. \n\nAnother consideration is the role of biological plausibility in evaluating DNNs as models of human perception. While DNNs are inspired by the architecture of the human brain, with layers of interconnected neurons, they differ significantly in terms of scale, connectivity, and learning mechanisms. The human visual system is characterized by a hierarchical organization, with different areas of the brain processing different aspects of visual information (DiCarlo et al., 2012). While DNNs mimic this hierarchical structure to some extent, they lack the complexity and adaptability of the human brain, which can integrate information from multiple sensory modalities and adapt to new environments. \n\nIn conclusion, while DNNs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in object recognition tasks, their adequacy as models of human visual perception remains an open question. They are valuable scientific tools that can provide insights into certain aspects of visual processing, but they fall short of capturing the full complexity and flexibility of human perception. Future research should focus on developing more interpretable models that align more closely with known cognitive and neural processes, as well as exploring the integration of DNNs with other computational approaches to better understand the mechanisms underlying human visual perception.", "References": [{"title": "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks", "authors": "Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E.
