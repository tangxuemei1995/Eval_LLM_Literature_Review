{"Literature Review": "Emerging pathogenic viral infections of the eye represent a significant concern in global health, particularly in the context of recent pandemics and outbreaks. The eye, as an extension of the central nervous system, can be affected by various viral pathogens, leading to a range of ophthalmic manifestations. This review explores the ophthalmic implications of emerging viral infections, focusing on COVID-19, Ebola virus disease, and other high-priority pathogens identified by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n\nCOVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been extensively studied for its systemic and ocular manifestations. Conjunctivitis is the most common ocular symptom associated with COVID-19, although more severe complications such as retinopathy and uveitis have been reported (Wu et al., 2020). The virus's presence in tears and conjunctival secretions suggests potential transmission through ocular routes, emphasizing the need for protective measures in clinical settings (Seah and Agrawal, 2020). Furthermore, the persistence of viral RNA in ocular tissues raises concerns about long-term ocular health impacts (Xia et al., 2020).\n\nEbola virus disease (EVD) is another emerging infection with significant ocular implications. Survivors of EVD often experience uveitis, a severe inflammatory condition of the eye, which can lead to vision loss if untreated (Varkey et al., 2015). The persistence of the Ebola virus in ocular tissues, even after systemic clearance, poses challenges for disease management and highlights the need for ongoing ophthalmic surveillance in survivors (Steptoe et al., 2016). The ophthalmic sequelae of EVD underscore the importance of integrating eye care into the broader management strategies for viral outbreaks.\n\nOther emerging viral infections, such as Zika virus, have also been associated with ocular manifestations. Zika virus can cause conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, uveitis and retinopathy (Furtado et al., 2016). The virus's ability to cross the placental barrier and affect fetal development has been linked to congenital ocular abnormalities, further complicating the public health response to Zika outbreaks (Ventura et al., 2016).\n\nThe epidemiology of these emerging viral infections highlights the interconnectedness of global health systems and the need for comprehensive surveillance and response strategies. The WHO's identification of high-priority pathogens underscores the importance of preparedness and rapid response to emerging threats. Ophthalmologists play a crucial role in identifying and managing the ocular manifestations of these infections, contributing to the broader public health response.\n\nTherapeutic approaches to managing the ocular manifestations of emerging viral infections are evolving. For COVID-19, antiviral treatments and corticosteroids have been used to manage severe ocular inflammation, although their efficacy and safety continue to be evaluated (Senanayake et al., 2020). In the case of EVD, corticosteroids have shown promise in reducing uveitis-related inflammation, but the risk of viral reactivation remains a concern (Hereth et al., 2017). The development of targeted therapies for viral-induced ocular conditions is an area of active research, with the potential to improve outcomes for affected individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, emerging pathogenic viral infections of the eye present significant challenges and opportunities for advancing global health security. The integration of ophthalmic care into the broader public health response to viral outbreaks is essential for mitigating the impact of these infections on individuals and communities. Continued research into the ocular manifestations and persistence of viral pathogens will enhance our understanding and inform future preparedness and response efforts.", "References": [{"title": "Characteristics of Ocular Findings of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei Province, China", "authors": "Wu, Ping, Duan, Feng, Luo, Chunyan, Liu, Qi, Qu, Xiaoyan, Liang, Lin, Wu, Kun, Song, Peiying, Zhang, Yizhi", "journal": "JAMA Ophthalmology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "138", "first page": "575", "last page": "578", "DOI": "10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.1291"}, {"title": "Can the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Affect the Eyes?
