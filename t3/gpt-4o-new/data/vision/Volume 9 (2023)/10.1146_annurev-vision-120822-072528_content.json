{"Literature Review": "The study of visual fixations and eye movements has been a focal point in understanding human visual and cognitive processes. Eye movements, particularly fixations, provide a window into the underlying mechanisms of attention and perception. The ability to predict where individuals will look next has significant implications for fields ranging from neuroscience to artificial intelligence. This literature review explores recent advances in predicting visual fixations, focusing on model evaluation, comparison, and the integration of probabilistic models. \n\nThe concept of saliency has been central to understanding visual attention. Saliency models aim to predict which parts of a visual scene are likely to attract attention. Early models, such as the one proposed by Itti, Koch, and Niebur (1998), were based on the idea that certain features in a visual scene, such as color, intensity, and orientation, stand out and attract attention (Itti et al., 1998). These models have evolved significantly, incorporating more complex features and mechanisms. For instance, the work by Borji and Itti (2013) provides a comprehensive review of saliency models, highlighting the transition from feature-based models to those incorporating cognitive factors (Borji & Itti, 2013).\n\nProbabilistic models have emerged as a powerful tool for predicting visual fixations. These models offer a unified framework that allows for the integration of various factors influencing eye movements. The Bayesian approach, as discussed by Tatler et al. (2011), provides a probabilistic framework for understanding how prior knowledge and sensory information are combined to guide eye movements (Tatler et al., 2011). This approach facilitates the comparison of different models by quantifying the contribution of various factors to fixation prediction.\n\nThe evaluation of models predicting visual fixations is crucial for advancing our understanding of visual attention. A key challenge is developing metrics that consistently measure model performance across different settings. Information gain has been proposed as a universal metric for model comparison. This metric quantifies the amount of information a model provides about the observed data, allowing for a direct comparison of models with different underlying assumptions (Kümmerer et al., 2015). The use of information gain as a benchmark has been instrumental in identifying the most informative models and understanding the mechanisms driving visual attention.\n\nThe integration of static and dynamic saliency models has been a significant advancement in the field. While static models focus on predicting fixations in still images, dynamic models account for the temporal aspects of visual scenes, such as those found in videos. The work by Le Meur and Liu (2015) highlights the importance of incorporating temporal dynamics into saliency models, demonstrating that dynamic models outperform static ones in predicting fixations in video sequences (Le Meur & Liu, 2015). This integration is crucial for applications in real-world settings, where visual scenes are rarely static.\n\nScanpath prediction, which involves predicting the sequence of fixations, is another area of interest. Scanpath models aim to capture the temporal order of fixations, providing insights into the strategies used by individuals when exploring visual scenes. The work by Engbert et al. (2015) presents a model that combines saliency with cognitive factors, such as task demands and memory, to predict scanpaths (Engbert et al., 2015). This approach highlights the importance of considering both bottom-up and top-down factors in understanding eye movements.\n\nThe development of a unifying framework for fixation prediction has facilitated the comparison of different models and the identification of key factors influencing visual attention. This framework allows for the translation of various saliency maps and scanpath models into a common language, enabling researchers to assess the relative contributions of different mechanisms. The work by Kümmerer et al. (2017) exemplifies this approach, demonstrating how a unifying framework can be used to compare models across different settings and identify the most informative examples for model comparison (Kümmerer et al., 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, the prediction of visual fixations is a complex task that requires the integration of multiple factors, including saliency, cognitive processes, and temporal dynamics. Probabilistic models offer a powerful tool for understanding these factors and comparing different models. The use of information gain as a universal metric provides a robust framework for model evaluation, facilitating the identification of the most informative models. As research in this field continues to advance, the development of a unifying framework will be crucial for integrating new findings and improving our understanding of the decision-making processes that determine where we look.", "References": [{"title": "A model of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis", "authors": "Laurent Itti, Christof Koch, Ernst Niebur", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": "1998", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1254", "last page": "1259", "DOI": "10.1109/34.730558"}, {"title": "State-of-the-art in visual attention modeling", "authors": "Ali Borji, Laurent Itti", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": "2013", "volumes": "35", "first page": "185", "last page": "207", "DOI": "10.1109/TPAMI.2012.89"}, {"title": "The influence of visual salience on fixation selection", "authors": "Benjamin W.
