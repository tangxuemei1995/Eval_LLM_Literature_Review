{"Literature Review": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is traditionally recognized as a vascular complication of diabetes, characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. However, emerging evidence suggests that DR should be considered a neurovascular disease, as neuronal dysfunction often precedes vascular changes. This literature review explores the early visual and neuronal dysfunctions associated with diabetes, emphasizing the importance of understanding these changes for early intervention and treatment. \n\nThe retina is a complex structure composed of multiple layers of neurons, including photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, which are essential for visual processing. In diabetes, retinal neurons exhibit functional impairments before any observable vascular damage. Studies have shown that patients with diabetes often have compromised electroretinograms (ERGs), indicating dysfunction in the inner retina, particularly affecting the bipolar and ganglion cells (Simo et al., 2018). These changes are reflected in reduced contrast sensitivity, a critical aspect of visual function that allows individuals to discern objects against varying backgrounds (Antonetti et al., 2012). \n\nRodent models of diabetes have been instrumental in elucidating the neuronal mechanisms underlying these early changes. In these models, several neuronal deficits have been identified, including reduced evoked gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, increased excitatory glutamate signaling, and diminished dopamine signaling (Li et al., 2019). GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the retina, and its reduced release can lead to increased excitability and potential neurotoxicity. Conversely, excessive glutamate signaling can cause excitotoxicity, leading to neuronal damage and death (Zheng et al., 2012). Dopamine, a neuromodulator, plays a crucial role in retinal function, and its reduced signaling can impair visual processing and adaptation to changes in light conditions (Aung et al., 2013). \n\nThe early neuronal dysfunctions observed in diabetes are not limited to the inner retina. Photoreceptors, the primary light-sensing cells, also exhibit functional impairments. Studies have shown that diabetic rodents have altered photoreceptor responses, which may contribute to the overall visual dysfunction observed in diabetes (Barber et al., 2011). These changes are thought to result from metabolic stress and oxidative damage, common features of the diabetic milieu (Kowluru et al., 2014). \n\nThe concept of DR as a neurovascular disease has significant implications for treatment strategies. Current therapies primarily target the vascular component of DR, such as anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatments, which aim to reduce neovascularization and vascular leakage (Cheung et al., 2010). However, these treatments do not address the underlying neuronal dysfunctions that occur early in the disease process. Understanding the neuronal deficits in diabetes could lead to novel therapeutic approaches that target these early changes, potentially preventing or delaying the onset of DR. \n\nOne promising area of research is the use of neuroprotective agents that can preserve retinal function. For instance, agents that modulate glutamate signaling or enhance GABAergic activity could mitigate excitotoxicity and preserve neuronal integrity (Simo et al., 2018). Additionally, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key contributors to neuronal damage in diabetes (Kowluru et al., 2014). \n\nIn conclusion, the recognition of DR as a neurovascular disease highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to its management. Early detection of neuronal dysfunctions and the development of targeted therapies could significantly improve outcomes for patients with diabetes. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms of neuronal damage in diabetes and developing interventions that can preserve retinal function and prevent the progression of DR.", "References": [{"title": "Diabetic retinopathy: current understanding, mechanisms, and treatment strategies", "authors": "Simo, R., Hernandez, C., Porta, M.", "journal": "Diabetes Care", "year": "2018", "volumes": "41", "first page": "137", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.2337/dc17-2722"}, {"title": "Diabetic retinopathy: seeing beyond glucose-induced microvascular disease", "authors": "Antonetti, D.
