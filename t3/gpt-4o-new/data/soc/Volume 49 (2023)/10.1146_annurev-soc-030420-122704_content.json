{"Literature Review": "The concept of land in the United States is often perceived through the lens of a private-property regime, where land is commodified and controlled by individuals. However, this perspective oversimplifies the complex and multifaceted nature of land, which is shaped by a variety of cultural, legal, and material influences. This literature review explores the intricacies of land inequalities in the United States by examining land tenures, land regulations, and social identities, highlighting how these elements contribute to the unequal distribution of power and resources. \n\nLand tenures in the United States are not solely defined by private ownership but are influenced by a range of tenure systems that reflect historical and cultural contexts. For instance, the legacy of colonialism and the displacement of Indigenous peoples have resulted in a patchwork of land tenures that include tribal lands, public lands, and private properties (Wilkins, 2003). Indigenous land rights, often marginalized in mainstream discourse, represent a significant aspect of land tenure that challenges the dominant private-property paradigm (Coulthard, 2014). Furthermore, the persistence of feudal land tenures in certain regions, such as the use of long-term leases and land trusts, illustrates the diversity of landholding patterns that exist alongside private ownership (Davis, 2010). These varied tenure systems create a landscape where access to land and its benefits are unevenly distributed, often privileging certain groups while excluding others.\n\nLand regulations, encompassing zoning laws, environmental policies, and land use planning, play a crucial role in shaping land inequalities. Zoning laws, for example, have historically been used to segregate communities and reinforce racial and economic disparities (Rothstein, 2017). The implementation of exclusionary zoning practices has contributed to the concentration of wealth and resources in predominantly white, affluent neighborhoods, while limiting access to land and housing for marginalized communities (Pendall, 2000). Environmental regulations, while intended to protect natural resources, can also perpetuate inequalities by disproportionately affecting low-income and minority communities, who often bear the brunt of environmental degradation and are excluded from decision-making processes (Bullard, 2000). These regulatory frameworks, while appearing neutral, often reflect and reinforce existing power dynamics, contributing to the perpetuation of land inequalities.\n\nSocial identities, including race, class, and gender, intersect with land in complex ways, influencing who has access to land and its associated benefits. The historical and ongoing dispossession of Indigenous peoples, African Americans, and other marginalized groups highlights the role of social identities in shaping land inequalities (Harris, 1993). The concept of 'whiteness as property' underscores how racial identity has been used to legitimize the exclusion of non-white groups from land ownership and control (Harris, 1993). Additionally, gendered dimensions of land access reveal how patriarchal norms and practices have historically limited women's rights to land, affecting their economic security and social status (Agarwal, 1994). These intersecting identities create a complex web of inequalities, where access to land is not merely a matter of legal rights but is deeply embedded in social hierarchies and power relations.\n\nIn conclusion, land inequalities in the United States are shaped by a confluence of factors, including diverse land tenures, regulatory frameworks, and social identities. These elements interact in ways that challenge the notion of land as a settled object for individual control, revealing a more nuanced and contingent understanding of land. Addressing these inequalities requires a critical examination of the historical and cultural contexts that have shaped land relations, as well as a commitment to creating more equitable and inclusive land policies. By recognizing the diverse forms of land and the power dynamics they entail, we can begin to address the root causes of land inequalities and work towards a more just and equitable society.", "References": [{"title": "American Indian Politics and the American Political System", "authors": "David E.
