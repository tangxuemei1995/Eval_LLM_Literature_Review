{"Literature Review": "The study of neighborhood and school effects on children's outcomes has been a significant area of research in social sciences, with each context traditionally examined in isolation. However, recent scholarship has begun to explore the intersection of these two contexts, recognizing that both neighborhoods and schools play crucial roles in shaping children's educational, economic, and health outcomes. This literature review synthesizes findings from studies that jointly consider neighborhood and school effects, critiques the dichotomous evaluation of these contexts, and proposes a new framework that emphasizes the interconnectedness of neighborhood–school structures. \n\nHistorically, research on neighborhood effects has focused on how the socio-economic and physical characteristics of neighborhoods influence individual outcomes. For instance, Wilson (1987) highlighted the impact of concentrated poverty and social isolation in urban neighborhoods on residents' life chances. Similarly, Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls (1997) introduced the concept of collective efficacy, demonstrating how social cohesion and shared expectations for social control within neighborhoods can affect crime rates and other social outcomes. These studies underscore the importance of neighborhood context in shaping individual trajectories. \n\nParallel to neighborhood effects research, studies on school effects have examined how school resources, teacher quality, and peer influences contribute to student achievement. Coleman et al. (1966) conducted one of the earliest and most influential studies, revealing that family background and peer influences were more significant predictors of student achievement than school resources. Subsequent research by Hanushek (1997) and others has further explored the role of school quality in educational outcomes, emphasizing the importance of teacher effectiveness and school leadership. \n\nDespite the robust literatures on neighborhood and school effects, there has been a growing recognition of the need to consider these contexts jointly. Research by Owens (2010) and Wodtke, Harding, and Elwert (2011) has shown that neighborhood and school contexts are interrelated and that their combined effects can be more significant than their individual contributions. For example, Wodtke et al. (2011) found that the cumulative exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods and low-performing schools had a compounding negative effect on educational attainment. \n\nThe tendency to evaluate which context matters more—neighborhoods or schools—has been critiqued for oversimplifying the complex interplay between these environments. As noted by Galster (2012), such comparisons often fail to account for the dynamic processes through which neighborhoods and schools influence each other. For instance, neighborhood characteristics can affect school composition and resources, while school quality can influence neighborhood desirability and residential patterns. \n\nTo address these limitations, researchers have begun to explore the concept of neighborhood–school structures, which considers how families select neighborhoods and schools and how these choices are shaped by broader social and economic forces. This approach recognizes that neighborhoods and schools are not static entities but are mutually constitutive and cyclically influence one another. \n\nResearch on neighborhood and school selection processes has highlighted the role of segregation and inequality in shaping these contexts. Studies by Reardon and Owens (2014) and Bischoff and Tach (2018) have documented the persistence of racial and economic segregation in both neighborhoods and schools, which can exacerbate disparities in access to quality education and resources. These findings suggest that understanding the mechanisms of selection and segregation is crucial for addressing the root causes of inequality in educational and social outcomes. \n\nIncorporating neighborhood–school structures into contextual effects research offers several advantages. First, it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how social contexts influence individual outcomes by considering the interactions between neighborhoods and schools. Second, it provides insights into the processes of selection and segregation, which are critical for developing policies aimed at reducing inequality. Finally, it encourages a shift away from the binary evaluation of neighborhood versus school effects, promoting a more nuanced analysis of the complex social environments in which children develop. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of neighborhood and school effects on children's outcomes would benefit from a reorientation towards neighborhood–school structures. By considering the interconnectedness of these contexts and the processes of selection and segregation, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that shape individual trajectories and inform policies aimed at promoting equity and well-being. Future research should continue to explore the dynamic interactions between neighborhoods and schools and their implications for social and educational policy.", "References": [{"title": "The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy", "authors": "William Julius Wilson", "journal": "University of Chicago Press", "year": "1987", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Neighborhoods and Violent Crime: A Multilevel Study of Collective Efficacy", "authors": "Robert J.
