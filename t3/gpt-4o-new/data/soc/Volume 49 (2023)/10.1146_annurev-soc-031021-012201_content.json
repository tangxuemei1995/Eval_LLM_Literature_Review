{"Literature Review": "The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change. This shift, often referred to as supply-side decarbonization, has significant social implications that are increasingly being recognized by sociologists. Historically, the relationship between fossil fuels and societal development has been profound, with the Industrial Revolution marking a pivotal moment in this dynamic. The reliance on coal and other fossil fuels has shaped economic structures, labor markets, and social hierarchies (Malm, 2016). As the world moves towards decarbonization, understanding the social impacts of this transition is essential. \n\nOne of the primary social impacts of decarbonization is the transformation of labor markets. The fossil fuel industry has been a significant source of employment, particularly in regions where coal, oil, and gas extraction are prevalent. The transition to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, presents both challenges and opportunities for workers in these industries. Studies have shown that while renewable energy sectors can create new jobs, these jobs often require different skills and are located in different regions than traditional fossil fuel jobs (Carley & Konisky, 2020). This geographic and skill mismatch can lead to social dislocation and economic hardship for workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel industries (Healy & Barry, 2017). \n\nMoreover, the concept of a 'just transition' has emerged as a framework to address these social challenges. A just transition seeks to ensure that the shift to a low-carbon economy is fair and inclusive, providing support for workers and communities affected by the transition. This includes retraining programs, social safety nets, and policies that promote economic diversification in regions heavily reliant on fossil fuels (Newell & Mulvaney, 2013). The success of a just transition is contingent upon the involvement of various stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and civil society, in the planning and implementation of transition strategies (Jenkins, 2019). \n\nIn addition to labor market impacts, decarbonization also has implications for social equity and justice. The distribution of the benefits and burdens of energy transitions is often uneven, with marginalized communities bearing a disproportionate share of the negative impacts. For instance, low-income and minority communities are more likely to be located near polluting fossil fuel facilities and thus suffer from higher rates of pollution-related health issues (Sovacool et al., 2019). As energy systems transition, there is a risk that these communities may be further marginalized if they do not have access to the benefits of renewable energy, such as lower energy costs and improved air quality (Baker et al., 2019). \n\nFurthermore, the governance of energy transitions plays a crucial role in shaping their social impacts. The shift to renewable energy requires significant changes in energy policy and regulation, which can be contentious and politically challenging. The involvement of diverse stakeholders in decision-making processes is essential to ensure that energy transitions are equitable and inclusive (Meadowcroft, 2009). Participatory governance models, which involve local communities in energy planning and decision-making, have been shown to enhance social acceptance and support for renewable energy projects (Devine-Wright, 2011). \n\nFinally, the cultural dimensions of energy transitions are also significant. Energy systems are deeply embedded in cultural practices and social norms, and changes in these systems can have profound effects on societal values and behaviors. The transition to renewable energy may require shifts in consumption patterns, lifestyle changes, and new forms of social organization (Shove & Walker, 2010). Understanding these cultural dimensions is critical for designing effective policies and interventions that support sustainable energy transitions. \n\nIn conclusion, the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization are multifaceted and complex. While technological and economic factors are often emphasized in discussions of energy transitions, the social dimensions are equally important. Addressing the social impacts of decarbonization requires a comprehensive approach that considers labor market transformations, social equity, governance, and cultural change. As the world moves towards a low-carbon future, sociologists and other social scientists have a crucial role to play in understanding and addressing the social challenges and opportunities of this transition.", "References": [{"title": "Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the Roots of Global Warming", "authors": "Andreas Malm", "journal": "Verso Books", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Energy-based economic development", "authors": "Sanya Carley, David M.
