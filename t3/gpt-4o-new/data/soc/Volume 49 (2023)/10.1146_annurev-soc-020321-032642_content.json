{"Literature Review": "The concept of 'diverging destinies' was first introduced by McLanahan (2004) to describe the growing socioeconomic disparities in family structures and their implications for children's well-being. This framework has been extensively applied in Western contexts, where it has been shown that family behaviors such as marriage, divorce, and childbearing are increasingly stratified by socioeconomic status (SES), leading to divergent outcomes for children (McLanahan, 2004). However, the application of this framework to East Asian societies, characterized by unique cultural, economic, and policy contexts, remains underexplored. \n\nEast Asia, comprising countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, presents a distinct context for examining diverging destinies due to its low fertility rates, rapid economic development, and traditional gender roles. In these societies, the gender division of labor remains highly asymmetric, with women bearing the brunt of domestic responsibilities despite increasing participation in the workforce (Brinton, 2001). This gender inequality in labor division has significant implications for family behaviors and children's outcomes, as it influences decisions regarding marriage, childbearing, and child-rearing (Raymo & Iwasawa, 2005).\n\nIn China, the one-child policy, although relaxed in recent years, has had profound effects on family structures and children's well-being. The policy has led to a preference for male children, resulting in skewed sex ratios and increased pressure on families to invest heavily in the education and upbringing of their single child (Fong, 2002). This intense focus on child investment aligns with the diverging destinies framework, as families with greater resources can provide better educational and developmental opportunities, thereby perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities across generations (Wu & Treiman, 2004).\n\nJapan and South Korea, on the other hand, have experienced significant changes in family behaviors due to economic pressures and shifting cultural norms. In Japan, the rise in non-marital cohabitation and delayed marriage has been linked to economic instability and changing gender roles (Raymo & Iwasawa, 2005). Similarly, in South Korea, the increasing age of first marriage and declining fertility rates reflect broader socioeconomic trends and the challenges of balancing work and family life (Anderson & Kohler, 2015). These changes in family behaviors are stratified by SES, with higher-income individuals more likely to marry and have children, thus reinforcing the diverging destinies framework (Raymo et al., 2015).\n\nTaiwan presents a unique case where traditional family values coexist with modern economic realities. The emphasis on education and family investment in children is strong, yet public support for families is limited, leading to significant disparities in children's outcomes based on family resources (Yu, 2009). The diverging destinies framework is applicable here, as families with higher SES can afford better educational opportunities and resources, thereby enhancing their children's future prospects (Yu & Su, 2006).\n\nDespite these insights, the diverging destinies framework may not fully capture the complexities of family change and inequality in East Asia. The strong cultural emphasis on family and education, coupled with limited public support, creates a unique environment where family behaviors and children's outcomes are influenced by factors beyond SES (Ochiai, 2014). For instance, the role of extended family networks and cultural norms around filial piety can mitigate some of the negative effects of socioeconomic disparities (Ochiai, 2014).\n\nMoreover, the rapid economic development in East Asia has led to significant shifts in family structures and gender roles, which may not align neatly with the diverging destinies framework. The increasing participation of women in the workforce and the rise of dual-income households challenge traditional gender roles and create new dynamics in family behaviors and children's outcomes (Brinton, 2001). These changes necessitate a nuanced understanding of how socioeconomic factors interact with cultural and policy contexts to shape family behaviors and inequalities in East Asia.\n\nIn conclusion, while the diverging destinies framework provides a useful lens for examining family change and inequality in East Asia, it must be adapted to account for the region's unique cultural, economic, and policy contexts. Future research should focus on exploring the interactions between SES, gender roles, and cultural norms to better understand the complexities of family behaviors and children's outcomes in East Asia. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how and why family change and inequality manifest in these societies, and inform policies aimed at addressing these issues.", "References": [{"title": "Diverging destinies: How children are faring under the second demographic transition", "authors": "Sara McLanahan", "journal": "Demography", "year": "2004", "volumes": "41", "first page": "607", "last page": "627", "DOI": "10.1353/dem.2004.0033"}, {"title": "Women, the Family, and the Economy in Japan: The Case of Part-Time Work", "authors": "Mary C.
