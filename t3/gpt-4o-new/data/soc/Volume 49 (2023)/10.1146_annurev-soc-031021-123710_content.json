{"Literature Review": "Critical Race Theory (CRT) has emerged as a pivotal framework for understanding the dynamics of race and racism in society, particularly in relation to the concept of White privilege. CRT posits that racism is not an aberration but a fundamental and enduring aspect of social structures, which is crucial for understanding White privilege. This literature review explores the intersection of CRT and White privilege, examining how these concepts have been developed and applied, particularly in the context of higher education. \n\nThe foundational premise of CRT is that racism is ingrained in the fabric of society, manifesting through legal, cultural, and institutional structures (Delgado & Stefancic, 2017). This perspective challenges the notion of racism as merely individual acts of prejudice, instead highlighting systemic and structural dimensions. Within this framework, White privilege is understood as a set of advantages conferred upon individuals by virtue of their Whiteness, which are often invisible to those who benefit from them (McIntosh, 1988). The concept of Whiteness as property, as articulated by Cheryl Harris (1993), further elucidates this idea by arguing that Whiteness functions as a form of property that grants tangible and intangible benefits to White individuals. \n\nInterest convergence, another key tenet of CRT, posits that advances in racial justice occur only when they align with the interests of White individuals (Bell, 1980). This principle is instrumental in understanding the persistence of White privilege, as it suggests that systemic changes are often superficial and do not threaten the underlying power structures that maintain White dominance. The interplay between Whiteness as property and interest convergence underscores the resilience of White privilege, as it is perpetuated through both overt and covert mechanisms. \n\nThe development of the concept of White privilege has been marked by a growing recognition of its complexity and pervasiveness. Peggy McIntosh's seminal work on the 'invisible knapsack' of White privilege (1988) highlighted the everyday, often unacknowledged benefits that White individuals experience. Subsequent scholarship has expanded on this foundation, exploring how White privilege operates across various domains, including education, employment, and healthcare (Bonilla-Silva, 2014). In higher education, for instance, White privilege manifests in the predominance of Eurocentric curricula, the underrepresentation of faculty of color, and the marginalization of minority students (Gillborn, 2005). These dynamics contribute to the reproduction of racial hierarchies and the perpetuation of White supremacy within academic institutions. \n\nThe prioritization of gender over race in discussions of privilege and oppression is another critical issue addressed by CRT scholars. Kimberlé Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality (1989) has been instrumental in highlighting the need to consider multiple axes of identity and oppression. Intersectionality challenges the tendency to view race and gender as separate or competing categories, instead emphasizing their interconnectedness. This perspective is crucial for understanding how White privilege operates in conjunction with other forms of privilege and oppression, and for developing more nuanced analyses of social inequality. \n\nPolicy-making processes also play a significant role in maintaining White privilege. CRT scholars argue that policies are often designed to protect White identities and interests, thereby reinforcing existing power structures (Ladson-Billings, 1998). In the context of higher education, this is evident in admissions policies, funding allocations, and curricular decisions that prioritize the needs and perspectives of White students and faculty. Efforts to address these inequities, such as affirmative action and diversity initiatives, are frequently met with resistance and framed as threats to meritocracy and fairness (Bonilla-Silva, 2014). \n\nMoving forward, the concept of White privilege must be critically examined and redefined to address its limitations and potential for reinforcing racial hierarchies. Scholars have called for a more intersectional approach that considers the interplay of race, gender, class, and other identities in shaping experiences of privilege and oppression (Crenshaw, 1989). Additionally, there is a need for greater emphasis on structural and institutional change, rather than solely focusing on individual awareness and behavior. This requires a commitment to dismantling the systems and structures that uphold White privilege and creating more equitable and inclusive environments. \n\nIn conclusion, CRT provides a robust framework for understanding and challenging White privilege. By emphasizing the centrality of racism, the property-like nature of Whiteness, and the dynamics of interest convergence, CRT offers valuable insights into the persistence and complexity of White privilege. However, there is a need for ongoing critical engagement with these concepts to ensure that they contribute to meaningful social change and the dismantling of racial hierarchies.", "References": [{"title": "Critical Race Theory: An Introduction", "authors": "Richard Delgado, Jean Stefancic", "journal": "New York University Press", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack", "authors": "Peggy McIntosh", "journal": "Peace and Freedom Magazine", "year": "1988", "volumes": "", "first page": "10", "last page": "12", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Whiteness as Property", "authors": "Cheryl I.
