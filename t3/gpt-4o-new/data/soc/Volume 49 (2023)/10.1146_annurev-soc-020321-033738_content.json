{"Literature Review": "Ethnomethodology, a term coined by Harold Garfinkel, has significantly influenced the landscape of sociological research since the publication of 'Studies in Ethnomethodology' in 1967. This approach focuses on the methods and practices through which social order is produced and maintained in everyday interactions. Garfinkel's work was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of Alfred Sch√ºtz, who emphasized the subjective construction of social reality, and by Talcott Parsons's systems theory, which focused on the structural aspects of social systems. Ethnomethodology diverges from these theories by emphasizing the active role of individuals in constructing social order through their everyday practices (Garfinkel, 1967). \n\nOne of the central concerns of ethnomethodology is the problem of contextuality, which Garfinkel addressed by drawing on Karl Mannheim's documentary method of interpretation. This method involves understanding social actions by interpreting them within the context of the broader social framework in which they occur. Ethnomethodology extends this idea by examining how individuals use contextual cues to make sense of social interactions (Heritage, 1984). This focus on contextuality has led to the development of various subfields within ethnomethodology, including conversation analysis and membership categorization analysis. \n\nConversation analysis, a prominent subfield of ethnomethodology, examines the structure and organization of talk in interaction. It has provided insights into the sequential organization of conversation, turn-taking mechanisms, and repair strategies (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). This approach has been applied to a wide range of settings, from everyday conversations to institutional interactions, highlighting the intricate ways in which social order is maintained through talk (Schegloff, 2007). \n\nMembership categorization analysis, another subfield, focuses on how individuals use categories to make sense of social interactions. This approach examines how categories are invoked, negotiated, and contested in interaction, providing insights into the construction of social identities and the negotiation of social boundaries (Hester & Eglin, 1997). \n\nEthnomethodology has also been applied to the study of everyday life, particularly in relation to issues of race, gender, and other forms of social difference. Garfinkel's early work on the 'breaching experiments' demonstrated how social norms are maintained and challenged in everyday interactions (Garfinkel, 1967). Subsequent studies have explored how social categories such as race and gender are constructed and negotiated in interaction, highlighting the role of everyday practices in the reproduction of social inequalities (West & Zimmerman, 1987). \n\nIn addition to its focus on everyday life, ethnomethodology has been applied to the study of legal environments, social problems, and deviance. Studies in these areas have examined how legal and social norms are constructed and maintained through interaction, providing insights into the processes through which social order is produced and challenged (Lynch, 1993). \n\nEthnomethodology has also contributed to the study of instructed action, particularly in relation to the sciences, technology, and organizations. Studies in this area have examined how instructions are produced, interpreted, and followed in various settings, highlighting the role of interaction in the organization of work and the production of scientific knowledge (Suchman, 1987). \n\nA longstanding concern for ethnomethodology has been with the conduct of social sciences, particularly in relation to issues of coding, surveying, and standardization. Ethnomethodological studies have examined how social scientific practices are constructed and maintained through interaction, providing insights into the processes through which social scientific knowledge is produced and validated (Button & Sharrock, 1998). \n\nOverall, ethnomethodology has given rise to a wide range of innovative research, demonstrating the organization of details in social life and their consequences for social order. Its focus on the methods and practices through which social order is produced and maintained has provided valuable insights into the construction of social reality, highlighting the active role of individuals in shaping the social world.", "References": [{"title": "Studies in Ethnomethodology", "authors": "Harold Garfinkel", "journal": "", "year": "1967", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology", "authors": "John Heritage", "journal": "", "year": "1984", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation", "authors": "Harvey Sacks, Emanuel A.
