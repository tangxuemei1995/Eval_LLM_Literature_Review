{"Literature Review": "The study of cross-border politics, particularly diasporic mobilization and state response, has gained significant traction in recent decades, driven by the transnational turn in the social sciences. This shift has encouraged scholars to view immigration and emigration as interconnected phenomena, rather than isolated events occurring at the points of origin and destination, respectively. The transnational perspective has provided a more holistic understanding of how diasporic communities engage in political activities across borders and how states respond to these activities. \n\nDiasporic mobilization refers to the political activities undertaken by emigrant communities in their host countries, which often aim to influence the political landscape of their home countries. This mobilization can take various forms, including lobbying, advocacy, and participation in electoral processes. The political nature of cross-border movements creates conditions that both enable and constrain diasporic political mobilization. For instance, the political environment in the host country, the level of integration of the diaspora, and the policies of the home country all play crucial roles in shaping the nature and extent of diasporic political activities (Levitt & Jaworsky, 2007). \n\nOne of the key factors influencing diasporic mobilization is the political opportunity structure in the host country. This concept refers to the extent to which the political environment is open or closed to the participation of immigrant communities. In countries with open political systems, diasporas are more likely to engage in political activities, as they have greater access to resources and platforms for advocacy (Koopmans et al., 2005). Conversely, in countries with restrictive political environments, diasporas may face significant barriers to political participation, limiting their ability to mobilize effectively. \n\nThe level of integration of the diaspora in the host country also plays a critical role in shaping diasporic mobilization. Well-integrated diasporas are more likely to have the resources, networks, and skills necessary to engage in political activities. Integration can be facilitated by factors such as citizenship acquisition, language proficiency, and economic stability (Portes et al., 1999). However, integration does not necessarily lead to political mobilization, as diasporas may choose to focus on other aspects of their lives, such as economic advancement or cultural preservation. \n\nHome state policies towards diasporas are another crucial factor influencing diasporic mobilization. States may adopt various policies to engage with their diasporas, ranging from supportive measures, such as dual citizenship and voting rights, to restrictive measures, such as surveillance and repression (Gamlen, 2008). These policies can significantly impact the ability of diasporas to mobilize politically, as supportive policies may encourage engagement, while restrictive policies may deter it. \n\nThe modalities of home state policies towards diasporas can be categorized into three main types: engagement, control, and neglect. Engagement policies aim to foster positive relations with diasporas by providing them with rights and opportunities to participate in the political processes of their home countries. Control policies, on the other hand, seek to monitor and regulate the activities of diasporas, often to prevent them from engaging in activities perceived as threatening to the home state. Neglect policies involve a lack of engagement or interest in the diaspora, which can result in diasporas feeling disconnected from their home countries (Ragazzi, 2014). \n\nThe geopolitical context in which the transnational turn emerged has also evolved significantly over the past four decades. Globalization, technological advancements, and changing migration patterns have transformed the landscape of cross-border politics. These changes have implications for the study of diasporic mobilization and state response, as they have altered the ways in which diasporas engage in political activities and the strategies that states employ to respond to these activities (Faist, 2010). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of cross-border politics, particularly diasporic mobilization and state response, has been enriched by the transnational perspective. This approach has highlighted the interconnectedness of immigration and emigration and provided valuable insights into the factors that shape diasporic political activities and state responses. As the world continues to change, scholars must remain attentive to the evolving dynamics of cross-border politics and the implications for diasporic mobilization and state response.", "References": [{"title": "Transnational migration studies: Past developments and future trends", "authors": "Levitt, Peggy; Jaworsky, B.
