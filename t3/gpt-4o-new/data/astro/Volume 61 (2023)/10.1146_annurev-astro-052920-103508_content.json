{"Literature Review": "The application of Gaussian Process (GP) regression in astronomical time series analysis has gained significant traction over the past two decades, primarily due to the increasing availability and complexity of time-domain data sets. GPs offer a flexible, mathematically robust framework for modeling stochastic processes, making them particularly suitable for the diverse and often noisy data encountered in astronomy. This literature review explores the theoretical underpinnings of GPs, their practical applications in astronomy, and the challenges associated with their implementation. \n\nGaussian Processes are a class of non-parametric models that provide a probabilistic approach to regression and classification problems. They are defined by a mean function and a covariance function, which together describe the distribution over functions. The flexibility of GPs lies in their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships without the need for explicit parametric forms, making them ideal for capturing the inherent variability in astronomical data (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). \n\nIn the context of astronomy, GPs have been employed to model a wide range of phenomena. For instance, they have been used to analyze the light curves of exoplanets, where the goal is to detect and characterize transiting planets by modeling the stellar variability (Aigrain et al., 2012). The ability of GPs to model correlated noise is particularly advantageous in this setting, as it allows for the separation of planetary signals from stellar activity. Similarly, GPs have been applied to the study of active galactic nuclei (AGN), where they are used to model the variability in the light curves and infer the physical processes driving these changes (Kelly et al., 2009). \n\nThe mathematical simplicity of GPs, combined with their robustness, has led to their widespread adoption in various subfields of astronomy. For example, in the study of optical transients, GPs have been used to model the time evolution of supernova light curves, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms (Kim et al., 2013). The ability to incorporate prior knowledge through the choice of covariance function allows researchers to tailor the GP model to specific astrophysical scenarios, enhancing the interpretability of the results. \n\nDespite their advantages, the application of GPs in astronomy is not without challenges. One of the primary limitations is the computational cost associated with GP regression, which scales cubically with the number of data points. This makes the application of GPs to large data sets computationally expensive and often impractical. However, recent advances in sparse GP approximations and scalable algorithms have mitigated some of these challenges, enabling the application of GPs to larger data sets (Hensman et al., 2013). \n\nThe development of open-source software packages has also facilitated the adoption of GPs in the astronomical community. Tools such as George (Ambikasaran et al., 2015) and celerite (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2017) provide efficient implementations of GP regression, allowing researchers to apply these methods to their data with relative ease. These packages often include features such as automatic differentiation and support for various covariance functions, further enhancing their utility in astronomical applications. \n\nIn summary, Gaussian Process regression has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series, offering a flexible and robust framework for modeling complex, stochastic signals. While challenges remain, particularly in terms of computational scalability, ongoing algorithmic and software developments continue to expand the applicability of GPs in astronomy. As the field of time-domain astronomy continues to grow, driven by new observational facilities and data sets, GPs are likely to remain an essential tool for researchers seeking to extract meaningful insights from their data.", "References": [{"title": "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning", "authors": "Carl Edward Rasmussen, Christopher K.
