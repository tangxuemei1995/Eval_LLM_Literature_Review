{"Literature Review": "The narrative of a strategic scientist's journey through time and space, as depicted in the autobiographical account, offers a unique perspective on the evolution of astronomical sciences in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. The life and career of the author, who has been a pivotal figure in the development of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), reflect significant advancements in the field of astronomy and geodynamics over the past several decades. This literature review explores the key themes and contributions highlighted in the autobiography, drawing on relevant scientific literature to contextualize these developments. \n\nThe establishment of a precise Universal Time system in the 1960s was a landmark achievement in the field of timekeeping and astronomy. Universal Time, which is crucial for astronomical observations and navigation, has been a focus of scientific inquiry for centuries. The development of atomic clocks and other technologies in the mid-20th century significantly enhanced the precision of time measurement (Guinot, 1973). The author's work in this area contributed to the global effort to refine Universal Time, aligning with international standards and improving the accuracy of astronomical data (McCarthy & Seidelmann, 2009).\n\nThe implementation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) in China during the 1970s and 1980s marked a significant advancement in radio astronomy. VLBI is a technique that allows for the observation of celestial objects with unprecedented resolution by combining data from multiple radio telescopes across vast distances (Thompson et al., 2001). The author's leadership in establishing a VLBI network in China facilitated high-precision measurements of celestial phenomena and contributed to the global VLBI community (Zhang et al., 1997). This work laid the foundation for subsequent developments in radio astronomy and deep space exploration in the region.\n\nThe construction of a satellite laser ranging (SLR) research station during the late 20th century further exemplifies the author's strategic vision in advancing space geodynamics. SLR is a technique used to measure the distance between a ground station and a satellite with high precision, providing valuable data for geophysical and geodetic research (Pearlman et al., 2002). The establishment of an SLR station in China enhanced the country's capabilities in monitoring Earth's dynamics and contributed to international geodetic networks (Tapley et al., 2004).\n\nThe development of the 65-m Radio Telescope in the early 21st century represents a significant milestone in China's radio astronomy capabilities. Large radio telescopes are essential for observing faint and distant astronomical objects, and their construction requires substantial technical and financial resources (Nan et al., 2011). The author's role in spearheading this project underscores their commitment to advancing China's position in the global astronomical community and fostering international collaboration.\n\nThe promotion of astro-geodynamics in China and the Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program in the late 20th century highlights the author's contributions to understanding Earth's dynamic processes. Astro-geodynamics involves the study of the interactions between astronomical and geophysical phenomena, such as Earth's rotation and tectonic movements (Gross, 2000). The Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program, initiated under the author's leadership, facilitated regional cooperation in geodetic research and contributed to the global understanding of Earth's dynamics (Beutler et al., 2005).\n\nThe author's involvement in international cooperation, particularly through leadership roles in the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the Royal Astronomical Society, reflects a commitment to fostering global collaboration in astronomy. International cooperation is essential for advancing scientific knowledge and addressing complex challenges that transcend national boundaries (Trimble, 2000). The author's efforts in promoting international collaboration have contributed to the integration of Chinese astronomy into the global scientific community and facilitated the exchange of knowledge and expertise.\n\nIn addition to scientific achievements, the author's social activities aimed at benefiting women and children demonstrate a commitment to social responsibility and equity. The promotion of gender equality and support for underprivileged groups are important aspects of scientific leadership, as they contribute to a more inclusive and diverse scientific community (Schiebinger, 1999). The author's initiatives in this area align with broader efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in science and technology fields.\n\nOverall, the autobiographical account of the author's journey as a strategic scientist provides valuable insights into the evolution of astronomical sciences in China and the Asia-Pacific region. The author's contributions to timekeeping, radio astronomy, space geodynamics, and international cooperation have had a lasting impact on the field and continue to inspire future generations of scientists. This literature review highlights the significance of these contributions and situates them within the broader context of scientific advancements and international collaboration.", "References": [{"title": "Atomic time-keeping from 1955 to the present", "authors": "Guinot, B.", "journal": "Metrologia", "year": "1973", "volumes": "9", "first page": "65", "last page": "68", "DOI": "10.1088/0026-1394/9/2/002"}, {"title": "Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics", "authors": "McCarthy, D.
