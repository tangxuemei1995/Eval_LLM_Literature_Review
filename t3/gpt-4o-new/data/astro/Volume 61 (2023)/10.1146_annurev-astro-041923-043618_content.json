{"Literature Review": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in the study of galaxy formation and evolution within the framework of the ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) cosmogony. These simulations have made significant strides in reproducing the observed properties of galaxies, including their spatial distribution, mass, size, and star formation rates (SFR). The ability of these simulations to replicate such characteristics has bolstered confidence in their utility for understanding the complex processes governing galaxy formation. However, despite these successes, several challenges remain, particularly concerning the modeling of circumgalactic gas and the sensitivity of simulation outcomes to subgrid models. \n\nOne of the primary successes of hydrodynamical simulations is their ability to reproduce the spatial clustering of galaxies. This achievement is crucial because it aligns with observations from large-scale galaxy surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al., 2000). The spatial distribution of galaxies is a fundamental test of cosmological models, and the agreement between simulations and observations suggests that the underlying cosmological framework is robust. Moreover, simulations like Illustris (Vogelsberger et al., 2014) and EAGLE (Schaye et al., 2015) have successfully captured the large-scale structure of the universe, providing insights into the processes that drive galaxy clustering.\n\nIn addition to spatial clustering, hydrodynamical simulations have made significant progress in reproducing the distributions of key galaxy properties, such as mass, size, and SFR. The mass distribution of galaxies, often characterized by the stellar mass function, is a critical observable that simulations must match. The IllustrisTNG project (Pillepich et al., 2018) has demonstrated success in this area, accurately reproducing the observed stellar mass function across a wide range of redshifts. Similarly, the EAGLE simulation has been successful in matching the observed size distribution of galaxies, which is essential for understanding the structural evolution of galaxies over cosmic time (Furlong et al., 2017).\n\nThe scaling relations that connect diverse galaxy properties to mass, such as the Tully-Fisher relation and the mass-metallicity relation, are another area where hydrodynamical simulations have shown success. These relations are crucial for understanding the interplay between galaxy mass and other properties, such as luminosity and metallicity. The success of simulations in reproducing these relations provides confidence in the physical processes implemented in the models, such as star formation and feedback mechanisms (Genel et al., 2014).\n\nDespite these successes, several challenges remain, particularly concerning the properties of circumgalactic gas. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, acting as a reservoir of gas that can fuel star formation and as a site for feedback processes that regulate galaxy growth. However, the properties of the CGM are highly sensitive to the details of subgrid models used in simulations. These models approximate the effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are critical for regulating the baryon cycle in galaxies (Crain et al., 2015).\n\nThe sensitivity of simulation outcomes to subgrid models poses a significant challenge for hydrodynamical simulations. Different simulation suites often employ different subgrid models, leading to variations in the predicted properties of the CGM and other galaxy characteristics. For instance, the FIRE simulations (Hopkins et al., 2014) emphasize the role of stellar feedback in shaping galaxy properties, while the IllustrisTNG simulations incorporate a more detailed treatment of AGN feedback. These differences can lead to discrepancies in the predicted properties of galaxies and their surrounding gas, highlighting the need for further refinement of subgrid models.\n\nComparisons between different simulation suites and observations are essential for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current models. Such comparisons can help to pinpoint areas where simulations agree with observations and where they diverge, providing guidance for future model development. For example, the comparison of EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations has revealed differences in the predicted gas fractions and metallicities of galaxies, which can be attributed to differences in feedback implementations (Nelson et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, hydrodynamical simulations have made significant progress in modeling the galaxy population within the ΛCDM framework. They have successfully reproduced many observed properties of galaxies, providing valuable insights into the processes governing galaxy formation and evolution. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the modeling of circumgalactic gas and the sensitivity of simulation outcomes to subgrid models. Addressing these challenges will require continued refinement of simulation techniques and further comparisons with observations to ensure that simulations accurately capture the complex interplay of processes that shape galaxies.", "References": [{"title": "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Technical Summary", "authors": "Donald G.
