{"Literature Review": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has opened a new frontier in the study of celestial bodies, providing unique insights into the composition and dynamics of objects formed outside our Solar System. These interlopers are significant because they offer a rare opportunity to study material from other star systems, potentially enhancing our understanding of planetary formation and the distribution of matter in the galaxy. \n\n1I/‘Oumuamua, the first identified interstellar object, was discovered in October 2017. It exhibited an elongated shape and a lack of a visible coma, which is typically associated with comets, leading to its initial classification as an asteroid-like object (Meech et al., 2017). However, its trajectory showed signs of non-gravitational acceleration, suggesting outgassing similar to comets, although no gas or dust was detected (Micheli et al., 2018). This led to various hypotheses about its composition and origin, including the possibility of it being a fragment of a larger body or even an artificial object (Bialy & Loeb, 2018). \n\nIn contrast, 2I/Borisov, discovered in August 2019, displayed characteristics more typical of a comet, with a visible coma and tail composed of gas and dust (Jewitt & Luu, 2019). Its composition was found to be similar to Solar System comets, with the presence of water vapor and carbon monoxide, suggesting that it formed in a cold region of its home system (Cordiner et al., 2020). The differences between 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov highlight the diversity of interstellar objects and suggest that they may originate from different types of protoplanetary disks or regions within those disks. \n\nThe number density of interstellar interlopers, estimated to be approximately 0.1 AU−3, implies a vast population of such objects in the Milky Way, potentially numbering between 10^25 and 10^26 (Do et al., 2018). This density suggests that the ejection of material from protoplanetary disks is a common process in the galaxy, possibly driven by gravitational interactions with giant planets or stellar encounters (Raymond et al., 2018). The study of these interlopers can therefore provide valuable information about the processes that govern the formation and evolution of planetary systems. \n\nThe origin of interstellar interlopers is still a matter of debate. While the protoplanetary disk ejection hypothesis is widely accepted, alternative explanations have been proposed. For instance, some researchers suggest that these objects could be remnants of disrupted planets or moons, or even fragments from collisions between larger bodies (Jackson et al., 2018). The lack of comprehensive data on these objects makes it challenging to definitively determine their origins, and further observations and discoveries are needed to refine our understanding. \n\nThe study of interstellar interlopers is still in its infancy, and the limited data available on 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov underscores the need for more advanced observational techniques and missions dedicated to the detection and analysis of such objects. Future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are expected to play a crucial role in identifying new interstellar visitors and providing more detailed data on their properties (Trilling et al., 2017). Additionally, missions designed to intercept and study these objects up close could provide unprecedented insights into their composition and structure, furthering our understanding of the galactic environment. \n\nIn conclusion, interstellar interlopers like 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov represent a new class of celestial objects that challenge our understanding of planetary formation and the dynamics of the galaxy. Their study offers a unique opportunity to explore the diversity of material in the universe and the processes that shape planetary systems. As observational capabilities improve and more interlopers are discovered, we can expect to gain a deeper understanding of these enigmatic visitors and their role in the broader context of astrophysics.", "References": [{"title": "A brief visit from a red and extremely elongated interstellar asteroid", "authors": "Meech, K.
