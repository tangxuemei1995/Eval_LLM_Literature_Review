{"Literature Review": "The formation and evolution of the first stars, known as Population III (Pop III) stars, represent a pivotal chapter in cosmic history. These stars formed from primordial, metal-free gas clouds at redshifts around z âˆ¼ 30 and below, marking the transition from the cosmic dark ages to the era of reionization. Theoretical models suggest that Pop III stars formed in small clusters due to the fragmentation of primordial gas, which is highly susceptible to such processes (Bromm & Larson, 2004). The mass function of these stars is believed to be logarithmically flat, indicating a wide range of stellar masses, although the exact distribution remains uncertain (Abel et al., 2002).\n\nThe feedback mechanisms from massive Pop III stars are crucial in regulating subsequent star formation. These stars, with their intense ultraviolet radiation and supernova explosions, significantly impact their surroundings by heating and ionizing the interstellar medium, thereby influencing the formation of subsequent generations of stars (Whalen et al., 2008). However, the immediate impact of this feedback is still a subject of debate, with some models suggesting that it could either suppress or trigger further star formation (Greif et al., 2010).\n\nIn extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, potentially reaching masses of several 10^5 solar masses. These stars are of particular interest because their remnants may serve as the seeds for the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars (Volonteri, 2010). The formation of such massive stars is thought to occur in regions of high gas density and low angular momentum, where rapid accretion can occur (Hosokawa et al., 2013).\n\nDirect observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe are extremely challenging due to their distance and the faintness of their signals. However, indirect methods such as the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves offer promising avenues for constraining their properties (Furlanetto et al., 2006). The 21-cm signal, in particular, provides a unique probe of the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization, potentially revealing the influence of Pop III stars on their environment (Pritchard & Loeb, 2012).\n\nStellar archaeological surveys have also provided valuable insights into the mass distribution of Pop III stars. By studying the chemical abundances of ancient stars in the Milky Way, researchers can infer the properties of their Pop III progenitors. These observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, which has implications for the chemical enrichment of the early Universe (Frebel & Norris, 2015).\n\nThe transition from Pop III to metal-enriched Population II (Pop II) stars marks a significant shift in the cosmic star-formation history. This transition is driven by the enrichment of the interstellar medium with metals from the first supernovae, which facilitates the cooling of gas clouds and the formation of lower-mass stars (Bromm & Yoshida, 2011). Theoretical models and simulations have been instrumental in exploring this transition, highlighting the complex interplay between star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment (Maio et al., 2010).\n\nFuture observational efforts, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and next-generation radio telescopes, are expected to provide further constraints on the properties and impact of Pop III stars. These instruments will enable the detection of faint signals from the early Universe, offering new insights into the formation and evolution of the first stars (Gardner et al., 2006). As our understanding of Pop III stars continues to evolve, they remain a key focus of research in cosmology and galactic archaeology, offering a window into the conditions of the early Universe and the processes that shaped the cosmos as we know it.", "References": [{"title": "The formation of the first stars and galaxies", "authors": "Bromm, V., Larson, R.
