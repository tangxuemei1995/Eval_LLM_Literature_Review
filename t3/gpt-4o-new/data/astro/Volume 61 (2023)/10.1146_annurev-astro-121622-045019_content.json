{"Literature Review": "Optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has undergone significant advancements over the past few decades, driven by technological innovations and the development of sophisticated instruments. The GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) array are at the forefront of these advancements, enabling observations of fainter objects with unprecedented resolution and precision. This literature review explores the key developments in O/IR interferometry, focusing on the technological breakthroughs and their implications for astronomical research. \n\nThe GRAVITY instrument, operational at the VLTI, represents a major leap in the capabilities of O/IR interferometry. By utilizing four 8-meter telescopes, GRAVITY achieves a sensitivity that allows for the observation of objects up to a thousand times fainter than those detectable by earlier interferometers (Eisenhauer et al., 2011). This sensitivity is crucial for studying faint astronomical phenomena such as the Galactic Center, exoplanets, and active galactic nuclei. The instrument's ability to achieve submilliarcsecond resolution and microarcsecond astrometry has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the precise measurement of the orbits of stars around the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way (Gravity Collaboration et al., 2018).\n\nThe CHARA array, with its 330-meter baselines and six 1-meter telescopes, complements the capabilities of GRAVITY by providing high-resolution imaging and aperture synthesis. This array has been instrumental in studying stellar surfaces and binary star systems, offering insights into stellar physics and the processes governing stellar evolution (ten Brummelaar et al., 2005). The combination of long baselines and multiple telescopes allows for detailed imaging of stellar environments, contributing to our understanding of phenomena such as star formation and the dynamics of young stellar objects (Monnier et al., 2007).\n\nA significant factor in the enhanced performance of modern interferometers is the development of single-mode beam combiners, which can now combine light from up to six telescopes. This advancement, coupled with improved image reconstruction software, has its roots in earlier developments in radio interferometry (Thompson et al., 2001). The transition from radio to optical/infrared wavelengths required overcoming challenges related to atmospheric turbulence and the coherence of light, which have been addressed through adaptive optics (AO) and fringe tracking technologies (Roddier, 1999).\n\nAdaptive optics systems correct for the distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere, allowing for clearer and more precise observations. The integration of AO with O/IR interferometry, particularly in the GRAVITY instrument, has significantly boosted sensitivity and resolution (Davies & Kasper, 2012). Fringe tracking, which stabilizes the interference pattern of light from different telescopes, is another critical component that enhances the performance of interferometers. Dual-beam interferometry, as implemented in GRAVITY, further improves sensitivity by allowing simultaneous observations of a target and a reference star, reducing the impact of atmospheric fluctuations (Lacour et al., 2014).\n\nLooking to the future, the implementation of laser guide star AO promises another order-of-magnitude improvement in O/IR interferometry. This technology will enable complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets, expanding the range of observable phenomena (Wizinowich et al., 2006). The combination of laser guide stars with large separation fringe tracking will allow astronomers to probe deeper into the universe, potentially uncovering new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, the nature of dark matter, and the properties of distant exoplanets.\n\nIn conclusion, the advances in O/IR interferometry, exemplified by instruments like GRAVITY and the CHARA array, have revolutionized our ability to observe and understand the universe. The integration of large telescopes, adaptive optics, and sophisticated beam combining techniques has pushed the boundaries of what is possible in astronomical observations. As technology continues to evolve, the potential for new discoveries in fields ranging from stellar physics to cosmology remains vast, promising exciting developments in the years to come.", "References": [{"title": "GRAVITY: a four-telescope beam combiner instrument for the VLTI", "authors": "Eisenhauer, F., Perrin, G., Brandner, W., Straubmeier, C., Perraut, K., Amorim, A., Schöller, M., Gillessen, S., Eckart, A., Genzel, R.", "journal": "The Messenger", "year": "2011", "volumes": "143", "first page": "16", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.18727/0722-6691/5204"}, {"title": "First light for GRAVITY: Phase referencing optical interferometry for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer", "authors": "Gravity Collaboration, Abuter, R., Accardo, M., Amorim, A., Anugu, N., Bauböck, M., Benisty, M., Berger, J.
