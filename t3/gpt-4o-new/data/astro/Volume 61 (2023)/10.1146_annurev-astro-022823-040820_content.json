{"Literature Review": "Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, consisting of gas and dust surrounding young stars. The chemistry within these disks plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planets. Understanding the chemical processes in protoplanetary disks is essential for comprehending the initial conditions of planet formation and the resulting chemical compositions of planets. This literature review explores the chemistry of volatile elements such as hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P) in protoplanetary disks, examining both observational and theoretical approaches, and the implications for planet formation.\n\nThe chemical composition of protoplanetary disks is influenced by both inherited material from the molecular cloud and in situ chemical processes. Inherited material refers to the chemical composition of the molecular cloud from which the star and disk form. Studies have shown that the initial chemical composition of the disk is largely determined by the molecular cloud, with some modifications occurring during the collapse and disk formation stages (Bergin et al., 2007). In situ chemistry, on the other hand, involves chemical reactions that occur within the disk itself, driven by factors such as temperature, radiation, and density (Henning & Semenov, 2013).\n\nThe elemental ratios of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation, chemical reactions, and dynamical processes. For instance, the O/C/N/H ratios in disks can be altered by the condensation of volatile molecules onto dust grains, which removes them from the gas phase (Öberg et al., 2011). This process can lead to significant variations in the chemical composition of the disk, affecting the types of planets that form and their potential habitability (Pontoppidan et al., 2014).\n\nObservational studies of protoplanetary disks have provided valuable insights into their chemical compositions. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has been instrumental in detecting various molecules in disks, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as methanol and formaldehyde (Walsh et al., 2014). These observations suggest that disks are rich in organic material, which could be important for the formation of prebiotic molecules on planets (Jørgensen et al., 2020).\n\nTheoretical models of disk chemistry aim to simulate the chemical evolution of disks and predict the abundances of different molecules. These models consider various physical and chemical processes, including gas-phase reactions, grain-surface reactions, and photodissociation (Woitke et al., 2009). However, modeling disk chemistry is challenging due to the complex interplay between chemical, physical, and dynamical processes. For example, turbulence and radial mixing can transport material across the disk, affecting the local chemical composition (Ciesla & Cuzzi, 2006).\n\nThe links between disk and planet chemical compositions are of great interest to researchers. The chemical composition of a planet is influenced by the material it accretes from the disk, which in turn depends on the disk's chemical evolution. Studies have shown that the composition of gas giants is particularly sensitive to the disk's chemical history, as they form from the accretion of gas and solids (Madhusudhan et al., 2014). Understanding these links is crucial for interpreting the observed compositions of exoplanets and assessing their potential habitability (Mordasini et al., 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, the chemistry of protoplanetary disks is a complex and dynamic field of study, with significant implications for planet formation and the chemical compositions of planets. The interplay between inherited and in situ chemistry, the deviations of elemental ratios from stellar values, and the links between disk and planet compositions are key areas of research. Advances in observational techniques and theoretical models continue to enhance our understanding of protoplanetary disk chemistry, providing valuable insights into the origins of planets and their potential for hosting life.", "References": [{"title": "The Chemical Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks", "authors": "Bergin, Edwin A., Aikawa, Yuri, Blake, Geoffrey A., van Dishoeck, Ewine F.", "journal": "Protostars and Planets V", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "751", "last page": "766", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4020-6997-8_43"}, {"title": "Chemistry in Protoplanetary Disks", "authors": "Henning, Thomas, Semenov, Dmitry", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2013", "volumes": "113", "first page": "9016", "last page": "9042", "DOI": "10.1021/cr400128p"}, {"title": "The Spitzer c2d Legacy Results: The Organic Composition of Disks and the Potential for Prebiotic Chemistry", "authors": "Öberg, Karin I., Qi, Chunhua, Fogel, Jeffrey K.
