{"Literature Review": "The study of quasars at cosmic dawn offers a unique window into the early Universe, providing insights into the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their role in galaxy formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Quasars, being among the most luminous and distant objects, serve as beacons that illuminate the conditions of the early Universe. The discovery of quasars at redshifts greater than 7.5 has pushed the boundaries of our understanding of cosmic history, revealing the presence of billion-solar-mass black holes within the first billion years after the Big Bang (Mortlock et al., 2011). \n\nThe number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at redshifts greater than 5, suggesting that the earliest quasars began to emerge around redshift 10 (Fan et al., 2006). This decline in number density is indicative of the rapid formation and evolution of quasars during this period. The lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution suggests a rapid buildup of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) environment, which is crucial for understanding the conditions that allow for such rapid growth (Jiang et al., 2007). \n\nThe existence of billion-solar-mass black holes at redshifts greater than 7.5 poses significant challenges to our understanding of black hole formation and growth. These SMBHs must form and grow in less than 700 million years, requiring a combination of massive early black hole seeds and highly efficient, sustained accretion (Volonteri, 2010). Theories suggest that these seeds could form from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds or from the remnants of the first generation of stars, known as Population III stars (Bromm & Yoshida, 2011). \n\nThe rapid growth of quasars is often accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in their host galaxies. Observations indicate that these host galaxies exhibit diverse morphological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical masses lower than those implied by the local black hole-galaxy scaling relations (Wang et al., 2013). This suggests that the processes governing black hole growth and galaxy evolution at cosmic dawn may differ significantly from those observed in the local Universe. \n\nQuasar spectra provide valuable information about the IGM during the EoR. The presence of hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra allows researchers to probe the tail end of cosmic reionization at redshifts around 5.3 to 6, indicating that the midpoint of the EoR occurred between redshifts 6.9 and 7.6 (Becker et al., 2001). These observations reveal large spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization, suggesting a patchy reionization process (Fan et al., 2006). \n\nIn addition to hydrogen absorption, observations of heavy element absorption lines in quasar spectra provide insights into the evolution of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) during the EoR. These lines suggest that the CGM experiences significant changes in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during this period (Simcoe et al., 2012). The presence of metals in the CGM indicates that star formation and feedback processes in early galaxies played a crucial role in enriching the IGM with heavy elements. \n\nOverall, the study of quasars at cosmic dawn has significantly advanced our understanding of the early Universe. These observations have provided critical insights into the formation and growth of SMBHs, the evolution of galaxies, and the reionization of the IGM. Future observations with next-generation telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, are expected to further illuminate the mysteries of cosmic dawn, providing even deeper insights into the processes that shaped the early Universe.", "References": [{"title": "A luminous quasar at a redshift of z = 7.085", "authors": "Daniel J.
