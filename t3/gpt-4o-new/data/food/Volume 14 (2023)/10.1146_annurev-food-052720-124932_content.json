{"Literature Review": "The molecular changes of meat proteins during processing have significant implications for the quality and nutritional value of meat products. Proteins, being a major component of meat, undergo various transformations during processing, which can affect their structure, functionality, and nutritional properties. Understanding these changes is crucial for improving meat quality and ensuring its nutritional benefits. \n\nOne of the primary molecular changes that occur in meat proteins during processing is denaturation. Denaturation involves the unfolding of protein structures, leading to the loss of their native conformation. This process is often induced by heat, pH changes, or mechanical forces during processing (Huff-Lonergan & Lonergan, 2005). Denaturation can affect the solubility, water-holding capacity, and texture of meat, which are critical quality attributes (Huff-Lonergan & Lonergan, 2005). For instance, heat-induced denaturation can lead to the aggregation of proteins, resulting in a firmer texture, which is desirable in some meat products but not in others (Tornberg, 2005).\n\nAnother significant change is the oxidation of meat proteins. Oxidation can occur during processing and storage, leading to the formation of carbonyl groups and disulfide bonds, which can alter the protein's functional properties (Lund et al., 2011). Oxidative modifications can decrease the digestibility and bioavailability of proteins, as they may hinder the action of digestive enzymes (Estevez, 2011). Moreover, protein oxidation is associated with the development of off-flavors and color changes, negatively impacting meat quality (Lund et al., 2011).\n\nThe nutritional value of meat proteins is also influenced by processing-induced changes. Proteins are a source of essential amino acids, and their bioavailability is crucial for human nutrition. Processing methods such as cooking can enhance the digestibility of proteins by denaturing them, making them more accessible to digestive enzymes (Rutherfurd et al., 2015). However, excessive processing can lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and other compounds that may reduce protein quality and pose health risks (Uribarri et al., 2010).\n\nHigh meat intake has been associated with various health risks, including cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers (Bouvard et al., 2015). These risks are partly attributed to the presence of harmful compounds formed during processing, such as heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Sinha et al., 1998). These compounds are formed during high-temperature cooking methods like grilling and frying and have been shown to be carcinogenic in animal studies (Sinha et al., 1998).\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with meat consumption, several preventive strategies have been proposed. These include the use of antioxidants to inhibit protein oxidation, the application of marination techniques to reduce the formation of harmful compounds, and the development of novel processing methods that minimize nutrient loss and the formation of undesirable compounds (Estevez, 2011; Gibis & Weiss, 2010). Additionally, consumer education on cooking methods and portion sizes can help reduce health risks associated with meat consumption (Bouvard et al., 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, the molecular changes of meat proteins during processing have profound effects on the quality and nutritional value of meat. While processing can enhance certain attributes, it can also lead to the formation of undesirable compounds that pose health risks. Understanding these changes and implementing preventive strategies are essential for improving meat quality and ensuring its nutritional benefits. Future research should focus on developing innovative processing techniques that preserve protein quality and minimize health risks, as well as exploring the role of dietary patterns in modulating the effects of meat consumption.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of water-holding capacity of meat: The role of postmortem biochemical and structural changes", "authors": "Huff-Lonergan, E., Lonergan, S.
