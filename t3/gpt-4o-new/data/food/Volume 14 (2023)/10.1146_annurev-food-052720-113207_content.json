{"Literature Review": "Microbubbles, defined as gas-filled bubbles with diameters typically less than 100 micrometers, have garnered significant attention in various industries due to their unique physicochemical properties. In the context of food technology, microbubbles present a novel approach to enhancing food safety, sustainability, and functionality. This review explores the generation techniques, modes of action, and potential applications of microbubbles in the food industry. \n\nThe generation of microbubbles can be achieved through several methods, including mechanical, chemical, and acoustic techniques. Mechanical methods, such as the use of microfluidic devices, allow for precise control over bubble size and distribution (Tsuge, 2014). Chemical methods often involve the use of surfactants to stabilize the bubbles, which can be tailored to specific applications (Kawagoe et al., 2015). Acoustic methods, such as sonication, utilize sound waves to create microbubbles and are particularly effective in liquid media (Leighton, 2012). Each of these methods offers distinct advantages and can be selected based on the desired application within the food industry.\n\nMicrobubbles have been shown to enhance cleaning and disinfection processes due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio, which increases the interaction with contaminants. Studies have demonstrated that microbubbles can effectively remove biofilms and other microbial contaminants from surfaces, making them a valuable tool for ensuring food safety (Liu et al., 2016). The ability of microbubbles to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) further enhances their disinfectant properties, as ROS can effectively inactivate a wide range of pathogens (Zhang et al., 2015).\n\nIn addition to their cleaning capabilities, microbubbles can improve the functional and mechanical properties of food materials. For instance, the incorporation of microbubbles into dough has been shown to enhance its rheological properties, resulting in improved texture and volume of baked products (Niranjan & Park, 2010). Similarly, microbubbles can be used to create stable foams and emulsions, which are essential in the production of various food products such as ice cream and whipped toppings (Campbell & Mougeot, 1999).\n\nMicrobubbles also play a role in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics and bioreactors. Their ability to enhance gas exchange and nutrient delivery makes them ideal for promoting the growth of plants and microorganisms (Kawagoe et al., 2015). In hydroponic systems, microbubbles can increase the oxygenation of nutrient solutions, leading to improved plant growth and yield (Kawagoe et al., 2015). In bioreactors, microbubbles can enhance the efficiency of fermentation processes by improving the mass transfer of gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide (Tsuge, 2014).\n\nThe environmental benefits of microbubbles are also noteworthy. Their use in cleaning and disinfection processes can reduce the need for harsh chemical agents, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of food production (Liu et al., 2016). Additionally, the energy-efficient nature of microbubble generation methods contributes to the sustainability of food processing operations (Leighton, 2012).\n\nDespite their potential, the adoption of microbubbles in the food industry remains limited. This is partly due to the lack of awareness and understanding of their benefits among industry stakeholders. However, as research continues to demonstrate the advantages of microbubbles, it is anticipated that their use will become more widespread. The low cost of microbubble generation and their versatility in various applications make them an attractive option for enhancing food safety, quality, and sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, microbubbles offer a promising solution to several challenges faced by the food industry. Their ability to enhance cleaning and disinfection, improve the functional properties of food materials, and support the growth of living organisms highlights their potential as a valuable tool in food technology. As the industry continues to seek sustainable and efficient solutions, the adoption of microbubbles is likely to increase, paving the way for innovative applications and improved food production processes.", "References": [{"title": "Microbubbles: From Fundamentals to Applications", "authors": "Tsuge, H.", "journal": "Elsevier", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Microbubble generation and its application in environmental engineering", "authors": "Kawagoe, Y., Shimizu, N., & Maeda, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Engineering", "year": "2015", "volumes": "141", "first page": "04014050", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000910"}, {"title": "The Acoustic Bubble", "authors": "Leighton, T.
