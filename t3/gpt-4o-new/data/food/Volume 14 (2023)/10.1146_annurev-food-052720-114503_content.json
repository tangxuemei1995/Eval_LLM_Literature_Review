{"Literature Review": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides (NFOs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. These oligosaccharides, which include galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), manno-oligosaccharides (MOS), chito-oligosaccharides (COS), and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), are not digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract and reach the colon where they exert beneficial effects on the gut microbiota. The enzymatic production of these oligosaccharides is preferred over chemical methods due to the specificity, predictability, and controllability of the enzymatic processes, which allow for the production of oligosaccharides with desired structures and functionalities (Gänzle, 2012). \n\nGalacto-oligosaccharides are synthesized from lactose using β-galactosidase enzymes. They are well-known for their ability to selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in the gut (Sako et al., 1999). GOS have been shown to improve intestinal health by enhancing the gut barrier function and modulating the immune system (Macfarlane et al., 2008). Xylo-oligosaccharides, derived from xylan-rich agricultural by-products, are produced using xylanase enzymes. XOS have been reported to have prebiotic effects similar to GOS, promoting the growth of Bifidobacteria and improving bowel function (Aachary and Prapulla, 2011). \n\nManno-oligosaccharides are produced from mannans using mannanase enzymes. They have been shown to possess prebiotic properties, enhancing the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria (Gibson et al., 2004). Chito-oligosaccharides, derived from chitin using chitinase enzymes, have been studied for their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, in addition to their prebiotic effects (Park et al., 2002). Human milk oligosaccharides, although complex and diverse, are produced using a combination of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. HMOs are known for their role in infant nutrition, promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and protecting against pathogens (Bode, 2012). \n\nThe physicochemical properties of NFOs, such as solubility, stability, and viscosity, are crucial for their application in food products. These properties can be tailored through enzymatic processes to enhance the quality and functionality of food products. For instance, GOS can improve the texture and shelf-life of dairy products, while XOS can be used to enhance the fiber content of baked goods (Roberfroid, 2007). The incorporation of NFOs into food products not only improves their nutritional profile but also offers health benefits, such as improved digestion and enhanced immune function (Slavin, 2013). \n\nThe prebiotic effects of NFOs are primarily attributed to their ability to modulate the gut microbiota. By selectively stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria, NFOs contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome, which is associated with various health benefits, including improved digestion, enhanced immune function, and reduced risk of gastrointestinal disorders (Rastall and Gibson, 2015). Moreover, the fermentation of NFOs by gut bacteria produces short-chain fatty acids, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties (Macfarlane and Macfarlane, 2003). \n\nIn conclusion, the enzymatic production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides offers a promising approach for the development of functional food ingredients with prebiotic effects and health benefits. The ability to tailor the structure and functionality of these oligosaccharides through enzymatic processes allows for their application in a wide range of food products, enhancing their nutritional and health-promoting properties. Future research should focus on optimizing the enzymatic production processes and exploring the potential health benefits of NFOs in various populations.", "References": [{"title": "Enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides", "authors": "Michael Gänzle", "journal": "Current Opinion in Food Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "1", "first page": "89", "last page": "95", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cofs.2012.03.001"}, {"title": "Prebiotics: Concept, definition, criteria, methodologies, and products", "authors": "Atsushi Sako, Kiyoshi Matsumoto, Ryoichi Tanaka", "journal": "Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering", "year": "1999", "volumes": "87", "first page": "469", "last page": "475", "DOI": "10.1016/S1389-1723(99)80062-6"}, {"title": "Prebiotics in infant nutrition", "authors": "Glenn R.
