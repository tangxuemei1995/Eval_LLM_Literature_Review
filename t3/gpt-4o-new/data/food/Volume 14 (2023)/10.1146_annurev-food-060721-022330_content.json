{"Literature Review": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) surfaces represent a promising innovation in the field of antimicrobial materials, particularly for applications in food processing and packaging. These surfaces leverage nanoscale topographies to physically disrupt bacterial cell membranes, offering a biocide-free alternative to traditional chemical antimicrobials. The mechanisms underlying the bactericidal action of MB surfaces have been a subject of extensive research. Studies have shown that the nanoscale features of these surfaces, such as nanopillars, nanocones, and nanowires, can exert mechanical forces on bacterial cells, leading to membrane rupture and cell death (Ivanova et al., 2013). The effectiveness of these surfaces is influenced by several factors, including the geometry, density, and material properties of the nanostructures (Li et al., 2016). \n\nRecent advances in nanofabrication technologies have facilitated the development of MB surfaces with precise control over these parameters. Techniques such as electron beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography, and reactive ion etching have been employed to create well-defined nanopatterns on various substrates (Kelleher et al., 2016). These methods allow for the scalable production of MB surfaces, which is crucial for their application in the food industry. However, the cost and complexity of these fabrication processes remain significant challenges. Efforts are underway to develop more cost-effective and scalable approaches, such as roll-to-roll processing and self-assembly techniques, which could enable the widespread adoption of MB surfaces in food-related applications (Cao et al., 2018).\n\nThe application of MB surfaces in the food industry presents unique challenges and opportunities. One of the primary concerns is the durability and stability of these surfaces under the harsh conditions often encountered in food processing environments, such as high temperatures, humidity, and exposure to cleaning agents (Linklater et al., 2020). Ensuring that MB surfaces maintain their bactericidal efficacy over time is critical for their successful implementation. Additionally, the potential impact of MB surfaces on food quality and safety must be carefully evaluated. While these surfaces are designed to be non-toxic and biocompatible, any unintended interactions with food products need to be thoroughly investigated (Gao et al., 2017).\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of MB surfaces in the food industry are substantial. By providing a passive, long-lasting antimicrobial effect, MB surfaces could significantly reduce the risk of bacterial contamination and biofilm formation on food-contact surfaces. This could lead to improved food safety and shelf life, as well as reduced reliance on chemical sanitizers, which can have negative environmental and health impacts (Hasan et al., 2013). Furthermore, the integration of MB surfaces into food packaging materials could offer an additional layer of protection against microbial spoilage, enhancing the overall quality and safety of packaged foods (Tripathy et al., 2017).\n\nTo facilitate the adoption of MB surfaces in the food industry, several critical research needs and opportunities must be addressed. First, there is a need for comprehensive studies to evaluate the long-term performance and safety of MB surfaces in real-world food processing and packaging environments. This includes assessing their resistance to wear and degradation, as well as their potential impact on food quality and safety. Second, the development of standardized testing methods for evaluating the bactericidal efficacy of MB surfaces is essential to ensure consistency and reliability across different studies and applications (Ivanova et al., 2013). Finally, interdisciplinary collaborations between materials scientists, microbiologists, and food industry stakeholders will be crucial to drive innovation and facilitate the translation of MB surface technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace (Li et al., 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, MB surfaces offer a promising approach to enhancing food safety and quality through their unique physicomechanical bactericidal mechanisms. While significant progress has been made in understanding their mechanisms of action and developing scalable fabrication techniques, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with their application in the food industry. By overcoming these challenges, MB surfaces have the potential to revolutionize food processing and packaging, providing a sustainable and effective solution to microbial contamination.", "References": [{"title": "Bactericidal activity of black silicon", "authors": "Ivanova, E.
