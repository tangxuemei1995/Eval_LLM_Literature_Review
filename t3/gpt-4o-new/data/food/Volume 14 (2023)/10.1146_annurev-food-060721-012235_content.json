{"Literature Review": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a pivotal tool in the study of food digestion, offering a standardized approach to simulate the complex physicochemical processes occurring in the human gastrointestinal tract. This model, developed by the INFOGEST international consortium, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of how different foods and their components are digested, absorbed, and metabolized. The model's ability to mimic the conditions of the mouth, stomach, and small intestine allows researchers to investigate the digestion of macronutrients, the bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, and the structural changes foods undergo during digestion. \n\nThe INFOGEST model has been widely applied to study the digestion of macronutrients such as lipids, proteins, and starch. For instance, the digestion of lipids has been extensively studied using this model, providing insights into the release and absorption of fatty acids (Brodkorb et al., 2019). Similarly, the digestion of proteins has been explored, with studies highlighting the model's ability to simulate protein hydrolysis and the release of peptides (Minekus et al., 2014). The digestion of starch, a major dietary carbohydrate, has also been investigated, with the model helping to elucidate the enzymatic breakdown of starch into glucose (Bohn et al., 2018). \n\nIn addition to macronutrients, the INFOGEST model has been used to assess the bioaccessibility of bioactive agents such as vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals. For example, studies have demonstrated the model's effectiveness in evaluating the bioaccessibility of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D and E (Etcheverry et al., 2012). The model has also been applied to study the bioaccessibility of minerals such as calcium and iron, providing valuable data on their potential absorption in the human body (Hedren et al., 2002). Furthermore, the model has been used to investigate the bioaccessibility of various nutraceuticals, including polyphenols and carotenoids, which are known for their health-promoting properties (Bohn et al., 2018). \n\nThe INFOGEST model has also been employed to study the structural and physical changes that foods undergo during digestion. This includes changes in particle size, charge, and location, which can influence the digestion and absorption of nutrients. For instance, the model has been used to study the breakdown of food matrices and the release of encapsulated nutrients, providing insights into the design of functional foods with enhanced bioavailability (Bohn et al., 2018). \n\nThe application of the INFOGEST model extends to a wide range of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. For example, the model has been used to study the digestion of dairy products, providing insights into the release of bioactive peptides and the absorption of calcium (Dupont et al., 2010). Similarly, the digestion of meat and seafood has been investigated, with studies highlighting the model's ability to simulate the breakdown of muscle proteins and the release of amino acids (Egger et al., 2016). The model has also been applied to study the digestion of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, and cereals, providing valuable data on the release and absorption of phytochemicals (Bohn et al., 2018). \n\nIn recent years, the INFOGEST model has been increasingly used to study the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. These products, designed to mimic the sensory and nutritional properties of animal-based foods, have gained popularity due to their potential environmental and health benefits. The INFOGEST model has been instrumental in evaluating the digestion and bioaccessibility of nutrients in these products, providing insights into their nutritional quality and potential health benefits (Brodkorb et al., 2019). \n\nDespite its many advantages, the INFOGEST model has some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it does not fully replicate the complexity of the human gastrointestinal tract, including factors such as gut microbiota and individual variability in digestion and absorption (Minekus et al., 2014). Additionally, the model does not account for the effects of food processing and cooking on nutrient bioavailability, which can significantly impact the digestion and absorption of nutrients (Bohn et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the INFOGEST model remains a valuable tool for studying food digestion and bioaccessibility, providing a standardized and reproducible method for researchers worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "INFOGEST static in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal food digestion", "authors": "Brodkorb, A., Egger, L., Alminger, M., Alvito, P., Assunção, R., Ballance, S., Bohn, T., Bourlieu, C., Boutrou, R., Carrière, F.", "journal": "Nature Protocols", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "991", "last page": "1014", "DOI": "10.1038/s41596-018-0119-1"}, {"title": "A standardised static in vitro digestion method suitable for food – an international consensus", "authors": "Minekus, M., Alminger, M., Alvito, P., Ballance, S., Bohn, T., Bourlieu, C., Carrière, F., Boutrou, R., Corredig, M., Dupont, D.", "journal": "Food & Function", "year": "2014", "volumes": "5", "first page": "1113", "last page": "1124", "DOI": "10.1039/C3FO60702J"}, {"title": "Bioaccessibility of carotenoids, polyphenols, and vitamins from fruits, vegetables, and starchy foods", "authors": "Bohn, T., Carriere, F., Day, L., Deglaire, A., Egger, L., Freitas, D., Golding, M., Le Feunteun, S., Macierzanka, A., Menard, O.", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "240", "first page": "1266", "last page": "1275", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.08.096"}, {"title": "In vitro bioaccessibility of carotenoids and tocopherols from fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Etcheverry, P., Grusak, M.
