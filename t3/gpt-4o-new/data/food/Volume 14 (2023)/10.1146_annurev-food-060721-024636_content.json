{"Literature Review": "Microgreens, the young edible plants harvested at the cotyledonary stage, have gained significant attention due to their rich nutritional profile, rapid growth cycle, and minimal resource requirements. These attributes make them an attractive option for diverse cultivation systems, ranging from home gardens to commercial vertical farms and even space farming. This literature review explores the recent developments in microgreen cultivation, focusing on their nutritional benefits, production systems, technological advancements, and potential applications in space farming. \n\nNutritional Benefits: Microgreens are known for their high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which contribute to their health-promoting properties. A study by Xiao et al. (2012) demonstrated that microgreens contain higher levels of vitamins C, E, and K compared to their mature counterparts. This nutrient density makes them a valuable addition to the human diet, particularly in urban areas where access to fresh produce may be limited. Furthermore, microgreens have been shown to possess significant antioxidant capacities, which can help mitigate oxidative stress and reduce the risk of chronic diseases (Xiao et al., 2012). \n\nProduction Systems: The cultivation of microgreens can be adapted to various systems, from simple soil-based methods to advanced hydroponic and aeroponic systems. Hydroponic systems, in particular, have gained popularity due to their efficient use of water and nutrients. Research by Di Gioia et al. (2017) highlights the potential of hydroponic systems to produce high-quality microgreens with reduced environmental impact. Additionally, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in microgreen production systems has enabled precise control over environmental conditions, leading to improved yield and quality (Di Gioia et al., 2017). \n\nTechnological Advancements: The use of IoT and automation in microgreen cultivation has revolutionized the industry, allowing for the development of sophisticated vertical farms. These farms utilize automated systems for irrigation, lighting, and nutrient delivery, optimizing growth conditions and reducing labor costs. A study by Benke and Tomkins (2017) discusses the role of vertical farming in enhancing food security by providing a reliable source of fresh produce in urban areas. The integration of IoT technologies in vertical farms has also facilitated real-time monitoring and data collection, enabling growers to make informed decisions and improve crop management practices (Benke and Tomkins, 2017). \n\nSpace Farming: The potential of microgreens for space farming has garnered interest from space agencies, as their short growth cycle and minimal resource requirements make them suitable for cultivation in microgravity environments. Research by Massa et al. (2016) explores the feasibility of growing microgreens on the International Space Station (ISS), highlighting their potential to enhance the diet of astronauts and contribute to their physical and psychological well-being. The sensory qualities of microgreens, such as their vibrant colors and flavors, can provide a welcome change to the often monotonous diet of space travelers (Massa et al., 2016). \n\nChallenges and Future Directions: Despite the promising potential of microgreens, several challenges remain in their cultivation, both on Earth and in space. One major challenge is the optimization of growth conditions to maximize yield and nutritional quality. Research by Chandra et al. (2019) emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address these challenges, incorporating expertise from fields such as plant science, engineering, and nutrition. Additionally, there is a need for further research on the long-term effects of consuming microgreens, particularly in space environments where the human body undergoes significant physiological changes (Chandra et al., 2019). \n\nIn conclusion, microgreens offer a promising solution to enhance food security and nutrition, with potential applications in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. The integration of advanced technologies in their cultivation systems has the potential to revolutionize the industry, providing a sustainable source of fresh produce. However, further research is needed to address the technical challenges and data gaps associated with microgreen cultivation, particularly in space farming. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, researchers can develop innovative solutions to optimize microgreen production and unlock their full potential.", "References": [{"title": "Microgreens: A novel component of the food system", "authors": "Xiao, Z., Lester, G.
