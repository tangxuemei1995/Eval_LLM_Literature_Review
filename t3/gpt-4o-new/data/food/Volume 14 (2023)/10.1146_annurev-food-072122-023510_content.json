{"Literature Review": "Starch, a polysaccharide composed of amylose and amylopectin, is a critical component in the human diet and a versatile raw material in the food industry. Its native form, however, often lacks the functional properties required for specific industrial applications, necessitating structural modifications to enhance or introduce desirable attributes. Enzymatic approaches have emerged as a promising method for starch modification due to their specificity, efficiency, and environmentally friendly nature. These methods primarily involve the use of glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyl transferases to alter the molecular structure of starch, thereby improving its functionality. \n\nGlycosyl hydrolases, such as amylases, play a crucial role in starch modification by catalyzing the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. Maltogenic amylases, for instance, have been shown to produce maltose and other oligosaccharides, which can enhance the sweetness and solubility of starch-based products (Van der Maarel et al., 2002). Similarly, cyclomaltodextrinases and neopullulanases are employed to produce cyclodextrins and other cyclic oligosaccharides, which have applications in encapsulation and stabilization of flavors and fragrances (Biwer et al., 2002). These enzymes offer a high degree of control over the degree of polymerization and branching of the resulting starch molecules, allowing for the tailoring of specific functional properties.\n\nGlycosyl transferases, on the other hand, facilitate the transfer of glycosyl groups to acceptor molecules, enabling the synthesis of novel starch derivatives. Branching enzymes, for example, introduce additional α-1,6 linkages into amylose and amylopectin, increasing the branching degree and altering the gelatinization and retrogradation properties of starch (Takata et al., 2005). Amylomaltases and GH70 α-transglycosylases are also utilized to modify the branching pattern and molecular weight distribution of starch, resulting in products with improved textural and thermal properties (Leemhuis et al., 2013).\n\nAmylosucrases and maltogenic amylases are particularly noteworthy for their ability to synthesize novel starch derivatives with unique functional properties. Amylosucrases catalyze the transfer of glucose units from sucrose to starch, producing highly branched glucans with enhanced solubility and resistance to enzymatic degradation (Skov et al., 2014). Maltogenic amylases, meanwhile, are employed to produce maltodextrins with specific dextrose equivalent values, which are used as fat replacers and bulking agents in low-calorie foods (Kim et al., 2010).\n\nThe enzymatic modification of starch is not only limited to the production of novel derivatives but also extends to the development of structure–functionality-driven processing strategies. These strategies involve the careful selection and combination of enzymes to achieve desired modifications, such as the production of resistant starches with enhanced dietary fiber content and prebiotic properties (Zhang et al., 2013). The use of enzyme cocktails, for instance, allows for the simultaneous hydrolysis and transglycosylation of starch, resulting in products with improved nutritional and functional attributes (Gidley et al., 2010).\n\nThe potential industrial applications of enzymatically modified starches are vast and varied. In the food industry, these starches are used to improve the texture, stability, and shelf-life of products such as sauces, soups, and baked goods (Singh et al., 2007). In the pharmaceutical industry, modified starches serve as excipients and drug delivery vehicles, offering controlled release and enhanced bioavailability of active ingredients (Bertoft, 2017). Additionally, the biodegradable nature of starch makes it an attractive material for the production of sustainable packaging and bioplastics (Van Soest et al., 1996).\n\nIn conclusion, enzymatic approaches for structuring starch offer a versatile and sustainable means of enhancing its functionality for various industrial applications. The specificity and efficiency of glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyl transferases enable the precise modification of starch's molecular structure, resulting in products with tailored properties. As research in this field continues to advance, the development of novel enzymes and processing strategies will likely expand the range of applications for enzymatically modified starches, contributing to the production of clean-label, environmentally friendly products.", "References": [{"title": "Properties and applications of starch-converting enzymes of the α-amylase family", "authors": "Van der Maarel, Marc J.
