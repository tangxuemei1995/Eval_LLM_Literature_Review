{"Literature Review": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, despite existing in nutrient-poor waters. This paradox is largely resolved by the efficient recycling and retention of nutrients, processes in which microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a central role. DOM serves as a crucial component in coral reef ecosystems, acting as an invisible currency that facilitates nutrient exchange, production, and organismal interactions. The microbial processing of DOM is integral to the defining characteristics of coral reefs, including high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity. \n\nMicrobial communities in coral reefs are diverse and dynamic, comprising bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses that interact with DOM in complex ways. These microorganisms are responsible for the decomposition of organic matter, which releases nutrients back into the ecosystem, making them available for primary producers such as algae and corals. This process is essential for maintaining the high productivity of coral reefs (Haas et al., 2011). The composition of microbial communities and the types of DOM present in reef environments can vary spatially and temporally, influenced by factors such as water temperature, light availability, and the presence of different reef organisms (Nelson et al., 2013). \n\nThe spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial processes in coral reefs are critical for understanding how these ecosystems function. Microbial decomposition of DOM is a key process that supports nutrient cycling and energy flow within the reef. This process is influenced by the composition of the microbial community and the types of DOM available. For example, different microbial taxa have varying abilities to degrade specific types of organic compounds, which can affect the rate and efficiency of DOM decomposition (Raina et al., 2009). Additionally, the spatial distribution of microbial communities can influence the flow of nutrients and energy across the reef, with different habitats supporting distinct microbial assemblages that perform specific biogeochemical functions (Haas et al., 2016). \n\nMicrobial interactions with DOM also play a crucial role in the structural complexity of coral reefs. The accretion of calcium carbonate by corals and other calcifying organisms is facilitated by microbial processes that recycle nutrients and provide energy for calcification. Microbes can also influence the dissolution of calcium carbonate, which can affect the structural integrity of the reef (Wild et al., 2004). The balance between accretion and dissolution is critical for maintaining the structural complexity of coral reefs, which provides habitat for a diverse array of organisms. \n\nThe resilience of coral reefs to environmental change is closely linked to the interactions between microbes and DOM. As reefs face increasing pressures from climate change, pollution, and overfishing, the ability of microbial communities to process DOM and support nutrient cycling becomes even more important. However, widespread habitat degradation is altering these interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience. For example, changes in water quality and temperature can shift the composition of microbial communities, potentially disrupting the processes that support reef function (Dinsdale et al., 2008). Additionally, the loss of biodiversity and structural complexity can reduce the capacity of reefs to retain and recycle nutrients, further compromising their resilience to global change (Hughes et al., 2017). \n\nIn conclusion, microbial interactions with DOM are central to the function and resilience of coral reef ecosystems. These interactions support key processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and structural accretion, which are essential for maintaining the high productivity and biodiversity of coral reefs. Understanding the dynamics of these interactions and how they are affected by environmental change is critical for the conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems in the face of global change.", "References": [{"title": "Effects of coral reef benthic primary producers on dissolved organic carbon and microbial activity", "authors": "Haas, A.
