{"Literature Review": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred in April 2010, represents a significant environmental disaster with far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems, coastal economies, and oil spill response strategies. The spill released approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, making it the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history (McNutt et al., 2012). Understanding the transport and fate of oil following such a blowout is crucial for mitigating future incidents and improving response strategies. This literature review examines the key processes involved in the transport of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, focusing on the formation of oil and gas plumes, droplet size distribution, surface behavior, and the influence of environmental factors such as waves and riverine inputs.\n\nThe initial phase of the oil spill involved the formation of an oil and gas plume at the wellhead located in the Mississippi Canyon block 252 (MC252). The dynamics of this plume were influenced by the high-pressure and low-temperature conditions at the seabed, which affected the solubility and phase behavior of hydrocarbons (Camilli et al., 2010). The plume's buoyancy-driven rise through the water column was characterized by complex interactions between oil droplets and gas bubbles, leading to a wide range of droplet sizes (Ryerson et al., 2012). The size distribution of these droplets is a critical factor in determining the subsequent transport and fate of the oil, as smaller droplets are more likely to remain suspended in the water column and be subject to dispersion by ocean currents (Zhao et al., 2014).\n\nOnce the oil reached the surface, its behavior was influenced by a variety of physical processes, including spreading, evaporation, emulsification, and dispersion. The presence of waves significantly affected the spreading and dispersion of the oil, with wave action promoting the formation of oil-in-water emulsions and enhancing the breakup of oil slicks into smaller droplets (Li et al., 2017). These processes are crucial for understanding the transport of oil over large distances and its potential impact on coastal environments. The role of waves in oil dispersion has been extensively studied, with findings indicating that wave-induced turbulence can increase the rate of oil droplet formation and enhance the mixing of oil into the water column (Zhao et al., 2016).\n\nIn addition to wave action, the transport of oil was also influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, including the presence of mesoscale eddies and the input of freshwater from the Mississippi River. The river's discharge can create buoyant plumes that interact with oil slicks, altering their transport pathways and potentially leading to the formation of oil-particle aggregates (Daly et al., 2016). These aggregates, formed through the interaction of oil droplets with suspended particulate matter, can sink to the seafloor, representing a significant pathway for oil removal from the surface environment (Passow et al., 2012).\n\nMassive drifter experiments conducted in the Gulf of Mexico have provided valuable insights into the transport mechanisms of oil following the Deepwater Horizon spill. These experiments involved deploying a large number of drifters to track the movement of surface waters and oil slicks, revealing the complex interplay between ocean currents, wind, and wave action in determining the transport pathways of oil (Olascoaga et al., 2013). The data obtained from these experiments have been instrumental in validating numerical models of oil transport and improving our understanding of the factors that influence the dispersion and fate of oil in marine environments.\n\nWhile numerical modeling plays a crucial role in predicting the transport and fate of oil spills, this review emphasizes the importance of integrating field observations and experimental data to enhance our understanding of the underlying physical processes. By focusing on the key mechanisms involved in oil transport, this review aims to facilitate communication among scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders involved in oil spill response and management. The insights gained from the Deepwater Horizon spill can inform future efforts to mitigate the impacts of oil spills and improve the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems.\n\nIn conclusion, the transport of oil following the Deepwater Horizon blowout was governed by a complex interplay of physical processes, including plume dynamics, droplet formation, surface behavior, and environmental influences such as waves and riverine inputs. Understanding these processes is essential for developing effective response strategies and mitigating the impacts of future oil spills. Continued research and collaboration among scientists, engineers, and policymakers are necessary to advance our knowledge of oil transport and improve our ability to respond to marine oil spills.", "References": [{"title": "Review of flow rate estimates of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill", "authors": "Marcia K.
