{"Literature Review": "Tidal marshes and mangroves have garnered significant attention as nature-based solutions for mitigating the impacts of coastal storms, such as flooding and shoreline erosion. These ecosystems provide a range of ecosystem services, including wave attenuation, sediment stabilization, and habitat provision, which are crucial for coastal resilience (Barbier et al., 2011). However, the effectiveness of tidal wetlands in hazard mitigation is contingent upon a variety of factors, including storm characteristics, wetland properties, and the broader coastal landscape. \n\nTidal wetlands, particularly mangroves, are known for their ability to attenuate short-period storm-induced waves. Studies have shown that mangrove forests can reduce wave heights by 13-66% over a distance of 100 meters, depending on the density and structure of the vegetation (Mazda et al., 2006). This wave attenuation capacity is primarily due to the complex root systems and dense canopy of mangroves, which dissipate wave energy. Similarly, tidal marshes, with their dense vegetation and shallow water depths, can also reduce wave energy, although their effectiveness is often less than that of mangroves due to their lower structural complexity (Möller et al., 2014).\n\nHowever, the ability of tidal wetlands to mitigate long-period storm surges is less effective. Storm surges, which can elevate sea levels by several meters for extended periods, pose a significant challenge to these ecosystems. The effectiveness of wetlands in attenuating storm surges is influenced by factors such as the width and elevation of the wetland, vegetation type, and the geomorphology of the surrounding landscape (Krauss et al., 2009). In some cases, wetlands may not attenuate storm surges at all, particularly when the surge height exceeds the elevation of the wetland or when the wetland is narrow and lacks sufficient vegetation density (Shepard et al., 2011).\n\nIn addition to wave and surge attenuation, tidal wetlands play a crucial role in limiting shoreline erosion. The root systems of mangroves and marsh plants stabilize sediments, reducing erosion rates during storm events (Gedan et al., 2011). However, the protective capacity of these ecosystems can be compromised by storm damage. Mangrove trees, in particular, are susceptible to damage from high winds and wave action, which can lead to significant loss of vegetation and structural damage (Alongi, 2008). Recovery from such damage can take several years, during which the protective functions of the wetland are diminished.\n\nThe long-term persistence of tidal wetlands is also threatened by other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Sea-level rise, increased storm intensity, and human activities such as land reclamation and pollution can exacerbate the vulnerability of these ecosystems (McLeod and Salm, 2006). As a result, the ability of tidal wetlands to provide effective storm protection may be compromised over time, necessitating adaptive management strategies that account for these uncertainties.\n\nAdaptive management is essential for the successful implementation of nature-based coastal defense projects. This approach involves monitoring and adjusting management practices in response to changing conditions and new information (Thom, 2000). By incorporating adaptive management, coastal defense projects can enhance the resilience of tidal wetlands and ensure their continued effectiveness in mitigating storm impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, while tidal marshes and mangroves offer valuable ecosystem services for coastal storm mitigation, their effectiveness is limited by various factors. Short-period storm-induced waves are attenuated effectively by these ecosystems, but long-period storm surges pose a greater challenge. Additionally, storm damage and other stressors can compromise the protective functions of tidal wetlands. Therefore, nature-based coastal defense projects must adopt adaptive management strategies to address these uncertainties and enhance the resilience of coastal ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services", "authors": "Edward B.
