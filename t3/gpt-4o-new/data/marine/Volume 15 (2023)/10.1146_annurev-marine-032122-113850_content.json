{"Literature Review": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is increasingly being considered as a viable strategy to mitigate climate change by enhancing the ocean's natural capacity to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2). The ocean plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle, absorbing approximately 25% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions annually (Le Quéré et al., 2018). This makes it a focal point for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies. However, the implementation of OCDR is fraught with technical, financial, social, and ethical challenges that must be carefully evaluated. \n\nTechnical assessments of OCDR approaches have primarily focused on methods such as ocean fertilization, alkalinity enhancement, and artificial upwelling. Ocean fertilization involves adding nutrients to the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth, which in turn enhances CO2 uptake (Boyd et al., 2007). However, the effectiveness and ecological impacts of this method remain uncertain, with concerns about potential negative effects on marine ecosystems (Buesseler et al., 2008). Alkalinity enhancement, which involves adding alkaline substances to the ocean to increase its capacity to absorb CO2, has shown promise in laboratory settings but requires further research to understand its large-scale implications (Renforth & Henderson, 2017). Artificial upwelling, which brings nutrient-rich deep waters to the surface, could also enhance CO2 uptake but may disrupt local marine ecosystems (Oschlies et al., 2010).\n\nFinancial considerations are critical in assessing the feasibility of OCDR. The costs associated with these technologies can be substantial, and their economic viability is often uncertain. For instance, the cost of ocean fertilization is highly variable and depends on the scale of deployment and the specific nutrients used (Glibert et al., 2008). Moreover, the potential for carbon credits and other financial incentives to support OCDR initiatives is still under debate, with questions about the permanence and verifiability of carbon sequestration (Gattuso et al., 2018).\n\nSocial issues, including public perception, play a significant role in the acceptance and implementation of OCDR strategies. Public perception is influenced by factors such as awareness of climate change, trust in scientific and governmental institutions, and perceived risks and benefits of OCDR technologies (Cox et al., 2016). Effective communication and engagement with stakeholders, including local communities, policymakers, and environmental organizations, are essential to address concerns and build support for OCDR initiatives (Buck et al., 2018).\n\nEthical considerations are also paramount in the discourse on OCDR. The potential risks to marine ecosystems and the broader environment raise questions about the moral responsibility of deploying such technologies. Ethical debates often center around issues of environmental justice, intergenerational equity, and the precautionary principle (Gardiner, 2010). There is a need for comprehensive ethical frameworks to guide decision-making processes and ensure that OCDR strategies are implemented in a manner that is just and equitable (Morrow et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, while OCDR presents a promising avenue for mitigating climate change, it requires a holistic assessment that integrates technical, financial, social, and ethical considerations. Future research should focus on developing robust methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness and impacts of OCDR technologies, as well as frameworks for stakeholder engagement and ethical decision-making. By adopting a sociotechnical systems approach, policymakers and researchers can better navigate the complexities of OCDR and contribute to sustainable climate solutions.", "References": [{"title": "Global Carbon Budget 2018", "authors": "Corinne Le Quéré, Robbie M.
