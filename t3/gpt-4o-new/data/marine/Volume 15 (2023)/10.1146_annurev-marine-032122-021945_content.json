{"Literature Review": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs) are critical components of the global ocean system, known for their high productivity and significant contributions to marine biodiversity and fisheries. These systems, located along the eastern edges of the world's ocean basins, include the California, Humboldt, Canary, and Benguela upwelling systems. They are characterized by the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters to the surface, driven by wind patterns and the Coriolis effect, which support rich marine ecosystems (Chavez & Messié, 2009). Climate change poses a significant threat to these systems, potentially altering their physical, chemical, and biological dynamics. \n\nOne of the primary concerns regarding climate change impacts on EBUSs is the potential for changes in upwelling intensity and seasonality. Bakun (1990) hypothesized that global warming could lead to increased upwelling intensity due to the intensification of alongshore winds. This hypothesis, known as the 'Bakun hypothesis,' suggests that as the land warms faster than the ocean, the pressure gradient between land and sea increases, strengthening coastal winds and, consequently, upwelling. Recent studies have provided mixed evidence for this hypothesis. For instance, Sydeman et al. (2014) found evidence of increased upwelling intensity in some regions, such as the California Current, but not uniformly across all EBUSs. \n\nThe biogeochemical impacts of climate change on EBUSs are also of significant concern. Enhanced upwelling can lead to increased nutrient supply and productivity, but it can also exacerbate hypoxia and ocean acidification, particularly in regions where the upwelled waters are already low in oxygen and high in CO2 (Gruber, 2011). The Humboldt Current system, for example, has experienced increased occurrences of hypoxic events, which have been linked to changes in upwelling patterns and ocean stratification (Gutiérrez et al., 2008). \n\nClimate change is also expected to affect the stratification of the water column in EBUSs. Increased surface temperatures can lead to enhanced stratification, which may inhibit the vertical mixing of nutrients and reduce productivity (Rykaczewski & Dunne, 2010). However, the interaction between increased stratification and upwelling is complex, as intensified upwelling could counteract some of the effects of stratification by bringing nutrients to the surface. \n\nThe ecological impacts of climate change on EBUSs are profound, affecting species distribution, abundance, and community structure. Changes in upwelling intensity and timing can alter the availability of nutrients and, consequently, the productivity of phytoplankton, which forms the base of the marine food web (Checkley & Barth, 2009). This can have cascading effects on higher trophic levels, including commercially important fish species. For instance, changes in the timing and intensity of upwelling have been linked to shifts in the distribution and abundance of sardine and anchovy populations in the California and Humboldt Current systems (Chavez et al., 2003). \n\nProjected changes in EBUSs over the twenty-first century suggest a continuation of these trends, with potential regional variations. Models predict that upwelling intensity may increase in poleward regions of EBUSs, while equatorward regions may experience less change or even a decrease in upwelling (Wang et al., 2015). This could lead to differential impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries, with some regions potentially benefiting from increased productivity, while others may face declines. \n\nDespite these projections, significant uncertainties remain regarding the future of EBUSs under climate change. The interactions between upwelling intensity, stratification, and source-water chemistry are complex and not fully understood. Additionally, the potential for feedback mechanisms, such as changes in ocean circulation patterns or biological responses, adds further uncertainty to projections (Di Lorenzo et al., 2010). \n\nIn conclusion, while there is evidence to suggest that climate change will impact EBUSs in various ways, the extent and nature of these impacts remain uncertain. Future research should focus on improving our understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes driving changes in EBUSs, as well as the ecological responses of marine organisms to these changes. This will be crucial for developing effective management and adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on these vital marine ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change and marine ecosystems of the California Current", "authors": "Chavez, F.P., Messié, M.", "journal": "Journal of Marine Systems", "year": "2009", "volumes": "79", "first page": "212", "last page": "226", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmarsys.2008.12.023"}, {"title": "Global warming and the intensification of coastal ocean upwelling", "authors": "Bakun, A.", "journal": "Science", "year": "1990", "volumes": "247", "first page": "198", "last page": "201", "DOI": "10.1126/science.247.4939.198"}, {"title": "Climate change and wind intensification in coastal upwelling ecosystems", "authors": "Sydeman, W.J., García-Reyes, M., Schoeman, D.S., Rykaczewski, R.R., Thompson, S.A., Black, B.A., Bograd, S.J.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "345", "first page": "77", "last page": "80", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1251635"}, {"title": "Warming up, turning sour, losing breath: ocean biogeochemistry under global change", "authors": "Gruber, N.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "369", "first page": "1980", "last page": "1996", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2011.0003"}, {"title": "Climate change and the Humboldt Current upwelling ecosystem", "authors": "Gutiérrez, D., Enriquez, E., Purca, S., Quipuzcoa, L., Marquina, R., Flores, G., Graco, M.", "journal": "Progress in Oceanography", "year": "2008", "volumes": "79", "first page": "238", "last page": "255", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pocean.2008.10.012"}, {"title": "Enhanced coastal upwelling and its potential impacts on marine ecosystems", "authors": "Rykaczewski, R.R., Dunne, J.P.", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2010", "volumes": "3", "first page": "247", "last page": "250", "DOI": "10.1038/ngeo818"}, {"title": "Climate change and small pelagic fish", "authors": "Checkley, D.M., Barth, J.A.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2009", "volumes": "323", "first page": "35", "last page": "38", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1164049"}, {"title": "From anchovies to sardines and back: multidecadal change in the Pacific Ocean", "authors": "Chavez, F.P., Ryan, J., Lluch-Cota, S.E., Ñiquen, M.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2003", "volumes": "299", "first page": "217", "last page": "221", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1075880"}, {"title": "Upwelling in the future: climate change impacts on eastern boundary upwelling systems", "authors": "Wang, D., Gouhier, T.C., Menge, B.A., Ganguly, A.R.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "350", "first page": "80", "last page": "84", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aac9940"}, {"title": "The future of coastal ocean upwelling", "authors": "Di Lorenzo, E., Miller, A.J., Schneider, N., McWilliams, J.C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2010", "volumes": "464", "first page": "1058", "last page": "1061", "DOI": "10.1038/nature09038"}]}
