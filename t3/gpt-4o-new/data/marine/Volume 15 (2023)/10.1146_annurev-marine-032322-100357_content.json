{"Literature Review": "Gender equity in oceanography is a critical issue that has garnered increasing attention over the past few decades. Historically, the field of oceanography, like many other scientific disciplines, has been dominated by men, with women and other gender minorities facing significant barriers to entry and advancement. These barriers have included overt discrimination, implicit biases, and structural inequities that have limited the participation and recognition of women in oceanography (Huyer, 2016). Despite these challenges, there has been notable progress in recent years, with women now receiving approximately half of the oceanography PhDs in many parts of the world (National Science Foundation, 2019). This increase in educational attainment has begun to translate into greater representation at earlier levels of academic employment, although disparities remain at higher levels of career advancement and recognition.\n\nOne of the key metrics for assessing gender equity in oceanography is the participation of women in the workforce. Studies have shown that while women are entering the field in greater numbers, they are still underrepresented in senior positions and leadership roles (Carter et al., 2019). This underrepresentation is reflected in metrics such as first-authored publications, funded grants, and conference speaker invitations, where women continue to lag behind their male counterparts (Holmes et al., 2011). The reasons for these disparities are multifaceted, including gender biases in peer review processes, networking opportunities, and mentorship availability (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012).\n\nEfforts to improve gender equity in oceanography have included a range of initiatives aimed at addressing these barriers. For example, many institutions have implemented policies to promote diversity and inclusion, such as gender quotas for conference speakers and grant review panels (Casad et al., 2018). Additionally, mentorship programs have been established to support the career development of women and other underrepresented groups in oceanography (Severson et al., 2019). These programs have been shown to be effective in increasing the retention and advancement of women in the field, although more work is needed to ensure their widespread adoption and success.\n\nAnother important aspect of gender equity in oceanography is the recognition and celebration of women's contributions to the field. Historically, women have been underrepresented in prestigious awards and honors, which can have a significant impact on their career advancement and visibility (Lincoln et al., 2012). Efforts to address this issue have included initiatives to increase the nomination and selection of women for awards, as well as the establishment of new awards specifically recognizing the contributions of women in oceanography (Handley et al., 2015).\n\nDespite these efforts, significant challenges remain in achieving gender equity in oceanography. One of the most persistent issues is the prevalence of harassment and discrimination, which can create a hostile work environment and deter women from pursuing careers in the field (Clancy et al., 2014). Addressing this issue requires a concerted effort from the entire oceanographic community to create a culture of respect and inclusion. This includes implementing policies to prevent and address harassment, as well as providing training and resources to support those who experience it (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, while there has been progress towards gender equity in oceanography, there is still much work to be done. Continued efforts are needed to address the structural inequities and biases that persist in the field, and to create a culture where oceanographers of all genders can thrive. This includes reexamining selection and evaluation procedures, eliminating harassment, and promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of the oceanographic enterprise. By working together, the oceanographic community can ensure that it is a welcoming and equitable field for all.", "References": [{"title": "Is the oceanography workforce ready for the future?", "authors": "S.
