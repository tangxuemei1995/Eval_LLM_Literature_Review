{"Literature Review": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) is a critical component of climate variability, influencing global weather patterns and climate systems. The PDV is characterized by modes of variability that are primarily driven by the ocean's response to atmospheric forcing. These modes are often described using statistical patterns of variance, which reflect the ocean's integration of atmospheric signals over time. The primary modes of PDV include the North Pacific–central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes, each representing distinct dynamical processes and timescales. \n\nThe NP-CP mode is a significant driver of interannual to decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean. It is closely associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a dominant mode of climate variability in the tropics. The NP-CP mode captures the interaction between the tropics and extratropics, highlighting the importance of teleconnections in modulating PDV. Teleconnections refer to climate anomalies being related over large distances, often linking the tropical Pacific with the North Pacific. Studies have shown that the NP-CP mode is energized by atmospheric forcing, which includes changes in wind patterns and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (Newman et al., 2016). These changes can lead to shifts in ocean currents and heat distribution, further influencing climate patterns across the Pacific basin.\n\nThe KOE mode, on the other hand, is associated with decadal to multidecadal variability. It is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV and is influenced by both tropical and extratropical processes. The KOE mode is characterized by changes in the strength and position of the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents, which are major ocean currents in the North Pacific. These currents play a crucial role in heat transport and distribution, affecting the climate of the surrounding regions (Qiu et al., 2014). The KOE mode also involves feedback mechanisms between the ocean and atmosphere, which can amplify or dampen climate signals over time.\n\nThe interaction between the NP-CP and KOE modes highlights the complexity of PDV and the importance of understanding the underlying dynamical processes. Both modes are influenced by two-way tropical–extratropical teleconnection dynamics, which synchronize the basin-scale footprint of PDV. These teleconnections are crucial for understanding how climate signals propagate across the Pacific and influence global climate systems (Deser et al., 2012). The integration of atmospheric and oceanic processes is essential for capturing the full spectrum of PDV and its impacts on climate variability.\n\nRecent studies have utilized empirical dynamical models to better understand the modes and mechanisms of PDV. These models are constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies derived from reanalysis products, providing a comprehensive view of the ocean-atmosphere interactions that drive PDV. By analyzing these models, researchers have identified key dynamical eigenmodes that explain the variance patterns observed in PDV (Alexander et al., 2010). These eigenmodes provide insights into the fundamental processes that govern PDV and offer a framework for predicting future climate variability.\n\nThe role of coupled feedbacks in PDV is another area of active research. Coupled feedbacks refer to the interactions between the ocean and atmosphere that can enhance or suppress climate signals. For example, changes in SSTs can influence atmospheric circulation patterns, which in turn affect ocean currents and heat distribution. These feedbacks can operate on different timescales, from interannual to multidecadal, and are critical for understanding the persistence and evolution of PDV anomalies (Di Lorenzo et al., 2015). Understanding these feedbacks is essential for improving climate models and predicting future climate variability.\n\nIn conclusion, the modes and mechanisms of Pacific decadal-scale variability are complex and multifaceted. The NP-CP and KOE modes represent key dynamical processes that drive PDV, highlighting the importance of teleconnections and coupled feedbacks in modulating climate variability. Empirical dynamical models provide valuable insights into the underlying processes and offer a framework for predicting future climate variability. Continued research in this area is essential for improving our understanding of PDV and its impacts on global climate systems.", "References": [{"title": "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Revisited", "authors": "Matthew Newman, Michael A.
