{"Literature Review": "The actuation problem in linguistics, particularly concerning sound change, is a complex issue that has intrigued researchers for decades. It seeks to understand why linguistic changes occur in specific languages at particular times and places. This problem is multifaceted, involving both individual and population-level perspectives. At the individual level, linguistic changes manifest as idiolectal differences, which are influenced by a speaker's past linguistic experiences and their physical, perceptual, cognitive, and social characteristics. These factors affect how individuals process and analyze linguistic data, leading to divergent representations and grammars across speakers. At the population level, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovations depend on the nature of contact between speakers with unique idiolects and the ability of individuals to leverage these innovations for ideological purposes. \n\nThe concept of actuation in linguistic change was first introduced by Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog (1968), who emphasized the importance of understanding the social and linguistic conditions that lead to change. They argued that linguistic change is not merely a result of internal linguistic factors but is also influenced by external social factors. This perspective has been supported by subsequent studies, which have shown that social networks and community structures play a crucial role in the propagation of linguistic innovations (Milroy and Milroy, 1985). \n\nIndividual differences in cognitive processing styles have been identified as significant factors in the actuation of linguistic change. Research by Labov (2001) suggests that individuals with different cognitive styles may process linguistic input differently, leading to variations in linguistic representations and, ultimately, linguistic change. This idea is supported by studies in psycholinguistics, which have shown that individual differences in memory, attention, and perception can influence language processing and acquisition (Ellis, 2006). \n\nThe role of social factors in linguistic change has been extensively studied. Eckert (2000) highlights the importance of social identity and group membership in the propagation of linguistic innovations. She argues that individuals adopt linguistic features that align with their social identity and group affiliations, which can lead to the spread of these features within a community. This perspective is supported by studies on language and identity, which have shown that linguistic choices are often motivated by social factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). \n\nAgent-based modeling has emerged as a promising tool for investigating the stochastic nature of language change propagation. This approach allows researchers to simulate the interactions between individuals with different idiolects and explore how these interactions lead to the spread of linguistic innovations. Studies using agent-based models have shown that linguistic change is a complex, dynamic process influenced by a multitude of factors, including social networks, communication patterns, and individual differences (Baxter et al., 2009). \n\nDespite the advances in understanding the actuation of linguistic change, a comprehensive model that accounts for all the relevant factors at the individual level remains elusive. One of the challenges is the vast number of contingencies that need to be aligned for linguistic change to occur. These contingencies include individual cognitive and social factors, as well as the broader social and linguistic context. As a result, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovations are predicted to be rare events (Labov, 2007). \n\nIn conclusion, the actuation problem in linguistic change is a complex issue that requires an interdisciplinary approach. Understanding the individual and population-level factors that contribute to linguistic change is crucial for developing a comprehensive model of language change actuation. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between cognitive, social, and linguistic factors in the actuation of linguistic change, using tools such as agent-based modeling to investigate the dynamic nature of this process.", "References": [{"title": "Empirical foundations for a theory of language change", "authors": "Weinreich, Uriel; Labov, William; Herzog, Marvin I.", "journal": "Directions for Historical Linguistics", "year": "1968", "volumes": "", "first page": "95", "last page": "188", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Linguistic change, social network and speaker innovation", "authors": "Milroy, Lesley; Milroy, James", "journal": "Journal of Linguistics", "year": "1985", "volumes": "21", "first page": "339", "last page": "384", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022226700010306"}, {"title": "Principles of Linguistic Change, Volume 2: Social Factors", "authors": "Labov, William", "journal": "Blackwell", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Individual differences in second language learning", "authors": "Ellis, Rod", "journal": "The Handbook of Second Language Acquisition", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "525", "last page": "551", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Linguistic Variation as Social Practice: The Linguistic Construction of Identity in Belten High", "authors": "Eckert, Penelope", "journal": "Blackwell", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach", "authors": "Bucholtz, Mary; Hall, Kira", "journal": "Discourse Studies", "year": "2005", "volumes": "7", "first page": "585", "last page": "614", "DOI": "10.1177/1461445605054407"}, {"title": "Modeling language change: An evaluation of Trudgill's theory of the emergence of New Zealand English", "authors": "Baxter, Gareth J.; Blythe, Richard A.; Croft, William; McKane, Alan J.", "journal": "Language Variation and Change", "year": "2009", "volumes": "21", "first page": "257", "last page": "296", "DOI": "10.1017/S095439450999010X"}, {"title": "Transmission and diffusion", "authors": "Labov, William", "journal": "Language", "year": "2007", "volumes": "83", "first page": "344", "last page": "387", "DOI": "10.1353/lan.2007.0082"}]}
