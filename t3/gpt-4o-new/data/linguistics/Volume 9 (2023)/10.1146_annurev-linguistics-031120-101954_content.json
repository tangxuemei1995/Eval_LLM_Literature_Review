{"Literature Review": "Prosodic prominence, a key concept in phonetics and phonology, has been the subject of extensive research across various languages. The mid-twentieth century marked a pivotal shift in understanding prosodic prominence, moving from a generalized notion of stress to a more nuanced distinction between word stress and phrasal accent. This distinction has been foundational in exploring how prominence is signaled and perceived across languages. Early studies predominantly focused on intonational pitch movements as primary indicators of prominence. For instance, Bolinger (1958) highlighted the role of pitch in distinguishing between stressed and unstressed syllables in English, emphasizing the importance of pitch contours in conveying meaning (Bolinger, 1958). However, subsequent research has expanded the scope to include a variety of phonetic cues beyond pitch, such as duration, intensity, and spectral tilt (Ladd, 2008). These studies suggest that prominence is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, with different languages utilizing different combinations of cues. \n\nThe concept of prosodic prominence is closely linked to the notion of lexical stress and pitch accent. Lexical stress refers to the emphasis placed on certain syllables within words, while pitch accent involves variations in pitch that highlight specific words or syllables within an utterance. Beckman and Pierrehumbert (1986) proposed a model of intonational phonology that distinguishes between these two types of prominence, providing a framework for analyzing prosodic patterns across languages (Beckman & Pierrehumbert, 1986). This model has been instrumental in understanding how different languages encode prominence through intonation and stress patterns. \n\nRecent research has also explored the role of non-phonetic factors in prosodic prominence. Word frequency, for example, has been shown to influence the perception of prominence, with less frequent words often perceived as more prominent due to their unexpectedness in discourse (Baayen et al., 2007). This finding underscores the importance of considering both phonetic and non-phonetic factors in a comprehensive theory of prosodic prominence. \n\nThe definition of prominence itself remains somewhat informal and is often based on intuitions derived from European languages. This has led to challenges in applying these concepts to non-European languages, which may exhibit different prosodic typologies. For example, African tone languages such as Yoruba and Igbo use tone rather than stress to convey prominence, highlighting the need for a more inclusive framework that accommodates diverse prosodic systems (Connell, 2001). \n\nMetrical phonology offers a potential solution by treating word and sentence stress as manifestations of a hierarchical prosodic structure. This approach allows for the integration of both stress and tone languages into a unified theory of prosodic prominence. Hayes (1995) proposed a metrical grid model that accounts for variations in stress patterns across languages, providing a basis for comparing prosodic systems with different typological characteristics (Hayes, 1995). \n\nFurthermore, the Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT) method has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating prosodic prominence. This method involves collecting judgments from naïve listeners about the perceived prominence of words in spoken discourse, providing insights into how prominence is perceived across different languages and contexts (Cole et al., 2010). RPT has been used to explore cross-linguistic differences in prosodic prominence, revealing that listeners from different language backgrounds may rely on different cues to identify prominent elements in speech. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of prosodic prominence across languages is a dynamic and evolving field. While early research focused primarily on pitch as a cue for prominence, recent studies have highlighted the importance of other phonetic and non-phonetic factors. The development of models such as intonational phonology and metrical phonology has provided valuable frameworks for analyzing prosodic patterns across languages. However, there is still a need for more research on non-European languages and the development of a more comprehensive theory that accommodates diverse prosodic typologies. The use of methods like Rapid Prosody Transcription offers promising avenues for future research, enabling a deeper understanding of how prominence is perceived and produced across different linguistic contexts.", "References": [{"title": "A theory of pitch accent in English", "authors": "Dwight Bolinger", "journal": "Word", "year": "1958", "volumes": "14", "first page": "109", "last page": "149", "DOI": "10.1080/00437956.1958.11659664"}, {"title": "Intonational Phonology", "authors": "D.
