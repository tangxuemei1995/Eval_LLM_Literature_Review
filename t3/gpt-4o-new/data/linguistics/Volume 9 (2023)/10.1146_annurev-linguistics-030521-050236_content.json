{"Literature Review": "Heritage languages represent a unique linguistic phenomenon that arises in bilingual or multilingual contexts, often within immigrant communities. These languages are typically acquired as the first or one of the first languages by individuals who later become more dominant in the majority language of their society. The study of heritage languages provides valuable insights into language acquisition, maintenance, and attrition, as well as the cognitive and social implications of bilingualism. \n\nThe acquisition of heritage languages occurs under conditions of reduced exposure compared to the majority language, leading to unique structural characteristics. Montrul (2008) highlights that heritage speakers often exhibit incomplete acquisition, where certain grammatical features are not fully developed due to limited input during critical periods of language development. This incomplete acquisition is further compounded by language attrition, where previously acquired linguistic features are lost over time due to disuse (Montrul, 2008). \n\nResearch by Polinsky and Kagan (2007) has shown that heritage languages often undergo significant structural changes, including simplification of grammatical structures and reduction in morphological complexity. These changes are attributed to the interaction between the limited input heritage speakers receive and the cognitive processes involved in language acquisition and maintenance. The age at which bilingualism is acquired plays a crucial role in determining the extent of these changes. Studies by Benmamoun, Montrul, and Polinsky (2013) suggest that early bilinguals, who acquire both the heritage and majority languages simultaneously, tend to retain more features of the heritage language compared to late bilinguals, who acquire the majority language later in life. \n\nThe critical period hypothesis, which posits that there is an optimal window for language acquisition, is particularly relevant in the context of heritage languages. Research by Au, Knightly, Jun, and Oh (2002) indicates that heritage speakers who are exposed to their heritage language during early childhood are more likely to retain native-like phonological and syntactic features compared to those who are exposed later. This finding underscores the importance of early and consistent exposure to the heritage language for its maintenance. \n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the relearning and reactivation of heritage languages. Studies by Montrul and Bowles (2010) have demonstrated that heritage speakers can successfully relearn their heritage language, often achieving high levels of proficiency. This process is facilitated by the cognitive advantages associated with bilingualism, such as enhanced metalinguistic awareness and cognitive flexibility, which enable heritage speakers to draw on their existing linguistic knowledge and skills. \n\nThe implications of heritage language research extend beyond the linguistic domain. Bilingualism, as exemplified by heritage speakers, has been shown to confer cognitive benefits, including improved executive function and attentional control (Bialystok, 2009). Moreover, the maintenance and revitalization of heritage languages have significant cultural and social implications, as they contribute to the preservation of cultural identity and diversity within immigrant communities (Fishman, 2001). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of heritage languages offers valuable insights into the processes of language acquisition, maintenance, and attrition. It highlights the complex interplay between linguistic, cognitive, and social factors in shaping the linguistic profiles of heritage speakers. As research in this field continues to evolve, it holds the potential to inform educational practices and policies aimed at supporting heritage language maintenance and revitalization, thereby promoting linguistic diversity and cultural heritage in multilingual societies.", "References": [{"title": "Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: Re-examining the age factor", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "John Benjamins Publishing Company", "year": "2008", "volumes": "49", "first page": "1", "last page": "276", "DOI": "10.1075/sibil.39"}, {"title": "Heritage languages: In the 'wild' and in the classroom", "authors": "Maria Polinsky, Olga Kagan", "journal": "Language and Linguistics Compass", "year": "2007", "volumes": "1", "first page": "368", "last page": "395", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00022.x"}, {"title": "Heritage languages and their speakers: Opportunities and challenges for linguistics", "authors": "Elabbas Benmamoun, Silvina Montrul, Maria Polinsky", "journal": "Theoretical Linguistics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "39", "first page": "129", "last page": "181", "DOI": "10.1515/tl-2013-0009"}, {"title": "Overhearing a language during childhood", "authors": "Toni C.
