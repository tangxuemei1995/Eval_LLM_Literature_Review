{"Literature Review": "The Principle of Compositionality, which posits that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents, has long been a cornerstone of linguistic theory. However, the advent of neural models in computational linguistics has challenged the traditional reliance on compositionality, as these models often outperform grammar-based approaches across various tasks (Lake & Baroni, 2018). This literature review explores the current state of compositionality in computational linguistics, examining its relevance and application in the context of neural networks and neurosymbolic models. \n\nNeural models, particularly deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and semantic parsing (Vaswani et al., 2017). These models often rely on large datasets and complex architectures to learn patterns and generalizations, seemingly bypassing the need for explicit compositional rules. However, this raises concerns about their ability to generalize from limited data, a task where compositionality is traditionally seen as advantageous (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). \n\nRecent studies have highlighted the limitations of neural models in capturing compositional generalizations. For instance, Lake and Baroni (2018) demonstrated that neural networks struggle with systematic generalization, a key aspect of compositionality, when trained on limited data. This suggests that while neural models excel in performance, they may lack the inherent ability to generalize in a compositional manner. \n\nTo address these limitations, researchers have explored neurosymbolic models, which integrate neural networks with symbolic reasoning to leverage the strengths of both approaches (Garcez et al., 2019). These models aim to incorporate compositional principles into neural architectures, allowing for more robust generalization and interpretability. For example, the work by Mao et al. (2019) on neurosymbolic concept learners demonstrates how integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks can improve performance on visual question answering tasks, highlighting the potential of compositionality in enhancing neural models. \n\nSemantic parsing, a task that involves mapping natural language to formal representations, is another area where compositionality plays a crucial role. Traditional grammar-based approaches to semantic parsing rely heavily on compositional rules to ensure accurate and interpretable mappings (Zettlemoyer & Collins, 2005). However, these approaches often struggle with scalability and coverage, particularly in the face of diverse and complex linguistic inputs. Neural models, on the other hand, offer greater flexibility and scalability but may sacrifice interpretability and compositional generalization (Dong & Lapata, 2016). \n\nRecent advancements in semantic parsing have sought to reconcile these trade-offs by exploring hybrid models that combine neural and symbolic components. For instance, the work by Liang et al. (2018) on neural-symbolic machines demonstrates how integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks can improve semantic parsing performance while maintaining compositional interpretability. This approach highlights the potential of compositionality as a guiding principle in designing models that balance performance and interpretability. \n\nMoreover, the exploration of novel design spaces in computational linguistics has led to the development of models that explicitly incorporate compositional principles. For example, the work by Russin et al. (2019) on compositional attention networks demonstrates how attention mechanisms can be designed to capture compositional structures, improving generalization and interpretability in neural models. These advancements suggest that compositionality remains a valuable tool in the design of neural architectures, particularly in tasks that require systematic generalization and interpretability. \n\nIn conclusion, while neural models have challenged the traditional reliance on compositionality in computational linguistics, recent research highlights the continued relevance of compositional principles. By integrating compositionality into neural architectures, researchers can enhance the generalization and interpretability of models, particularly in tasks such as semantic parsing. The exploration of neurosymbolic models and novel design spaces offers promising avenues for reconciling the strengths of neural and symbolic approaches, ensuring that compositionality remains a vital component of computational linguistics.", "References": [{"title": "Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks", "authors": "Brenden M.
