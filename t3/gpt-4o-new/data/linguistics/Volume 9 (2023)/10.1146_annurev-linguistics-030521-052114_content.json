{"Literature Review": "The assessment of second language (L2) speaking proficiency is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of various linguistic and non-linguistic components. Speaking proficiency encompasses not only the ability to produce language but also the capacity to engage in meaningful interaction, which involves both linguistic and strategic competencies. The construct of speaking proficiency has been explored extensively in the literature, with researchers emphasizing the need for a multi-componential approach to capture the full range of skills involved in speaking (Fulcher, 2003). \n\nLinguistic competence, a core component of speaking proficiency, includes phonological, grammatical, lexical, and discourse knowledge. Phonological competence involves the ability to produce and perceive sounds accurately, which is crucial for intelligibility (Derwing & Munro, 2005). Grammatical competence refers to the use of syntactic structures, while lexical competence involves the appropriate use of vocabulary. Discourse competence, on the other hand, pertains to the ability to organize and connect ideas coherently in speech (Bachman & Palmer, 1996). These linguistic components are essential for effective communication and are often the focus of traditional language assessments.\n\nStrategic competence, another critical aspect of speaking proficiency, involves the use of communication strategies to overcome difficulties in interaction. This includes strategies for managing conversation, such as turn-taking, repairing communication breakdowns, and using fillers or pauses to maintain fluency (Canale & Swain, 1980). Strategic competence is particularly important in spontaneous speech, where speakers must adapt to the dynamic nature of interaction.\n\nInteractional competence, which encompasses the ability to engage in conversation and respond to interlocutors, is increasingly recognized as a vital component of speaking proficiency. This involves not only linguistic skills but also the ability to predict and respond to the interlocutor's contributions in real-time (Young, 2011). The interactive nature of speaking necessitates the inclusion of interactional competence in assessments to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of a speaker's abilities.\n\nThe assessment of speaking proficiency is further complicated by the influence of various factors that can introduce construct-irrelevant variance. Task design is a critical consideration, as different tasks can elicit varying levels of performance from test-takers. Tasks should be designed to reflect real-world speaking situations and should be varied to capture a range of speaking abilities (Luoma, 2004). Rater variability is another significant source of variance, as raters may differ in their interpretations of performance criteria and their severity or leniency in scoring (McNamara, 1996). Training and standardization of raters are essential to minimize this variability and ensure reliable assessments.\n\nInterlocutor effects also play a role in speaking assessments, as the presence and behavior of an interlocutor can influence a test-taker's performance. The interlocutor's proficiency level, familiarity, and interaction style can all impact the test-taker's ability to demonstrate their speaking skills (Brown, 2003). To address this, assessments may include multiple interlocutors or use standardized interlocutors to reduce variability.\n\nDespite the challenges associated with assessing speaking proficiency, advancements in technology offer new possibilities for more valid and reliable assessments. Automated scoring systems, for example, can provide consistent and objective evaluations of speaking performance, though they must be carefully calibrated to account for the nuances of human communication (Zechner et al., 2009). Additionally, computer-mediated communication tools can facilitate the assessment of interactional competence by simulating real-world speaking scenarios.\n\nFuture research in the assessment of speaking proficiency should continue to explore the integration of linguistic, strategic, and interactional competencies into assessment frameworks. There is also a need for further investigation into the impact of task design, rater training, and interlocutor effects on assessment outcomes. Moreover, the development of innovative assessment tools that leverage technology to enhance the validity and reliability of speaking assessments remains a promising area of inquiry.\n\nIn conclusion, the assessment of L2 speaking proficiency is a complex task that requires a nuanced understanding of the various components of speaking. By adopting a multi-componential approach and addressing the factors that contribute to construct-irrelevant variance, researchers and practitioners can develop more valid and reliable assessments that accurately reflect a speaker's abilities.", "References": [{"title": "Testing Second Language Speaking", "authors": "Glenn Fulcher", "journal": "Applied Linguistics", "year": "2003", "volumes": "24", "first page": "446", "last page": "469", "DOI": "10.1093/applin/24.4.446"}, {"title": "Accent, intelligibility, and comprehensibility: Evidence from four L1s", "authors": "Tracey M.
