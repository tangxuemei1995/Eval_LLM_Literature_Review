{"Literature Review": "The field of linguistics, like many other academic disciplines, has traditionally approached ethics through a regulatory lens, focusing on compliance with institutional guidelines and oversight bodies. However, recent scholarship has begun to expand this view, emphasizing the relational and reciprocal nature of ethical practice in linguistics. This shift reflects broader trends in academia towards decolonization, intersectionality, and social justice, which challenge researchers to reconsider their responsibilities not only in conducting research but also in how they conceive, frame, report, discuss, and teach their work. \n\nOne of the foundational aspects of ethics in linguistics is the concept of regulatory ethics, which involves adherence to established guidelines and protocols designed to protect research participants and ensure the integrity of research processes. These guidelines are often enforced by institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees, which assess research proposals to ensure they meet ethical standards (Mackenzie & Stoljar, 2000). However, critics argue that regulatory ethics can be overly prescriptive and may not adequately address the complex, context-dependent nature of linguistic research, particularly in fieldwork settings where researchers engage with diverse communities (Cameron et al., 1992).\n\nIn response to these limitations, scholars have advocated for a more relational approach to ethics in linguistics, which emphasizes the importance of building trust and mutual respect between researchers and the communities they study. This perspective aligns with the principles of participatory research, which seeks to involve community members as active collaborators in the research process (Smith, 1999). Relational ethics requires linguists to be reflexive about their positionality and the power dynamics inherent in their research relationships, recognizing that ethical practice is not just about following rules but about fostering genuine partnerships (Tuck & Yang, 2012).\n\nThe concept of relational ethics is closely tied to the broader movement towards decolonizing methodologies in linguistics. Decolonization involves challenging the dominance of Western epistemologies and methodologies, and instead valuing indigenous and marginalized ways of knowing and being (Battiste, 2000). In the context of linguistics, this means questioning the assumptions and biases that underpin traditional linguistic theories and practices, and seeking to amplify the voices and perspectives of those who have been historically marginalized in the field (Pennycook, 2001).\n\nIntersectionality is another critical framework that has informed recent discussions of ethics in linguistics. Originally developed by Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989) in the context of legal studies, intersectionality highlights the ways in which multiple forms of oppression and privilege intersect to shape individuals' experiences. In linguistics, this means considering how factors such as race, gender, class, and disability intersect to influence language use and linguistic identity (Bucholtz & Hall, 2005). An intersectional approach to ethics requires linguists to be attentive to the diverse and intersecting identities of their research participants, and to consider how these identities may impact their research findings and interpretations.\n\nThe alignment of ethical practice with scientific validity is a key theme in the literature on ethics in linguistics. Scholars argue that ethical research practices are not only morally imperative but also enhance the quality and validity of linguistic research. By engaging with communities in ethical and respectful ways, researchers can gain deeper insights into linguistic phenomena and produce more nuanced and accurate analyses (Hymes, 1974). Moreover, ethical research practices can help to dismantle dominant discourses and normative practices that have historically marginalized certain voices and perspectives in the field (Canagarajah, 1999).\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on ethics in linguistics highlights the importance of moving beyond regulatory compliance to embrace a more relational and reciprocal approach to ethical practice. This shift reflects broader trends towards decolonization, intersectionality, and social justice, which challenge linguists to reconsider their responsibilities not only in conducting research but also in how they conceive, frame, report, discuss, and teach their work. By aligning ethical practice with scientific validity, linguists can advance their work in meaningful ways and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable field.", "References": [{"title": "Relational Autonomy: Feminist Perspectives on Autonomy, Agency, and the Social Self", "authors": "Mackenzie, Catriona; Stoljar, Natalie", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Researching Language: Issues of Power and Method", "authors": "Cameron, Deborah; Frazer, Elizabeth; Harvey, Penelope; Rampton, Ben; Richardson, Kay", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "1992", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples", "authors": "Smith, Linda Tuhiwai", "journal": "Zed Books", "year": "1999", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Decolonization is not a metaphor", "authors": "Tuck, Eve; Yang, K.
