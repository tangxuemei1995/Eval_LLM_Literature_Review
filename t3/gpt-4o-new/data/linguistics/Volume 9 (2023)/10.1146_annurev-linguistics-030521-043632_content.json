{"Literature Review": "The classification of verbs across languages is a complex task that has been approached from various angles in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The advent of large language models has revolutionized the way linguistic information is extracted from text, yet these models are not without their limitations. This literature review explores the current state of verb classification, the role of human-designed lexical resources, and the potential for augmenting language models with external knowledge. \n\nVerb classification is a fundamental aspect of linguistic analysis, as verbs are central to sentence structure and meaning. Traditional approaches to verb classification have relied heavily on manually curated resources such as verb lexicons and thesauri. These resources, while comprehensive, are labor-intensive to create and maintain, especially across multiple languages (Levin, 1993). The development of the VerbNet and FrameNet projects exemplifies the extensive effort required to build such resources (Kipper et al., 2008; Baker et al., 1998). These projects have provided valuable insights into verb semantics and syntax, but their applicability is often limited to the languages for which they were developed.\n\nRecent advancements in language modeling, particularly with the introduction of transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, have shifted the focus towards unsupervised learning from large text corpora (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). These models have demonstrated remarkable success in various NLP tasks, including verb classification, by leveraging contextual embeddings to capture semantic relationships. However, probing studies have revealed that these models, while effective task solvers, do not inherently possess deep linguistic understanding (Rogers et al., 2020). They often rely on surface-level patterns and may struggle with tasks requiring nuanced semantic distinctions, such as verb classification across languages.\n\nThe limitations of language models have reignited interest in the potential role of human-designed lexical resources. These resources can provide structured, high-quality linguistic information that models may not easily learn from raw text. For instance, the integration of VerbNet with language models has been shown to improve performance on tasks requiring verb sense disambiguation (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005). Moreover, the use of external verb knowledge can enhance the interpretability of model predictions, offering insights into the decision-making process of neural architectures (Peters et al., 2019).\n\nMultilingual verb classification presents additional challenges, as it requires accounting for cross-linguistic variations in verb semantics and syntax. Approaches to generating verb classes multilingually have included both lexicographic work and crowdsourcing. Lexicographic efforts, while costly, can yield high-quality resources that capture the intricacies of verb usage across languages (Vossen, 1998). On the other hand, crowdsourcing offers a scalable alternative, leveraging the intuition of native speakers to gather linguistic data. Studies have shown that crowdsourcing can be an effective means of collecting verb classifications, though the quality of the data may vary depending on the task design and participant expertise (Snow et al., 2008).\n\nThe utility of augmenting pretrained language models with external verb knowledge is supported by evidence from various studies. For example, the incorporation of lexical resources has been found to improve model performance on tasks such as machine translation and semantic role labeling (Faruqui et al., 2015). Additionally, the use of verb lexicons can aid in the development of more robust multilingual models by providing a consistent framework for verb classification across languages (Pustejovsky et al., 2010).\n\nIn conclusion, while large language models have advanced the field of verb classification, they are not a panacea. Human-designed lexical resources continue to play a crucial role in filling the knowledge gaps of these models. The integration of external verb knowledge can enhance model performance and interpretability, particularly in multilingual contexts. As NLP continues to evolve, the collaboration between computational and human linguistic expertise will be essential in advancing our understanding of verb classification across languages.", "References": [{"title": "English Verb Classes and Alternations: A Preliminary Investigation", "authors": "Beth Levin", "journal": "University of Chicago Press", "year": "1993", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Large-Scale Classification of English Verbs", "authors": "Karin Kipper, Anna Korhonen, Neville Ryant, Martha Palmer", "journal": "Language Resources and Evaluation", "year": "2008", "volumes": "42", "first page": "21", "last page": "40", "DOI": "10.1007/s10579-007-9048-2"}, {"title": "The Berkeley FrameNet Project", "authors": "Collin F.
