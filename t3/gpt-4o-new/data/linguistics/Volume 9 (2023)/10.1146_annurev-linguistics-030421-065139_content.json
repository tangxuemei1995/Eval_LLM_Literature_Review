{"Literature Review": "Speech prosody, the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, plays a crucial role in communication by conveying emotional and linguistic information. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding how speech prosody is affected in various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. This interest is driven by the potential of prosodic features to serve as biomarkers for these conditions, offering insights into the underlying brain mechanisms and aiding in diagnosis and treatment. \n\nSchizophrenia is one of the most studied mental disorders in relation to speech prosody. Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit prosodic deficits, which can manifest as monotonic speech, inappropriate intonation, and difficulty in expressing or recognizing emotions through speech (Alpert et al., 2000). These prosodic abnormalities are thought to be linked to disruptions in the neural circuits involved in emotional processing and language production (Mitchell et al., 2004). Studies have shown that these deficits can impact social interactions and contribute to the social withdrawal commonly observed in schizophrenia (Ross et al., 2001).\n\nIn autism spectrum disorder (ASD), prosodic features are also significantly affected. Individuals with ASD often have atypical prosody, characterized by unusual pitch, rhythm, and stress patterns (Paul et al., 2005). These prosodic differences can hinder effective communication and social interaction, as they may lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the speaker's intent (McCann & Peppe, 2003). Research suggests that these prosodic abnormalities may be related to deficits in the integration of sensory information and the processing of social cues (Diehl et al., 2009).\n\nAlzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, also impacts speech prosody. As the disease progresses, patients may exhibit changes in speech rate, pitch, and volume, which can affect the clarity and emotional expressiveness of their speech (Taler & Phillips, 2008). These prosodic changes are believed to result from the deterioration of brain regions involved in speech production and emotional regulation, such as the frontal and temporal lobes (Cummings, 2004). Understanding these changes can provide valuable insights into the progression of the disease and aid in the development of therapeutic interventions.\n\nDepression is another mental disorder where prosodic features are altered. Depressed individuals often speak in a flat, monotonous tone, with reduced pitch variation and slower speech rate (Mundt et al., 2007). These prosodic characteristics can reflect the emotional blunting and psychomotor retardation associated with depression (Scherer, 2003). Prosodic analysis has been proposed as a tool for assessing the severity of depression and monitoring treatment response (Cummins et al., 2015).\n\nThe study of speech prosody in mental disorders highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that integrates findings from multiple disciplines, including psycholinguistics, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Theoretical models that consider the interplay between cognition, emotion, and language are essential for understanding the complex nature of prosodic deficits in these disorders (Pell et al., 2011). Moreover, there is a growing recognition of the importance of investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in prosody research, as these factors can influence the perception and production of prosodic features (Jessen et al., 2012).\n\nFuture research should focus on developing standardized methods for assessing prosodic features in mental disorders, as well as exploring the potential of prosodic biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Multidisciplinary efforts are needed to address the challenges in this field and to advance our understanding of the role of prosody in mental health. By integrating current findings and guiding future research, we can improve the characterization of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders and inform the development of effective interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Prosody and schizophrenia: A review", "authors": "Alpert, M., Rosenberg, S.
