{"Literature Review": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) presents a unique opportunity to explore both universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia. The complexity of the Chinese language, with its logographic writing system and tonal phonology, provides a distinct context for examining the cognitive and neural underpinnings of dyslexia. Recent research has highlighted several key areas of interest, including phonological processing, orthographic and morphological deficits, and neural activation patterns. \n\nPhonological processing deficits are considered a universal feature of dyslexia across languages. In Chinese DD, these deficits manifest in difficulties with phonological awareness, which is the ability to recognize and manipulate sounds in spoken language. Studies have shown that Chinese dyslexic children exhibit significant challenges in tasks requiring phonological processing, such as phoneme deletion and tone discrimination (Ho et al., 2004). These findings align with research in alphabetic languages, suggesting a shared phonological processing deficit in dyslexia (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005).\n\nRapid automatized naming (RAN) deficits are another universal characteristic of dyslexia. RAN tasks require individuals to quickly name a series of familiar items, such as colors or numbers, and are thought to reflect the efficiency of accessing phonological representations. Chinese dyslexic children have been found to perform poorly on RAN tasks, indicating a language-universal deficit (Shu et al., 2006). This supports the notion that RAN deficits are a core component of dyslexia, regardless of the language.\n\nIn contrast, orthographic and morphological deficits in Chinese DD are language-specific. The Chinese writing system is logographic, meaning that each character represents a morpheme or a word, rather than a phoneme. This requires a strong orthographic knowledge and morphological awareness. Research has shown that Chinese dyslexic children struggle with tasks involving character recognition and morphological processing, which are critical for reading comprehension in Chinese (McBride-Chang et al., 2005). These deficits highlight the importance of considering language-specific factors in understanding dyslexia.\n\nAt the neural level, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have identified both universal and language-specific patterns of brain activation in Chinese dyslexic children. Hypoactivation in the left superior temporal and inferior frontal regions has been observed, which is consistent with findings in alphabetic languages and suggests a shared phonological processing deficit (Siok et al., 2004). However, Chinese dyslexic children also exhibit hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital and middle temporal regions, as well as atypical activation in the left frontal areas. These patterns may reflect compensatory strategies for impaired visual-spatial analysis and morphological processing, which are specific to the Chinese language (Tan et al., 2005).\n\nThe genetic basis of dyslexia has also been explored in the context of Chinese DD. Susceptibility genes, such as DCDC2 and KIAA0319, have been implicated in dyslexia across different languages (Scerri & Schulte-Körne, 2010). However, the expression and impact of these genes may vary depending on the linguistic context. In Chinese, where morphological processing is crucial, genetic factors may interact with environmental influences to shape the manifestation of dyslexia (Wong et al., 2012).\n\nOverall, recent advances in Chinese DD research underscore the importance of considering both universal and language-specific mechanisms in understanding dyslexia. The findings have significant implications for the development of intervention programs. Effective interventions should address the phonological and RAN deficits common to all languages, while also targeting the orthographic and morphological challenges unique to Chinese. Moreover, understanding the neural and genetic underpinnings of Chinese DD can inform the design of personalized interventions that take into account individual differences in cognitive and neural profiles.\n\nFuture research should continue to explore the interplay between universal and language-specific factors in dyslexia. Longitudinal studies tracking the development of reading skills in Chinese children with dyslexia could provide valuable insights into the progression of deficits and the effectiveness of interventions. Additionally, cross-linguistic studies comparing Chinese DD with dyslexia in other languages could further elucidate the shared and distinct mechanisms underlying this complex disorder.", "References": [{"title": "Phonological awareness and rapid naming deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia", "authors": "Ho, Connie S.-H., Chan, David W., Tsang, Suk-Man, Lee, Suk-Han", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Child Psychology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "89", "first page": "115", "last page": "131", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecp.2004.05.002"}, {"title": "Developmental dyslexia in different languages: Language-specific or universal?", "authors": "Ziegler, Johannes C., Goswami, Usha", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Child Psychology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "92", "first page": "166", "last page": "193", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecp.2005.04.006"}, {"title": "Rapid naming and phonological processing as predictors of reading development in Chinese", "authors": "Shu, Hua, McBride-Chang, Catherine, Wu, Siu-Lan, Liu, Hongyun", "journal": "Journal of Educational Psychology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "98", "first page": "220", "last page": "233", "DOI": "10.1037/0022-0663.98.2.220"}, {"title": "Morphological awareness and early literacy development in Chinese-speaking children: What we know and what we need to know", "authors": "McBride-Chang, Catherine, Tardif, Twila, Cho, Jeung-Ryeul, Shu, Hua, Fletcher, Paul, Stokes, Stephanie F., Wong, Y.
