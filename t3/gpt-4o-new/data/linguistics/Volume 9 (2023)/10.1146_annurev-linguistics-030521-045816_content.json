{"Literature Review": "The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and language development has been a focal point of research for decades, with numerous studies highlighting the disparities in language acquisition and communication skills among children from different SES backgrounds. These disparities are often attributed to differences in parental input, comprehension strategies, and production practices, which collectively influence language development and communication. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on how SES impacts language development, focusing on the concepts relevant for communication, comprehension strategies, and production practices that express social identity. \n\nParental input is a critical factor in language development, and research consistently shows that children from higher SES backgrounds are exposed to a richer linguistic environment. Hart and Risley (1995) conducted a seminal study that found significant differences in the quantity and quality of words spoken to children from different SES backgrounds. They reported that by age three, children from high-SES families had heard approximately 30 million more words than their low-SES counterparts. This 'word gap' has been linked to differences in vocabulary size and language processing skills (Hart & Risley, 1995). \n\nHowever, it is not just the quantity of language exposure that matters, but also the quality. Hoff (2003) found that the complexity and diversity of language used by parents also vary with SES, with higher SES parents using more complex sentence structures and a wider range of vocabulary. This exposure to complex language structures is crucial for developing syntactic parsing skills, which are essential for understanding and producing language (Hoff, 2003). \n\nIn terms of comprehension strategies, children from different SES backgrounds may develop distinct approaches to interpreting language. Fernald et al. (2013) found that children from higher SES backgrounds were faster and more accurate in processing familiar words, suggesting that they develop more efficient language processing strategies. This efficiency in processing may be due to the richer linguistic environment and more frequent exposure to diverse language inputs (Fernald et al., 2013). \n\nMoreover, SES differences in language comprehension are not limited to vocabulary and syntax but extend to the interpretation of pragmatic aspects of language. Rowe (2012) highlighted that children from higher SES backgrounds are more adept at understanding indirect requests and non-literal language, which are crucial for effective communication in social contexts. This ability to comprehend nuanced language reflects the influence of SES on the development of pragmatic language skills (Rowe, 2012). \n\nIn terms of language production, children from different SES backgrounds exhibit variations in their use of language to express social identity. Labov (2006) emphasized that language is a tool for signaling social identity and that children from different SES backgrounds may adopt distinct linguistic styles to align with their social group. This sociolinguistic perspective suggests that language production is not merely about conveying information but also about expressing identity and belonging (Labov, 2006). \n\nSES-related differences in language production are also evident in the use of dialects and vernaculars. Craig and Washington (2004) found that African American children from low-SES backgrounds often use African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as a marker of cultural identity. This use of vernaculars can influence academic achievement, as standard language forms are often privileged in educational settings (Craig & Washington, 2004). \n\nThe implications of SES differences in language development extend beyond communication skills to impact academic achievement. Language skills are foundational for literacy development, and disparities in language acquisition can contribute to achievement gaps. Snow (1991) argued that early language experiences shape literacy skills, and children from low-SES backgrounds may enter school with less developed language skills, putting them at a disadvantage in academic settings (Snow, 1991). \n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that language is a flexible medium, and children from all SES backgrounds have the potential to develop strong language skills given the right support and opportunities. Intervention programs that focus on enhancing language exposure and providing rich linguistic environments have shown promise in mitigating SES-related language disparities (Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). \n\nIn conclusion, SES differences in language development are multifaceted, involving variations in parental input, comprehension strategies, and production practices. These differences reflect underlying disparities in access to linguistic resources and opportunities for language learning. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the social and cultural contexts of language development and provides support for children from all SES backgrounds to develop their language skills and express their social identities.", "References": [{"title": "Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children", "authors": "Betty Hart, Todd R.
