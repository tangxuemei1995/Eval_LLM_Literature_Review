{"Literature Review": "Language documentation has emerged as a critical subfield within linguistics, driven by the urgent need to preserve endangered languages and the concurrent evolution of digital technologies. Over the past two and a half decades, the field has witnessed significant technological advancements that have transformed the ways in which linguistic data is collected, stored, and disseminated. This literature review explores recent technological innovations in resource creation and mobilization within language documentation, highlighting their impact on language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis. \n\nThe advent of affordable digital recording devices has revolutionized the collection of linguistic data. Early efforts in language documentation relied heavily on analog recording equipment, which posed challenges in terms of data quality and storage (Himmelmann, 1998). However, the introduction of digital audio and video recorders has significantly enhanced the quality and accessibility of recorded language events. These devices allow for high-fidelity recordings that are crucial for capturing the nuances of spoken language, including intonation, stress, and rhythm (Woodbury, 2011). Moreover, the portability and affordability of these devices have democratized the process of data collection, enabling linguists and community members to document languages in diverse settings and contexts (Austin, 2010).\n\nIn addition to recording technologies, advancements in software tools for annotation and analysis have played a pivotal role in language documentation. Annotation software such as ELAN (EUDICO Linguistic Annotator) and Praat have become indispensable tools for linguists, allowing for the detailed transcription and analysis of recorded data (Wittenburg et al., 2006). These tools support the integration of multiple tiers of annotation, including phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and semantic information, thereby facilitating comprehensive linguistic analysis (Boersma & Weenink, 2021). Furthermore, the development of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques has opened new avenues for automating aspects of annotation, reducing the time and effort required for manual transcription (Bird & Liberman, 2001).\n\nThe mobilization of linguistic resources is another area where technology has made significant strides. Digital platforms and repositories such as the Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) and the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) provide centralized access to a wealth of linguistic data, supporting both academic research and community-driven language revitalization efforts (Nathan, 2010). These platforms not only ensure the long-term preservation of linguistic resources but also facilitate their dissemination to a global audience, fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration (Thieberger & Berez, 2012).\n\nMoreover, mobile applications and online tools have emerged as powerful vehicles for language learning and revitalization. Apps like Duolingo and Memrise, while primarily focused on widely spoken languages, have inspired the development of similar tools for endangered languages, offering interactive and engaging ways for users to learn and practice languages (Moseley, 2010). Community-driven projects such as the 'FirstVoices' platform empower indigenous communities to create and share digital language resources, supporting intergenerational language transmission and cultural continuity (Czaykowska-Higgins et al., 2014).\n\nThe integration of virtual and augmented reality technologies into language documentation is an exciting frontier that holds promise for immersive language learning experiences. Projects like 'The Language Conservancy's' VR initiatives aim to create virtual environments where users can engage with language in contextually rich settings, enhancing their linguistic and cultural understanding (Hinton, 2011). These technologies offer novel ways to experience and interact with language, providing opportunities for experiential learning that traditional methods cannot replicate.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain in the field of language documentation. Issues related to data ownership, ethical considerations, and the digital divide must be addressed to ensure that technological innovations benefit all stakeholders equitably (Dobrin et al., 2009). Collaborative approaches that involve linguists, technologists, and community members are essential for developing sustainable and culturally sensitive documentation practices (Rice, 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, recent technological advances have significantly enhanced the capacity for resource creation and mobilization in language documentation. Digital recording devices, annotation software, online repositories, and emerging technologies like VR are transforming the ways in which linguistic data is collected, analyzed, and shared. These innovations not only support academic research but also empower communities to reclaim and revitalize their languages, contributing to the preservation of linguistic diversity worldwide. As the field continues to evolve, ongoing collaboration and ethical engagement will be crucial in harnessing the full potential of technology for language documentation.", "References": [{"title": "Documentary and descriptive linguistics", "authors": "Nikolaus P.
