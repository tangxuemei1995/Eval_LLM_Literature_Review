{"Literature Review": "Constructed languages, often referred to as 'conlangs,' represent a fascinating intersection of linguistics, culture, and creativity. These languages are intentionally created rather than naturally evolved, and they serve a variety of purposes, from philosophical exploration to practical communication solutions, artistic expression, and scientific experimentation. The study of constructed languages offers insights into linguistic theory, cognitive science, and cultural studies. \n\nPhilosophical languages, one of the earliest forms of constructed languages, emerged in the seventeenth century. These languages were designed to reflect the logical structure of reality more accurately than natural languages. John Wilkins' 'An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language' (1668) is a seminal work in this area, proposing a universal language based on a taxonomy of concepts (Wilkins, 1668). Philosophical languages aimed to eliminate the ambiguities and irregularities inherent in natural languages, thus facilitating clearer communication and thought. However, these languages often faced criticism for their complexity and lack of practicality, as noted by Eco (1995), who explored the historical attempts at creating universal languages and their philosophical underpinnings (Eco, 1995).\n\nInternational auxiliary languages (IALs) gained prominence in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a response to the growing need for a common language to facilitate international communication. Esperanto, created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, is the most successful example of an IAL. It was designed to be easy to learn, politically neutral, and culturally inclusive (Zamenhof, 1887). Studies have shown that Esperanto can be learned more quickly than many natural languages, making it an attractive option for international communication (Corsetti, 1996). Despite its advantages, Esperanto has not achieved widespread adoption, partly due to the dominance of English as a global lingua franca (Gordin, 2015). Other IALs, such as Ido and Interlingua, have also been developed, each with its own linguistic features and community of speakers (Blanke, 1985).\n\nIn recent decades, constructed languages have become popular in the realms of fiction, particularly in science fiction and fantasy genres. These artistic languages, or 'artlangs,' are often created to add depth and authenticity to fictional worlds. J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish languages, such as Quenya and Sindarin, are well-known examples, reflecting Tolkien's background in philology and his desire to create a rich linguistic history for his fictional universe (Tolkien, 1954). Similarly, the Klingon language, developed by linguist Marc Okrand for the Star Trek franchise, has gained a dedicated following and is studied by fans worldwide (Okrand, 1985). The creation of these languages involves not only linguistic creativity but also cultural and historical considerations, as they must fit seamlessly into the fictional worlds they inhabit (Peterson, 2015).\n\nConstructed languages are also increasingly used in psycholinguistic experiments to explore fundamental questions about language learning, processing, and cognition. By controlling the linguistic variables in a constructed language, researchers can isolate specific factors and examine their effects on language acquisition and use. For example, artificial languages have been used to study the role of word order and morphology in language learning (Culbertson et al., 2012). These experiments provide valuable insights into the cognitive processes underlying language and have implications for theories of language universals and typology (Fedzechkina et al., 2012).\n\nThe study of constructed languages challenges traditional linguistic paradigms and offers new perspectives on language as a human phenomenon. While natural languages evolve organically over time, constructed languages are the product of deliberate design, reflecting the intentions and creativity of their creators. This distinction raises important questions about the nature of language, its functions, and its relationship to culture and identity. As the field of linguistics continues to evolve, constructed languages will likely play an increasingly important role in both theoretical and applied research, offering unique opportunities to explore the boundaries of human language and communication.", "References": [{"title": "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language", "authors": "John Wilkins", "journal": "", "year": "1668", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Search for the Perfect Language", "authors": "Umberto Eco", "journal": "", "year": "1995", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Fundamento de Esperanto", "authors": "L.
