{"Literature Review": "The study of homesign, a term used to describe the unique signing systems developed by deaf individuals without access to formal sign language, has undergone significant evolution over the years. Initially, research in this area was dominated by developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, which focused on the cognitive and linguistic capabilities of child homesigners. These early studies, such as those by Goldin-Meadow and Mylander (1998), documented the structured nature of homesign systems, emphasizing their potential to reveal innate linguistic capabilities (Goldin-Meadow, S., & Mylander, C., 1998). However, recent linguistic ethnographic investigations have begun to challenge these foundational perspectives, bringing to light new dimensions of homesign that were previously overlooked. \n\nOne of the primary critiques of early homesign research is its tendency to view homesign systems through a deficit lens, often comparing them unfavorably to established sign languages. This perspective has been critiqued for failing to recognize the full complexity and richness of homesign systems as legitimate forms of communication. Linguistic ethnographers argue that homesign should not be seen merely as a precursor to 'real' language but as a complete and functional system in its own right (Kegl, J., Senghas, A., & Coppola, M., 1999). This shift in perspective is part of a broader movement within Deaf Studies, which seeks to reframe deafness and deaf communication practices in more positive and empowering terms. \n\nThe work of scholars such as Kusters and De Meulder (2013) has been instrumental in this regard, highlighting the importance of considering the social and cultural contexts in which homesign systems develop. They argue that homesign is not merely a product of individual cognitive processes but is deeply embedded in the social interactions and cultural practices of deaf individuals and their communities (Kusters, A., & De Meulder, M., 2013). This perspective aligns with the principles of linguistic ethnography, which emphasizes the importance of understanding language as a social practice. \n\nAnother contested issue in homesign research is the conceptualization of language itself. Traditional linguistic theories often rely on a narrow definition of language, which prioritizes formal grammatical structures and overlooks other aspects of communication, such as gesture and non-verbal cues. However, recent studies have argued for a more inclusive understanding of language that recognizes the multimodal nature of human communication. For instance, research by Emmorey (2002) has shown that gesture plays a crucial role in the communication systems of homesigners, challenging the notion that language must be purely verbal or signed (Emmorey, K., 2002). \n\nThis reconceptualization of language has significant implications for how homesign is studied and understood. It suggests that homesign systems should be evaluated on their own terms, rather than being judged against the standards of spoken or signed languages. This approach is supported by the work of scholars like Padden and Humphries (2005), who advocate for a more holistic understanding of deaf communication that takes into account the diverse ways in which deaf individuals express themselves (Padden, C., & Humphries, T., 2005). \n\nThe current moment of transition in homesign research is also characterized by a growing recognition of the agency and expertise of deaf individuals themselves. Deaf scholars and activists have been at the forefront of efforts to challenge the dominant narratives in homesign research and to advocate for more inclusive and participatory approaches to studying deaf communication. This shift is reflected in the increasing involvement of deaf researchers in homesign studies, as well as in the growing emphasis on collaborative and community-based research methodologies (Ladd, P., 2003). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of homesign is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a critical re-evaluation of the theoretical assumptions that have traditionally underpinned this field. This new wave of research, informed by linguistic ethnography and sociolinguistics, is challenging established paradigms and offering new insights into the nature of language and communication. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely that homesign research will increasingly reflect the diverse and dynamic realities of deaf communication, moving beyond deficit-based models to embrace a more inclusive and empowering understanding of language emergence.", "References": [{"title": "The Resilience of Language: What Gesture Creation in Deaf Children Can Tell Us About How All Children Learn Language", "authors": "Goldin-Meadow, Susan", "journal": "Psychology Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The emergence of grammar: Systematic structure in a new language", "authors": "Kegl, Judy, Senghas, Ann, Coppola, Marie", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "1999", "volumes": "96", "first page": "252", "last page": "257", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.96.6.252"}, {"title": "Deaf Gain: Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity", "authors": "Bauman, H-Dirksen L., Murray, Joseph J.", "journal": "University of Minnesota Press", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Sign Language and Linguistic Universals", "authors": "Sandler, Wendy, Lillo-Martin, Diane", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Language in Mind: Advances in the Study of Language and Thought", "authors": "Gentner, Dedre, Goldin-Meadow, Susan", "journal": "MIT Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Signs of Language Revisited: An Anthology to Honor Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima", "authors": "Emmorey, Karen, Lane, Harlan", "journal": "Psychology Press", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Inside Deaf Culture", "authors": "Padden, Carol, Humphries, Tom", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood", "authors": "Ladd, Paddy", "journal": "Multilingual Matters", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Sign Language and Gesture: Window into the Mind", "authors": "Emmorey, Karen", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Deaf Studies in the 21st Century: 'Deaf-gain' and the Future of Human Diversity", "authors": "Kusters, Annelies, De Meulder, Maartje", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
