{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between diet, gut microbiota, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders has garnered significant attention in recent years. The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the human gastrointestinal tract, plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health and overall homeostasis. Diet is a primary modulator of the gut microbiome, influencing its composition and function, which in turn affects the host's health. This literature review explores the role of diet–microbiome interactions in GI disorders, specifically focusing on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and discusses strategies to modulate these interactions through microbiome-targeted therapies.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional GI disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS is multifactorial, involving gut-brain axis dysregulation, altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and immune activation. Recent studies have highlighted the role of gut microbiota in IBS, suggesting that dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbial community, may contribute to symptom development (Simrén et al., 2013). Dietary interventions, such as low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diets, have been shown to alleviate IBS symptoms by reducing the production of gas and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut bacteria (Halmos et al., 2014).\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the GI tract. The etiology of IBD is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. The gut microbiota is believed to play a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis, with studies showing reduced microbial diversity and altered microbial composition in patients (Frank et al., 2007). Diet-induced changes in the gut microbiome can influence the inflammatory response, with certain dietary components, such as fiber, promoting the production of anti-inflammatory SCFAs (Makki et al., 2018).\n\nThe interaction between diet and the gut microbiome is mediated through the metabolism of dietary components into bioactive metabolites. These metabolites, including SCFAs, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, can influence GI physiology and immune function. SCFAs, produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers by gut bacteria, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and maintain intestinal barrier integrity (Koh et al., 2016). Bile acids, derived from cholesterol metabolism, can modulate gut motility and microbial composition, influencing GI health (Ridlon et al., 2016).\n\nMicrobiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have been explored as potential strategies to modulate diet–microbiome interactions in GI disorders. Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits, have shown promise in alleviating IBS symptoms by modulating gut microbiota composition and function (Ford et al., 2014). Prebiotics, non-digestible food components that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, can enhance the production of SCFAs and improve gut health (Gibson et al., 2017). FMT, the transfer of fecal material from a healthy donor to a patient, has been investigated as a treatment for IBD, with studies showing variable efficacy (Moayyedi et al., 2015).\n\nPersonalized nutrition, tailored to an individual's genetic, microbial, and metabolic profile, is emerging as a promising approach to modulate diet–microbiome interactions in GI disorders. Advances in omics technologies, such as metagenomics and metabolomics, enable comprehensive profiling of the gut microbiome and its metabolic outputs, facilitating the development of personalized dietary interventions (Zeevi et al., 2015). However, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical practice, including the need for standardized methodologies and large-scale studies to validate personalized approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, the diet–microbiome interaction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of GI disorders, with diet-induced changes in the gut microbiome influencing disease outcomes. Microbiome-targeted therapies offer potential strategies to modulate these interactions, but further research is needed to optimize their efficacy and develop personalized interventions. Understanding the complex interplay between diet, microbiota, and host physiology will be essential for advancing the management of GI disorders.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome", "authors": "Simrén, M., Barbara, G., Flint, H.
