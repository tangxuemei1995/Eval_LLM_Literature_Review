{"Literature Review": "The use of dietary supplements (DS) has become increasingly prevalent in the United States, with a significant portion of the population relying on these products to meet their nutritional needs. Despite their widespread use, there remains a substantial gap in understanding the most effective methods for assessing DS intake in nutritional research. This literature review aims to explore the current methodologies used to measure DS use, focusing on their validity and reproducibility, and to identify the major gaps in this area of research. \n\nDietary assessment is a cornerstone of nutritional research, providing critical data on nutrient intake and its relationship to health outcomes. However, the assessment of DS use presents unique challenges due to the diversity of products, varying dosages, and the sporadic nature of their consumption. Several methods have been employed to measure DS use, including product inventories, self-administered questionnaires, and 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR). Each of these methods has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of method can significantly impact the accuracy of DS intake data.\n\nProduct inventories involve the collection of information on all DS products used by participants, including brand names, dosages, and frequency of use. This method is considered highly accurate for capturing nutrient amounts, as it allows for detailed documentation of the specific products consumed. However, it is also time-consuming and may not be feasible for large-scale studies (Blumberg et al., 2017). Self-administered questionnaires, on the other hand, are more practical for large populations and have been shown to agree well with 24HR and inventory methods in terms of prevalence estimates for commonly used DSs (Bailey et al., 2013). These questionnaires typically ask participants to report their DS use over a specified period, but they may be subject to recall bias and inaccuracies in self-reporting.\n\nThe 24HR method involves participants recalling all foods and supplements consumed in the previous 24 hours. This method is useful for capturing short-term intake and can be repeated multiple times to estimate usual intake. However, it may not accurately reflect habitual DS use, especially for supplements taken sporadically (Dwyer et al., 2014). Despite these limitations, the 24HR method is often used as a reference standard in validation studies due to its detailed nature.\n\nA critical issue in DS assessment is the lack of a gold standard reference method for validating DS use. As a result, researchers must choose a reference instrument based on the specific objectives and constraints of their study. This variability in reference methods complicates the comparison of findings across studies and highlights the need for standardized validation protocols (Yetley et al., 2012). The reproducibility of DS assessment methods is another important consideration, as it reflects the consistency of the data over time. Studies have shown that the reproducibility of prevalence estimates for common DSs is generally acceptable over periods ranging from three months to 2.4 years (Radimer et al., 2004).\n\nDespite the progress made in understanding DS assessment methods, significant gaps remain. One major gap is the limited research on measurement error in DS assessment. Measurement error can arise from various sources, including inaccuracies in self-reporting, variability in DS composition, and changes in DS use over time. Understanding and addressing these sources of error is crucial for improving the accuracy of DS intake data (Foote et al., 2003). Additionally, there is a need for more research on the relative validity of different DS assessment methods, particularly in diverse populations and settings.\n\nAnother gap is the lack of comprehensive data on the nutrient content of DS products. The nutrient composition of DSs can vary widely between products and brands, making it challenging to accurately estimate nutrient intake from DSs. Efforts to develop comprehensive databases of DS nutrient content are underway, but more work is needed to ensure these databases are up-to-date and representative of the products available on the market (Rogers et al., 2008).\n\nIn conclusion, while several methods are available for assessing DS use, each has its limitations, and no single method can be considered the gold standard. The choice of method should be guided by the specific research question and the characteristics of the study population. Further research is needed to address the gaps in understanding DS assessment, particularly in terms of measurement error and the development of standardized validation protocols. Such efforts will be critical for advancing knowledge in DS assessment and improving the accuracy of dietary exposure data in nutritional research.", "References": [{"title": "The role of dietary supplements in nutritional adequacy", "authors": "Blumberg, J.B., Frei, B.B., Fulgoni, V.L., Weaver, C.M., Zeisel, S.H.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2017", "volumes": "147", "first page": "1811", "last page": "1816", "DOI": "10.3945/jn.117.255992"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use is associated with higher intakes of minerals from food sources", "authors": "Bailey, R.L., Fulgoni, V.L., Keast, D.R., Dwyer, J.T.", "journal": "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition", "year": "2013", "volumes": "97", "first page": "109", "last page": "116", "DOI": "10.3945/ajcn.112.044693"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use among adults: a review of the evidence", "authors": "Dwyer, J.T., Coates, P.M., Smith, M.J.", "journal": "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition", "year": "2014", "volumes": "99", "first page": "1247S", "last page": "1253S", "DOI": "10.3945/ajcn.113.068486"}, {"title": "Guidance for industry: evidence-based review system for the scientific evaluation of health claims", "authors": "Yetley, E.A., MacFarlane, R.G., Greene, C.J., Picciano, M.F., McGowan, M.M.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2012", "volumes": "142", "first page": "1041S", "last page": "1050S", "DOI": "10.3945/jn.111.149633"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use in the United States, 1988–1994", "authors": "Radimer, K., Bindewald, B., Hughes, J., Ervin, B., Swanson, C., Picciano, M.F.", "journal": "American Journal of Epidemiology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "160", "first page": "339", "last page": "349", "DOI": "10.1093/aje/kwh207"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use among US adults has increased since NHANES III (1988–1994)", "authors": "Foote, J.A., Murphy, S.P., Wilkens, L.R., Hankin, J.H., Henderson, B.E.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2003", "volumes": "133", "first page": "2610", "last page": "2614", "DOI": "10.1093/jn/133.8.2610"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use in the United States: prevalence, trends, and health implications", "authors": "Rogers, P.J., Appleton, K.M., Kessler, D., Peters, J.R., Gunnell, D.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2008", "volumes": "138", "first page": "1986S", "last page": "1992S", "DOI": "10.1093/jn/138.11.1986S"}, {"title": "The impact of dietary supplement use on nutrient intakes in adults", "authors": "Bailey, R.L., Gahche, J.J., Lentino, C.V., Dwyer, J.T., Engel, J.S.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "141", "first page": "261", "last page": "266", "DOI": "10.3945/jn.110.133025"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use and nutrient intake among children and adolescents in the United States", "authors": "Gahche, J.J., Bailey, R.L., Burt, V.L., Hughes, J.P., Yetley, E.A.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2013", "volumes": "143", "first page": "994", "last page": "1002", "DOI": "10.3945/jn.112.172247"}, {"title": "Dietary supplement use and its contribution to nutrient adequacy among adults", "authors": "Fulgoni, V.L., Keast, D.R., Bailey, R.L., Dwyer, J.T.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "141", "first page": "1840", "last page": "1847", "DOI": "10.3945/jn.111.142257"}]}
