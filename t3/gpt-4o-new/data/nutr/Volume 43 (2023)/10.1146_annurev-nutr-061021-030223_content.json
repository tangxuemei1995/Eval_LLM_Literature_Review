{"Literature Review": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, not due to alcohol consumption. It is particularly common among individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, affecting approximately 25% of the global population (Younossi et al., 2016). NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Chalasani et al., 2018). Despite its prevalence, there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for NAFLD, highlighting the need for effective therapeutic strategies. \n\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have garnered attention for their potential therapeutic effects in NAFLD. These fatty acids are known for their anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and lipid-lowering properties, which are crucial in the context of NAFLD (Jump et al., 2015). The pathophysiology of NAFLD involves insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation, all of which can be modulated by ω3 PUFAs (Argo et al., 2015). \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ω3 PUFAs in NAFLD. A meta-analysis by Parker et al. (2012) concluded that ω3 PUFA supplementation significantly reduces liver fat content and improves liver function tests in patients with NAFLD. This is supported by a randomized controlled trial by Tanaka et al. (2008), which showed that DHA supplementation led to a significant reduction in liver fat and improved insulin sensitivity in patients with NAFLD. \n\nThe mechanisms by which ω3 PUFAs exert their effects in NAFLD are multifaceted. They are known to modulate lipid metabolism by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which play a critical role in fatty acid oxidation and lipid homeostasis (Jump et al., 2015). Additionally, ω3 PUFAs can reduce hepatic de novo lipogenesis by downregulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a key transcription factor involved in lipid synthesis (Argo et al., 2015). \n\nInflammation is a key driver of NAFLD progression, and ω3 PUFAs have potent anti-inflammatory effects. They can inhibit the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Calder, 2015). Furthermore, ω3 PUFAs can enhance the production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and resolvins, which help resolve inflammation and promote tissue repair (Serhan et al., 2008). \n\nFibrosis is a critical stage in the progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and HCC. ω3 PUFAs have been shown to exert anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting hepatic stellate cell activation, a key event in liver fibrosis (Svegliati-Baroni et al., 2006). This is supported by preclinical studies demonstrating that ω3 PUFA supplementation reduces liver fibrosis in animal models of NAFLD (Sanyal et al., 2014). \n\nDespite the promising evidence, the clinical use of ω3 PUFAs in NAFLD is not without challenges. The optimal dose and formulation of ω3 PUFAs for NAFLD treatment remain to be established. Moreover, the variability in response among individuals necessitates further research to identify potential biomarkers that can predict treatment response (Jump et al., 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, ω3 PUFAs hold significant promise as a therapeutic option for NAFLD due to their ability to modulate key pathways involved in the disease's pathogenesis. While current evidence supports their efficacy in reducing liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis, further large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and establish standardized treatment protocols. The integration of ω3 PUFAs into NAFLD management could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of this increasingly prevalent liver disease.", "References": [{"title": "Global epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease—Meta‐analytic assessment of prevalence, incidence, and outcomes", "authors": "Zobair M.
