{"Literature Review": "Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin that is crucial for maintaining human health. It serves as a precursor for the coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which are essential for various biochemical processes, including energy production, cellular respiration, and the metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids. Riboflavin deficiency, although rare in high-income countries, remains a significant public health issue in low-income regions, where dietary intake may be insufficient (Powers, 2003). The clinical manifestations of riboflavin deficiency include cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and anemia, particularly erythroid hypoplasia (Powers, 2003; McCormick, 1989). \n\nThe causes of riboflavin deficiency are multifaceted, often linked to inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption syndromes, and increased physiological demands such as during pregnancy and lactation (Powers, 2003). In low-income countries, diets are often limited in riboflavin-rich foods such as dairy products, eggs, and green leafy vegetables, leading to higher prevalence rates of deficiency (Powers, 2003). Additionally, certain populations, including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, may be at increased risk due to impaired absorption or increased metabolic requirements (Powers, 2003; McCormick, 1989). \n\nSubclinical riboflavin deficiency is more prevalent than overt deficiency and often goes undetected due to the lack of routine measurement of riboflavin biomarkers in clinical practice (Powers, 2003). The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) is a sensitive biomarker for assessing riboflavin status, with higher values indicating deficiency (Powers, 2003). Despite its utility, EGRac is not commonly used in clinical settings, leading to underdiagnosis of subclinical deficiency (Powers, 2003). \n\nThe health consequences of riboflavin deficiency extend beyond the classical clinical signs. Riboflavin plays a critical role in iron metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to anemia, characterized by reduced hemoglobin synthesis and erythroid hypoplasia (Powers, 2003; McCormick, 1989). Furthermore, riboflavin is involved in the metabolism of other B vitamins, including vitamin B6 and folate, which are essential for homocysteine metabolism. Elevated homocysteine levels, associated with riboflavin deficiency, have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension (Powers, 2003; McCormick, 1989). \n\nRecent studies have highlighted the potential role of riboflavin in managing hypertension, particularly in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, which is associated with elevated homocysteine levels (Powers, 2003). Supplementation with riboflavin has been shown to lower blood pressure in these individuals, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for riboflavin in cardiovascular health (Powers, 2003). \n\nPublic health strategies to address riboflavin deficiency should focus on improving dietary intake through food fortification and supplementation programs, particularly in vulnerable populations (Powers, 2003). Additionally, increasing awareness and routine screening for riboflavin status using biomarkers like EGRac could help identify at-risk individuals and prevent the adverse health outcomes associated with deficiency (Powers, 2003). \n\nIn conclusion, riboflavin deficiency, while often overlooked, has significant clinical and public health implications. Addressing this deficiency requires a multifaceted approach, including dietary interventions, public health policies, and increased research into the detection and management of subclinical deficiency. Further studies are needed to explore the broader health impacts of riboflavin deficiency and the potential benefits of supplementation in various populations.", "References": [{"title": "Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and health", "authors": "Hilary J.
