{"Literature Review": "The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) is a complex communication network that links the gut microbiota with the central nervous system, influencing brain development and function. The prenatal and early postnatal periods are critical windows for the development of the MGBA, and nutrition plays a pivotal role in shaping this axis. Maternal and infant nutrition can significantly impact the composition and function of the gut microbiota, which in turn can influence neurodevelopmental outcomes. This literature review explores the current understanding of how maternal and infant nutrition affects the MGBA, with a focus on specific nutrients such as milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics.\n\nMaternal nutrition during pregnancy is crucial for the development of the fetal brain and gut microbiota. Studies have shown that maternal diet can influence the microbial composition of the infant gut, which is established during birth and continues to develop in the early postnatal period (Koren et al., 2012). For instance, maternal intake of LC-PUFAs, such as omega-3 fatty acids, has been associated with improved cognitive outcomes in children (Innis, 2007). LC-PUFAs are essential for brain development, and their presence in the maternal diet can enhance the transfer of these nutrients to the fetus, supporting neurodevelopment (Cetin et al., 2009).\n\nHuman milk is the gold standard for infant nutrition and plays a significant role in shaping the infant gut microbiota. HMOs, a major component of human milk, serve as prebiotics that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria in the infant gut (Bode, 2012). The presence of specific HMOs in breast milk has been linked to the development of a healthy gut microbiota and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes (Goehring et al., 2016). Additionally, MFGM, another component of human milk, contains bioactive compounds that support brain development and cognitive function (Timby et al., 2014).\n\nThe introduction of solid foods and the transition from breastfeeding to complementary feeding is another critical period for the development of the MGBA. The composition of the diet during this time can influence the diversity and stability of the gut microbiota, which is important for brain development (Koletzko et al., 2019). Prebiotics and probiotics are dietary components that can modulate the gut microbiota and have been shown to have potential benefits for neurodevelopment. Prebiotics, such as inulin and fructooligosaccharides, can enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria and improve gut health (Roberfroid et al., 2010). Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits, have been shown to influence brain function and behavior through the MGBA (Sarkar et al., 2016).\n\nPostbiotics, which are metabolic byproducts of probiotics, are emerging as potential modulators of the MGBA. These compounds can exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, suggesting their potential role in supporting neurodevelopment (Aguilar-Toalá et al., 2018). The use of postbiotics in infant nutrition is an area of growing interest, with studies indicating their potential to enhance gut health and cognitive function (Tsilingiri and Rescigno, 2013).\n\nDespite the growing body of evidence supporting the role of nutrition in the development of the MGBA, there are still gaps in our understanding. Most studies have focused on the effects of individual nutrients, but the interactions between different dietary components and their combined effects on the MGBA are not well understood. Additionally, the long-term impact of early nutritional interventions on neurodevelopmental outcomes remains to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of nutrition on the MGBA and to identify optimal dietary strategies for supporting brain development.\n\nIn conclusion, maternal and infant nutrition plays a critical role in the development of the MGBA, with potential implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Nutrients such as MFGM, HMOs, LC-PUFAs, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics can influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota, which in turn can affect brain development and function. Understanding the impact of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the development of individualized nutrition-based interventions to support neurodevelopment and prevent neurocognitive and behavioral disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Host remodeling of the gut microbiome and metabolic changes during pregnancy", "authors": "Koren, O., Goodrich, J.
