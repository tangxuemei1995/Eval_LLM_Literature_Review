{"Literature Review": "The concept of nutrition security has gained increasing attention in recent years as a critical component of public health and policy discussions. While food security has been extensively studied and is well-defined, nutrition security remains an emerging concept that requires further exploration and understanding. Food security, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), refers to the access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2020). However, nutrition security extends beyond mere access to food, encompassing the quality of the diet and the nutritional status of individuals. This literature review aims to explore the existing research on nutrition security, its relationship with food security, and the importance of assessing and monitoring nutrition security to promote healthy dietary intake and outcomes in the United States.\n\nThe distinction between food security and nutrition security is crucial for understanding the broader implications of dietary intake and health outcomes. Food security focuses on the availability and accessibility of food, while nutrition security emphasizes the adequacy of nutrient intake and the overall quality of the diet (Jones et al., 2013). Nutrition security is concerned with ensuring that individuals not only have enough food but also have access to a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients for maintaining health and preventing disease (FAO, 2013). This distinction highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing dietary intake and health outcomes, as food security alone does not guarantee nutrition security.\n\nResearch has shown that food insecurity is associated with poor diet quality and adverse health outcomes. For instance, food-insecure individuals are more likely to consume diets high in energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, leading to increased risks of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases (Seligman et al., 2010). This underscores the importance of considering nutrition security in public health interventions and policies aimed at improving dietary intake and health outcomes. By focusing on nutrition security, policymakers can address the underlying factors that contribute to poor diet quality and health disparities.\n\nThe assessment and monitoring of nutrition security require a multidimensional approach that considers both dietary intake and nutritional status. Dietary intake assessments typically involve evaluating the types and quantities of foods consumed, as well as the nutrient content of the diet (Kirkpatrick et al., 2014). Nutritional status assessments, on the other hand, involve measuring biomarkers and other indicators of nutrient adequacy and health outcomes (Biesalski et al., 2013). Together, these assessments provide a comprehensive picture of nutrition security and can inform targeted interventions to improve dietary intake and health outcomes.\n\nSeveral frameworks have been proposed to conceptualize nutrition security and its relationship with food security. One such framework identifies two primary constructs: healthy diets and nutritional status (FAO, 2013). Healthy diets refer to the consumption of a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients, while nutritional status refers to the physiological state of individuals as determined by nutrient intake and utilization. Within these constructs, multiple subconstructs can be identified, such as dietary diversity, nutrient adequacy, and health outcomes. This framework provides a useful tool for understanding how nutrition security arises and how it differs from food security.\n\nThe importance of assessing and monitoring nutrition security is underscored by the growing recognition of the role of diet in preventing and managing chronic diseases. Poor diet quality is a leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide, and improving nutrition security is essential for reducing the burden of diet-related diseases (Micha et al., 2017). By assessing and monitoring nutrition security, researchers and policymakers can identify populations at risk of poor diet quality and implement targeted interventions to improve dietary intake and health outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, nutrition security is a critical component of public health that extends beyond food security to encompass the quality of the diet and the nutritional status of individuals. While food security is necessary for ensuring access to food, nutrition security is essential for ensuring that individuals have access to a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients for maintaining health and preventing disease. The assessment and monitoring of nutrition security require a multidimensional approach that considers both dietary intake and nutritional status. By focusing on nutrition security, policymakers can address the underlying factors that contribute to poor diet quality and health disparities, ultimately promoting healthy dietary intake and outcomes in the United States.", "References": [{"title": "Household Food Security in the United States in 2019", "authors": "Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Matthew P.
