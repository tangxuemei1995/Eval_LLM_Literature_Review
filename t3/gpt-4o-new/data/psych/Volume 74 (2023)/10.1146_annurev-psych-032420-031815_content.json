{"Literature Review": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a psychological phenomenon where the evaluation of a neutral stimulus changes due to its association with an affective stimulus. This process has been a subject of interest since the early 20th century, with roots in classical conditioning research. The foundational work by Pavlov on classical conditioning laid the groundwork for understanding how associations between stimuli can alter responses (Pavlov, 1927). Over the decades, EC has evolved into a distinct area of research, focusing specifically on how attitudes and evaluations are formed and changed through associative processes. \n\nThe historical trajectory of EC research reveals a shift from behaviorist interpretations to more cognitive perspectives. Initially, EC was understood primarily through the lens of stimulus-response associations, akin to classical conditioning. However, as cognitive psychology gained prominence, researchers began to explore the underlying cognitive processes that mediate EC effects. This shift is exemplified by the work of Martin and Levey (1978), who proposed that EC involves not just simple associations but also complex cognitive processes such as propositional reasoning. \n\nIn recent years, the focus has been on understanding the functional properties of EC effects and how they can be harnessed to influence evaluations. A key question in this domain is how EC procedures should be designed to maximize their impact on evaluation. Research by Hofmann et al. (2010) suggests that the strength and durability of EC effects depend on factors such as the number of pairings, the intensity of the affective stimulus, and the context in which the conditioning occurs. These findings underscore the importance of carefully designing EC procedures to achieve desired outcomes. \n\nAnother critical area of inquiry is the cognitive processes that mediate EC effects. There is ongoing debate about whether these processes are automatic or require conscious awareness. Some researchers argue that EC effects can occur automatically, without conscious awareness of the stimulus co-occurrence (De Houwer, 2006). Others contend that awareness and propositional reasoning play a crucial role in mediating EC effects (Mitchell et al., 2009). This debate highlights the complexity of the cognitive mechanisms underlying EC and the need for further research to disentangle these processes. \n\nThe external validity of EC research is another important consideration. While EC effects have been robustly demonstrated in laboratory settings, their ubiquity and relevance in real-world contexts remain subjects of investigation. Field studies, such as those by Olson and Fazio (2001), have provided evidence that EC can influence attitudes outside the lab, suggesting that EC processes are not confined to artificial experimental conditions. However, the extent to which EC effects generalize to everyday life and influence real-world behavior is still an open question. \n\nThe future of EC research lies in addressing these open questions and exploring the practical applications of EC in various domains, such as marketing, health promotion, and social behavior change. Understanding the relevance of EC to everyday life and the level of control individuals have over these processes is crucial for translating EC research into practical interventions. Moreover, advancements in neuroimaging and computational modeling offer promising avenues for elucidating the neural and computational mechanisms underlying EC. \n\nIn conclusion, evaluative conditioning is a dynamic and evolving field of research that has made significant strides in understanding how attitudes and evaluations are formed and changed. While much progress has been made, important questions remain about the cognitive processes mediating EC effects, their automaticity, and their external validity. Addressing these questions will be essential for advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of EC and its applications in real-world contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Conditioned reflexes: An investigation of the physiological activity of the cerebral cortex", "authors": "Ivan P.
