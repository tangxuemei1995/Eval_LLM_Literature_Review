{"Literature Review": "Social cognitive aging is a multifaceted process influenced by a variety of determinants that can either enhance resilience or increase risk. The SCoRe framework provides a comprehensive model to understand these determinants by categorizing them into capacity and motivational resources. Capacity resources refer to the cognitive and neural substrates that support social cognition, while motivational resources pertain to the drive and willingness to engage in social cognitive tasks. Neurobiological aging, a key determinant of social cognitive aging, is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. These influences manifest as changes in sensory, neural, and physiological systems, which directly impact cognitive capacity. For instance, age-related declines in sensory processing can impair the ability to perceive social cues, thereby reducing social cognitive capacity (Salthouse, 2010). Furthermore, neurobiological changes can indirectly affect motivation by altering the perceived value of cognitive effort and the expectation of reward versus loss (Samanez-Larkin & Knutson, 2015). \n\nThe role of genetic factors in social cognitive aging has been highlighted in studies examining the influence of specific genes on cognitive decline. For example, the APOE Îµ4 allele has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive impairments, which can affect social cognition (Corder et al., 1993). Environmental factors, such as exposure to chronic stress, have also been shown to accelerate neurobiological aging and cognitive decline (Lupien et al., 2009). These findings underscore the importance of considering both genetic predispositions and environmental exposures when assessing social cognitive aging. \n\nContextual factors play a crucial role in determining the availability and utilization of capacity and motivational resources. Relationship status, for instance, has been found to influence social cognitive resilience. Married individuals or those in stable relationships often exhibit better social cognitive functioning compared to their single counterparts, possibly due to the cognitive and emotional support provided by partners (Antonucci et al., 2010). Familiarity with social partners can also enhance social cognitive performance by reducing cognitive load and increasing the efficiency of social information processing (Hess, 2005). Practice and engagement in social activities have been shown to mitigate age-related declines in social cognition by promoting cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity (Park & Reuter-Lorenz, 2009). \n\nThe interaction between capacity and motivational resources is critical for understanding social cognitive aging. For example, older adults may experience a decline in cognitive capacity but maintain high levels of motivation, which can compensate for deficits and support resilience (Carstensen et al., 1999). Conversely, a lack of motivation can exacerbate the impact of capacity limitations, leading to increased risk of social cognitive decline. The valuation of cognitive effort is a key motivational factor that influences social cognitive engagement. Older adults may prioritize tasks that are perceived as rewarding or meaningful, which can enhance motivation and support social cognitive resilience (Hess et al., 2016). \n\nThe implications of social cognitive change in late adulthood are significant for everyday social functioning. Declines in social cognition can affect interpersonal relationships, social participation, and overall quality of life. For instance, difficulties in understanding social cues or regulating emotions can lead to social withdrawal and isolation, which are risk factors for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety (Cacioppo et al., 2010). Therefore, interventions aimed at enhancing social cognitive resilience, such as cognitive training programs or social engagement activities, are crucial for promoting healthy aging. \n\nFuture research should focus on identifying the specific mechanisms through which capacity and motivational resources interact to influence social cognitive aging. Longitudinal studies that track changes in social cognition over time and examine the impact of interventions on social cognitive outcomes are needed. Additionally, research should explore the role of technology in supporting social cognitive resilience, particularly in the context of increasing digital communication among older adults. Understanding the determinants of social cognitive aging is essential for developing strategies to enhance resilience and reduce risk, ultimately improving the quality of life for older adults.", "References": [{"title": "Aging and measures of processing speed", "authors": "Salthouse, T.
