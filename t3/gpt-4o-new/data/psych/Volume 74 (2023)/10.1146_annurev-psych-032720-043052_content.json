{"Literature Review": "The underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, particularly in male-dominated areas such as computer science and engineering, has been a persistent issue despite efforts to increase gender diversity. This literature review explores the psychological factors contributing to women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM, emphasizing the role of gender stereotypes and systemic barriers. Research indicates that person-level explanations, such as women's abilities, interests, and self-efficacy, are insufficient to account for the gender gap in STEM (Cheryan et al., 2017). Instead, gender stereotypes play a significant role in shaping women's self-concept fit, goal fit, and social fit within these fields. \n\nGender stereotypes, which associate STEM fields with masculine traits, can negatively impact women's self-concept fit, or the alignment between their self-perception and the perceived characteristics of STEM professionals (Cundiff et al., 2013). This misalignment can lead to a lack of identification with STEM careers, reducing women's interest and persistence in these fields. Furthermore, stereotypes about women's abilities in STEM can undermine their self-efficacy, or belief in their capability to succeed in STEM tasks, further discouraging their participation (Shapiro & Williams, 2012). \n\nThe concept of goal fit, or the alignment between personal goals and the perceived goals of a STEM career, is also influenced by gender stereotypes. Women may perceive STEM careers as incompatible with communal goals, such as helping others or working collaboratively, which are often more strongly endorsed by women than men (Diekman et al., 2010). This perception can deter women from pursuing STEM careers, as they may feel that their personal values and goals are not aligned with those of the field. \n\nSocial fit, or the sense of belonging within a STEM environment, is another critical factor affected by gender stereotypes. Women in male-dominated STEM fields often experience a lack of social fit due to the underrepresentation of female role models and mentors, as well as a culture that may not be inclusive of diverse perspectives (Murphy et al., 2007). This lack of social fit can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, further discouraging women's participation and retention in STEM. \n\nThese psychological barriers are compounded by systemic issues within educational and organizational cultures. For instance, the 'chilly climate' in STEM classrooms and workplaces, characterized by subtle biases and microaggressions, can create an unwelcoming environment for women (Hall & Sandler, 1982). Additionally, the lack of institutional support for work-life balance and family responsibilities can disproportionately affect women, who often bear a greater share of caregiving duties (Ceci & Williams, 2011). \n\nAddressing these barriers requires a multifaceted approach that targets institutional, interpersonal, and individual levels. At the institutional level, policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion, such as bias training and mentorship programs, can help create a more supportive environment for women in STEM (Carnes et al., 2015). Interpersonally, fostering a culture of collaboration and respect can enhance social fit and reduce the impact of gender stereotypes. At the individual level, interventions that boost women's self-efficacy and challenge stereotype-based beliefs can empower women to pursue and persist in STEM careers (Dasgupta, 2011). \n\nIn conclusion, the underrepresentation of women in STEM is a complex issue that cannot be attributed solely to individual differences in abilities or interests. Gender stereotypes and systemic barriers play a significant role in shaping women's experiences and outcomes in STEM fields. By addressing these barriers through comprehensive strategies at multiple levels, it is possible to create a more inclusive and equitable environment that supports women's full participation and advancement in STEM.", "References": [{"title": "Why are some STEM fields more gender balanced than others?", "authors": "Sapna Cheryan, Sianna A.
