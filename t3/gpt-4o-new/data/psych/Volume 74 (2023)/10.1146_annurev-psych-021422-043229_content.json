{"Literature Review": "The integration of vision and action in psychological research has historically been fragmented, with each domain often studied in isolation. This separation is largely due to the traditional scientific approach that emphasizes specialization, leading to a compartmentalized understanding of cognitive processes. However, recent studies have begun to challenge this dichotomy, revealing a more intricate relationship between vision and action than previously acknowledged. This literature review aims to explore the evolving understanding of this relationship, focusing on three pertinent theories that have emerged in recent years. \n\nThe traditional view of cognitive processing follows a linear sequence: see → decide → act. This model suggests that visual information is first processed, followed by a decision-making phase, and finally, an action is executed. However, this model has been increasingly questioned. Milner and Goodale (1995) proposed the dual-stream hypothesis, which posits that the visual system is divided into two pathways: the dorsal stream, responsible for the guidance of actions, and the ventral stream, responsible for object recognition. This theory suggests that vision for action and vision for perception are processed in parallel, rather than sequentially, challenging the traditional see → decide → act model (Milner & Goodale, 1995). \n\nFurther supporting the integration of vision and action, research by Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia (2010) on mirror neurons has provided insights into how action understanding is linked to visual perception. Mirror neurons, which fire both when an individual performs an action and when they observe the same action performed by another, suggest a direct coupling between perception and action. This finding implies that the brain's motor system is involved in understanding actions, blurring the lines between seeing and doing (Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia, 2010). \n\nAnother significant contribution to the understanding of vision and action is the theory of embodied cognition. This theory posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world. According to Wilson (2002), cognition is not just a product of the brain but is influenced by the entire body and its interactions with the environment. This perspective suggests that vision and action are not separate processes but are intertwined, with action playing a crucial role in shaping perception (Wilson, 2002). \n\nThe concept of affordances, introduced by Gibson (1979), further illustrates the connection between vision and action. Affordances refer to the potential actions that an environment offers to an individual. This concept emphasizes that perception is directly linked to action possibilities, suggesting that vision is inherently action-oriented. Gibson's ecological approach to perception challenges the traditional view by proposing that perception is not a passive process but is actively involved in guiding behavior (Gibson, 1979). \n\nRecent neuroimaging studies have provided empirical support for the integration of vision and action. For instance, research by Gallivan et al. (2011) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that brain regions traditionally associated with motor planning are also activated during visual tasks, even in the absence of overt movement. This finding suggests that the brain's motor system is engaged during visual processing, supporting the notion of a close coupling between vision and action (Gallivan et al., 2011). \n\nMoreover, the role of attention in the vision-action relationship has been explored in studies by Castiello (1996), who demonstrated that attention is not only crucial for visual processing but also for the execution of actions. This research highlights that attention serves as a bridge between perception and action, facilitating the integration of these processes (Castiello, 1996). \n\nThe integration of vision and action has significant implications for understanding consciousness. Theories such as the sensorimotor theory of consciousness, proposed by O'Regan and Noë (2001), argue that consciousness arises from the dynamic interaction between sensory inputs and motor outputs. This theory suggests that consciousness is not a passive state but is actively constructed through the interplay of perception and action (O'Regan & Noë, 2001). \n\nIn conclusion, the traditional separation of vision and action in psychological research is increasingly being challenged by findings that highlight their interdependence. Theories such as the dual-stream hypothesis, embodied cognition, and affordances, along with empirical evidence from neuroimaging and attention studies, underscore the need to rethink the relationship between vision and action. This integrated perspective not only enhances our understanding of cognitive processes but also has profound implications for the study of consciousness and attention.", "References": [{"title": "The visual brain in action", "authors": "Milner, A.
