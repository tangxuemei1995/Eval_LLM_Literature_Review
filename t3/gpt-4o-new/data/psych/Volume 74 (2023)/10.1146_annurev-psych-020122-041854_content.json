{"Literature Review": "Psychological resilience, defined as the ability to maintain or regain psychological well-being in the face of adversity, has been a subject of extensive research. The concept of resilience is complex and multifaceted, involving various psychological processes and mechanisms. This literature review aims to explore the existing research on psychological resilience, focusing on the affect-regulation framework, which integrates the stress and coping approach with the emotion and emotion-regulation approach. \n\nThe concept of resilience has evolved over time, with early research focusing on individual traits and characteristics that contribute to resilience. However, more recent studies have emphasized the dynamic and context-dependent nature of resilience, highlighting the role of environmental and social factors (Masten, 2001). Resilience is not a fixed trait but a process that involves the interaction between individuals and their environments (Luthar et al., 2000). This shift in understanding has led to the development of various theoretical frameworks to explain resilience, including the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach.\n\nThe stress and coping approach to resilience focuses on how individuals manage stress and adversity through coping strategies. This approach is grounded in the transactional model of stress and coping, which posits that stress is a result of the interaction between individuals and their environments (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Coping strategies can be problem-focused, aimed at addressing the source of stress, or emotion-focused, aimed at managing emotional responses to stress. Research has shown that effective coping strategies are associated with better psychological outcomes and greater resilience (Compas et al., 2001).\n\nHowever, the stress and coping approach has limitations. It often emphasizes cognitive processes and may overlook the role of emotions in resilience. Emotions are central to the experience of adversity and can influence how individuals perceive and respond to stress (Gross, 1998). The emotion and emotion-regulation approach to resilience addresses this limitation by focusing on how individuals regulate their emotions in response to adversity. Emotion regulation involves processes that influence the intensity, duration, and expression of emotions (Gross, 2002). Effective emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, have been linked to greater resilience and psychological well-being (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004).\n\nDespite the contributions of both approaches, they have been relatively isolated from one another, limiting our understanding of resilience. The affect-regulation framework proposed in this review aims to integrate these approaches by emphasizing the role of affect regulation in resilience. Affect regulation involves the modulation of both emotions and mood states, encompassing both cognitive and emotional processes (Koole, 2009). This framework posits that resilience involves the ability to effectively regulate affective responses to adversity, drawing on both coping strategies and emotion regulation processes.\n\nResearch supporting the affect-regulation framework highlights the importance of flexibility in affect regulation. Flexibility refers to the ability to adaptively switch between different regulatory strategies depending on the context and demands of the situation (Bonanno & Burton, 2013). Studies have shown that individuals who exhibit greater flexibility in affect regulation are more resilient and experience better psychological outcomes in the face of adversity (Aldao et al., 2015).\n\nMoreover, the affect-regulation framework underscores the role of positive emotions in resilience. Positive emotions can broaden individuals' thought-action repertoires, enhance coping resources, and promote adaptive responses to stress (Fredrickson, 2001). Research has demonstrated that positive emotions are associated with greater resilience and can buffer against the negative effects of stress (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004).\n\nIn conclusion, the affect-regulation framework provides a comprehensive understanding of psychological resilience by integrating the strengths of the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach. This framework highlights the importance of affect regulation in resilience and offers a promising direction for future research. By examining the interplay between coping strategies, emotion regulation, and positive emotions, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that underlie resilience and develop interventions to promote psychological well-being in the face of adversity.", "References": [{"title": "Ordinary magic: Resilience processes in development", "authors": "Ann S.
