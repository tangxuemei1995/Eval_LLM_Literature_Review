{"Literature Review": "Self-continuity, a concept that encapsulates the subjective sense of connection across different temporal selves, has garnered significant attention in psychological research. This construct is divided into three primary forms: past-present self-continuity, present-future self-continuity, and global self-continuity, which integrates past, present, and future selves. Each form of self-continuity plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's motivation, regulatory properties, and overall psychological well-being. \n\nPast-present self-continuity refers to the perceived connection between one's past and present selves. This form of continuity is essential for maintaining a coherent identity over time, which is crucial for psychological stability and well-being (Chandler et al., 2003). Research has shown that individuals with a strong sense of past-present self-continuity are more likely to experience higher levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction (Sokol & Serper, 2007). This continuity also influences decision-making processes, as individuals who perceive a strong connection with their past selves are more likely to make decisions that align with their long-term goals and values (Bartels & Rips, 2010).\n\nPresent-future self-continuity, on the other hand, involves the connection between one's current self and future self. This form of continuity is particularly important for motivation and goal-setting, as it encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that benefit their future selves (Hershfield et al., 2009). Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a strong sense of present-future self-continuity are more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as exercising and saving for retirement, as they perceive these actions as investments in their future well-being (Ersner-Hershfield et al., 2009).\n\nGlobal self-continuity, which encompasses the integration of past, present, and future selves, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding one's life narrative. This form of continuity is associated with a sense of purpose and meaning in life, as it allows individuals to see their lives as a coherent whole (McAdams, 2001). Research has shown that global self-continuity is linked to positive psychological outcomes, such as increased resilience and reduced anxiety (Bluck & Alea, 2008).\n\nWhile self-continuity is generally associated with positive outcomes, self-discontinuity, or the sense of disconnect among temporal selves, can also have psychological and behavioral benefits. For instance, self-discontinuity can facilitate personal growth and change by allowing individuals to break free from past constraints and adopt new identities (Wilson & Ross, 2001). This process can be particularly beneficial in the context of major life transitions, such as career changes or recovery from addiction, where a sense of discontinuity can provide the impetus for positive change (Pals, 2006).\n\nThe neural correlates of self-continuity have also been explored, with research indicating that specific brain regions are activated during self-continuity processing. The medial prefrontal cortex, for example, has been implicated in the integration of past, present, and future self-representations (D'Argembeau et al., 2008). This brain region is thought to play a key role in maintaining a coherent sense of self over time, which is essential for effective self-regulation and decision-making.\n\nDevelopmental perspectives on self-continuity suggest that this construct evolves over the lifespan, with significant changes occurring during adolescence and early adulthood (Habermas & Bluck, 2000). During these developmental stages, individuals are particularly focused on forming a coherent identity and establishing a sense of continuity across different life domains. This process is influenced by various internal and external factors, including cognitive development, social relationships, and cultural context.\n\nCultural differences in self-continuity have also been documented, with research indicating that individuals from collectivist cultures tend to emphasize collective self-continuity, or the sense of connection between one's personal identity and the broader social group (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). This form of continuity is associated with a strong sense of belonging and social support, which can buffer against stress and promote psychological well-being (Triandis, 1995).\n\nIn conclusion, self-continuity is a multifaceted construct that plays a critical role in shaping an individual's motivation, attitudes, and behavior. While self-continuity is generally associated with positive psychological outcomes, self-discontinuity can also provide opportunities for growth and change. Future research should continue to explore the complex interplay between self-continuity and various psychological and cultural factors, as well as the neural mechanisms underlying this construct.", "References": [{"title": "Personal persistence, identity development, and suicide: A study of Native and non-Native North American adolescents", "authors": "Michael J.
