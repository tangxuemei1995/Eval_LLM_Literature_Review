{"Literature Review": "The design and development of health technologies have traditionally been dominated by a technocentric approach, focusing primarily on the technical and functional aspects of devices. However, this approach often overlooks the complex socio-cultural, economic, and environmental contexts in which these technologies are deployed, leading to translational gaps and inequities in health outcomes. A shift towards human- and equity-centered design is essential to address these challenges and ensure that health technologies are accessible, acceptable, and effective for diverse populations. \n\nHuman-centered design (HCD) emphasizes the importance of understanding the needs, preferences, and behaviors of end-users in the design process. This approach has been shown to improve the usability and acceptance of health technologies by aligning them more closely with the real-world contexts in which they are used (Norman, 2013). HCD involves iterative cycles of prototyping and testing with users, allowing designers to refine their solutions based on direct feedback (Brown, 2009). This process not only enhances the functionality of the device but also ensures that it is culturally and contextually appropriate. \n\nEquity-centered design extends the principles of HCD by explicitly addressing issues of power, privilege, and access. It seeks to identify and dismantle systemic barriers that contribute to health disparities, ensuring that marginalized and underserved communities are prioritized in the design process (Costanza-Chock, 2020). This approach requires a deep understanding of the social determinants of health and the ways in which they intersect with technology use. By engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and community organizations, designers can gain insights into the unique challenges and opportunities faced by different groups (Bazzano et al., 2017). \n\nStakeholder engagement is a critical component of both human- and equity-centered design. It involves actively involving all relevant parties in the design process, from initial needs assessment to final implementation. This collaborative approach helps to ensure that the perspectives and experiences of all stakeholders are considered, leading to more inclusive and effective solutions (Sanders & Stappers, 2008). Effective stakeholder engagement requires building trust and fostering open communication, which can be facilitated through participatory design methods such as co-design workshops and focus groups (Simonsen & Robertson, 2012). \n\nContextual investigation is another key element of human- and equity-centered design. It involves examining the broader environmental, social, and economic factors that influence the use and impact of health technologies. This includes understanding the healthcare infrastructure, regulatory landscape, and cultural norms of the target population (Berg, 1999). By considering these contextual factors, designers can develop solutions that are not only technically feasible but also sustainable and scalable in the long term. \n\nSeveral frameworks have been developed to guide the integration of human- and equity-centered approaches in health technology design. The Design Justice Network Principles, for example, provide a set of guidelines for ensuring that design processes are inclusive, participatory, and accountable to the communities they serve (Costanza-Chock, 2020). Similarly, the WHO's Human-Centered Design for Global Health framework emphasizes the importance of empathy, collaboration, and iteration in the design of health interventions (World Health Organization, 2016). \n\nCase studies of successful human- and equity-centered design in health technology highlight the potential of these approaches to bridge the gap between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing. For instance, the development of a low-cost, portable ultrasound device for use in rural Africa involved extensive stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation to ensure that the device met the needs of local healthcare providers and patients (Malkin, 2007). Similarly, the design of a culturally tailored diabetes management app for Native American communities involved collaboration with tribal leaders and healthcare providers to ensure that the app was culturally relevant and accessible (Roubideaux, 2011). \n\nIncorporating human- and equity-centered approaches into biomedical engineering education is also crucial for preparing the next generation of engineers to design technologies that are equitable and impactful. This requires a shift in pedagogy to emphasize the importance of stakeholder engagement, contextual investigation, and social justice in the design process (Friedman & Hendry, 2019). By equipping students with the skills and knowledge to think beyond the device, educators can help to ensure that future health technologies are designed with the needs and contexts of diverse populations in mind.", "References": [{"title": "The Design of Everyday Things", "authors": "Donald A.
