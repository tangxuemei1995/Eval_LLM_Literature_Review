{"Literature Review": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for noninvasive monitoring of cellular and tissue metabolism, primarily through the autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors such as NADH and FAD. These cofactors play crucial roles in cellular metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and their autofluorescence properties have been extensively studied over the past several decades. The development of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques, such as multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence, has significantly advanced the field by enabling high-resolution imaging of these cofactors in living cells and tissues without the need for exogenous labels (Skala et al., 2007). \n\nNADH and FAD autofluorescence provide intrinsic contrast based on their distinct spectral and fluorescence lifetime properties. NADH, for instance, exhibits fluorescence when in its reduced form, while FAD fluoresces in its oxidized state. The optical redox ratio, defined as the ratio of FAD to NADH fluorescence intensities, serves as a quantitative measure of the cellular redox state and has been used to assess metabolic changes in various biological contexts (Chance et al., 1979). This ratio is particularly useful in distinguishing between glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, as these pathways differentially affect the levels of NADH and FAD within cells (Heikal, 2010).\n\nFluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) further enhances the capability of metabolic imaging by providing information on the microenvironment and binding states of NADH. The fluorescence lifetime of NADH is sensitive to its binding status, with free NADH exhibiting a shorter lifetime compared to protein-bound NADH. This property allows FLIM to differentiate between metabolic states and has been applied to study various physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and stem cell differentiation (Bird et al., 2005; Skala et al., 2007).\n\nDespite these advances, several challenges remain in the field of label-free optical metabolic imaging. One major challenge is the need for improved quantitative analysis methods that can accurately interpret the complex fluorescence signals from NADH and FAD. The development of robust algorithms and computational models is essential for extracting meaningful biological information from these signals (Stringari et al., 2012). Additionally, the temporal resolution of current imaging techniques needs to be enhanced to capture rapid metabolic changes in real-time, which is critical for understanding dynamic cellular processes (Datta et al., 2015).\n\nRecent progress in addressing these challenges includes the integration of advanced imaging modalities with metabolic imaging. For example, the combination of FLIM with other imaging techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography, has been explored to provide complementary information on cellular metabolism and structure (Suhling et al., 2015). Furthermore, the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in image analysis holds promise for improving the accuracy and speed of metabolic imaging data interpretation (Okkelman et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, label-free optical metabolic imaging represents a promising approach for studying cellular metabolism in a noninvasive manner. The ability to monitor NADH and FAD autofluorescence provides valuable insights into the metabolic state of cells and tissues, with potential applications in disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Continued advancements in imaging technology and data analysis methods are expected to further enhance the utility of this technique in biomedical research.", "References": [{"title": "In vivo multiphoton NADH fluorescence reveals depth-dependent keratinocyte metabolism in human skin", "authors": "Skala, Melissa C., Riching, Karen M., Gendron-Fitzpatrick, Ann, Eickhoff, Jens, Eliceiri, Kevin W., White, John G., Ramanujam, Nirmala", "journal": "Biophysical Journal", "year": "2007", "volumes": "94", "first page": "L39", "last page": "L41", "DOI": "10.1529/biophysj.107.120576"}, {"title": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH distinguishes alterations in cellular metabolism", "authors": "Bird, David K., Yan, Lei, Vrotsos, Konstantinos M., Eliceiri, Kevin W., Vaughan, Eric M., Keely, Patricia J., White, John G., Ramanujam, Nirmala", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Optics", "year": "2005", "volumes": "10", "first page": "064006", "last page": "064006", "DOI": "10.1117/1.2137336"}, {"title": "Optical redox ratio predicts response to breast cancer therapy", "authors": "Heikal, Ahmed A.", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Optics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "15", "first page": "066012", "last page": "066012", "DOI": "10.1117/1.3524304"}, {"title": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous biomarker of oxidative stress", "authors": "Chance, Britton, Schoener, Bruce, Oshino, Reiko, Itshak, F.
