{"Literature Review": "Neural plasticity is a fundamental aspect of the brain's ability to adapt to new experiences and learn new skills. In the context of brain–machine interfaces (BMIs), neural plasticity plays a crucial role in enabling the brain to adapt to artificial pathways that are introduced to restore sensorimotor functions. BMIs are designed to create artificial motor and/or sensory pathways, which necessitate the brain to learn new relationships between sensory inputs and motor outputs to achieve dexterous control. This literature review explores the role of neural plasticity in BMIs, focusing on how learning processes can be harnessed to improve BMI performance and how BMI design can influence neural plasticity.\n\nThe concept of neural plasticity in BMIs is rooted in the brain's inherent ability to reorganize itself in response to new experiences and environmental changes. This reorganization is essential for the brain to adapt to the artificial pathways introduced by BMIs. Studies have shown that neural plasticity is a key factor in the successful implementation of BMIs for restoring movement and sensation. For instance, research by Lebedev and Nicolelis (2006) demonstrated that the brain can adapt to BMIs by forming new neural connections, which are essential for the control of prosthetic devices. This adaptation is facilitated by the brain's ability to learn new sensorimotor mappings, which are critical for the effective use of BMIs.\n\nThe learning process in BMIs is influenced by several factors, including the design of the BMI itself. The design of BMIs can significantly impact the extent and nature of neural plasticity. For example, the use of closed-loop BMIs, which provide real-time feedback to the user, has been shown to enhance neural plasticity and improve BMI performance. A study by Carmena et al. (2003) highlighted the importance of feedback in promoting neural plasticity, as it allows the brain to adjust its activity based on the outcomes of motor actions. This feedback-driven learning process is crucial for the brain to develop new sensorimotor mappings and achieve dexterous control of prosthetic devices.\n\nMoreover, the integration of sensory feedback in BMIs is a critical factor in promoting neural plasticity. Sensory feedback provides the brain with information about the consequences of motor actions, which is essential for learning and adaptation. Research by O'Doherty et al. (2011) demonstrated that the inclusion of sensory feedback in BMIs can enhance neural plasticity and improve motor control. This study showed that sensory feedback allows the brain to refine its motor commands, leading to more precise and coordinated movements. The integration of sensory feedback in BMIs is therefore a key consideration in the design of bidirectional devices that aim to restore both sensory and motor functions.\n\nThe role of neural plasticity in BMIs is also influenced by the type of neural signals used to control the interface. Different types of neural signals, such as local field potentials and single-unit activity, can have varying effects on neural plasticity. Research by Fetz (2007) suggested that the use of single-unit activity, which provides high-resolution information about neural activity, can enhance neural plasticity and improve BMI performance. This is because single-unit activity allows for more precise control of prosthetic devices, which in turn promotes the development of new neural connections and sensorimotor mappings.\n\nIn addition to the type of neural signals, the training protocols used in BMIs can also impact neural plasticity. Training protocols that involve repetitive practice and task-specific training have been shown to enhance neural plasticity and improve BMI performance. A study by Jackson et al. (2006) demonstrated that repetitive practice can lead to the formation of new neural connections, which are essential for the control of prosthetic devices. This study highlighted the importance of task-specific training in promoting neural plasticity, as it allows the brain to develop new sensorimotor mappings that are specific to the tasks being performed.\n\nOverall, the role of neural plasticity in BMIs is a complex and multifaceted process that is influenced by various factors, including the design of the BMI, the type of neural signals used, and the training protocols employed. The integration of sensory feedback, the use of closed-loop systems, and task-specific training are all critical factors in promoting neural plasticity and improving BMI performance. As BMIs continue to evolve, understanding the role of neural plasticity will be essential for the development of more effective and efficient interfaces that can restore sensorimotor functions in individuals with neurological disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Brain–machine interfaces: past, present and future", "authors": "Miguel A.
