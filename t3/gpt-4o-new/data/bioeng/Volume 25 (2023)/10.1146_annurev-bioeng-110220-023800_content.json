{"Literature Review": "Electroporation is a biophysical phenomenon that involves the application of short, high-voltage electric pulses to cells, resulting in increased permeability of the cell membrane. This process facilitates the introduction of molecules such as DNA, RNA, and drugs into cells, making it a versatile tool in both research and clinical settings. The fundamental mechanism of electroporation involves the formation of transient pores in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, which allows for the passage of molecules that would otherwise be unable to penetrate the cell (Neumann et al., 1982). The efficiency and safety of electroporation depend on various parameters, including the strength and duration of the electric field, the type of cells being targeted, and the medium in which the cells are suspended (Weaver, 1995).\n\nRecent advancements in electroporation technologies have significantly expanded their applications, particularly in the field of gene therapy. Electroporation has been employed to enhance the delivery of genetic material into cells, a critical step in gene therapy protocols. This method has been shown to improve transfection efficiency and reduce cytotoxicity compared to traditional chemical transfection methods (Gehl, 2003). In particular, electroporation has been used to deliver plasmid DNA encoding therapeutic genes into muscle tissue, demonstrating potential for treating genetic disorders such as muscular dystrophy (Wells, 2004).\n\nIn addition to gene therapy, electroporation has been utilized in electrochemotherapy, a technique that combines electroporation with chemotherapy to enhance drug uptake in cancer cells. This approach has been particularly effective in treating cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors, where the application of electric pulses increases the permeability of cancer cell membranes, allowing for higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to enter the cells (Marty et al., 2006). Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of electrochemotherapy in improving local tumor control and reducing tumor size, with minimal side effects (Mir et al., 1998).\n\nThe development of microfluidic devices has further advanced electroporation technologies by enabling precise control over the electroporation process at the single-cell level. Microfluidic electroporation systems allow for the manipulation of individual cells in a controlled environment, facilitating high-throughput screening and analysis of cellular responses to electroporation (Huang and Rubinsky, 2001). These systems have been used to study the effects of electroporation on cell viability, membrane recovery, and the uptake of various molecules, providing valuable insights into the optimization of electroporation parameters for different applications (Valero et al., 2008).\n\nScaling up from single-cell to in vivo applications, electroporation has been employed in pulsed field ablation, a technique used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. Pulsed field ablation involves the application of electric pulses to cardiac tissue, creating lesions that disrupt abnormal electrical pathways and restore normal heart rhythm (Reddy et al., 2020). This method offers several advantages over traditional thermal ablation techniques, including reduced risk of collateral damage to surrounding tissues and shorter procedure times (Neven et al., 2017).\n\nThe integration of electroporation with other technologies, such as nanoparticles and CRISPR-Cas9, has opened new avenues for research and clinical applications. Nanoparticles can be used to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents during electroporation, improving targeting specificity and reducing off-target effects (Yarmush et al., 2014). Similarly, the combination of electroporation with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has shown promise in achieving precise genetic modifications in a variety of cell types, paving the way for the development of novel gene therapies (Kim et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, recent advancements in electroporation technologies have expanded their applications from bench to clinic, offering new opportunities for research and therapeutic interventions. The continued development of electroporation techniques, coupled with innovations in related fields, holds great potential for improving the delivery of therapeutic agents and enhancing the efficacy of treatments for a wide range of diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Gene transfer into mouse lyoma cells by electroporation in high electric fields", "authors": "Neumann, E., Schaefer-Ridder, M., Wang, Y., Hofschneider, P.
