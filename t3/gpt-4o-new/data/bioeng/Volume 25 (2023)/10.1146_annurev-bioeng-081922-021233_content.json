{"Literature Review": "Epitranscriptional regulation, a burgeoning field of study, has emerged as a critical area of research in understanding the complexities of gene expression and its implications in cardiovascular bioengineering. The epitranscriptome encompasses a variety of RNA modifications, including methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation, which collectively influence RNA stability, localization, translation, and degradation. These modifications are pivotal in modulating gene expression and have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes within the cardiovascular system. \n\nMethylation, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is one of the most extensively studied RNA modifications. It has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Studies have demonstrated that m6A modifications are dynamically regulated and can influence cell fate decisions, which are crucial in cardiovascular development and disease (Dominissini et al., 2012). The m6A modification is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex, including METTL3 and METTL14, and is recognized by specific reader proteins such as YTHDF1, which facilitate mRNA translation (Meyer et al., 2015). In the context of cardiovascular diseases, m6A modifications have been linked to the regulation of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets (Dorn et al., 2019).\n\nPseudouridylation, the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine, is another prevalent RNA modification that enhances RNA stability and function. This modification has been implicated in the regulation of splicing and translation, processes that are essential for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (Carlile et al., 2014). Pseudouridylation is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases, and its dysregulation has been associated with various cardiovascular pathologies, including atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (Li et al., 2015).\n\nDeamination, particularly the conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I editing), is mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). This modification can alter codon identity, splicing, and RNA secondary structure, thereby influencing gene expression and protein function. A-to-I editing has been shown to play a role in the adaptive response of the cardiovascular system to stress and injury, suggesting its importance in cardiovascular regeneration and repair (Picardi et al., 2015).\n\nHydroxylation, although less studied, is another modification that has been identified in various RNA species. It is catalyzed by the TET family of enzymes and has been implicated in the regulation of RNA stability and translation. Recent studies suggest that RNA hydroxylation may play a role in the response to hypoxic conditions, which are common in cardiovascular diseases (Zhang et al., 2016).\n\nThe elucidation of these epitranscriptional modifications has been facilitated by advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools. Techniques such as m6A-seq and pseudouridine-seq have enabled the comprehensive mapping of RNA modifications across the transcriptome, providing insights into their functional roles in cardiovascular biology (Linder et al., 2015). These tools have also been instrumental in identifying novel RNA modifications and their associated regulatory networks, paving the way for the development of targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn the realm of cardiovascular bioengineering, understanding the epitranscriptome landscape offers exciting opportunities for innovation. For instance, the modulation of RNA modifications could be harnessed to engineer tissues with enhanced regenerative capacity or to develop biomaterials that mimic the dynamic nature of the cardiovascular environment. Furthermore, the integration of epitranscriptomic data with other omics approaches could lead to the identification of novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (Roundtree et al., 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, epitranscriptional regulation represents a critical layer of gene expression control with significant implications for cardiovascular physiology and pathology. The continued exploration of RNA modifications and their regulatory mechanisms holds promise for advancing our understanding of cardiovascular biology and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. As the field of cardiovascular bioengineering continues to evolve, the integration of epitranscriptomic insights will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the future of cardiovascular research and therapy.", "References": [{"title": "Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq", "authors": "Dominissini, D., Moshitch-Moshkovitz, S., Schwartz, S., Salmon-Divon, M., Ungar, L., Osenberg, S., Cesarkas, K., Jacob-Hirsch, J., Amariglio, N., Rechavi, G.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2012", "volumes": "485", "first page": "201", "last page": "206", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11112"}, {"title": "Comprehensive analysis of mRNA methylation reveals enrichment in 3' UTRs and near stop codons", "authors": "Meyer, K.
