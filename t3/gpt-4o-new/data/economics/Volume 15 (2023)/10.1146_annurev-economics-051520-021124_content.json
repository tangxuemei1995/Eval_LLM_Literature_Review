{"Literature Review": "Partial identification has emerged as a crucial concept in econometrics and statistics, addressing the limitations of point identification in empirical research. The concept of partial identification is rooted in the recognition that, in many practical scenarios, the exact value of a parameter cannot be determined due to data limitations and model assumptions. Instead, researchers aim to characterize the identified set, which encompasses all parameter values consistent with the observed data and the underlying model assumptions. This literature review explores the general frameworks for partial identification and highlights recent advancements in the field. \n\nThe foundational work on partial identification can be traced back to the seminal contributions of Charles F. Manski, who introduced the concept of bounds analysis as a method to deal with incomplete data and model uncertainty (Manski, 2003). Manski's work laid the groundwork for understanding how to derive bounds on parameters of interest when point identification is not feasible. His approach involves using weak assumptions to construct bounds that are robust to model misspecification and data limitations. This framework has been widely adopted and extended in various contexts, including treatment effects, policy evaluation, and structural models. \n\nOne of the key developments in partial identification is the use of set identification, which involves characterizing the set of parameter values that are consistent with the observed data and model assumptions. This approach has been particularly useful in dealing with endogeneity and measurement error, where traditional identification strategies may fail. For instance, Tamer (2003) introduced a framework for set identification in models with multiple equilibria, demonstrating how partial identification can provide informative bounds on parameters even when the model is not fully specified. \n\nRecent advancements in partial identification have focused on incorporating additional information to tighten the identified set. One such approach is the use of shape restrictions, which impose constraints on the functional form of the model based on economic theory or prior knowledge. For example, Blundell, Chen, and Kristensen (2007) explored the use of shape restrictions in nonparametric regression models to improve the precision of partial identification. By incorporating monotonicity and concavity constraints, they were able to derive tighter bounds on the parameters of interest. \n\nAnother significant development in partial identification is the use of optimizing behavior to inform the identification process. This approach leverages the assumption that agents optimize their behavior according to some objective function, which can provide additional structure to the model. For instance, Chesher (2010) examined the role of optimizing behavior in models of consumer demand, showing how it can be used to derive informative bounds on price elasticities. By incorporating economic theory into the identification process, researchers can obtain more precise estimates of the parameters of interest. \n\nThe literature on partial identification has also explored the use of instrumental variables (IV) to address endogeneity issues. While traditional IV methods rely on strong assumptions for point identification, partial identification allows for weaker assumptions and more robust inference. Imbens and Angrist (1994) introduced the concept of local average treatment effects (LATE), which provides a partial identification framework for estimating causal effects in the presence of endogenous treatment assignment. This approach has been widely applied in empirical research, particularly in the evaluation of social programs and policy interventions. \n\nIn addition to these methodological advancements, recent research has focused on the development of computational tools for conducting partial identification analysis. These tools facilitate the implementation of partial identification methods in practice, allowing researchers to derive bounds and conduct sensitivity analysis more efficiently. For example, Chernozhukov, Hong, and Tamer (2007) developed a computational framework for partial identification in structural models, providing a practical tool for applied researchers. \n\nOverall, the literature on partial identification has made significant strides in addressing the challenges of incomplete data and model uncertainty. By characterizing the identified set and incorporating additional information through shape restrictions, optimizing behavior, and instrumental variables, researchers can obtain more informative and robust estimates of parameters of interest. As the field continues to evolve, further advancements in computational methods and the integration of economic theory are likely to enhance the applicability and precision of partial identification in empirical research.", "References": [{"title": "Partial Identification of Probability Distributions", "authors": "Charles F.
