{"Literature Review": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator has been a cornerstone in economic modeling due to its analytical tractability and the ability to capture substitution effects between goods and factors. However, its knife-edge properties often limit its applicability in more nuanced economic scenarios, necessitating the exploration of non-CES aggregators. This literature review delves into various classes of non-CES aggregators, examining their theoretical underpinnings, applications, and the trade-offs they present compared to the CES framework. \n\nOne of the primary limitations of the CES aggregator is its assumption of constant elasticity of substitution, which implies that the substitution effect between any two goods or factors remains constant regardless of their relative prices or quantities. This assumption can be overly restrictive in real-world scenarios where substitution elasticity may vary. Non-CES aggregators, such as the translog and the generalized Leontief functions, offer more flexibility by allowing substitution elasticity to change with the level of inputs or outputs (Christensen et al., 1973). The translog function, in particular, has been widely used in empirical studies due to its second-order approximation to any twice-differentiable production function, providing a more flexible functional form than CES (Berndt & Christensen, 1973).\n\nAnother class of non-CES aggregators is the implicit additivity models, which relax the additivity assumption inherent in CES functions. These models, such as the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) developed by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), allow for non-linear Engel curves and varying income elasticities, making them suitable for analyzing consumer behavior with nonhomothetic preferences. The AIDS model has been instrumental in empirical studies of consumer demand, providing insights into how consumption patterns change with income levels (Deaton & Muellbauer, 1980).\n\nIn the context of production functions, non-CES aggregators like the variable elasticity of substitution (VES) and the constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functions have been explored. The VES function allows for variable substitution elasticity, which can capture the varying ease of substituting between inputs as their relative prices change (Sato & Koizumi, 1973). On the other hand, the CET function is used to model situations where outputs can be transformed into each other at a constant rate, providing a dual perspective to the CES function in production analysis (Powell & Gruen, 1968).\n\nThe concept of gross substitutes and complements is another area where non-CES aggregators provide valuable insights. While the CES function assumes that all goods are gross substitutes, non-CES models can accommodate both gross substitutes and complements, offering a more realistic representation of consumer preferences and production technologies. For instance, the quadratic expenditure system (QES) allows for the possibility of goods being either substitutes or complements, depending on the context (Howe, 1975).\n\nNon-CES aggregators also play a crucial role in international trade theory, where the assumption of identical substitution elasticity across countries and goods can be unrealistic. Models such as the Armington aggregator, which allows for different substitution elasticities between domestic and foreign goods, have been pivotal in trade analysis (Armington, 1969). This flexibility is essential for understanding trade patterns and the impact of trade policies on different sectors.\n\nDespite their advantages, non-CES aggregators come with their own set of challenges. The increased flexibility often comes at the cost of analytical tractability, making it difficult to derive closed-form solutions or conduct comparative statics. Moreover, the estimation of non-CES models can be computationally intensive, requiring sophisticated econometric techniques and large datasets (Diewert, 1974). Nonetheless, the trade-off between flexibility and tractability is often justified by the richer insights these models provide into economic behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, non-CES aggregators offer a valuable extension to the traditional CES framework, providing the flexibility needed to capture more complex economic phenomena. By relaxing certain assumptions of the CES function, these models allow for variable substitution elasticities, nonhomothetic preferences, and the coexistence of gross substitutes and complements. While they present challenges in terms of estimation and analytical complexity, their ability to provide a more nuanced understanding of economic interactions makes them indispensable tools in economic research.", "References": [{"title": "Transcendental Logarithmic Production Frontiers", "authors": "Laurits R.
