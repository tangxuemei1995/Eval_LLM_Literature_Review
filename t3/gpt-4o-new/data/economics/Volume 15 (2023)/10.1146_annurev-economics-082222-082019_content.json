{"Literature Review": "The trade relations between the United States and China have been a focal point of economic research over the past two decades, primarily due to the profound impact these relations have had on global trade dynamics. The 'China shock,' a term coined to describe the rapid increase in Chinese exports following China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, has been a significant area of study. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) were among the first to quantify the impact of the China shock on the US labor market, finding that regions with industries more exposed to Chinese imports experienced greater declines in manufacturing employment. This finding has been corroborated by subsequent studies, which have also highlighted the heterogeneous effects of the China shock across different sectors and regions (Pierce & Schott, 2016). \n\nThe measurement of the China shock has been a critical aspect of understanding its economic effects. Researchers have employed various methods, including input-output linkages and dynamic spatial economics models, to capture the complex interactions between trade and labor markets. For instance, Acemoglu et al. (2016) utilized a model that incorporates input-output linkages to demonstrate how the China shock propagated through the US economy, affecting not only directly competing industries but also those indirectly linked through supply chains. This approach has provided a more nuanced understanding of the China shock's impact, revealing that the aggregate gains from trade were accompanied by significant distributional consequences. \n\nThe recent US–China trade war, initiated in 2018, has added another layer of complexity to the analysis of US–China trade relations. The trade war, characterized by the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of goods, has been studied using various empirical methods to assess its economic effects. Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019) employed a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of tariffs on US prices and welfare, finding that the tariffs led to significant welfare losses for US consumers without achieving the intended policy objectives of reducing the trade deficit or reviving domestic manufacturing. \n\nThe trade war's effects on employment have been less pronounced than initially anticipated. Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) analyzed the employment effects of the trade war using a general equilibrium model and found that while there were some localized employment gains in protected industries, these were offset by losses in other sectors, resulting in a negligible net effect on overall employment. This finding aligns with the broader literature on trade protectionism, which suggests that while tariffs can provide temporary relief to certain industries, they often lead to inefficiencies and welfare losses in the long run (Irwin, 2019). \n\nOne of the key questions in the literature is whether the trade war has reversed the distributional effects of the China shock. The evidence suggests that it has not. The tariffs have not significantly altered the competitive landscape for US manufacturing, nor have they reversed the long-term decline in manufacturing employment attributed to technological change and other structural factors (Bown, 2020). Instead, the trade war has highlighted the limitations of using trade policy as a tool for addressing complex economic challenges, such as income inequality and regional disparities. \n\nIn summary, the literature on US–China trade relations over the past two decades provides several important lessons. First, while the aggregate gains from trade with China have been substantial, they have been unevenly distributed, creating both winners and losers. Second, the decline in US manufacturing employment during this period cannot be solely attributed to China's trade expansion; other factors, such as automation and global supply chain dynamics, have played significant roles. Finally, the recent trade war has underscored the challenges of using protectionist measures to achieve economic objectives, as it has resulted in welfare losses without reversing the adverse distributional effects of the China shock. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive policy approaches that address the root causes of economic dislocation and inequality, rather than relying solely on trade policy interventions.", "References": [{"title": "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States", "authors": "David H.
