{"Literature Review": "Cognitive limitations have long been a subject of interest in behavioral economics, particularly in understanding how they lead to suboptimal decision-making. The concept of contingent thinking, or the ability to consider and plan for various possible future scenarios, is central to this discussion. Failures of contingent thinking (FCT) have been identified as a significant mechanism through which cognitive limitations manifest, leading to failures in profit maximization and other suboptimal behaviors. This literature review explores the experimental findings on FCT, its theoretical underpinnings, and its implications in applied environments. \n\nThe concept of contingent thinking is rooted in the broader framework of cognitive limitations, which has been extensively studied in behavioral economics. Simon (1955) introduced the notion of bounded rationality, suggesting that individuals are limited in their cognitive capabilities and thus rely on heuristics rather than optimal decision-making processes. This foundational work laid the groundwork for understanding how cognitive limitations can lead to systematic deviations from rational behavior. Building on this, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) developed prospect theory, which further elucidated how cognitive biases and heuristics influence decision-making under uncertainty. These seminal works highlight the importance of considering cognitive limitations in economic models and provide a theoretical basis for understanding FCT. \n\nRecent experimental studies have documented FCT as a specific cognitive limitation that impairs decision-making. For instance, Camerer et al. (2004) conducted experiments demonstrating that individuals often fail to consider all possible contingencies when making decisions, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This failure is particularly evident in complex decision-making environments where the number of potential contingencies is large. The experiments showed that even when individuals are aware of the contingencies, they often fail to integrate this information into their decision-making processes effectively. This finding is consistent with the notion of cognitive overload, where the sheer volume of information exceeds an individual's processing capacity, leading to errors in judgment. \n\nThe sure-thing principle, introduced by Savage (1954), is a key theoretical concept related to FCT. It posits that if an individual prefers one action over another in one scenario and also in the opposite scenario, they should prefer that action regardless of the scenario. However, FCT often leads to violations of the sure-thing principle, as individuals fail to consider all relevant contingencies. This violation has been empirically observed in various experimental settings, suggesting that FCT is a pervasive issue in decision-making. \n\nThe implications of FCT extend beyond theoretical models and experimental settings to real-world applications. In financial markets, for example, investors often fail to account for all possible market contingencies, leading to suboptimal investment strategies and financial losses. Barberis and Thaler (2003) highlighted how cognitive limitations, including FCT, contribute to market anomalies such as the equity premium puzzle and excess volatility. Similarly, in organizational settings, managers may fail to consider all potential outcomes of strategic decisions, resulting in suboptimal business performance. \n\nAddressing FCT requires a multifaceted approach that includes both theoretical advancements and practical interventions. Theoretically, models of decision-making need to incorporate cognitive limitations explicitly to better predict and explain observed behaviors. This involves integrating insights from psychology and neuroscience to develop more comprehensive models of human cognition. Practically, interventions such as decision aids and training programs can help individuals improve their contingent thinking abilities. For instance, providing structured decision-making frameworks and tools can help individuals systematically consider all relevant contingencies, thereby reducing the likelihood of FCT. \n\nIn conclusion, failures of contingent thinking represent a significant cognitive limitation that impairs decision-making across various domains. Experimental evidence highlights the prevalence of FCT and its impact on suboptimal behavior, while theoretical work provides a framework for understanding its underlying mechanisms. Addressing FCT requires both theoretical and practical efforts to enhance individuals' contingent thinking abilities and improve decision-making outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice", "authors": "Herbert A.
