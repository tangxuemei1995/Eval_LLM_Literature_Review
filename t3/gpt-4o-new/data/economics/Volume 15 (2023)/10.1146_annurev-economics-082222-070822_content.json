{"Literature Review": "Antitrust reform has been a subject of intense debate and scrutiny, particularly in the context of the digital economy where market power is increasingly concentrated. The dissatisfaction with existing antitrust enforcement mechanisms has led to significant legislative efforts, particularly in the European Union, which has enacted comprehensive legislation aimed at addressing perceived limitations in antitrust enforcement. This has, in turn, influenced proposals to amend US antitrust laws, with a focus on firms that dominate the digital economy (Cunningham et al., 2021). The European Union's approach has been characterized by a proactive stance in regulating digital markets, as evidenced by the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to impose obligations on gatekeeper platforms to ensure fair competition (Crémer et al., 2019). This legislative framework has been seen as a model for other jurisdictions, including the United States, where there is a growing consensus on the need for antitrust reform to address the challenges posed by digital monopolies (Khan, 2017). \n\nIn the United States, the debate around antitrust reform has been shaped by the recognition that market power has increased in most advanced economies, but this has not been uniformly associated with higher prices or lower productivity (Autor et al., 2020). This has led to calls for a more nuanced approach to antitrust enforcement that goes beyond traditional metrics of consumer welfare, such as price and output, to consider broader economic and social impacts (Stucke & Grunes, 2016). The current antitrust framework in the US has been criticized for being excessively deferential to antitrust defendants, particularly in cases involving digital platforms, where network effects and data-driven business models create unique challenges for competition policy (Wu, 2018). \n\nProposed reforms in the US have included measures to tighten antitrust enforcement more generally, with a focus on addressing the concentration and exercise of economic power. These reforms have been informed by a growing body of economic research that highlights the potential benefits of antitrust interventions for consumers, including lower prices, increased innovation, and improved market efficiency (Shapiro, 2019). However, there is also a recognition that many of the proposed reforms include prohibitions or obligations that depart from traditional antitrust principles, creating potential risks for consumer welfare (Hovenkamp, 2020). For instance, some proposals advocate for structural remedies, such as breaking up dominant firms, which could have unintended consequences for market dynamics and innovation (Eisenach & Lenard, 2019). \n\nThe debate over antitrust reform is further complicated by the global nature of digital markets, which requires coordination and cooperation among different jurisdictions to ensure effective enforcement. The European Union's experience with antitrust enforcement in the digital economy provides valuable lessons for other countries, particularly in terms of balancing the need for regulation with the potential risks of stifling innovation (Ezrachi & Stucke, 2016). The EU's approach has been characterized by a willingness to impose significant fines and remedies on dominant firms, as seen in cases against Google and Apple, which have set important precedents for antitrust enforcement globally (Geradin, 2020). \n\nIn conclusion, antitrust reform is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of the economic and social impacts of market power. While there is a clear need for reform to address the challenges posed by digital monopolies, it is important to ensure that any changes to the antitrust framework are grounded in sound economic principles and do not inadvertently harm consumer welfare. The experiences of the European Union and other jurisdictions provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and risks of different approaches to antitrust enforcement, and these should inform ongoing debates and legislative efforts in the United States and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Killer Acquisitions", "authors": "Colleen Cunningham, Florian Ederer, Song Ma", "journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "129", "first page": "649", "last page": "702", "DOI": "10.1086/712506"}, {"title": "Competition Policy for the Digital Era", "authors": "Jacques Crémer, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, Heike Schweitzer", "journal": "European Commission", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox", "authors": "Lina M.
