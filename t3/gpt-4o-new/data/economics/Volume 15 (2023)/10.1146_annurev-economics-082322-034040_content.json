{"Literature Review": "The concept of Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) has gained significant attention in recent years as a mechanism to address carbon leakage and ensure that international trade does not undermine domestic climate policies. Carbon leakage occurs when production shifts to countries with less stringent climate policies, leading to an overall increase in global greenhouse gas emissions. This phenomenon poses a challenge to countries that have implemented carbon pricing mechanisms, as it can erode the environmental benefits of such policies and affect the competitiveness of domestic industries (Böhringer et al., 2012). \n\nThe rationale for BCAs is rooted in the need to level the playing field between domestic producers subject to carbon pricing and foreign producers who are not. By imposing a carbon price on imported goods equivalent to that faced by domestic producers, BCAs aim to prevent carbon leakage and protect domestic industries from unfair competition (Fischer & Fox, 2012). This approach is akin to an export subsidy, as it effectively neutralizes the cost advantage that foreign producers might have due to lax environmental regulations (Cosbey et al., 2019). \n\nThe design of BCAs is complex and must balance several factors, including environmental effectiveness, economic competitiveness, technical feasibility, and compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Environmental effectiveness refers to the ability of BCAs to reduce carbon leakage and contribute to global emission reductions. Studies have shown that BCAs can be effective in reducing leakage, particularly when applied to energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors (Monjon & Quirion, 2011). However, the environmental benefits of BCAs depend on their design, including the scope of products covered and the method of calculating the carbon content of imports (Dröge, 2009). \n\nEconomic competitiveness is another critical consideration in the design of BCAs. While BCAs can protect domestic industries from unfair competition, they can also lead to trade tensions and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The economic impact of BCAs on domestic industries and consumers depends on various factors, including the elasticity of demand for imported goods and the ability of domestic producers to pass on the costs of carbon pricing to consumers (Böhringer et al., 2012). \n\nTechnical feasibility is a significant challenge in implementing BCAs. Accurate measurement of the carbon content of imports is essential for the effectiveness of BCAs, but this can be technically challenging due to differences in production processes and data availability across countries (Cosbey et al., 2019). Moreover, the administrative costs of implementing BCAs can be substantial, particularly for countries with complex trade relationships and a wide range of imported products (Fischer & Fox, 2012). \n\nCompliance with WTO rules is a crucial consideration in the design of BCAs. The WTO allows for trade measures to protect the environment, but such measures must not discriminate between domestic and foreign producers or between different trading partners. BCAs must be designed to ensure that they are consistent with these principles, which can be challenging given the diversity of national climate policies and the potential for trade disputes (Dröge, 2009). \n\nAn import-limited BCA, which applies only to imports and not to exports, is more effective in reducing leakage than free emissions allowances, as it directly targets the carbon content of imported goods (Monjon & Quirion, 2011). However, this approach does not preserve the export competitiveness of the country imposing it, as domestic producers still face higher production costs due to carbon pricing. To address this issue, some studies have suggested the use of climate clubs, where countries with similar climate policies agree to implement BCAs and coordinate their trade measures to prevent leakage and protect competitiveness (Nordhaus, 2015). \n\nIn conclusion, BCAs represent a promising tool for addressing carbon leakage and ensuring that international trade supports, rather than undermines, domestic climate policies. However, their design and implementation pose significant challenges, including the need to balance environmental effectiveness, economic competitiveness, technical feasibility, and WTO compliance. Further research is needed to explore the potential of BCAs in different sectors and regions, as well as their interaction with other climate policy instruments.", "References": [{"title": "The role of border carbon adjustment in unilateral climate policy: Overview of an emerging policy instrument", "authors": "Christoph Böhringer, Edward J.
