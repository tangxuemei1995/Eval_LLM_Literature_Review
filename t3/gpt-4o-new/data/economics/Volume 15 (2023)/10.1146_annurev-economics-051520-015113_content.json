{"Literature Review": "Climate change is a pressing global issue that necessitates a multifaceted approach to mitigation and adaptation. The economic policies required to combat climate change are diverse, encompassing carbon pricing, green research and development (R&D) support, standards, bans, and targeted subsidies. This literature review explores the effectiveness and challenges of these policies, drawing on theoretical and empirical research. \n\nCarbon pricing is widely regarded as a cornerstone of climate policy. It internalizes the external costs of carbon emissions, providing economic incentives for emission reductions. Theoretical models suggest that carbon pricing is an efficient tool for reducing emissions (Nordhaus, 2007). Empirical studies have shown that carbon pricing can lead to significant emission reductions without adverse economic impacts (Metcalf & Stock, 2020). However, the implementation of carbon pricing faces political and social challenges, including concerns about competitiveness and equity (Carattini et al., 2018). To address these issues, carbon border adjustments have been proposed as a complementary measure to prevent carbon leakage and protect domestic industries (Mehling et al., 2019).\n\nGreen R&D support is another critical component of the policy portfolio needed to address climate change. Innovation in clean technologies is essential for achieving long-term emission reductions. Public support for green R&D can help overcome market failures associated with knowledge spillovers and the high risk of early-stage innovation (Popp, 2019). Empirical evidence suggests that public R&D funding can stimulate private investment in clean technologies, leading to technological advancements and cost reductions (Nemet, 2009). However, the effectiveness of R&D support depends on the design of the policy, including the selection of technologies and the balance between basic and applied research (Fischer & Newell, 2008).\n\nIn addition to carbon pricing and green R&D support, other policies such as standards, bans, and targeted subsidies play a role in climate change mitigation. Standards and bans can provide clear signals to markets and consumers, driving the adoption of cleaner technologies (Gillingham & Stock, 2018). For example, fuel economy standards have been effective in reducing emissions from the transportation sector (Klier & Linn, 2012). However, these policies can be inflexible and may lead to unintended consequences, such as the rebound effect, where efficiency gains lead to increased consumption (Sorrell, 2009).\n\nTargeted subsidies can also support the transition to a low-carbon economy by reducing the cost of clean technologies and encouraging their adoption. Subsidies for renewable energy have been successful in increasing the deployment of wind and solar power (Borenstein, 2012). However, subsidies can be costly and may lead to market distortions if not carefully designed and implemented (Jenkins, 2014). Moreover, the phase-out of subsidies can be politically challenging, as it may face resistance from vested interests (Aldy, 2013).\n\nThe coherence and coordination of these policies are crucial for their effectiveness. Incoherent policies can lead to conflicting signals and reduce the overall impact of climate policy (Goulder & Parry, 2008). For example, subsidies for fossil fuels can undermine the effectiveness of carbon pricing and other climate policies (Coady et al., 2017). Therefore, a comprehensive and integrated approach is needed to ensure that policies are aligned and mutually reinforcing.\n\nIn conclusion, a portfolio of economic policies is needed to effectively combat climate change. Carbon pricing and green R&D support are essential tools, but their implementation can be improved through complementary measures such as carbon border adjustments. Standards, bans, and targeted subsidies also have a role to play, but their design and implementation require careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences. The coherence and coordination of these policies are critical for maximizing their effectiveness and achieving long-term emission reductions.", "References": [{"title": "A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies", "authors": "William D.
