{"Literature Review": "Gender differences in negotiation have been a focal point in understanding the persistent gender pay gap in labor markets. Historically, women have been found to negotiate less frequently and less aggressively than men, which has been linked to disparities in salary and career advancement (Babcock & Laschever, 2003). This literature review examines various interventions designed to address these differences and evaluates their effectiveness in reducing the gender pay gap. \n\nOne of the earliest approaches to addressing gender differences in negotiation was through negotiation training programs aimed at encouraging women to 'lean in' and negotiate more assertively. These programs were inspired by the work of Babcock and Laschever (2003), who highlighted the importance of negotiation in achieving career success. However, subsequent research has shown mixed results regarding the effectiveness of such training. For instance, Bowles et al. (2007) found that while negotiation training can increase women's propensity to negotiate, it does not necessarily lead to better outcomes, as women often face social backlash for negotiating assertively. This backlash can manifest as negative evaluations from employers, which can undermine the benefits of negotiation training (Amanatullah & Morris, 2010).\n\nIn response to these challenges, there has been a shift towards interventions that focus on changing the institutional context of negotiations rather than solely focusing on changing women's behavior. One such intervention is the implementation of policies that ban salary history inquiries. Research by Bessen et al. (2020) suggests that these bans can help reduce the gender pay gap by preventing employers from anchoring salary offers based on previous earnings, which are often lower for women. Similarly, wage transparency policies have been shown to reduce gender pay disparities by making salary information more accessible and allowing employees to identify and challenge inequities (Baker et al., 2019).\n\nAnother institutional intervention involves banning negotiations altogether for certain positions or within certain organizations. This approach aims to eliminate the negotiation process as a source of gender disparity. Leibbrandt and List (2015) found that when negotiations were banned, the gender pay gap was reduced, as men and women received the same starting salaries. However, this approach has been criticized for potentially stifling individual agency and failing to address underlying biases that contribute to gender disparities in the workplace.\n\nWhile these institutional changes show promise, they are not without unintended consequences. For example, banning salary history inquiries may lead employers to rely more heavily on other biased indicators, such as education or previous job titles, which can perpetuate existing disparities (Kim, 2020). Similarly, wage transparency can lead to dissatisfaction and decreased morale if not implemented carefully, as employees may react negatively to perceived inequities (Card et al., 2012).\n\nThe shift from 'fixing the women' to 'fixing the institutions' reflects a broader understanding of the structural factors that contribute to gender disparities in negotiation outcomes. This shift is supported by evidence suggesting that institutional interventions are more effective in promoting pay equity than individual-focused strategies (Bohnet, 2016). However, it is crucial to consider the context in which these interventions are implemented, as their effectiveness can vary depending on organizational culture and industry norms.\n\nIn conclusion, while gender differences in negotiation contribute to the gender pay gap, interventions aimed at reducing these differences must be carefully designed and implemented to avoid unintended consequences. Institutional changes, such as banning salary history inquiries and promoting wage transparency, show promise in reducing gender disparities, but they must be accompanied by efforts to address underlying biases and ensure equitable outcomes for all employees. Future research should continue to explore the complex interplay between individual behavior and institutional context in shaping negotiation outcomes and work towards developing comprehensive strategies that promote gender equity in the workplace.", "References": [{"title": "Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide", "authors": "Linda Babcock, Sara Laschever", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "When Gender Changes the Negotiation", "authors": "Hannah Riley Bowles, Linda Babcock, Lei Lai", "journal": "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "93", "first page": "994", "last page": "1012", "DOI": "10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.994"}, {"title": "Negotiating Gender Roles: Gender Differences in Assertive Negotiating Are Mediated by Women's Fear of Backlash and Attenuated When Negotiating on Behalf of Others", "authors": "Joyce E.
