{"Literature Review": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a condition characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium balance, leading to hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular and renal damage. It is recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension, yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated (Funder et al., 2016). The prevalence of PA among hypertensive patients is estimated to be around 5-10%, with higher rates observed in patients with resistant hypertension (Mulatero et al., 2013). The pathophysiology of PA involves the overproduction of aldosterone, which leads to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and increased blood volume, contributing to hypertension and subsequent target organ damage (Young, 2019).\n\nThe cardiovascular implications of PA are significant, with patients exhibiting a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infarction compared to those with essential hypertension (Milliez et al., 2005). The kidneys are also adversely affected, with PA patients showing a higher prevalence of albuminuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Sechi et al., 2006). These complications underscore the importance of effective management strategies for PA to mitigate the risk of organ damage.\n\nSurgical intervention, specifically adrenalectomy, is the treatment of choice for patients with unilateral PA, as it can lead to normalization of aldosterone levels and resolution of hypertension in many cases (Funder et al., 2016). However, not all patients are candidates for surgery due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or other contraindications, and some patients may decline surgical intervention. In such cases, medical management with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is the primary therapeutic approach.\n\nSteroidal MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have been the cornerstone of medical treatment for PA. These agents work by blocking the effects of aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor, thereby reducing sodium retention and lowering blood pressure (Funder et al., 2016). Spironolactone, the most commonly used MRA, has been shown to effectively control blood pressure and reduce left ventricular mass in PA patients (Rossi et al., 2006). However, its use is often limited by side effects such as gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and hyperkalemia, which can lead to poor adherence and discontinuation of therapy (Funder et al., 2016).\n\nEplerenone, a more selective MRA, is associated with a lower incidence of side effects compared to spironolactone, but it is also less potent and may require higher doses to achieve similar blood pressure control (Funder et al., 2016). Despite their efficacy, steroidal MRAs are underprescribed, possibly due to concerns about side effects and the need for regular monitoring of serum potassium levels (Funder et al., 2016).\n\nThe development of nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone, offers a promising alternative for the management of PA. These agents have been shown to reduce adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease and are generally better tolerated than steroidal MRAs (Bakris et al., 2020). Finerenone, in particular, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing albuminuria and slowing the progression of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting potential benefits for PA patients with renal involvement (Bakris et al., 2020).\n\nWhile the blood pressure-lowering effects of nonsteroidal MRAs in PA are not yet fully established, their ability to mitigate target organ damage may provide a valuable therapeutic option for patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery or tolerate steroidal MRAs (Bakris et al., 2020). Further research is needed to elucidate the role of nonsteroidal MRAs in the management of PA and to determine their long-term effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, PA is a prevalent and underrecognized cause of secondary hypertension with significant implications for cardiovascular and renal health. While surgical intervention remains the preferred treatment for unilateral PA, MRAs play a crucial role in the medical management of patients who are not surgical candidates. The advent of nonsteroidal MRAs offers a promising alternative with potentially fewer side effects, but further studies are required to fully understand their impact on blood pressure and target organ protection in PA patients.", "References": [{"title": "The management of primary aldosteronism: case detection, diagnosis, and treatment: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline", "authors": "Funder, John W., Carey, Robert M., Mantero, Franco, Murad, M.
