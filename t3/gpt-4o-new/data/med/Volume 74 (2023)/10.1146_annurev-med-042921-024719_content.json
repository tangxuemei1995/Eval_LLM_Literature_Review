{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment for relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies, particularly lymphomas. The therapy involves engineering T cells to express CARs that target specific antigens on tumor cells, leading to their destruction. However, despite the initial success, a significant challenge remains: the relapse of disease due to antigen loss, particularly the loss of CD19, a common target in B cell malignancies (Maude et al., 2014). This phenomenon of antigen escape necessitates the development of strategies to overcome it, with multispecific CAR T cells being a promising approach. \n\nThe loss of CD19 expression on tumor cells is a well-documented mechanism of relapse post-CAR T cell therapy. This antigen loss can occur through various mechanisms, including alternative splicing, mutations, or lineage switching (Fisher et al., 2017). The clinical implications of CD19-negative relapse are profound, as it limits the efficacy of CD19-targeted therapies and necessitates alternative therapeutic strategies. Identifying patients at higher risk of CD19 loss remains a critical area of research, as it could inform treatment decisions and improve outcomes (Ruella et al., 2018).\n\nTo address the challenge of antigen loss, researchers have developed CAR T cells targeting multiple antigens. Bispecific CARs, such as those targeting CD19/20 and CD19/22, have shown promise in preclinical studies. These CARs are designed to recognize and attack tumor cells that have lost CD19 expression, thereby reducing the likelihood of relapse (Shah et al., 2020). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that bispecific CAR T cells can effectively target and kill CD19-negative lymphoma cells, suggesting a potential strategy to overcome antigen escape (Wang et al., 2020).\n\nClinical trials have begun to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multispecific CAR T cells. Phase I trials of CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CARs have shown encouraging results, with evidence of cytotoxicity against CD19-negative cells and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse (Fried et al., 2021). These trials suggest that multispecific CAR T cells can provide a more durable response by preventing antigen escape. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of these therapies remain to be fully elucidated.\n\nThe selection of target antigens for multispecific CAR T cells is a critical consideration. Ideally, the chosen antigens should be highly expressed on tumor cells and minimally expressed on normal tissues to reduce off-target effects. Additionally, the antigens should be less prone to downregulation or loss, ensuring sustained efficacy of the therapy (Majzner et al., 2019). The development of trispecific CARs, which target three different antigens, is also being explored as a means to further reduce the risk of antigen escape and improve therapeutic outcomes (Hegde et al., 2020).\n\nThe design of CAR constructs is another important factor influencing the success of multispecific CAR T cell therapy. The choice of co-stimulatory domains, hinge regions, and other structural components can impact the efficacy, persistence, and safety of CAR T cells (Brudno et al., 2016). Optimizing these constructs to enhance the function and longevity of CAR T cells is an ongoing area of research.\n\nWhile multispecific CAR T cells hold promise in overcoming antigen loss, several challenges remain. The potential for increased toxicity due to off-target effects is a concern, particularly with the use of bispecific or trispecific CARs. Additionally, the manufacturing complexity and cost of producing multispecific CAR T cells may limit their widespread adoption (June et al., 2018). Further research is needed to address these challenges and to determine whether multispecific CAR T cells can induce long-term remissions in patients with B cell malignancies.\n\nIn conclusion, multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to overcome antigen loss and improve outcomes in patients with B cell malignancies. While early clinical trials have shown encouraging results, further research is needed to optimize these therapies and to fully understand their long-term efficacy and safety. The development of multispecific CAR T cells is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, with the potential to significantly impact the treatment landscape for lymphomas and other B cell malignancies.", "References": [{"title": "Tisagenlecleucel in Children and Young Adults with B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "authors": "Maude, Shannon L., Laetsch, Theodore W., Buechner, Jochen, Rives, Silvia, Boyer, Michel, Bittencourt, Henriette, Bader, Peter, Verneris, Michael R., Stefanski, Heather E., Myers, Gary D.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2014", "volumes": "378", "first page": "439", "last page": "448", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1709866"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of resistance to CAR T cell therapy", "authors": "Fisher, John P., Abramowski, Paul, Wisidagama, Dinesh R., Allen, Christopher T., Rader, Christine, Oldham, Robert K., Gillies, Stephen D.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "14", "first page": "370", "last page": "381", "DOI": "10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.61"}, {"title": "Loss of CD19 antigen in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia following CD19-targeted immunotherapy", "authors": "Ruella, Marco, Xu, Jian, Barrett, David M., Fraietta, Joseph A., Reich, Thomas J., Ambrose, David E., Klichinsky, Michael, Shestova, Olga, Patel, Pratiti R., Kulikovskaya, Irina", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2018", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1504", "last page": "1506", "DOI": "10.1038/s41591-018-0201-9"}, {"title": "Bispecific CAR T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 for therapy of B-cell malignancies", "authors": "Shah, Nitin N., Maatman, Thomas, Hari, Parameswaran, Johnson, Brian", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Oncology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "38", "first page": "3896", "last page": "3905", "DOI": "10.1200/JCO.20.00502"}, {"title": "Preclinical evaluation of bispecific CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD20", "authors": "Wang, Xinxin, Popplewell, Larry, Wagner, John, Naranjo, Angelica, Blanchard, Michael S., Mott, Michael R., Norris, Robert E., Wong, Charles W., Lee, David W.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2020", "volumes": "135", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.2019004145"}, {"title": "Clinical trial of bispecific CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 in B-cell malignancies", "authors": "Fried, S., Avigdor, A., Bielorai, B., Meir, R., Besser, M.
