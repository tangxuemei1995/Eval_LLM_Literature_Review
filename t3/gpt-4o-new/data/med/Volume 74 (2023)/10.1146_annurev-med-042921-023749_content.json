{"Literature Review": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Since its initial description by Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the pathological hallmarks of AD have been identified as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques. NFTs are primarily composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, while senile plaques are mainly constituted of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. The role of these aggregates in AD pathogenesis has been extensively studied, with a significant focus on the fibrillar forms of these proteins. However, recent research has shifted towards understanding the role of soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau, often referred to as the 'tau we cannot see', in driving neurodegeneration in AD. \n\nThe tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons. In AD, tau undergoes hyperphosphorylation, leading to its detachment from microtubules and subsequent aggregation into NFTs. While NFTs are a hallmark of AD, their presence does not correlate well with the severity of cognitive impairment, suggesting that other forms of tau may be more relevant to disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Soluble tau oligomers, which are intermediate species in the aggregation pathway, have been proposed as the toxic entities responsible for neuronal dysfunction and death (Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2012). \n\nThe concept of tau oligomers as key players in AD pathogenesis is supported by several lines of evidence. First, tau oligomers have been detected in the brains of AD patients and in animal models of tauopathy, where their levels correlate with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits (Berger et al., 2007). Second, tau oligomers have been shown to disrupt synaptic function by impairing synaptic plasticity and reducing synaptic density (Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2011). Third, tau oligomers can propagate from cell to cell, spreading tau pathology throughout the brain in a prion-like manner (Clavaguera et al., 2009). \n\nThe detection and quantification of soluble tau species in biological samples have been challenging due to their transient and dynamic nature. However, advances in biomarker research have led to the development of sensitive assays capable of detecting tau oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood (Sato et al., 2018). These assays have the potential to improve the diagnosis of AD and monitor disease progression and response to therapy. \n\nTherapeutic strategies targeting tau oligomers are being actively pursued. Immunotherapy approaches, such as passive immunization with tau antibodies, have shown promise in preclinical models by reducing tau pathology and improving cognitive function (Yanamandra et al., 2013). Small molecules that inhibit tau aggregation or promote tau clearance are also under investigation (Wischik et al., 2014). \n\nDespite these advances, several challenges remain in targeting tau oligomers for AD therapy. The heterogeneity of tau species and their dynamic nature complicate the identification of specific toxic forms. Additionally, the blood-brain barrier poses a significant obstacle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. \n\nIn conclusion, the 'tau we cannot see'—soluble, nonfibrillar tau species—are emerging as critical drivers of neurodegeneration in AD. Understanding the mechanisms by which these tau species contribute to disease progression and developing effective strategies to target them are essential for advancing AD research and therapy. Continued efforts in biomarker development and therapeutic innovation hold promise for improving the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating disease.", "References": [{"title": "Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes", "authors": "Braak, H., Braak, E.", "journal": "Acta Neuropathologica", "year": "1991", "volumes": "82", "first page": "239", "last page": "259", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00308809"}, {"title": "Tau oligomers as potential targets for immunotherapy for Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathies", "authors": "Lasagna-Reeves, C.
