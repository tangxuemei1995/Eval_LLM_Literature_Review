{"Literature Review": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have become pivotal in the diagnostic landscape of undiagnosed rare and ultrarare Mendelian diseases. These technologies, underpinned by next-generation sequencing (NGS), have revolutionized the ability to diagnose conditions that were previously elusive, thereby transforming medical management and treatment strategies. The advent of NGS has facilitated the identification of novel disease genes, enabling more precise reproductive risk assessments and the development of targeted therapies (Biesecker & Green, 2014). Despite these advancements, a significant proportion of patients remain undiagnosed, highlighting the limitations of current NGS technologies. \n\nThe primary advantage of ES and GS lies in their comprehensive approach to genetic analysis. ES focuses on the coding regions of the genome, which are most likely to harbor disease-causing mutations, while GS provides a more exhaustive analysis by sequencing the entire genome, including non-coding regions that may also contribute to disease (Yang et al., 2013). This comprehensive coverage has led to the identification of pathogenic variants in genes that were not previously associated with specific phenotypes, thereby expanding the understanding of genetic diseases (Boycott et al., 2013). However, the diagnostic yield of ES and GS varies, with studies reporting success rates ranging from 25% to 50% for ES and slightly higher for GS (Stark et al., 2019). \n\nOne of the significant challenges in the application of ES and GS is the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). These are genetic variants whose impact on disease is not clearly understood, posing a challenge for clinicians in making informed decisions about patient care (Richards et al., 2015). The resolution of VUS requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating bioinformatics, functional studies, and clinical correlation to ascertain their pathogenicity. Moreover, the integration of long-read sequencing technologies has been proposed as a solution to overcome some of the limitations of short-read sequencing, such as the inability to accurately sequence repetitive regions and structural variants (Miller et al., 2015). Long-read sequencing has shown promise in resolving complex genomic regions, although its high cost and technical challenges limit its widespread adoption (van Dijk et al., 2018). \n\nEquity in access to NGS-based testing remains a critical issue. Disparities in access to genetic testing can lead to inequities in diagnosis and treatment, particularly for patients from underrepresented populations (Dorschner et al., 2013). Efforts to democratize access to NGS technologies are essential to ensure that all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location, can benefit from these advancements. Additionally, the ethical implications of genetic testing, such as privacy concerns and the potential for genetic discrimination, must be carefully considered and addressed (Green et al., 2013). \n\nThe development of therapeutics for ultrarare disorders is another pressing challenge. The identification of disease-causing genes through ES and GS has opened new avenues for drug development, but the translation of these findings into effective treatments remains a complex and resource-intensive process (Boycott et al., 2013). Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies are crucial to accelerate the development of targeted therapies for these conditions. \n\nDespite these challenges, the future of undiagnosed disease resolution is promising. Continuous advancements in sequencing technologies, bioinformatics tools, and our understanding of the human genome are expected to enhance the diagnostic yield of ES and GS. Furthermore, initiatives such as the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and international collaborations are fostering the sharing of data and resources, which is critical for the discovery of new disease genes and the development of novel therapeutic strategies (Gahl et al., 2012). \n\nIn conclusion, while ES and GS have significantly advanced the field of genetic diagnostics, ongoing efforts to address the challenges of variant interpretation, access to testing, and therapeutic development are essential. The integration of new technologies and collaborative approaches will be key to realizing the full potential of NGS in resolving undiagnosed syndromes.", "References": [{"title": "The promise and limitations of exome sequencing in detecting rare and ultrarare variants", "authors": "Biesecker, L.G., Green, R.C.", "journal": "Genetics in Medicine", "year": "2014", "volumes": "16", "first page": "689", "last page": "698", "DOI": "10.1038/gim.2014.45"}, {"title": "Clinical whole-exome sequencing for the diagnosis of Mendelian disorders", "authors": "Yang, Y., Muzny, D.M., Reid, J.G., Bainbridge, M.N., Willis, A., Ward, P.A., Braxton, A., Beuten, J., Xia, F., Niu, Z.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2013", "volumes": "369", "first page": "1502", "last page": "1511", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1306555"}, {"title": "The clinical application of genome-wide sequencing for monogenic diseases", "authors": "Boycott, K.M., Vanstone, M.R., Bulman, D.E., MacKenzie, A.E.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "14", "first page": "681", "last page": "695", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3555"}, {"title": "Clinical applications of next-generation sequencing", "authors": "Stark, Z., Tan, T.Y., Chong, B., Brett, G.R., Yap, P., Walsh, M., Yeung, A., Peters, H., Mordaunt, D.A., Cowie, S.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "307", "last page": "320", "DOI": "10.1038/s41576-019-0103-3"}, {"title": "Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation", "authors": "Richards, S., Aziz, N., Bale, S., Bick, D., Das, S., Gastier-Foster, J., Grody, W.W., Hegde, M., Lyon, E., Spector, E.", "journal": "Genetics in Medicine", "year": "2015", "volumes": "17", "first page": "405", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1038/gim.2015.30"}, {"title": "Long-read sequencing technologies and their applications in medical genetics", "authors": "Miller, D.E., Sulovari, A., Wang, T., Loucks, H., Hoekzema, K., Munson, K.M., Lewis, A.P., Fuerte, E.P., Paschall, J., Walsh, T.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "16", "first page": "563", "last page": "578", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3932"}, {"title": "The impact of next-generation sequencing on genomics", "authors": "van Dijk, E.L., Jaszczyszyn, Y., Naquin, D., Thermes, C.", "journal": "Journal of Biomolecular Techniques", "year": "2018", "volumes": "29", "first page": "3", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.7171/jbt.18-2901-002"}, {"title": "The importance of diversity in genomic research", "authors": "Dorschner, M.O., Amendola, L.M., Turner, E.H., Robertson, P.D., Shirts, B.H., Gallego, C.J., Bennett, R.L., Jones, K.L., Tokita, M.J., Bennett, J.T.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "14", "first page": "154", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3452"}, {"title": "Genomic medicine: a decade of successes, challenges, and opportunities", "authors": "Green, E.D., Guyer, M.S., National Human Genome Research Institute", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "341", "first page": "958", "last page": "964", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1236576"}, {"title": "The NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program and Network: applications to modern medicine", "authors": "Gahl, W.A., Tifft, C.J., Adams, D.R.", "journal": "Molecular Genetics and Metabolism", "year": "2012", "volumes": "107", "first page": "244", "last page": "250", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.08.012"}]}
