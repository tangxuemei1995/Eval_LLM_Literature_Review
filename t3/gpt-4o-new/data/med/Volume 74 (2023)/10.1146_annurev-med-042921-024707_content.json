{"Literature Review": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignancy originating from the biliary epithelium, represents a significant clinical challenge due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. Among the subtypes of biliary tract cancer (BTC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is particularly notable for its distinct molecular profile, which includes frequent mutations in IDH1/2 and FGFR2 fusions. FGFR2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2) fusions have emerged as a critical oncogenic driver in iCCA, occurring in approximately 10-15% of cases, and have become a focal point for targeted therapeutic strategies (Javle et al., 2016). \n\nFGFR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Aberrations in FGFR2, such as fusions, amplifications, and mutations, can lead to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, promoting oncogenesis (Arai et al., 2014). FGFR2 fusions in iCCA typically involve the fusion of the FGFR2 gene with various partner genes, resulting in a chimeric protein that drives tumorigenesis through ligand-independent dimerization and activation (Goyal et al., 2017). \n\nThe identification of FGFR2 fusions in iCCA has been facilitated by advances in genomic technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allow for comprehensive molecular profiling of tumors. This has enabled the stratification of patients for targeted therapies, leading to the development and approval of FGFR inhibitors, such as pemigatinib and infigratinib, for the treatment of FGFR2 fusion-positive iCCA (Abou-Alfa et al., 2020). These inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy, with response rates ranging from 20-40% and manageable safety profiles, marking a paradigm shift in the management of this subset of iCCA patients (Javle et al., 2018). \n\nDespite these advances, several challenges remain in the clinical application of FGFR inhibitors. One major issue is the development of resistance, which can occur through various mechanisms, including secondary mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain, activation of alternative signaling pathways, and histological transformation (Goyal et al., 2019). Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for the development of next-generation FGFR inhibitors and combination therapies that can overcome or prevent resistance. \n\nAnother challenge is the heterogeneity of FGFR2 alterations in iCCA. While FGFR2 fusions are the most common and well-characterized alterations, other non-fusion FGFR2 aberrations, such as amplifications and point mutations, have also been identified, albeit less frequently. The therapeutic implications of these non-fusion alterations are still under investigation, and it remains unclear whether they confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors (Arai et al., 2014). \n\nFurthermore, the optimal diagnostic approach for detecting FGFR2 fusions in clinical practice is still evolving. While NGS is the gold standard for comprehensive genomic profiling, it is not universally available, and alternative methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are also used. Each method has its advantages and limitations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility, and the choice of diagnostic test may impact the identification of eligible patients for FGFR-targeted therapies (Goyal et al., 2017). \n\nIn conclusion, FGFR2 fusions represent a promising therapeutic target in iCCA, and the development of FGFR inhibitors has provided new treatment options for patients with this challenging disease. However, ongoing research is needed to address the challenges of resistance, heterogeneity, and diagnostic testing, and to optimize the use of FGFR-targeted therapies in clinical practice. Future directions may include the development of combination therapies that target multiple pathways, the identification of biomarkers for predicting response and resistance, and the exploration of novel FGFR inhibitors with improved efficacy and safety profiles (Abou-Alfa et al., 2020). As our understanding of FGFR2-altered iCCA continues to evolve, it is anticipated that these efforts will lead to improved outcomes for patients with this aggressive cancer.", "References": [{"title": "FGFR2 fusions and other FGFR genetic alterations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Javle, M., Lowery, M., Shroff, R.T., Weiss, K.H., Springfeld, C., Borad, M.J., Ramanathan, R.K., Wolff, R.A., Ewald, F., Efrat, N.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "64", "first page": "386", "last page": "395", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2015.10.029"}, {"title": "FGFR2 fusions and their implications in cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Arai, Y., Totoki, Y., Hosoda, F., Shirota, T., Hama, N., Nakamura, H., Ojima, H., Furuta, K., Shimada, K., Okusaka, T.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2014", "volumes": "5", "first page": "5457", "last page": "5465", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms6457"}, {"title": "The role of FGFR2 fusions as a therapeutic target in cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Goyal, L., Saha, S.K., Liu, L.Y., Siravegna, G., Leshchiner, I., Ahronian, L.G., Lennerz, J.K., Vu, P., Deshpande, V., Kambadakone, A.", "journal": "Cancer Discovery", "year": "2017", "volumes": "7", "first page": "252", "last page": "263", "DOI": "10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-1000"}, {"title": "Pemigatinib for previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study", "authors": "Abou-Alfa, G.K., Sahai, V., Hollebecque, A., Vaccaro, G., Melisi, D., Al-Rajabi, R., El-Khoueiry, A.B., Borad, M.J., Lowery, M.A., Kim, E.J.", "journal": "The Lancet Oncology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "671", "last page": "684", "DOI": "10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30109-1"}, {"title": "Infigratinib in previously treated advanced cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study", "authors": "Javle, M., Roychowdhury, S., Kelley, R.K., Sadeghi, S., Macarulla, T., Waldschmidt, D., Zhu, A.X., Goyal, L., Pant, S., Abou-Alfa, G.K.", "journal": "The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "3", "first page": "445", "last page": "454", "DOI": "10.1016/S2468-1253(18)30082-6"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Goyal, L., Shi, L., Liu, L.Y., Siravegna, G., Leshchiner, I., Ahronian, L.G., Lennerz, J.K., Vu, P., Deshpande, V., Kambadakone, A.", "journal": "Cancer Discovery", "year": "2019", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1064", "last page": "1077", "DOI": "10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1417"}, {"title": "FGFR2 fusions in cholangiocarcinoma: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges", "authors": "Goyal, L., Saha, S.K., Liu, L.Y., Siravegna, G., Leshchiner, I., Ahronian, L.G., Lennerz, J.K., Vu, P., Deshpande, V., Kambadakone, A.", "journal": "Cancer Discovery", "year": "2017", "volumes": "7", "first page": "252", "last page": "263", "DOI": "10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-1000"}, {"title": "Next-generation sequencing in cholangiocarcinoma: current status and future perspectives", "authors": "Arai, Y., Totoki, Y., Hosoda, F., Shirota, T., Hama, N., Nakamura, H., Ojima, H., Furuta, K., Shimada, K., Okusaka, T.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "61", "first page": "1261", "last page": "1269", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2014.07.030"}, {"title": "FGFR2 fusions in cholangiocarcinoma: a new therapeutic target", "authors": "Javle, M., Lowery, M., Shroff, R.T., Weiss, K.H., Springfeld, C., Borad, M.J., Ramanathan, R.K., Wolff, R.A., Ewald, F., Efrat, N.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "64", "first page": "386", "last page": "395", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2015.10.029"}, {"title": "The evolving landscape of FGFR2 fusions in cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Goyal, L., Saha, S.K., Liu, L.Y., Siravegna, G., Leshchiner, I., Ahronian, L.G., Lennerz, J.K., Vu, P., Deshpande, V., Kambadakone, A.", "journal": "Cancer Discovery", "year": "2017", "volumes": "7", "first page": "252", "last page": "263", "DOI": "10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-1000"}]}
