{"Literature Review": "The use of race in kidney function estimation has been a topic of significant debate and scrutiny, particularly in the context of promoting health equity and justice. Historically, race-based adjustments in clinical algorithms, such as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), have been justified by perceived physiological differences among racial groups. However, these adjustments have increasingly been criticized for perpetuating racial biases and health disparities. This literature review explores the historical context, scientific rationale, and recent developments in the use of race in kidney function estimation, with a focus on the transition towards race-neutral approaches.\n\nThe inclusion of race in kidney function estimation equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, was initially based on studies suggesting that Black individuals have higher average serum creatinine levels than White individuals, potentially due to differences in muscle mass (Levey et al., 1999). This led to the incorporation of a race coefficient in these equations, which adjusted the eGFR upwards for Black patients (Levey et al., 2009). However, the scientific basis for these adjustments has been increasingly questioned, as they rely on broad racial categories that do not account for individual variability and the social construct of race (Boulware et al., 2006).\n\nCritics argue that the use of race in clinical algorithms can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. For instance, the upward adjustment of eGFR for Black patients may delay the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and subsequent referral for specialist care or kidney transplantation (Powe, 2020). This has significant implications for health equity, as Black individuals are already disproportionately affected by CKD and its complications (Crews et al., 2014). The reliance on race-based adjustments also overlooks the impact of social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status and access to healthcare, which are critical factors in health disparities (Williams et al., 2010).\n\nIn response to these concerns, there has been a growing movement towards developing race-neutral kidney function estimation equations. In 2021, the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology Task Force recommended the adoption of a new CKD-EPI equation that does not include a race coefficient (Inker et al., 2021). This equation was developed using a diverse dataset and aims to provide more accurate and equitable assessments of kidney function across all racial groups. The transition to race-neutral equations is seen as a crucial step towards reducing health disparities and promoting health justice (Diao et al., 2021).\n\nThe shift away from race-based algorithms in nephrology is part of a broader movement in medicine to critically evaluate the use of race as a biological variable. Scholars have argued for a more nuanced understanding of race as a social construct that reflects historical and structural inequities rather than inherent biological differences (Roberts, 2011). This perspective calls for the integration of social determinants of health into clinical decision-making and the development of algorithms that are both scientifically rigorous and equity-oriented (Boyd et al., 2020).\n\nDespite the progress made, challenges remain in the implementation of race-neutral equations. There is a need for widespread education and training for healthcare providers to ensure the accurate use of these new tools. Additionally, further research is needed to validate the performance of race-neutral equations in diverse populations and to explore alternative biomarkers for kidney function estimation (Peralta et al., 2011). The ongoing dialogue between researchers, clinicians, and patients is essential to ensure that the transition to race-neutral algorithms is informed by the needs and experiences of those most affected by kidney disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of race in kidney function estimation has been a contentious issue with significant implications for health equity. The move towards race-neutral equations represents a critical step towards addressing racial biases in clinical algorithms and promoting a more just healthcare system. However, achieving health justice requires continued efforts to understand and address the complex interplay of biological, social, and structural factors that contribute to health disparities.", "References": [{"title": "A more accurate method to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine: a new prediction equation", "authors": "Levey, Andrew S., Bosch, John P., Lewis, Julia B., Greene, Tom, Rogers, David M., Roth, Neil S.", "journal": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "year": "1999", "volumes": "130", "first page": "461", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.7326/0003-4819-130-6-199903160-00002"}, {"title": "A new equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate", "authors": "Levey, Andrew S., Stevens, Lesley A., Schmid, Christopher H., Zhang, Yaping L., Castro, Allen F., Feldman, Harold I.", "journal": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "150", "first page": "604", "last page": "612", "DOI": "10.7326/0003-4819-150-9-200905050-00006"}, {"title": "Race and trust in the health care system", "authors": "Boulware, L.
