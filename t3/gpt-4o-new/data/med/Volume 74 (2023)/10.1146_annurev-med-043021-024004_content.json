{"Literature Review": "The origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies are multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of historical, social, and technical factors. These biases can manifest in various ways, from the design and development of medical devices to the data used in their calibration and the algorithms that interpret their outputs. Understanding these origins is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their impact and ensure equitable healthcare outcomes for all individuals.\n\nOne of the most well-documented examples of racial bias in pulmonary technologies is the differential performance of pulse oximeters across different racial and ethnic groups. Studies have shown that pulse oximeters, which are widely used to measure blood oxygen levels, tend to overestimate oxygen saturation in individuals with darker skin tones (Bickler et al., 2005). This discrepancy arises because the devices are often calibrated using data from predominantly white populations, leading to inaccuracies when applied to more diverse groups (Feiner et al., 2007). The implications of this bias are significant, as it can result in delayed or inadequate treatment for patients of color, exacerbating existing health disparities.\n\nPulmonary function testing (PFT) is another area where racial and ethnic biases have been identified. PFTs are used to assess lung function and diagnose respiratory conditions, but the reference values used to interpret these tests are often based on race-specific norms. These norms are derived from historical data that may not accurately reflect the current population's diversity, leading to potential misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatment recommendations for non-white patients (Braun et al., 2015). The use of race-based reference values in PFTs has been criticized for perpetuating the false notion that biological differences between races are significant, rather than recognizing the social determinants of health that contribute to disparities (Kaufman et al., 2017).\n\nThe development and deployment of algorithms in healthcare also present opportunities for bias to be introduced and perpetuated. Algorithms used to predict healthcare needs or outcomes are often trained on datasets that do not adequately represent the diversity of the patient population. This lack of representation can lead to biased predictions that disadvantage certain racial or ethnic groups. For example, a study by Obermeyer et al. (2019) found that an algorithm used to allocate healthcare resources systematically underestimated the health needs of black patients compared to white patients, due to the use of healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs, which does not account for systemic barriers to accessing care.\n\nThe regulatory standards and evaluation processes for medical technologies also play a role in perpetuating bias. Current regulatory frameworks often do not require comprehensive testing across diverse populations, allowing biased technologies to enter the market without adequate scrutiny (Vyas et al., 2020). This lack of oversight can result in the widespread use of biased technologies, further entrenching health disparities.\n\nAddressing these biases requires a multifaceted approach. First, there is a need for more inclusive data collection and analysis practices that ensure diverse representation in the datasets used to develop and calibrate medical technologies. This includes not only racial and ethnic diversity but also consideration of other factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status (Chen et al., 2020). Second, there is a need for greater awareness and education among healthcare providers and policymakers about the potential for bias in medical technologies and the importance of using equitable practices in their deployment (Seymour et al., 2021).\n\nFinally, there is a need for stronger regulatory oversight to ensure that medical technologies are rigorously tested for bias before they are approved for use. This could involve the development of new standards and guidelines for evaluating the performance of medical devices and algorithms across diverse populations, as well as ongoing monitoring and assessment to identify and address any biases that may emerge over time (Benjamin, 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies are complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of historical, social, and technical factors. Addressing these biases requires a concerted effort from researchers, healthcare providers, policymakers, and regulators to ensure that medical technologies are developed and deployed in a way that promotes equity and reduces health disparities.", "References": [{"title": "Effects of skin pigmentation on pulse oximeter accuracy at low saturation", "authors": "Bickler, P.
