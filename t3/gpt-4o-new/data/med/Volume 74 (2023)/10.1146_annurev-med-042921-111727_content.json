{"Literature Review": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) represents a distinct clinical entity within the spectrum of myocardial infarction (MI). Unlike the more common MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD), MINOCA is characterized by the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis on angiography, typically defined as less than 50% luminal narrowing. This condition accounts for approximately 6-8% of all MI cases, highlighting its clinical relevance (Pasupathy et al., 2015). The pathophysiology of MINOCA is heterogeneous, involving a range of mechanisms such as coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, plaque disruption, and thrombosis (Tamis-Holland et al., 2019). \n\nEpidemiologically, MINOCA is more prevalent among women, who constitute a significant proportion of affected individuals. This gender disparity may be attributed to differences in coronary artery disease presentation and pathophysiological mechanisms between men and women (Reynolds et al., 2018). The clinical presentation of MINOCA is similar to that of MI-CAD, with patients experiencing chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers. However, the absence of obstructive coronary lesions necessitates a different diagnostic and therapeutic approach. \n\nThe diagnostic evaluation of MINOCA involves a combination of invasive and non-invasive techniques. Coronary angiography remains the cornerstone for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease. However, to elucidate the underlying cause of MINOCA, additional imaging modalities such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) are often employed. These techniques can detect subtle plaque disruptions or thrombi that may not be apparent on angiography alone (Lindahl et al., 2017). Furthermore, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is invaluable in differentiating between ischemic and non-ischemic causes of myocardial injury, such as myocarditis or takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Dastidar et al., 2017). Provocative testing for coronary spasm, although not routinely performed, can be useful in selected cases to identify vasospastic angina as a potential mechanism (Montone et al., 2018). \n\nThe management of MINOCA is challenging due to the lack of specific guidelines and the variability in underlying mechanisms. Current treatment strategies are often extrapolated from those used in MI-CAD, including the use of antiplatelet agents, statins, and beta-blockers. However, the efficacy of these treatments in MINOCA patients remains uncertain, as they have not been specifically studied in this population (Tamis-Holland et al., 2019). The role of anticoagulation is particularly controversial, given the potential for thrombotic mechanisms in some MINOCA cases. \n\nRecent studies have highlighted the need for personalized treatment approaches based on the identified pathophysiological mechanism. For instance, patients with evidence of coronary spasm may benefit from calcium channel blockers or nitrates, while those with microvascular dysfunction might respond to therapies targeting endothelial function (Bairey Merz et al., 2017). The use of CMR to guide therapy is an emerging area of interest, as it can provide insights into myocardial tissue characteristics and help tailor treatment (Dastidar et al., 2017). \n\nDespite advances in diagnostic techniques, there remains a significant gap in the evidence base for the management of MINOCA. Clinical trials specifically targeting this population are urgently needed to establish evidence-based treatment protocols. The MINOCA-BAT trial, for example, is an ongoing study investigating the efficacy of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in MINOCA patients, which may provide valuable insights into optimal management strategies (Nordenskjöld et al., 2019). \n\nIn conclusion, MINOCA is a complex and multifaceted condition that requires a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management. While significant progress has been made in understanding its pathophysiology, further research is needed to develop targeted therapies and improve outcomes for affected patients. The integration of advanced imaging techniques and personalized medicine holds promise for the future management of MINOCA.", "References": [{"title": "Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries: diagnosis and management", "authors": "Pasupathy, Shyamala; Air, Tracy; Dreyer, Rachel P.; Tavella, Rachael; Beltrame, John F.", "journal": "European Cardiology Review", "year": "2015", "volumes": "10", "first page": "79", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.15420/ecr.2015.10.02.79"}, {"title": "Contemporary diagnosis and management of patients with myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association", "authors": "Tamis-Holland, Judith E.; Jneid, Hani; Reynolds, Harmony R.; Agewall, Stefan; Brilakis, Emmanouil S.; Brown, Todd M.; Lerman, Amir; Cushman, Mary; Kumbhani, Dharam J.; Arslanian-Engoren, Cynthia", "journal": "Circulation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "139", "first page": "e891", "last page": "e908", "DOI": "10.1161/CIR.0000000000000670"}, {"title": "Sex differences in myocardial infarction pathophysiology: a review", "authors": "Reynolds, Harmony R.; Shaw, Linda J.; Min, James K.; Page, C.
