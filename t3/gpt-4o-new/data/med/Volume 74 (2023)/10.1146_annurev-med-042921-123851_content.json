{"Literature Review": "Maternal mortality remains a critical public health issue in the United States, with rates significantly higher than those in other developed countries. This disparity is compounded by racial, geographic, and socioeconomic factors, which contribute to the complexity of addressing maternal health outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that approximately 700 women die each year in the United States as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications, with significant variations across different demographic groups (CDC, 2020). The literature indicates that African American, Native American, and Alaska Native women are disproportionately affected, experiencing maternal mortality rates two to three times higher than those of white women (Petersen et al., 2019). This racial disparity is a persistent issue that underscores the need for targeted interventions and policy changes.\n\nThe shift in the underlying causes of maternal mortality in the United States mirrors trends observed in other developed nations. Historically, hemorrhage and infection were the leading causes of maternal death, but recent data indicate a rise in deaths related to cardiovascular diseases and preexisting medical conditions (Creanga et al., 2017). This shift necessitates a reevaluation of current healthcare practices and the implementation of strategies that address these emerging threats. Cardiovascular conditions, including cardiomyopathy, hypertensive disorders, and thrombotic pulmonary embolism, now account for a significant proportion of maternal deaths (Kassebaum et al., 2014). The increasing prevalence of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension among reproductive-age women further exacerbates the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (Fingar et al., 2018).\n\nContinuity of care is a critical component in reducing maternal mortality rates. Ensuring that women receive comprehensive care before, during, and after pregnancy can help identify and manage preexisting conditions that may increase the risk of maternal death. Preconception health and counseling are essential strategies for improving maternal outcomes. Preconception care involves assessing and managing risk factors before pregnancy, which can significantly reduce the incidence of complications during pregnancy and childbirth (Johnson et al., 2006). Studies have shown that women who receive preconception care are more likely to have healthier pregnancies and better birth outcomes (Moos et al., 2008).\n\nThe postpartum period is another critical window for intervention. Primary care visits within the first year after delivery provide an opportunity to address health issues that may have arisen during pregnancy and to manage chronic conditions that could affect future pregnancies (Tully et al., 2017). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a comprehensive postpartum visit within the first six weeks after delivery, with ongoing care as needed (ACOG, 2018). However, many women do not receive adequate postpartum care, particularly those from marginalized communities (Declercq et al., 2016). Addressing barriers to postpartum care, such as lack of access to healthcare services, financial constraints, and cultural factors, is essential for improving maternal health outcomes.\n\nSocioeconomic factors also play a significant role in maternal mortality. Women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often face challenges in accessing quality healthcare, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of conditions that contribute to maternal death (Howell et al., 2016). Health insurance coverage is a critical determinant of access to care, and expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income women has been shown to improve maternal health outcomes (Searing & Ross, 2019). Additionally, addressing social determinants of health, such as education, employment, and housing, is crucial for reducing disparities in maternal mortality.\n\nIn conclusion, maternal mortality in the United States is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach to prevention. Addressing racial and socioeconomic disparities, improving continuity of care, and focusing on preconception and postpartum health are key strategies for reducing maternal deaths. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations must work together to implement evidence-based interventions that address the root causes of maternal mortality and improve health outcomes for all women.", "References": [{"title": "Vital Signs: Pregnancy-Related Deaths, United States, 2011–2015, and Strategies for Prevention, 13 States, 2013–2017", "authors": "Petersen, Emily E., Davis, Nicole L., Goodman, Deanna, Cox, Suzan, Syverson, Cynthia, Seed, Kim, Shapiro-Mendoza, Carrie K., Callaghan, William M., Barfield, Wanda", "journal": "MMWR.
