{"Literature Review": "The study of fusion oncoproteins (FOs) and their role in cancer biology has gained significant attention due to their association with aggressive cancers and poor patient outcomes. FOs are the result of in-frame chromosomal translocations, which lead to the creation of novel proteins with oncogenic potential. Recent research has highlighted the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the function of these proteins, particularly in the formation of biomolecular condensates that are crucial for their oncogenic activity. LLPS is a process by which proteins and nucleic acids demix from the surrounding environment to form concentrated, dynamic assemblies without a surrounding membrane. These condensates can compartmentalize biochemical reactions and are implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and signal transduction (Banani et al., 2017). \n\nFOs can be broadly categorized into two classes based on their localization and function: nuclear condensates that alter chromatin biology and gene expression, and cytoplasmic condensates that promote aberrant signaling pathways such as RAS/MAPK signaling. Nuclear FOs, such as the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein found in Ewing sarcoma, are known to form nuclear condensates that disrupt normal chromatin architecture and transcriptional regulation (Boulay et al., 2017). These condensates often contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and specific folded domains that facilitate interactions with chromatin and transcriptional machinery, leading to the activation of oncogenic transcriptional programs (Kato et al., 2012). \n\nCytoplasmic FOs, on the other hand, are involved in the dysregulation of signaling pathways. For instance, the BCR-ABL fusion protein, characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia, forms cytoplasmic condensates that enhance kinase activity and downstream signaling, contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation (McWhirter et al., 1993). These condensates often involve interactions with signaling proteins and adaptors, which are mediated by LLPS-prone sequences within the FOs. \n\nThe propensity of FOs to undergo LLPS is largely attributed to their amino acid sequences, which often contain IDRs and specific motifs that promote multivalent interactions. IDRs are regions within proteins that lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, allowing them to engage in dynamic interactions with multiple partners. These regions are enriched in low-complexity sequences and repetitive motifs, which are known to facilitate phase separation (Uversky, 2017). Additionally, folded domains within FOs can provide structural scaffolds that enhance the stability and specificity of the condensates (Wright and Dyson, 2015). \n\nThe role of LLPS in FO-driven cancers is not limited to the formation of oncogenic condensates. Some FOs can also inhibit physiological LLPS processes in normal cells, leading to dysregulation of cellular homeostasis. For example, the PML-RARÎ± fusion protein in acute promyelocytic leukemia disrupts the formation of PML nuclear bodies, which are involved in various cellular processes including DNA repair and apoptosis (Zhong et al., 2000). This disruption is mediated by the ability of the fusion protein to sequester normal PML proteins into aberrant condensates, thereby impairing their function. \n\nThe enrichment of LLPS-prone sequences in FOs suggests that these proteins have evolved to exploit phase separation as a mechanism to drive oncogenesis. Understanding the sequence features that promote LLPS in FOs can provide insights into their function and potential therapeutic targets. For instance, targeting the interactions that mediate condensate formation, such as those involving IDRs or specific folded domains, could disrupt the oncogenic activity of FOs and provide a novel approach to cancer therapy (Shin and Brangwynne, 2017). \n\nIn conclusion, the role of phase-separated condensates in FO-driven cancers highlights the importance of LLPS in the regulation of oncogenic processes. The ability of FOs to form nuclear and cytoplasmic condensates through LLPS is a key factor in their oncogenic potential, affecting both transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways. Further research into the sequence features and interactions that drive LLPS in FOs will be crucial for developing targeted therapies for these aggressive cancers.", "References": [{"title": "Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry", "authors": "Banani, S.
