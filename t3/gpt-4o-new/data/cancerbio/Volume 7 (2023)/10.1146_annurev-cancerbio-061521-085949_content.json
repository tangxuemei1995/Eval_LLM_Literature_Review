{"Literature Review": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic milieu that plays a critical role in cancer progression and response to therapy. Among the various cellular components of the TME, myeloid cells, particularly mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are pivotal in modulating immune responses and influencing tumor dynamics. Macrophages and DCs are not only involved in the innate immune response but also play a crucial role in shaping adaptive immunity, making them attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. \n\nMacrophages are highly plastic cells that can adopt different functional phenotypes depending on the signals they receive from their environment. In the context of cancer, macrophages are often polarized towards a tumor-promoting phenotype, known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are typically characterized by an M2-like phenotype, which is associated with immunosuppression, tissue remodeling, and promotion of tumor growth and metastasis (Mantovani et al., 2002). The presence of TAMs in the TME has been correlated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancers (Qian and Pollard, 2010). \n\nDendritic cells, on the other hand, are professional antigen-presenting cells that are essential for the initiation of T cell-mediated immune responses. In tumors, however, DCs often exhibit an immature or dysfunctional phenotype, characterized by impaired antigen presentation and reduced ability to activate T cells (Gabrilovich et al., 2012). This dysfunction is partly due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), which inhibit DC maturation and function (Steinman and Banchereau, 2007). \n\nRecent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have provided new insights into the heterogeneity and spatial organization of MNPs within tumors. These studies have revealed distinct subsets of macrophages and DCs with unique transcriptional profiles and functional properties (Zilionis et al., 2019). For instance, a subset of macrophages expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules has been identified in tumors, which is associated with enhanced antigen presentation and T cell activation (Cassetta et al., 2019). Similarly, a subset of DCs known as cDC1s has been shown to be critical for cross-presentation of tumor antigens and induction of cytotoxic T cell responses (Broz et al., 2014). \n\nThe therapeutic modulation of MNPs in cancer has been a major focus of research, with several strategies being explored to reprogram these cells towards an anti-tumor phenotype. One approach is the use of small molecules or antibodies to block the recruitment and survival of TAMs in tumors. For example, inhibitors of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), which is critical for macrophage survival, have shown promise in preclinical models by reducing TAM numbers and enhancing anti-tumor immunity (Ries et al., 2014). Another strategy is to re-educate TAMs towards a pro-inflammatory, M1-like phenotype using agents such as toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists or CD40 agonists, which can enhance their ability to stimulate T cells and promote tumor cell killing (Beatty et al., 2011). \n\nFor DCs, therapeutic strategies have focused on enhancing their antigen-presenting capacity and ability to activate T cells. This can be achieved through the use of DC vaccines, where patient-derived DCs are loaded with tumor antigens ex vivo and then re-infused into the patient to stimulate a robust T cell response (Palucka and Banchereau, 2012). Additionally, targeting pathways that inhibit DC function, such as the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, can restore their ability to activate T cells and improve anti-tumor immunity (Zou et al., 2016). \n\nIn conclusion, macrophages and dendritic cells are key players in the tumor microenvironment, with significant implications for cancer progression and therapy. Understanding the biology and functional diversity of these cells is crucial for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Recent advances in our understanding of MNP biology have opened new avenues for therapeutic intervention, offering hope for improved cancer treatment outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Macrophage polarization: tumor-associated macrophages as a paradigm for polarized M2 mononuclear phagocytes", "authors": "Mantovani, Alberto; Sica, Antonio; Sozzani, Silvano; Allavena, Paola; Vecchi, Andrea; Locati, Massimo", "journal": "Trends in Immunology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "23", "first page": "549", "last page": "555", "DOI": "10.1016/S1471-4906(02)02302-5"}, {"title": "Macrophage diversity enhances tumor progression and metastasis", "authors": "Qian, Bin-Zhi; Pollard, Jeffrey W.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "141", "first page": "39", "last page": "51", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014"}, {"title": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages: the twist of fate in the cancer microenvironment", "authors": "Gabrilovich, Dmitry I.; Ostrand-Rosenberg, Suzanne; Bronte, Vincenzo", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2012", "volumes": "122", "first page": "2331", "last page": "2337", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI59378"}, {"title": "Dendritic cell function in tumor biology", "authors": "Steinman, Ralph M.; Banchereau, Jacques", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2007", "volumes": "450", "first page": "884", "last page": "890", "DOI": "10.1038/nature06333"}, {"title": "Single-cell transcriptomics of human and mouse lung cancers reveals conserved myeloid populations across individuals and species", "authors": "Zilionis, Rimantas; Engblom, Camilla; Pfirschke, Christina; Savova, Violeta; Zemmour, David; Saatcioglu, Huseyin D.; Krishnan, Indu; Maroni, Giulia; Meyerovitz, David; Kerwin, Christopher M.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-08831-9"}, {"title": "Human tumor-associated macrophage and monocyte transcriptional landscapes reveal cancer-specific reprogramming, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets", "authors": "Cassetta, Luca; Fragkogianni, Sofia; Sims, Andrew H.; Swierczak, Agnieszka; Forrester, Laura M.; Zhang, Hong; Soong, David Y.
