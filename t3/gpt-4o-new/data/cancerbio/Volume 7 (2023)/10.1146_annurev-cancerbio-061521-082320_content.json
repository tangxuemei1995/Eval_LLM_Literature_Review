{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of CD19+ hematological malignancies, demonstrating remarkable efficacy and durability in clinical settings. However, the limitations associated with CAR T cells, such as severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and the need for patient-specific manufacturing, have prompted the exploration of alternative cell types for CAR engineering. Natural killer (NK) cells, with their innate ability to target and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization, have emerged as a promising platform for CAR-based therapies. CAR NK cells offer several advantages over CAR T cells, including a lower risk of CRS, the potential for allogeneic 'off-the-shelf' use, and the ability to target a broader range of tumor antigens (Liu et al., 2020). \n\nThe development of CAR NK cells has been challenging due to difficulties in sourcing NK cells, achieving efficient gene transfer, and ensuring robust expansion and persistence in vivo. NK cells can be derived from various sources, including peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and NK cell lines such as NK-92. Each source has its advantages and limitations. For instance, peripheral blood NK cells are readily available but require extensive ex vivo expansion, while NK-92 cells can be easily expanded but are derived from a lymphoma and require irradiation before infusion (Rezvani et al., 2017). \n\nGene transfer methods for CAR NK cells have evolved significantly, with viral vectors such as lentivirus and retrovirus being the most commonly used due to their high transduction efficiency. However, non-viral methods, including electroporation and transposon systems like Sleeping Beauty, are gaining traction due to their lower cost and reduced risk of insertional mutagenesis (Miller et al., 2019). The choice of CAR design is also critical, with considerations for the antigen-binding domain, hinge region, transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains. Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of co-stimulatory domains such as 4-1BB or CD28 can enhance the persistence and cytotoxicity of CAR NK cells (Zhu et al., 2020). \n\nManufacturing CAR NK cells for clinical application involves several key steps, including isolation, activation, gene modification, expansion, and cryopreservation. The development of standardized protocols and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant facilities is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of CAR NK cell products. Recent advances in bioreactor technology and automated cell processing systems have facilitated the large-scale production of CAR NK cells, paving the way for their clinical translation (Shimasaki et al., 2020). \n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in the clinical development of CAR NK cells. One major hurdle is the limited in vivo persistence of NK cells, which may necessitate repeated infusions or the use of cytokine support to maintain their activity. Strategies to enhance NK cell persistence, such as the co-administration of IL-15 or the engineering of CAR NK cells to express cytokine receptors, are currently under investigation (Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment poses a significant barrier to the efficacy of CAR NK cells. Approaches to overcome this include the combination of CAR NK cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors or the engineering of CAR NK cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (Rezvani et al., 2017). \n\nThe future of CAR NK cell therapy is promising, with several clinical trials underway to evaluate their safety and efficacy in various malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors. The development of universal CAR NK cells, which can be used across multiple patients without the need for HLA matching, represents a significant advancement in the field. These 'off-the-shelf' products have the potential to reduce costs and increase accessibility to CAR-based therapies (Miller et al., 2019). \n\nIn conclusion, CAR NK cells represent a novel and versatile platform for cancer immunotherapy, with the potential to overcome many of the limitations associated with CAR T cells. Continued research and innovation in the areas of cell sourcing, gene transfer, and manufacturing will be critical to realizing the full potential of CAR NK cells in the clinic. As the field progresses, it will be essential to address the challenges of persistence, tumor microenvironment, and scalability to ensure the successful translation of CAR NK cell therapies into routine clinical practice.", "References": [{"title": "CAR NK cells: a promising cellular immunotherapy for cancer", "authors": "Liu, E., Marin, D., Banerjee, P., Macapinlac, H.
