{"Literature Review": "The advent of T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy has revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy, offering a promising avenue for targeting tumor-specific neoantigens. Neoantigens, which are novel protein sequences resulting from tumor-specific mutations, can be classified into private and public neoantigens. Private neoantigens are unique to individual patients, necessitating personalized therapeutic approaches. In contrast, public neoantigens are shared across multiple patients and are often associated with recurrent mutation hotspots, translocations, or gene fusions in oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, as well as epitopes from viral oncogenic proteins (Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015). This review focuses on the potential of targeting public neoantigens using TCR-based therapies, with particular emphasis on mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and viral oncogenic proteins.\n\nMutant KRAS is a well-characterized oncogene with mutations frequently occurring in codons 12, 13, and 61, which are implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers (Cox et al., 2014). These mutations result in constitutive activation of the KRAS protein, driving oncogenesis. TCR-based therapies targeting mutant KRAS have shown promise in preclinical models. For instance, Tran et al. (2016) demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a TCR specific for the KRAS G12D mutation could selectively recognize and kill tumor cells harboring this mutation. This study underscores the potential of targeting KRAS mutations as a therapeutic strategy in cancers with high KRAS mutation prevalence.\n\nSimilarly, mutant p53, another common oncogenic driver, presents a viable target for TCR-based therapies. Mutations in the TP53 gene are prevalent in over 50% of human cancers, leading to the loss of tumor suppressor function and gain of oncogenic properties (Kandoth et al., 2013). Efforts to target mutant p53 have focused on identifying immunogenic epitopes that can be recognized by TCRs. A study by Malekzadeh et al. (2019) identified a TCR that specifically targets the p53 R175H mutation, demonstrating the feasibility of targeting mutant p53 in a clinical setting. These findings highlight the potential of TCR-based therapies in targeting common oncogenic mutations that are shared across different cancer types.\n\nIn addition to targeting oncogenic mutations, TCR-based therapies have also been explored for targeting epitopes derived from viral oncogenic proteins. Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are examples of viruses that contribute to oncogenesis through the expression of viral proteins that can serve as public neoantigens (Bzhalava et al., 2013). TCRs engineered to target HPV E6 and E7 proteins have shown efficacy in preclinical models of cervical cancer, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for HPV-associated malignancies (Stevanović et al., 2015). Similarly, TCRs targeting EBV-derived epitopes have been investigated for the treatment of EBV-associated cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and certain lymphomas (Voo et al., 2004).\n\nDespite the promising potential of TCR-based therapies, several challenges remain in their clinical application, particularly in the context of solid tumors. One major challenge is the heterogeneity of antigen expression within tumors, which can lead to immune escape and treatment resistance (McGranahan and Swanton, 2017). Strategies to overcome this include the use of combination therapies that target multiple antigens or pathways, as well as the development of TCRs with enhanced affinity and specificity for tumor antigens (June et al., 2018).\n\nAnother challenge is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which can inhibit T cell function and limit the efficacy of TCR-based therapies. Approaches to modulate the tumor microenvironment, such as the use of checkpoint inhibitors or cytokine therapies, are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of TCR-based treatments (Ribas and Wolchok, 2018). Additionally, advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, offer the potential to engineer T cells with improved functionality and resistance to immunosuppressive signals (Eyquem et al., 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, TCR-based cellular therapy represents a promising strategy for targeting public neoantigens in cancer. The ability to target shared oncogenic mutations and viral epitopes offers the potential for broad applicability across multiple cancer types. However, overcoming the challenges of antigen heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment will be critical to realizing the full potential of these therapies. Continued research and clinical trials are essential to optimize TCR-based approaches and improve outcomes for patients with cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy", "authors": "Schumacher, Ton N., Schreiber, Robert D.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "348", "first page": "69", "last page": "74", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaa4971"}, {"title": "KRAS: from undruggable to druggable in cancer", "authors": "Cox, Adrienne D., Fesik, Stephen W., Kimmelman, Alec C., Luo, Ji, Der, Channing J.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Drug Discovery", "year": "2014", "volumes": "13", "first page": "828", "last page": "851", "DOI": "10.1038/nrd4389"}, {"title": "T-cell transfer therapy targeting mutant KRAS in cancer", "authors": "Tran, Eric, Robbins, Paul F., Lu, Yi-Chen, Prickett, Todd D., Gartner, Joseph J., Jia, Lijun, Pasetto, Anna, Zheng, Zhiya, Ray, Sandhya, Groh, Eric M.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2016", "volumes": "375", "first page": "2255", "last page": "2262", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1609279"}, {"title": "Mutational landscape and significance across 12 major cancer types", "authors": "Kandoth, Cyriac, McLellan, Michael D., Vandin, Fabio, Ye, Ke, Niu, Beifang, Lu, Chang, Xie, Miao, Zhang, Qunyuan, McMichael, Joshua F., Wyczalkowski, Matthew A.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "502", "first page": "333", "last page": "339", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12634"}, {"title": "Neoantigen screening identifies broad TP53 mutant immunogenicity in patients with epithelial cancers", "authors": "Malekzadeh, Parisa, Pasetto, Anna, Robbins, Paul F., Parkhurst, Meredith R., Paria, Bita C., Jia, Lijun, Gartner, Joseph J., Hill, Valerie, Yu, Zhiya, Restifo, Nicholas P.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "129", "first page": "1109", "last page": "1114", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI123791"}, {"title": "Viral and non-viral causes of human cancers", "authors": "Bzhalava, Davit, Muhr, Laila S.
