{"Literature Review": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective permeability barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the central nervous system (CNS). It plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS by regulating the entry of substances, including therapeutic agents. This barrier poses a significant challenge in the treatment of CNS tumors, both primary and metastatic, as it limits the delivery of potentially effective chemotherapeutic agents to the brain (Abbott et al., 2010). The BBB is composed of endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes, which together form a tight junction that restricts the passage of molecules (Obermeier et al., 2013). \n\nThe treatment of CNS tumors has historically been challenging due to the protective nature of the BBB. Primary CNS tumors, such as glioblastomas, are particularly difficult to treat, with poor clinical outcomes that have not significantly improved over the past few decades (Stupp et al., 2005). The BBB restricts the delivery of many chemotherapeutic agents, which are often large, hydrophilic, or substrates for efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (Agarwal et al., 2011). These transporters actively pump drugs out of the brain, further complicating treatment efforts. \n\nRecent advances in the treatment of extracranial solid tumors have led to an increased incidence of CNS metastases, as patients live longer and systemic therapies fail to adequately penetrate the CNS (Lin and DeAngelis, 2015). This highlights the need for improved drug delivery strategies that can overcome the BBB and effectively target CNS tumors. Several approaches are being explored to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, including the use of nanoparticles, focused ultrasound, and chemical modification of drugs to increase lipophilicity (Pardridge, 2012). \n\nNanoparticles have shown promise in enhancing drug delivery to the brain by facilitating the transport of drugs across the BBB. These particles can be engineered to carry therapeutic agents and target specific receptors on the BBB, allowing for increased permeability and drug accumulation in the brain (Saraiva et al., 2016). Focused ultrasound is another innovative technique that temporarily disrupts the BBB, allowing for the passage of drugs into the brain. This method has been shown to increase the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents in preclinical models and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials (Hynynen et al., 2006). \n\nChemical modification of drugs to increase their lipophilicity is another strategy to enhance BBB penetration. Lipophilic drugs are more likely to passively diffuse across the BBB, although this approach must be balanced with the potential for increased systemic toxicity (Pardridge, 2012). Additionally, prodrug strategies, where an inactive precursor of a drug is administered and converted into the active form within the brain, are being investigated to improve CNS drug delivery (Rautio et al., 2008). \n\nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics play a critical role in the development of CNS therapeutics. Understanding the relationship between drug concentration, time, and therapeutic effect is essential for optimizing treatment regimens (de Lange and Danhof, 2002). The heterogeneity of CNS tumors, both across different cancer subtypes and within individual tumors, further complicates treatment efforts. This heterogeneity necessitates a personalized approach to therapy, where drug delivery strategies are tailored to the specific characteristics of the tumor and the patient (Verhaak et al., 2010). \n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration is essential for advancing the treatment of CNS tumors. Researchers, clinicians, and industry partners must work together to develop a common vocabulary and shared goals to overcome the challenges posed by the BBB. By leveraging advances in drug delivery technologies, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, the field is poised for renewed progress in the treatment of CNS cancers. Continued research and innovation are needed to improve clinical outcomes for patients with these challenging tumors.", "References": [{"title": "Blood-brain barrier: physiological and molecular mechanisms", "authors": "Abbott, N.
