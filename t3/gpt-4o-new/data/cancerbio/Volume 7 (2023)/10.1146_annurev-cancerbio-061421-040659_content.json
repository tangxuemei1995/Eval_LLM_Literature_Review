{"Literature Review": "The development of organoid models has significantly advanced cancer research by providing a more accurate representation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vitro. These three-dimensional (3D) cultures maintain the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of tumors, which are critical for understanding cancer biology and treatment responses (Clevers, 2016). The integration of immune cells into organoid models is a burgeoning area of research, driven by the need to better mimic the complex interactions within the TME, particularly in the context of immunotherapy (Dijkstra et al., 2018). \n\nOrganoids derived from patient tumors, known as patient-derived organoids (PDOs), have shown promise in reflecting patient-specific responses to therapies, thus paving the way for personalized medicine (Vlachogiannis et al., 2018). However, traditional organoid cultures lack the immune components of the TME, which are crucial for studying immune-oncology interactions and the efficacy of immunotherapies (Neal et al., 2018). To address this gap, various coculture systems have been developed to incorporate immune cells into organoid models, each with unique advantages and limitations. \n\nOne approach involves the use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a source of immune cells. PBMCs can be isolated from patients and cocultured with organoids to study immune cell infiltration and tumor-immune interactions (Neal et al., 2018). This method allows for the examination of patient-specific immune responses and the testing of immunotherapeutic agents in a personalized context. However, maintaining the viability and functionality of immune cells in long-term culture remains a challenge (Dijkstra et al., 2018). \n\nAnother strategy is the incorporation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) into organoid cultures. TILs are isolated directly from tumor tissues and are more representative of the immune cells present in the TME (Dijkstra et al., 2018). This approach provides insights into the natural immune response to tumors and the potential for TIL-based therapies. However, the isolation and expansion of TILs can be technically demanding and may not be feasible for all tumor types (Neal et al., 2018). \n\nRecent advances have also seen the use of engineered immune cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, in organoid cocultures. These engineered cells can be designed to target specific tumor antigens, providing a powerful tool for studying targeted immunotherapies (Jung et al., 2021). The use of CAR T cells in organoid models allows for the evaluation of their efficacy and potential off-target effects in a controlled environment. However, the complexity of engineering these cells and the need for specific tumor antigens limit their widespread application (Jung et al., 2021). \n\nIn addition to immune cells, other nonimmune components of the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, have been successfully incorporated into organoid cultures. These cells play critical roles in tumor progression and response to therapy, and their inclusion in organoid models provides a more comprehensive understanding of the TME (Neal et al., 2018). For instance, fibroblasts can influence the immune landscape of tumors by modulating cytokine production and extracellular matrix composition (Dijkstra et al., 2018). Endothelial cells, on the other hand, are essential for studying angiogenesis and the delivery of therapeutics within the TME (Jung et al., 2021). \n\nThe integration of immune and nonimmune cells into organoid models has opened new avenues for cancer research, particularly in the field of immunotherapy. These coculture systems offer a platform for studying the complex interactions within the TME and for testing novel therapeutic strategies. However, challenges remain in standardizing these models and ensuring their reproducibility across different laboratories (Vlachogiannis et al., 2018). \n\nIn conclusion, the engineering of the immune microenvironment into organoid models represents a significant advancement in cancer research. By faithfully recapitulating the TME, these models provide valuable insights into tumor biology and the development of personalized therapies. As the field continues to evolve, further refinement of coculture techniques and the incorporation of additional TME components will enhance the utility of organoid models in cancer research.", "References": [{"title": "Organoids: A new approach to human disease", "authors": "Hans Clevers", "journal": "Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044152"}, {"title": "Convergence of organoid and immune cell technologies for precision medicine", "authors": "Kasper Dijkstra, Lodewyk F.
