{"Literature Review": "The advent of FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) has introduced a novel paradigm in the field of radiobiology, challenging traditional concepts of radiation therapy. FLASH-RT is characterized by its ultrahigh dose rate, delivering radiation doses in less than 500 milliseconds, which is significantly faster than conventional radiotherapy. This rapid delivery is associated with the 'FLASH effect,' a phenomenon where normal tissue toxicity is reduced while maintaining effective tumor control. The potential of FLASH-RT to expand the therapeutic index has generated considerable interest and research efforts aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications. \n\nThe concept of dose rate in radiotherapy is not new, but the ultrahigh dose rates used in FLASH-RT are unprecedented. Previous studies have shown that dose rate can influence the biological effects of radiation. For instance, Fowler (1989) discussed the impact of dose rate on the repair of sublethal damage and the repopulation of cells during fractionated radiotherapy, suggesting that higher dose rates could potentially reduce normal tissue damage by limiting the time for repair processes (Fowler, 1989). However, the dose rates in FLASH-RT exceed those traditionally studied, necessitating a reevaluation of radiobiological principles. \n\nThe FLASH effect, first observed in preclinical studies, has been demonstrated in various animal models. Favaudon et al. (2014) reported that mice exposed to FLASH-RT exhibited significantly less lung fibrosis compared to those treated with conventional dose rates, without compromising tumor control (Favaudon et al., 2014). This finding was pivotal in establishing the potential of FLASH-RT to spare normal tissues. Subsequent studies have corroborated these results across different tissue types, including skin and brain, further supporting the generalizability of the FLASH effect (Montay-Gruel et al., 2017; Vozenin et al., 2019). \n\nThe mechanisms underlying the FLASH effect remain a subject of intense investigation. One hypothesis suggests that the ultrahigh dose rate induces a transient hypoxic environment in normal tissues, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative damage (Durante et al., 2018). This is supported by studies showing that the protective effect of FLASH-RT is diminished under conditions of normoxia (Loo et al., 2017). Additionally, the role of the immune system in mediating the FLASH effect is being explored, with evidence suggesting that FLASH-RT may modulate immune responses differently than conventional radiotherapy (Bourhis et al., 2019). \n\nDespite promising preclinical data, the translation of FLASH-RT into clinical practice presents several challenges. The technical requirements for delivering ultrahigh dose rates necessitate specialized equipment and precise dosimetry, which are not yet widely available. Furthermore, the optimal parameters for FLASH-RT, such as dose, fractionation, and treatment volume, need to be defined through rigorous clinical trials. Early-phase clinical studies are underway, aiming to establish safety and efficacy in human patients (Vozenin et al., 2020). \n\nThe potential of FLASH-RT to revolutionize cancer treatment is significant, but it also raises important questions about the future of radiobiology. The traditional linear-quadratic model, which has guided radiotherapy planning for decades, may not adequately describe the biological effects observed at ultrahigh dose rates. This necessitates the development of new models and frameworks to predict treatment outcomes and optimize therapy (Cunningham et al., 2020). \n\nIn conclusion, FLASH radiotherapy represents a promising advancement in cancer treatment, offering the potential to enhance the therapeutic index by sparing normal tissues while effectively targeting tumors. The FLASH effect challenges existing radiobiological paradigms and underscores the need for continued research to elucidate its mechanisms and clinical applications. As the field progresses, collaboration between physicists, biologists, and clinicians will be essential to fully realize the potential of FLASH-RT and integrate it into standard oncological practice.", "References": [{"title": "The linear-quadratic formula and progress in fractionated radiotherapy", "authors": "Fowler, J.
