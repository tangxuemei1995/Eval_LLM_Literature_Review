{"Literature Review": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a transformative technique in structural biology, offering insights into the architecture of biological macromolecules at near-atomic resolution. This method has gained prominence due to its ability to visualize large and complex structures that are often intractable by traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The evolution of cryo-EM into a high-resolution technique is attributed to advancements in both hardware and software, which have collectively enhanced its resolution and applicability. \n\nHistorically, the development of cryo-EM can be traced back to the pioneering work of Dubochet and colleagues, who introduced the concept of vitrification to preserve biological samples in their native state (Dubochet et al., 1988). This breakthrough allowed for the imaging of samples without the need for crystallization, a significant limitation in X-ray crystallography. The introduction of direct electron detectors marked another milestone, significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enabling the capture of high-resolution images (Li et al., 2013). These detectors, coupled with sophisticated image processing algorithms, have facilitated the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional projections, a process that has been refined over the years (Scheres, 2012).\n\nDespite these advancements, cryo-EM is not without its limitations. One of the primary challenges is the issue of beam-induced motion, which can blur images and reduce resolution. This problem has been partially mitigated by the development of motion correction algorithms that track and compensate for sample movement during imaging (Bai et al., 2015). Another significant hurdle is the presence of optical aberrations, which can distort images and complicate the interpretation of structural data. Advances in computational methods, such as the use of phase plates and aberration correction software, have been instrumental in addressing these issues (Feng et al., 2017).\n\nThe resolution of cryo-EM is also limited by the quality of the sample preparation. The process of vitrification, while preserving the native state of the sample, can introduce artifacts such as preferred orientation and aggregation, which can hinder accurate structure determination (Glaeser, 2016). Efforts to improve sample preparation techniques, including the development of new grid materials and support films, are ongoing and hold promise for enhancing the quality of cryo-EM data (Russo and Passmore, 2014).\n\nLooking to the future, several developments are poised to further enhance the capabilities of cryo-EM. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into image processing workflows is expected to streamline data analysis and improve the accuracy of structure determination (Zhu et al., 2019). Additionally, the development of more powerful electron microscopes with improved optics and automation capabilities will likely expand the range of structures that can be studied using cryo-EM (Cheng, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, single-particle cryo-EM has revolutionized the field of structural biology, providing unprecedented insights into the structure and function of biological macromolecules. While challenges remain, ongoing technological advancements and methodological innovations continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with this powerful technique. As cryo-EM continues to evolve, it is poised to play an increasingly central role in the elucidation of complex biological systems, complementing and extending the capabilities of traditional structural biology methods.", "References": [{"title": "Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens", "authors": "Jacques Dubochet, Michel Adrian, Jean-Jacques Chang, Jacques Dubochet, Jean-Claude Lepault, Alain W.
