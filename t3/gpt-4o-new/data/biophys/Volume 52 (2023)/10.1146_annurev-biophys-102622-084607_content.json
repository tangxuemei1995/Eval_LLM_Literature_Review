{"Literature Review": "The prediction of protein structures has been a central challenge in computational biology for decades. The complexity of protein folding and the vast diversity of protein structures have necessitated the development of sophisticated computational methods to predict three-dimensional (3D) structures from amino acid sequences. Two major community-wide blind prediction experiments, CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) and CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions), have played pivotal roles in advancing the field by providing platforms for benchmarking and evaluating prediction methods. \n\nThe CASP experiment, initiated in 1994, has been instrumental in assessing the progress of protein structure prediction methods. It has highlighted the importance of accurate modeling of single protein chains, which is crucial for understanding protein function and interactions. Over the years, CASP has witnessed incremental improvements in prediction accuracy, largely driven by advances in homology modeling, threading, and ab initio methods (Moult et al., 1995). However, the recent introduction of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the field, leading to unprecedented levels of accuracy in predicting protein structures (Senior et al., 2020). \n\nDeep learning approaches, particularly those utilizing neural networks, have significantly enhanced the ability to predict protein structures by learning complex patterns from large datasets. AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind, is a prime example of how deep learning can be harnessed to achieve remarkable accuracy in structure prediction. In CASP14, AlphaFold demonstrated a median Global Distance Test (GDT) score of 92.4, indicating near-experimental accuracy for many targets (Jumper et al., 2021). This breakthrough has been attributed to the integration of evolutionary information, structural templates, and advanced neural network architectures, which collectively enable the prediction of accurate 3D structures from sequences. \n\nThe CAPRI experiment, on the other hand, focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions and complexes. Accurate modeling of protein complexes is essential for understanding cellular processes and designing therapeutic interventions. While progress in this area has been slower compared to single-chain predictions, recent advances in machine learning and integrative modeling approaches have shown promise. Methods that combine structural data with experimental information, such as cryo-electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry, have improved the accuracy of complex predictions (Lensink et al., 2019). \n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into protein structure prediction has not only improved accuracy but also expanded the scope of computational structural biology. AI-based methods are now being used to predict the effects of mutations, design novel proteins, and explore protein dynamics. These applications are transforming the field by providing insights into protein function and facilitating the development of new therapeutics (Yang et al., 2019). \n\nDespite these advances, several challenges remain. One major challenge is the accurate prediction of protein complexes, particularly those involving transient interactions or large assemblies. The complexity of these systems requires the development of more sophisticated algorithms that can capture the dynamic nature of protein interactions. Additionally, the integration of AI with experimental data poses challenges related to data quality, standardization, and interpretation (Bryant et al., 2020). \n\nAnother challenge is the need for more comprehensive datasets that encompass the diversity of protein structures and interactions. While deep learning models have benefited from large sequence databases, the availability of high-quality structural data remains a limiting factor. Efforts to expand structural databases and improve data sharing are crucial for the continued advancement of the field (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021). \n\nIn conclusion, the field of protein structure prediction has undergone a transformative shift with the advent of deep learning methodologies. The success of AI-based approaches in CASP and CAPRI highlights the potential of these technologies to address longstanding challenges in structural biology. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of AI with experimental techniques and the development of new computational methods will be key to unlocking the full potential of protein structure prediction.", "References": [{"title": "A large-scale experiment to assess protein structure prediction methods", "authors": "John Moult, Krzysztof Fidelis, Brian Rost, Tim Hubbard, Alexei Tramontano", "journal": "Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics", "year": "1995", "volumes": "23", "first page": "ii", "last page": "iv", "DOI": "10.1002/prot.340230303"}, {"title": "Improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning", "authors": "Andrew W.
