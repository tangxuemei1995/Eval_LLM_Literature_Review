{"Literature Review": "Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for biosensing applications due to their unique properties, such as high specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and the ability to support quantum mechanical phenomena. These materials offer significant advantages for the detection of biomolecules, including high sensitivity and the potential for single-molecule detection. The large surface area of 2D materials allows for a high density of active sites for biomolecule interaction, which is crucial for enhancing the sensitivity of biosensors (Novoselov et al., 2004). The electrical properties of graphene, such as its high carrier mobility and tunable bandgap, make it particularly suitable for field-effect transistor (FET) based biosensors (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). \n\nGraphene's ability to modulate electrical charge density in response to biomolecule binding is a key mechanism in its sensing capabilities. This modulation can be detected as changes in current or capacitance, providing a direct electrical readout of biomolecule interactions (Schedin et al., 2007). The sensitivity of graphene-based sensors can reach zeptomolar concentrations, allowing for the detection of single molecules (Ohno et al., 2009). However, achieving specificity in complex biological mixtures remains a significant challenge. The presence of various biomolecules can lead to non-specific binding, which affects the accuracy of the sensor (Zhang et al., 2014). \n\nDefects in 2D materials, such as vacancies, grain boundaries, and functional groups, can significantly influence their sensing performance. While defects can enhance sensitivity by providing additional active sites for biomolecule interaction, they can also introduce noise and variability in sensor response (Banhart et al., 2011). Therefore, understanding and controlling the nature and distribution of defects is crucial for the development of reliable 2D material-based biosensors. \n\nThe integration of 2D materials into FET-based biosensors has been extensively studied. FET biosensors leverage the field effect to transduce biomolecule binding events into measurable electrical signals. The high surface-to-volume ratio of 2D materials enhances the interaction between the target biomolecules and the sensor surface, leading to significant changes in the electrical properties of the device (Cai et al., 2014). The use of impedance models to interpret these changes provides insights into the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecule interactions (Hess et al., 2011). \n\nStandardization and calibration of 2D material-based biosensors are critical for their practical application, particularly in point-of-care settings. Calibration against known standards ensures the accuracy and reproducibility of sensor measurements, which is essential for clinical diagnostics (Pumera, 2011). The development of standardized protocols for sensor fabrication, functionalization, and testing will facilitate the widespread adoption of 2D material-based biosensors in healthcare. \n\nThe potential of graphene and other 2D materials to revolutionize healthcare lies in their ability to provide rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of biomolecules. The establishment of a roadmap for the deployment of these sensors in point-of-care platforms will require addressing challenges related to specificity, defect control, and standardization. Advances in material synthesis, device engineering, and data analysis will play a crucial role in overcoming these challenges and realizing the full potential of 2D material-based biosensors (Akinwande et al., 2014). \n\nIn conclusion, graphene and 2D materials offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced biosensors. Their unique properties enable the detection of biomolecules with high sensitivity and specificity, making them ideal candidates for point-of-care diagnostics. Continued research into the fundamental properties of these materials, as well as the development of robust sensor platforms, will be essential for their successful integration into healthcare applications.", "References": [{"title": "Electric field effect in atomically thin carbon films", "authors": "K.
