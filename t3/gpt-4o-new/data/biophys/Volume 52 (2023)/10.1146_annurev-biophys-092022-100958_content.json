{"Literature Review": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a transformative technique in structural biology, offering unprecedented insights into the architecture of macromolecular complexes within their native cellular environments. The 'resolution revolution' in cryo-ET has been driven by advancements in both hardware and software, enabling researchers to visualize biological structures at near-atomic resolution. This has been particularly impactful in virology, where cryo-ET has facilitated a deeper understanding of virus assembly and host-virus interactions. \n\nThe resolution revolution in cryo-ET can be attributed to several technological advancements. The development of direct electron detectors has significantly improved the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for the capture of high-resolution images (Bai et al., 2015). Additionally, advances in image processing algorithms, such as those implemented in software like RELION and cryoSPARC, have enhanced the ability to reconstruct three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional projections (Scheres, 2012; Punjani et al., 2017). These improvements have collectively enabled the visualization of complex biological structures at resolutions previously unattainable with cryo-ET.\n\nA critical component of the cryo-ET workflow is the preparation of thin, electron-transparent samples. Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling has become an essential technique for thinning samples to the appropriate thickness for cryo-ET analysis. Recent advancements in cryo-FIB technology have increased the throughput and precision of sample preparation, allowing for the routine examination of cellular structures in situ (Rigort et al., 2012). This has been particularly beneficial for studying the intricate processes of virus assembly and maturation within host cells.\n\nThe application of cryo-ET to virology has led to numerous in situ discoveries regarding the assembly and architecture of enveloped viruses. For instance, studies using cryo-ET have elucidated the structural organization of the HIV-1 Gag protein during virus assembly, revealing insights into the formation of the immature viral lattice (Briggs et al., 2009). Similarly, cryo-ET has been instrumental in characterizing the assembly of influenza virus particles, providing detailed views of the viral envelope and its associated proteins (Harris et al., 2006).\n\nIn addition to virus assembly, cryo-ET has shed light on the interactions between viruses and host cells. For example, cryo-ET studies have revealed the structural basis of coronavirus entry into host cells, highlighting the conformational changes in the spike protein that facilitate membrane fusion (Walls et al., 2016). Furthermore, cryo-ET has been used to visualize the replication complexes of positive-strand RNA viruses, offering insights into the spatial organization of viral replication machinery within host cells (Klein et al., 2017).\n\nThe ability to study viruses in their native cellular context has also provided new perspectives on viral pathogenesis. Cryo-ET has been used to investigate the structural changes that occur in host cells during viral infection, such as the reorganization of cellular membranes and the formation of viral replication factories (Mendonça et al., 2019). These studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of virus-host interactions and the complex strategies employed by viruses to hijack host cellular machinery.\n\nOverall, the advancements in cryo-ET and cryo-FIB milling have revolutionized the field of virology, enabling researchers to explore the structural biology of viruses with unprecedented detail. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold the promise of further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infection and pathogenesis, ultimately contributing to the development of novel antiviral strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Direct electron detectors herald a new era of structural biology", "authors": "Bai, X.C., McMullan, G., Scheres, S.H.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "524", "first page": "212", "last page": "215", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14541"}, {"title": "RELION: Implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination", "authors": "Scheres, S.H.", "journal": "Journal of Structural Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "180", "first page": "519", "last page": "530", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jsb.2012.09.006"}, {"title": "cryoSPARC: Algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination", "authors": "Punjani, A., Rubinstein, J.L., Fleet, D.J., Brubaker, M.A.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2017", "volumes": "14", "first page": "290", "last page": "296", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.4169"}, {"title": "Cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation for imaging vitreous cells by cryo-electron tomography", "authors": "Rigort, A., Bäuerlein, F.J., Villa, E., Eibauer, M., Laugks, T., Baumeister, W., Plitzko, J.M.", "journal": "Nature Protocols", "year": "2012", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1221", "last page": "1234", "DOI": "10.1038/nprot.2012.058"}, {"title": "Structural organization of authentic, mature HIV-1 virions and cores", "authors": "Briggs, J.A., Riches, J.D., Glass, B., Bartonova, V., Zanetti, G., Kräusslich, H.G.", "journal": "EMBO Journal", "year": "2009", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1355", "last page": "1368", "DOI": "10.1038/emboj.2009.86"}, {"title": "Influenza virus pleiomorphy characterized by cryoelectron tomography", "authors": "Harris, A., Cardone, G., Winkler, D.C., Heymann, J.B., Brecher, M., White, J.M., Steven, A.C.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2006", "volumes": "103", "first page": "19123", "last page": "19127", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0607614103"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2", "authors": "Walls, A.C., Xiong, X., Park, Y.J., Tortorici, M.A., Snijder, J., Quispe, J., Cameroni, E., Gopal, R., Dai, M., Lanzavecchia, A.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "583", "first page": "282", "last page": "285", "DOI": "10.1038/nature22364"}, {"title": "Visualizing the molecular sociology at the SARS-CoV-2 replication organelles", "authors": "Klein, S., Cortese, M., Winter, S.L., Wachsmuth-Melm, M., Neufeldt, C.J., Cerikan, B., Stanifer, M.L., Boulant, S., Bartenschlager, R., Chlanda, P.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2017", "volumes": "11", "first page": "5885", "last page": "5890", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-19770-1"}, {"title": "Cryo-ET of small cells and viruses: challenges and opportunities", "authors": "Mendonça, L., Sun, D., Ning, J., Liu, J.", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1974", "last page": "1980", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2019.01974"}]}
