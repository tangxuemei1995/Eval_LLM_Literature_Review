{"Literature Review": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are pivotal components of the innate immune system in both animals and plants. These proteins are responsible for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading to the formation of multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes in animals and resistosomes in plants. The assembly and architecture of these complexes are crucial for mediating immune responses, and recent advances in structural biology have provided significant insights into their mechanisms of action. \n\nInflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that play a critical role in the innate immune response by activating inflammatory caspases, such as caspase-1, which in turn process pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into their active forms (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). The NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is one of the most studied inflammasomes and is activated by a wide range of stimuli, including microbial infections and cellular stress (Guo et al., 2015). Structural studies have revealed that upon activation, NLRP3 undergoes a conformational change that facilitates its oligomerization and the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1 to form the active inflammasome complex (Lu et al., 2014). \n\nIn plants, NLR proteins form resistosomes, which are analogous to inflammasomes in animals. These complexes are activated in response to pathogen effector proteins and play a crucial role in plant immunity by triggering hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death at the site of infection (Jones et al., 2016). Recent structural studies have provided insights into the assembly of plant resistosomes. For instance, the ZAR1 resistosome, a well-characterized plant NLR complex, forms a pentameric structure upon activation, which is essential for its function in immune signaling (Wang et al., 2019). The ZAR1 resistosome is activated through a series of conformational changes that involve the exchange of ADP for ATP, leading to the oligomerization of ZAR1 and the formation of a channel-like structure that is thought to mediate ion fluxes across the membrane, contributing to HR (Wang et al., 2019). \n\nDespite the functional similarities between inflammasomes and resistosomes, there are notable differences in their structural organization and activation mechanisms. Inflammasomes typically involve the recruitment of adaptor proteins and pro-caspases, whereas resistosomes are primarily composed of NLR proteins themselves. Additionally, the activation of inflammasomes often involves the sensing of a wide range of stimuli, while resistosomes are more specific to pathogen effectors (Jones et al., 2016). \n\nThe structural elucidation of NLR complexes has also highlighted the role of autoinhibition and ligand recognition in their activation. In both inflammasomes and resistosomes, NLR proteins are maintained in an autoinhibited state in the absence of stimuli. Ligand recognition induces conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition and promote oligomerization. For example, in the NLRP3 inflammasome, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain is thought to play a role in maintaining autoinhibition, and its interaction with ligands or other proteins is crucial for activation (Lu et al., 2014). Similarly, in the ZAR1 resistosome, the LRR domain is involved in recognizing pathogen effectors, leading to the activation of the complex (Wang et al., 2019). \n\nThe structural insights into NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes have significant implications for understanding their distinct mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic targeting. Inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome have shown promise in treating inflammatory diseases, highlighting the importance of structural studies in drug development (Guo et al., 2015). In plants, engineering NLR proteins with enhanced resistance to pathogens could improve crop resilience, which is crucial for food security (Jones et al., 2016). \n\nIn conclusion, the assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes are central to their function in immune signaling. Recent advances in structural biology have provided a deeper understanding of their activation mechanisms, highlighting both commonalities and differences between these complexes. Continued research in this area is likely to yield further insights into the regulation of innate immunity and its applications in medicine and agriculture.", "References": [{"title": "Inflammasomes and their role in health and disease", "authors": "Schroder, K., Tschopp, J.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "10", "first page": "316", "last page": "328", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2623"}, {"title": "Inflammasomes: mechanism of assembly, regulation and signalling", "authors": "Guo, H., Callaway, J.
