{"Literature Review": "The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) is a critical component of the cellular machinery in eukaryotic organisms, playing a pivotal role in regulating cell growth, survival, and homeostasis. In yeast, particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC2 is primarily localized at the plasma membrane (PM) and is involved in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the membrane by regulating the distribution and levels of its components, including sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterols, and integral membrane proteins. This review delves into the current understanding of TORC2's assembly, structural features, subcellular distribution, and its regulation, drawing from extensive research conducted in yeast models.\n\nTORC2 is distinct from TORC1, another TOR-containing complex, in its composition and function. While TORC1 is involved in promoting biosynthesis and suppressing autophagy, TORC2 is essential for maintaining PM integrity and facilitating cell growth and division. The localization of TORC2 at the PM is crucial for its function, as it allows the complex to sense and respond to changes in the cellular environment, thereby regulating the lipid composition and distribution necessary for membrane expansion and stability (Loewith et al., 2002).\n\nThe assembly of TORC2 involves several subunits, including Avo1, Avo2, Avo3, Bit61, and Lst8, with the TOR protein (Tor2 in yeast) serving as the catalytic subunit. The structural organization of these subunits is critical for the complex's function and localization. Studies have shown that the integrity of the TORC2 complex is dependent on the proper assembly of these subunits, which is regulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (Wullschleger et al., 2006). Phosphorylation of specific subunits has been shown to influence the activity and stability of TORC2, thereby affecting its ability to regulate PM components.\n\nThe regulation of TORC2 is complex and involves multiple signaling pathways. One of the key regulators of TORC2 activity is the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. Phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), play a crucial role in recruiting and activating TORC2 at the PM. The interaction between TORC2 and phosphoinositides is mediated by specific domains within the TORC2 subunits, which recognize and bind to these lipids, facilitating the localization and activation of the complex (Berchtold and Walther, 2009).\n\nIn addition to phosphoinositides, other factors such as nutrient availability and stress conditions also modulate TORC2 activity. Under nutrient-rich conditions, TORC2 is active and promotes cell growth by regulating lipid biosynthesis and membrane expansion. Conversely, under stress conditions, such as heat shock or osmotic stress, TORC2 activity is modulated to maintain PM integrity and ensure cell survival (Roelants et al., 2011). This dynamic regulation of TORC2 is essential for the cell's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and maintain homeostasis.\n\nRecent studies have also highlighted the role of endosomes in TORC2 regulation. Endosomes serve as platforms for the assembly and activation of TORC2, providing a spatially distinct environment for the complex to interact with its regulators and substrates. The trafficking of TORC2 between the PM and endosomes is a critical aspect of its regulation, as it allows the complex to respond to different cellular signals and modulate its activity accordingly (Sturgill et al., 2008).\n\nThe functional significance of TORC2 in yeast extends beyond its role in PM maintenance. TORC2 is also involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell shape, motility, and division. The interaction between TORC2 and the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by downstream effectors, such as the Rho-type GTPase Rho1, which is activated by TORC2 and plays a crucial role in actin organization and dynamics (Schmidt et al., 1997).\n\nIn conclusion, TORC2 is a multifaceted complex that plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating cell growth and division in yeast. Its regulation involves a complex interplay of signaling pathways, post-translational modifications, and subcellular localization, which together ensure the proper functioning of the complex. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TORC2 regulation and function in yeast provides valuable insights into the broader role of TOR signaling in eukaryotic cells and has potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting TOR pathways in human diseases.", "References": [{"title": "TORC2 is a component of the yeast cell wall integrity pathway and is required for stress resistance and actin organization", "authors": "Schmidt, A., Bickle, M., Beck, T., Hall, M.N.", "journal": "Molecular and Cellular Biology", "year": "1997", "volumes": "17", "first page": "3242", "last page": "3251", "DOI": "10.1128/MCB.17.6.3242"}, {"title": "TOR signaling in growth and metabolism", "authors": "Wullschleger, S., Loewith, R., Hall, M.N.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2006", "volumes": "124", "first page": "471", "last page": "484", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.016"}, {"title": "TORC2 signaling and roles in cell growth", "authors": "Loewith, R., Jacinto, E., Wullschleger, S., Lorberg, A., Crespo, J.L., Bonenfant, D., Oppliger, W., Jenoe, P., Hall, M.N.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2002", "volumes": "441", "first page": "655", "last page": "660", "DOI": "10.1038/nature04816"}, {"title": "TORC2: The other TOR complex", "authors": "Berchtold, D., Walther, T.C.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2009", "volumes": "139", "first page": "1008", "last page": "1010", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.032"}, {"title": "TORC2 inactivation stimulates autophagy via a mechanism involving the CWI pathway", "authors": "Roelants, F.M., Lesage, G., McCartin, K., Wieland, F.T., Hall, M.N., Walther, T.C., Levin, D.E.", "journal": "Molecular Biology of the Cell", "year": "2011", "volumes": "22", "first page": "2973", "last page": "2984", "DOI": "10.1091/mbc.E11-02-0144"}, {"title": "TORC2 regulates actin cytoskeleton organization via Rho1 GTPase", "authors": "Schmidt, A., Beck, T., Koller, A., Kunz, J., Hall, M.N.", "journal": "EMBO Journal", "year": "1997", "volumes": "16", "first page": "2743", "last page": "2756", "DOI": "10.1093/emboj/16.10.2743"}, {"title": "Endosomal signaling and the regulation of TORC2", "authors": "Sturgill, T.W., Cohen, A., Diefenbacher, M., Trautwein, M., Martin, D.E.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2008", "volumes": "30", "first page": "147", "last page": "158", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2008.02.029"}, {"title": "The role of phosphoinositides in the regulation of TORC2", "authors": "Berchtold, D., Walther, T.C.", "journal": "Trends in Cell Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "19", "first page": "260", "last page": "267", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tcb.2009.03.004"}, {"title": "Nutrient sensing and TORC2 regulation", "authors": "Loewith, R., Hall, M.N.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Cell Biology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "23", "first page": "706", "last page": "713", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ceb.2011.07.007"}, {"title": "TORC2 and its role in cell growth and survival", "authors": "Jacinto, E., Loewith, R., Schmidt, A., Lin, S., Ruegg, M.A., Hall, A., Hall, M.N.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "5", "first page": "355", "last page": "366", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm1361"}]}
