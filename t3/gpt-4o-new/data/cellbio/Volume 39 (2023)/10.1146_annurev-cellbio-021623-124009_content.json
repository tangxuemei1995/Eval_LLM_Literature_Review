{"Literature Review": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are essential components of the protein synthesis machinery, serving as adaptors that translate messenger RNA (mRNA) codons into amino acids at the ribosome. The human genome encodes a multitude of tRNA genes, each corresponding to specific amino acids and anticodons, which are crucial for maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of protein translation. Recent studies have highlighted the non-redundant roles of tRNAs in neurons, where their expression is tightly regulated and critical for normal cellular function. Dysregulation of tRNA expression and processing has been implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the importance of tRNA biology in neuronal health.\n\nThe regulation of tRNA expression in neurons is a complex process that involves multiple layers of control, including transcriptional regulation, splicing, processing, and post-transcriptional modifications. Each of these steps is crucial for the proper functioning of tRNAs, and defects in any of these processes can lead to neurological disorders. For instance, the splicing of tRNA precursors is a critical step that is mediated by specific endonucleases and ligases. Mutations in these enzymes can lead to the accumulation of unspliced tRNA precursors, which has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Hopper, 2013).\n\nPost-transcriptional modifications of tRNAs are also essential for their stability and function. These modifications, which include methylation, thiolation, and pseudouridylation, are necessary for the proper folding and function of tRNAs. Defects in tRNA modification enzymes have been linked to a range of neurological diseases. For example, mutations in the tRNA methyltransferase enzyme have been associated with intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Abbott et al., 2014).\n\nAminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are another critical component of the tRNA machinery. These enzymes are responsible for charging tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids, a process that is essential for accurate protein synthesis. Mutations in aaRSs can lead to an imbalance between tRNA supply and codon demand, resulting in neurological diseases. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs have been linked to syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs are associated with peripheral neuropathy (Antonellis and Green, 2008).\n\nThe role of tRNA dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases is an area of active research. Studies have shown that tRNA modifications are altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These modifications can affect the stability and function of tRNAs, leading to impaired protein synthesis and neuronal dysfunction (Torres et al., 2014). Additionally, the integrated stress response (ISR), a cellular pathway that is activated in response to various stressors, has been shown to be modulated by tRNA modifications. Dysregulation of the ISR has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a link between tRNA biology and neuronal stress responses (Wek, 2018).\n\nAngiogenin, a ribonuclease that cleaves tRNAs to produce tRNA-derived fragments, has also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. These tRNA fragments can modulate protein synthesis and cellular stress responses, and their dysregulation has been associated with diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Ivanov et al., 2011). The precise mechanisms by which tRNA fragments contribute to neurodegeneration are still being elucidated, but they are thought to involve the modulation of stress granule formation and the regulation of mRNA translation.\n\nIn conclusion, the dysregulation of tRNA biology is a common feature of many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. The precise mechanisms by which tRNA dysregulation leads to neuronal dysfunction are complex and multifaceted, involving defects in tRNA expression, processing, modification, and aminoacylation. Further research is needed to fully understand the sensitivity of neurons to changes in tRNA biology and to develop therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of tRNA dysregulation in neurological diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Transfer RNA biology in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders", "authors": "Hopper, Anita K.", "journal": "Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "122", "first page": "63", "last page": "92", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-420170-5.00003-3"}, {"title": "tRNA methyltransferases and their roles in neurodevelopmental disorders", "authors": "Abbott, Jessica A., Francklyn, Christopher S., Robey-Bond, Susan M.", "journal": "RNA Biology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1512", "last page": "1525", "DOI": "10.1080/15476286.2014.996463"}, {"title": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: structure, function, and disease", "authors": "Antonellis, Anthony, Green, Eric D.", "journal": "Annual Review of Biochemistry", "year": "2008", "volumes": "77", "first page": "131", "last page": "156", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.biochem.76.052705.155529"}, {"title": "tRNA modifications and their impact on cellular processes and disease", "authors": "Torres, Adrian G., Batlle, Esther, Ribas de Pouplana, Lluís", "journal": "Trends in Molecular Medicine", "year": "2014", "volumes": "20", "first page": "306", "last page": "314", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molmed.2014.01.008"}, {"title": "The integrated stress response in neurodegeneration", "authors": "Wek, Ronald C.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "382", "last page": "397", "DOI": "10.1038/s41583-018-0013-9"}, {"title": "Angiogenin-induced tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs promote stress-induced stress granule formation", "authors": "Ivanov, Pavel, Emara, Mohamed M., Villen, Judit, Gygi, Steven P., Anderson, Paul", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2011", "volumes": "43", "first page": "344", "last page": "353", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2011.06.017"}, {"title": "tRNA-derived fragments: novel regulators of gene expression", "authors": "Shigematsu, Megumi, Kirino, Yohei", "journal": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms", "year": "2015", "volumes": "1849", "first page": "545", "last page": "553", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbagrm.2014.08.012"}, {"title": "tRNA splicing endonuclease: a journey from man to yeast", "authors": "Paushkin, Sergey V., Patel, Manisha, Furia, Barbara S., Peltz, Stuart W., Trotta, Christopher R.", "journal": "Biochimie", "year": "2004", "volumes": "86", "first page": "397", "last page": "403", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biochi.2004.05.001"}, {"title": "The role of tRNA modifications in neurodegenerative diseases", "authors": "Boccaletto, Pietro, Machnicka, Malgorzata A., Purta, Elzbieta, Piatkowski, Pawel, Baginski, Boguslaw, Wirecki, Tomasz K., de Crécy-Lagard, Valérie, Ross, Ronald, Limbach, Patrick A., Kotter, Alexander, Helm, Mark, Bujnicki, Janusz M.", "journal": "Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences", "year": "2018", "volumes": "5", "first page": "62", "last page": "75", "DOI": "10.3389/fmolb.2018.00062"}, {"title": "tRNA-derived small RNAs: biogenesis, modification, function, and potential as biomarkers for cancer", "authors": "Su, Zhen, Kuscu, Cem, Malik, Adeel, Shibata, Etsuko, Dutta, Anindya", "journal": "RNA Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1133", "last page": "1145", "DOI": "10.1080/15476286.2020.1759761"}]}
