{"Literature Review": "The Toll signaling pathway is a pivotal component of the immune response in many organisms, including insects, where it has been co-opted for roles beyond immunity, such as dorsoventral (DV) patterning. This dual functionality of Toll signaling in insects presents a fascinating example of neofunctionalization, where a gene or pathway acquires a new function after a duplication event or through evolutionary adaptation. The discovery of Toll's role in DV patterning was first made in Drosophila melanogaster, where it is essential for establishing the embryonic DV axis (Anderson et al., 1985). In Drosophila, the Toll pathway is activated by the ligand Sp채tzle, leading to the nuclear localization of the transcription factor Dorsal, which patterns the embryo by regulating gene expression along the DV axis (Morisato and Anderson, 1995). \n\nIn other insects, the role of Toll signaling in DV patterning varies significantly. For instance, in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, Toll signaling is involved in DV patterning, but its role is less pronounced compared to Drosophila, with a greater reliance on Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling (Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008). This suggests that while Toll signaling was integrated into the DV patterning system early in insect evolution, its role has been modulated in different lineages, possibly due to the expansion of BMP signaling, which is the primary pathway for DV patterning in most metazoans (De Robertis, 2008). \n\nThe integration of Toll signaling into DV patterning in insects may have occurred through a process of co-option, where a pre-existing immune function was adapted for a new developmental role. This is supported by the observation that Toll signaling has an immune function in the extraembryonic serosa of many insect embryos, a tissue that differentiates early in development (Jacobs et al., 2013). The serosa is involved in protecting the embryo from pathogens, and its early differentiation may have provided a context in which Toll signaling could be co-opted for DV patterning. \n\nIn more distantly related insects, such as the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus and the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, the role of Toll in DV patterning is even more reduced, with BMP signaling playing a more dominant role (Miyawaki et al., 2004; Lynch and Roth, 2011). This suggests a trend in insect evolution where the reliance on Toll signaling for DV patterning decreases as BMP signaling becomes more prominent. This trend is not observed outside of insects, where BMP signaling is the primary mechanism for DV patterning in all major metazoan lineages (De Robertis and Sasai, 1996). \n\nThe evolutionary history of Toll signaling in insects highlights the plasticity of developmental pathways and the potential for pathways to acquire new functions. The co-option of Toll signaling for DV patterning in insects may have been facilitated by the pre-existing immune function of the pathway, providing a selective advantage in the context of embryonic development. This scenario is supported by studies in non-insect hexapods, where Toll signaling is primarily associated with immunity, suggesting that its role in DV patterning is a derived feature of insects (Buchta et al., 2013). \n\nOverall, the neofunctionalization of Toll signaling in insects represents a compelling example of how evolutionary pressures can shape the functions of signaling pathways, leading to the diversification of developmental mechanisms. The interplay between Toll and BMP signaling in DV patterning across different insect lineages underscores the complexity of evolutionary adaptations and the dynamic nature of developmental systems.", "References": [{"title": "Establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo: the induction of polarity by the Toll gene product", "authors": "Anderson, K.
