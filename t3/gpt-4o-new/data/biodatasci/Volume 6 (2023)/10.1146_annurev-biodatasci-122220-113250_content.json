{"Literature Review": "The field of precision medicine has been significantly advanced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have provided insights into the genetic underpinnings of various diseases and traits. However, the initial focus of GWAS on populations of European descent has led to a skewed understanding of genetic associations, limiting the generalizability of findings across diverse ancestry groups. This literature review explores the importance of diversity in precision medicine, emphasizing the need for inclusive genetic research to improve the identification of disease susceptibility variants across different populations. \n\nThe early years of GWAS were marked by a Eurocentric bias, with over 80% of participants in these studies being of European ancestry (Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016). This lack of diversity has significant implications for the applicability of genetic findings to non-European populations. For instance, genetic variants identified in European populations may not have the same effect sizes or even be present in other ancestry groups, leading to inaccurate risk predictions and potential health disparities (Martin et al., 2019). \n\nEfforts to diversify GWAS have been underway, with initiatives such as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) consortium and the All of Us Research Program in the United States aiming to include underrepresented populations in genetic research (Rotimi et al., 2014; Denny et al., 2019). These initiatives have highlighted the importance of studying diverse populations to uncover novel genetic associations that are not detectable in European-centric studies. For example, a study by Wojcik et al. (2019) demonstrated that including diverse populations in GWAS led to the discovery of new loci associated with body mass index (BMI) that were not identified in European-only analyses. \n\nThe inclusion of diverse populations in genetic research also enhances the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are used to predict an individual's risk of developing certain diseases based on their genetic makeup. PRS derived from European populations often perform poorly in non-European groups, underscoring the need for ancestry-specific risk models (Martin et al., 2019). By incorporating genetic data from diverse populations, researchers can develop more accurate and equitable PRS, ultimately improving disease prediction and prevention strategies across different ancestry groups (Duncan et al., 2019). \n\nCollaborative consortia and study design approaches have been instrumental in diversifying GWAS. The Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, for example, has successfully included participants from multiple ancestry groups, leading to the identification of novel lipid-associated loci that are relevant across populations (Willer et al., 2013). Similarly, the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study has focused on understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations, providing valuable insights into the generalizability of genetic associations (Matise et al., 2011). \n\nThe advent of budget-friendly whole-genome sequencing technologies has further facilitated the inclusion of diverse populations in genetic research. These technologies allow for the comprehensive analysis of genetic variation across the entire genome, enabling the discovery of rare variants that may contribute to disease susceptibility in specific populations (Taliun et al., 2021). By leveraging these advancements, researchers can build more inclusive genotype-phenotype catalogs that reflect the true diversity of human genetics. \n\nIn conclusion, the importance of diversity in precision medicine cannot be overstated. By expanding the scope of genetic research to include diverse ancestry groups, we can improve the generalizability of genetic associations and enhance our understanding of disease susceptibility across populations. This inclusive approach not only addresses health disparities but also paves the way for more personalized and effective healthcare solutions. As the field of precision medicine continues to evolve, it is crucial to prioritize diversity in genetic research to ensure that the benefits of genomic discoveries are equitably distributed across all populations.", "References": [{"title": "The clinical imperative for inclusivity: Race, ethnicity, and ancestry (REA) in genomics", "authors": "Popejoy, Alice B., Fullerton, Stephanie M.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "175", "last page": "185", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg.2015.34"}, {"title": "Clinical use of current polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities", "authors": "Martin, Alicia R., Kanai, Masahiro, Kamatani, Yoichiro, Okada, Yukinori, Neale, Benjamin M., Daly, Mark J.", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "51", "first page": "584", "last page": "591", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-019-0379-x"}, {"title": "H3Africa: Enabling genomic research in Africa", "authors": "Rotimi, Charles N., Abayomi, Akinyemi, Abimiku, Alash'le, Adabayeri, Victor M., Adebamowo, Clement A., Adebiyi, Ezekiel, Ademola, Adebowale D., Adeyemo, Adebowale, Adu, Daniel, Affolabi, Rodrigue", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "344", "first page": "1346", "last page": "1348", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1251546"}, {"title": "The 'All of Us' Research Program", "authors": "Denny, Joshua C., Rutter, Jared L., Goldstein, David B., Philippakis, Anthony, Smoller, Jordan W., Jenkins, G.
