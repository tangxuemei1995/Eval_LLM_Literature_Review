{"Literature Review": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has been heralded as a transformative force, promising to enhance diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes. However, the efficacy of AI in healthcare is contingent upon the quality and representativeness of the underlying biomedical data. A growing body of literature highlights a significant challenge: biomedical data inequality, which refers to the underrepresentation of diverse populations in datasets used to train AI models. This inequality poses a risk of exacerbating health disparities, particularly for non-European populations, as AI models may not generalize well across different demographic groups. \n\nBiomedical data inequality is rooted in historical and systemic biases in data collection practices. Studies have shown that clinical trials and genomic studies predominantly involve individuals of European descent, leading to a skewed representation in biomedical datasets (Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016). This lack of diversity can result in AI models that are less accurate for underrepresented groups, potentially leading to misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatment recommendations (Obermeyer et al., 2019). The implications of such biases are profound, as they can perpetuate existing health disparities and undermine the potential benefits of AI in healthcare.\n\nRecent research has focused on understanding the impact of data inequality on machine learning models. One study by Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated that models trained on imbalanced datasets tend to perform poorly on minority groups, highlighting the need for more inclusive data collection practices. Furthermore, the concept of 'subpopulation shift' has been introduced to describe the phenomenon where AI models trained on one demographic group fail to generalize to others (Suresh and Guttag, 2021). This shift underscores the importance of developing models that are robust to variations in population characteristics.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have proposed several algorithmic interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of data inequality. Transfer learning, for instance, has been explored as a technique to improve model performance across diverse populations by leveraging knowledge from well-represented groups (Pan and Yang, 2010). Additionally, fairness-aware machine learning algorithms have been developed to ensure equitable model performance across different demographic groups (Zemel et al., 2013). These approaches aim to reduce bias in AI models and promote health equity.\n\nAnother promising avenue for addressing data inequality is the use of synthetic data generation. Techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been employed to create synthetic datasets that reflect the diversity of the human population (Frid-Adar et al., 2018). By augmenting existing datasets with synthetic data, researchers can improve the representativeness of training data and enhance model performance for underrepresented groups.\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain in ensuring data quality across different ethnic groups. Recent studies have identified disparities in data quality, with some groups having less accurate or incomplete data (Gianfrancesco et al., 2018). This can further exacerbate biases in AI models, as poor-quality data can lead to erroneous predictions. Addressing these disparities requires concerted efforts to improve data collection practices and ensure that all populations are adequately represented in biomedical datasets.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI holds great promise for transforming healthcare, the issue of biomedical data inequality must be addressed to realize its full potential. Efforts to improve data diversity and quality, coupled with algorithmic interventions, are essential to mitigate health disparities and ensure that AI benefits all populations equitably. Future research should continue to explore innovative solutions for addressing data inequality and promoting health equity in the era of AI-driven healthcare.", "References": [{"title": "Genomics is failing on diversity", "authors": "Popejoy, A.
