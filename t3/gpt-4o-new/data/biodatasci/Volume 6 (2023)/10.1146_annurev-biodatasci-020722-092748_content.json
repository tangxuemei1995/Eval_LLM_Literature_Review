{"Literature Review": "Breast cancer remains a significant public health concern, with risk assessment being a critical component in the management and treatment of the disease. The integration of molecular and radiomic features represents a promising frontier in personalized medicine, offering the potential to enhance the precision of risk stratification. This literature review explores the current state of research in combining molecular and radiomic features for breast cancer risk assessment, highlighting key studies and emerging trends. \n\nBreast density, as measured by conventional mammography, has long been recognized as a significant risk factor for breast cancer. High breast density is associated with a four to six-fold increase in breast cancer risk (Boyd et al., 2007). However, breast density alone is limited in its ability to capture the complexity of breast parenchymal patterns, which can provide additional insights into cancer risk. Recent advances in radiomics, which involve the extraction of quantitative features from medical images, have shown promise in enhancing risk assessment models by capturing these complex patterns (Mann et al., 2019). Radiomic features can include texture, shape, and intensity, which may correlate with underlying biological processes associated with cancer development. \n\nOn the molecular front, genetic factors have been extensively studied for their role in breast cancer risk. High-penetrance mutations, such as those in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are well-established risk factors (Antoniou et al., 2003). However, these mutations are relatively rare in the general population. More common are low-penetrance genetic variants, which individually confer a modest increase in risk but can collectively have a significant impact when combined into polygenic risk scores (PRS) (Mavaddat et al., 2015). PRS have been shown to improve risk prediction models, particularly when integrated with traditional risk factors such as family history and lifestyle factors. \n\nThe integration of radiomic and molecular features for breast cancer risk assessment is an emerging area of research. Few studies have explored the combined use of these biomarkers, but the potential for improved risk stratification is significant. For instance, McCarthy et al. (2016) demonstrated that combining mammographic texture features with genetic information improved the accuracy of risk prediction models. Similarly, a study by Yala et al. (2019) found that integrating deep learning-based mammographic features with genetic data enhanced the prediction of breast cancer risk. These studies suggest that the combination of radiomic and molecular features can provide complementary information, leading to more accurate risk assessments. \n\nDespite these promising findings, several challenges remain in the integration of radiomic and molecular features. One major challenge is the standardization of radiomic feature extraction and analysis. Variability in imaging protocols and feature extraction methods can lead to inconsistencies in radiomic data, which can affect the reliability of risk models (Zwanenburg et al., 2020). Efforts to standardize radiomic analysis, such as the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI), are crucial for advancing this field. \n\nAnother challenge is the integration of diverse data types, including imaging, genetic, and clinical data. Advanced computational methods, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, are increasingly being used to address this challenge. These methods can handle large, complex datasets and identify patterns that may not be apparent through traditional statistical approaches (Esteva et al., 2017). However, the development of robust, interpretable models that can be applied in clinical practice remains an ongoing area of research. \n\nIn conclusion, the integration of molecular and radiomic features holds great promise for improving breast cancer risk assessment. While significant progress has been made, further research is needed to address the challenges of standardization and data integration. As these challenges are overcome, the combined use of imaging and genetic biomarkers has the potential to transform breast cancer risk assessment, leading to more personalized and effective screening and prevention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Mammographic density and the risk and detection of breast cancer", "authors": "Boyd, Norman F., Guo, Hong, Martin, Lisa J., Sun, Lei, Stone, Jennifer, Fishell, Elaine, Jong, Roberta A., Hislop, T.
