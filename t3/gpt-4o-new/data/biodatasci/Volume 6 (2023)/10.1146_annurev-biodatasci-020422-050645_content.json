{"Literature Review": "The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and transcriptomic states within complex biological systems. This technology has enabled researchers to dissect the cellular composition of tissues at an unprecedented resolution, revealing insights into cellular differentiation, development, and disease states (Tang et al., 2009). However, the transcriptome is only one aspect of cellular identity, and recent advances in single-cell technologies have expanded the scope to include genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data, collectively referred to as single-cell multiomics. These technologies provide a more comprehensive view of cellular biology by capturing multiple layers of information from individual cells.\n\nSingle-cell multiomics technologies can be broadly categorized into those that measure multiple modalities simultaneously from the same cell and those that measure different modalities from separate cells. Technologies such as CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing) and REAP-seq (RNA Expression and Protein sequencing) allow for the simultaneous measurement of RNA and surface protein expression, providing insights into the relationship between transcriptomic and proteomic states (Stoeckius et al., 2017; Peterson et al., 2017). Similarly, methods like scATAC-seq (single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) and scM&T-seq (single-cell Methylome and Transcriptome sequencing) enable the concurrent profiling of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation alongside transcriptomic data, offering a window into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (Buenrostro et al., 2015; Angermueller et al., 2016).\n\nIn addition to these simultaneous measurement techniques, computational methods have been developed to integrate data from different modalities that are assayed separately. These methods are crucial for leveraging the full potential of single-cell multiomics, as they allow for the integration of diverse datasets to provide a holistic view of cellular states and interactions. One such approach is the use of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its extensions, which have been employed to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, aligning cells across modalities based on shared features (Butler et al., 2018). Another popular method is the use of matrix factorization techniques, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which decompose data into a set of basis components that can be used to identify shared and unique features across modalities (Duren et al., 2018).\n\nThe integration of single-cell multiomics data not only enhances our understanding of cellular identity but also provides insights into the interactions between different biological layers. For instance, the integration of genomic and transcriptomic data can reveal how genetic variations influence gene expression patterns, while the combination of epigenomic and transcriptomic data can elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression changes (Clark et al., 2018). Moreover, the integration of spatial data with other modalities allows for the mapping of cellular interactions and tissue architecture, providing a spatial context to molecular data (St√•hl et al., 2016).\n\nDespite the promise of single-cell multiomics, several challenges remain. One major challenge is the technical variability and noise inherent in single-cell data, which can complicate data integration and interpretation. To address this, computational methods have been developed to account for batch effects and other sources of variability, improving the robustness of integrated analyses (Haghverdi et al., 2018). Another challenge is the scalability of these methods, as the increasing size and complexity of single-cell datasets require efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale data integration (Stuart et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, single-cell multiomics represents a powerful approach for dissecting the complexity of biological systems at the cellular level. The development of novel technologies and computational methods for integrating multimodal data has opened new avenues for understanding cellular identity and function. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to transform our understanding of biology and disease, providing insights that were previously unattainable with single-modality approaches.", "References": [{"title": "mRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell", "authors": "Tang, F., Barbacioru, C., Wang, Y., Nordman, E., Lee, C., Xu, N., Wang, X., Bodeau, J., Tuch, B.
