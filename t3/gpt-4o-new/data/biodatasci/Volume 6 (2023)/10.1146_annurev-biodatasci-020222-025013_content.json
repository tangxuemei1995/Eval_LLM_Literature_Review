{"Literature Review": "The field of drug discovery has been revolutionized by the advent of computational techniques, particularly structure-based virtual screenings (SBVSs). These methods have emerged as a pivotal tool in addressing the challenges of high development costs, prolonged timelines, and the limited approval of new drugs. SBVSs leverage the three-dimensional structures of biological targets to identify potential drug candidates, offering a more targeted approach compared to traditional methods. Recent advancements in ultralarge virtual screenings (ULVSs) have further enhanced the capabilities of SBVSs, enabling the exploration of vast chemical spaces and the identification of novel compounds with therapeutic potential. \n\nThe foundation of SBVSs lies in molecular docking, a computational technique that predicts the preferred orientation of a small molecule when bound to a target protein. This process is crucial for understanding the interaction dynamics and potential efficacy of a drug candidate. The accuracy of molecular docking has been significantly improved by incorporating more sophisticated scoring functions and algorithms that account for the flexibility of both the ligand and the protein (Meng et al., 2011). These improvements have been instrumental in increasing the reliability of SBVSs in drug discovery pipelines. \n\nOne of the most significant developments in SBVSs is the integration of machine learning and deep learning techniques. These approaches have been employed to enhance the prediction accuracy of docking scores and to streamline the virtual screening process. For instance, deep learning models have been trained to predict binding affinities with remarkable precision, outperforming traditional scoring functions (Jiménez et al., 2018). Moreover, machine learning algorithms have been utilized to prioritize compounds for experimental validation, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with drug discovery (Gomes et al., 2017). \n\nThe advent of GPU acceleration has also played a crucial role in the evolution of SBVSs. By harnessing the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs, researchers have been able to perform virtual screenings on an unprecedented scale. This has facilitated the exploration of ultralarge chemical libraries, comprising billions of compounds, in a feasible timeframe (Gorgulla et al., 2020). The ability to screen such vast libraries has opened new avenues for identifying drug candidates that target previously undruggable receptor classes, such as protein-protein interactions. \n\nRecent success stories in ULVSs highlight their transformative potential in early-stage drug discovery. For example, the identification of novel inhibitors for challenging targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, has been achieved through ULVSs, demonstrating their efficacy in rapidly responding to emerging health threats (Ton et al., 2020). These successes underscore the importance of ULVSs in expanding the druggable chemical space and accelerating the discovery of new therapeutics. \n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in the implementation of SBVSs and ULVSs. One of the primary concerns is the accurate prediction of binding free energies, which is critical for assessing the potential efficacy of a drug candidate. Free energy simulations, such as molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling techniques, have been employed to address this issue, providing more reliable estimates of binding affinities (Abel et al., 2017). However, these methods are computationally intensive and require further optimization to be routinely integrated into virtual screening workflows. \n\nLooking forward, the future of SBVSs and ULVSs is promising, with several research directions poised to enhance their impact on drug discovery. The development of more accurate and efficient scoring functions, the integration of multi-target screening approaches, and the incorporation of real-time feedback from experimental data are expected to further refine these techniques. Additionally, the continued advancement of AI-driven methodologies and the expansion of publicly available chemical libraries will likely drive the next wave of innovations in this field. \n\nIn conclusion, SBVSs and ULVSs represent a paradigm shift in drug discovery, offering a more efficient and targeted approach to identifying new therapeutics. The integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning, GPU acceleration, and free energy simulations, has significantly enhanced their capabilities, paving the way for the discovery of novel drug candidates. As these methods continue to evolve, they hold the potential to transform the landscape of drug discovery, making it more accessible and effective in addressing global health challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Molecular docking: a powerful approach for structure-based drug discovery", "authors": "Meng, X.
