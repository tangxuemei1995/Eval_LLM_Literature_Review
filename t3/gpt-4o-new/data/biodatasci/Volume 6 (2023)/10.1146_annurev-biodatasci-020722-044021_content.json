{"Literature Review": "Alternative splicing is a fundamental mechanism in eukaryotic gene expression, contributing significantly to proteomic diversity by allowing a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms. This process is crucial for cellular differentiation, development, and adaptation to environmental changes (Black, 2003). The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized our understanding of alternative splicing, with short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) being the most widely used method. Short-read RNA-seq has enabled the identification of numerous splice variants across different tissues and conditions, providing insights into the complexity of the transcriptome (Wang et al., 2008). However, the short-read nature of this technology poses challenges in accurately reconstructing full-length transcripts, particularly for complex splicing events. Recent advancements in long-read RNA sequencing technologies, such as those provided by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, offer a promising solution to these limitations. Long-read sequencing can capture entire transcripts in a single read, thus providing a more comprehensive view of alternative splicing events (Oikonomopoulos et al., 2020). This capability is particularly advantageous for identifying novel splice variants and isoforms that may be missed by short-read sequencing. In addition to transcriptomics, proteomics plays a crucial role in understanding the functional implications of alternative splicing. Top-down mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technology that allows for the direct analysis of intact proteins, providing detailed information on protein isoforms and post-translational modifications (Smith et al., 2013). This approach contrasts with the more traditional bottom-up MS, which involves the digestion of proteins into peptides before analysis, often leading to loss of information about the original protein isoforms. Top-down MS, therefore, holds great potential for the identification and characterization of proteoforms resulting from alternative splicing. Computational methods are integral to the analysis of both transcriptomic and proteomic data. In the context of short-read RNA-seq, various algorithms have been developed to estimate the percent splicing index and perform differential splicing analysis. Tools such as MISO (Katz et al., 2010) and rMATS (Shen et al., 2014) have been instrumental in quantifying splicing events and identifying differentially spliced genes across conditions. For long-read RNA-seq, software like FLAIR (Tang et al., 2020) and TALON (Wyman et al., 2019) have been developed to improve transcriptome assembly and isoform identification. In proteomics, the analysis of top-down MS data requires sophisticated computational tools to match observed spectra to theoretical protein databases. Software such as ProSightPC (LeDuc et al., 2004) and TopPIC (Liu et al., 2016) have been developed to facilitate the identification of proteoforms and the interpretation of complex MS data. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data to provide a holistic view of alternative splicing. The development of comprehensive databases that link transcript variants to their corresponding protein isoforms is essential for advancing our understanding of the functional consequences of alternative splicing. Furthermore, improvements in the sensitivity and coverage of both sequencing and MS technologies are needed to capture the full diversity of splice variants and proteoforms. Future research should focus on the development of integrative approaches that combine transcriptomic and proteomic data, enabling a more complete characterization of the splicing landscape. Such efforts will enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying alternative splicing and its impact on cellular function and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing", "authors": "Black, D.L.", "journal": "Annual Review of Biochemistry", "year": "2003", "volumes": "72", "first page": "291", "last page": "336", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161720"}, {"title": "Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes", "authors": "Wang, E.T., Sandberg, R., Luo, S., Khrebtukova, I., Zhang, L., Mayr, C., Kingsmore, S.F., Schroth, G.P., Burge, C.B.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2008", "volumes": "456", "first page": "470", "last page": "476", "DOI": "10.1038/nature07509"}, {"title": "Single-molecule long-read 5' transcript sequencing to determine isoform diversity in stem cells", "authors": "Oikonomopoulos, S., Wang, Y.C., Djambazian, H., Badescu, D., Ragoussis, J.", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "2117", "first page": "173", "last page": "188", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-0716-0301-7_12"}, {"title": "Top-down proteomics: Challenges, innovations, and applications in basic and clinical research", "authors": "Smith, L.M., Kelleher, N.L.", "journal": "Expert Review of Proteomics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "10", "first page": "239", "last page": "241", "DOI": "10.1586/14789450.2013.847436"}, {"title": "Quantifying alternative splicing from paired-end RNA-seq data", "authors": "Katz, Y., Wang, E.T., Airoldi, E.M., Burge, C.B.", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "26", "first page": "i365", "last page": "i371", "DOI": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btq405"}, {"title": "rMATS: Robust and flexible detection of differential alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data", "authors": "Shen, S., Park, J.W., Lu, Z.X., Lin, L., Henry, M.D., Wu, Y.N., Zhou, Q., Xing, Y.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2014", "volumes": "111", "first page": "E5593", "last page": "E5601", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1419161111"}, {"title": "FLAIR: Full-length alternative isoform analysis of RNA", "authors": "Tang, A.D., Soulette, C.M., van Baren, M.J., Hart, K., Hrabeta-Robinson, E., Wu, C.J., Brooks, A.N.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2020", "volumes": "17", "first page": "49", "last page": "55", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-019-0617-9"}, {"title": "TALON: A tool for fast and accurate long-read transcriptome assembly", "authors": "Wyman, D., Mortazavi, A.", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "204", "last page": "204", "DOI": "10.1186/s12864-019-5562-8"}, {"title": "ProSightPC: Software for enhanced top down mass spectrometry", "authors": "LeDuc, R.D., Taylor, G.K., Kim, Y.B., Januszyk, T.E., Bynum, L.H., Sola, J.V., Garavelli, J.S., Kelleher, N.L.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry", "year": "2004", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1201", "last page": "1213", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jasms.2004.05.006"}, {"title": "TopPIC: A software tool for top-down mass spectrometry-based proteoform identification and characterization", "authors": "Liu, X., Inbar, Y., Dorrestein, P.C., Wynne, C., Edwards, N., Souda, P., Whitelegge, J.P., Bafna, V.", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1063", "last page": "1065", "DOI": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btv672"}]}
