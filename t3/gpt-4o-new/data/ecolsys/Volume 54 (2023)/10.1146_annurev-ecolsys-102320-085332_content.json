{"Literature Review": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, with significant implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. While much attention has been given to surface SOC, deep SOC, which constitutes over 70% of total SOC, remains underexplored (Rumpel and Kögel-Knabner, 2011). Deep SOC, located at depths greater than 20 cm, is influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors compared to surface SOC, and its response to global change drivers such as warming, altered precipitation patterns, elevated CO2 levels, and land use changes is not well understood (Jobbágy and Jackson, 2000). This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the response of deep SOC to these global change drivers, highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies that include deep soil layers.\n\nWarming is a significant driver of SOC dynamics, with temperature increases potentially accelerating SOC decomposition rates. However, the response of deep SOC to warming may differ from that of surface SOC due to the reduced influence of microbial activity and the increased role of mineral stabilization at greater depths (Davidson and Janssens, 2006). Studies have shown that warming can lead to increased SOC decomposition in surface soils, but the effect on deep SOC is less clear (Conant et al., 2011). Some research suggests that deep SOC may be less sensitive to temperature changes due to its association with mineral surfaces, which can protect organic matter from microbial decomposition (Schmidt et al., 2011).\n\nShifting precipitation patterns, another aspect of global change, can also impact SOC dynamics. Changes in soil moisture can influence microbial activity and SOC decomposition rates. However, the effects of altered precipitation on deep SOC are not well documented. Surface SOC is more directly affected by changes in precipitation due to its proximity to the soil surface and greater exposure to moisture fluctuations (Lal, 2004). In contrast, deep SOC may be buffered against short-term changes in precipitation, although long-term shifts in moisture regimes could alter deep SOC dynamics by affecting root growth and organic matter inputs (Trumbore, 2009).\n\nElevated atmospheric CO2 levels can enhance plant growth and increase organic matter inputs to soils, potentially affecting SOC storage. While surface SOC may respond rapidly to increased plant inputs, the response of deep SOC is less certain. Elevated CO2 can stimulate root growth and exudation, potentially increasing carbon inputs to deeper soil layers (Iversen, 2010). However, the extent to which these inputs translate into increased deep SOC storage depends on the balance between carbon inputs and decomposition rates, which are influenced by soil properties and microbial activity (Kell, 2011).\n\nLand use and land cover changes, such as deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization, are major drivers of SOC dynamics. These changes can alter the quantity and quality of organic matter inputs, soil structure, and microbial communities, all of which influence SOC storage and turnover (Guo and Gifford, 2002). While the impacts of land use change on surface SOC are well documented, the effects on deep SOC are less understood. Some studies suggest that land use changes can lead to significant losses of deep SOC, particularly when deep soil layers are disturbed by activities such as plowing or construction (Don et al., 2011).\n\nDespite the importance of deep SOC in the global carbon cycle, few studies have explicitly focused on its response to global change drivers. Most research has concentrated on surface soils, leading to a gap in our understanding of deep SOC dynamics. This gap is partly due to the logistical challenges of sampling and analyzing deep soils, as well as the complexity of deep SOC interactions with soil minerals and microbial communities (Rumpel and Kögel-Knabner, 2011). To address this gap, it is crucial for future research to incorporate deep soils into experimental designs and modeling efforts. This will improve our understanding of deep SOC responses to global change and enhance the accuracy of carbon cycle models and climate projections (Schmidt et al., 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, deep SOC plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, yet its response to global change drivers remains poorly understood. Warming, altered precipitation patterns, elevated CO2 levels, and land use changes all have the potential to impact deep SOC dynamics, but more research is needed to elucidate these effects. By incorporating deep soils into global change studies, scientists can improve predictions of SOC responses to climate change and inform the development of effective climate mitigation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Deep soil organic carbon: a key but poorly understood component of terrestrial C cycle", "authors": "Rumpel, C., Kögel-Knabner, I.", "journal": "Plant and Soil", "year": "2011", "volumes": "338", "first page": "143", "last page": "158", "DOI": "10.1007/s11104-010-0391-5"}, {"title": "The vertical distribution of soil organic carbon and its relation to climate and vegetation", "authors": "Jobbágy, E.G., Jackson, R.B.", "journal": "Ecological Applications", "year": "2000", "volumes": "10", "first page": "423", "last page": "436", "DOI": "10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0423:TVDOSO]2.0.CO;2"}, {"title": "Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change", "authors": "Davidson, E.A., Janssens, I.A.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "440", "first page": "165", "last page": "173", "DOI": "10.1038/nature04514"}, {"title": "Temperature and soil organic matter decomposition rates - synthesis of current knowledge and a way forward", "authors": "Conant, R.T., Ryan, M.G., Ågren, G.I., Birge, H.E., Davidson, E.A., Eliasson, P.E., Evans, S.E., Frey, S.D., Giardina, C.P., Hopkins, F.M.", "journal": "Global Change Biology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "17", "first page": "3392", "last page": "3404", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02496.x"}, {"title": "Persistence of soil organic matter as an ecosystem property", "authors": "Schmidt, M.W.I., Torn, M.S., Abiven, S., Dittmar, T., Guggenberger, G., Janssens, I.A., Kleber, M., Kögel-Knabner, I., Lehmann, J., Manning, D.A.C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "478", "first page": "49", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10386"}, {"title": "Soil carbon sequestration impacts on global climate change and food security", "authors": "Lal, R.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2004", "volumes": "304", "first page": "1623", "last page": "1627", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1097396"}, {"title": "Radiocarbon and soil carbon dynamics", "authors": "Trumbore, S.", "journal": "Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences", "year": "2009", "volumes": "37", "first page": "47", "last page": "66", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124300"}, {"title": "Digging deeper: fine-root responses to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration in forested ecosystems", "authors": "Iversen, C.M.", "journal": "New Phytologist", "year": "2010", "volumes": "186", "first page": "346", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03122.x"}, {"title": "How deep do roots go?", "authors": "Kell, D.B.", "journal": "Trends in Plant Science", "year": "2011", "volumes": "16", "first page": "616", "last page": "618", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tplants.2011.09.006"}, {"title": "Soil carbon stocks and land use change: a meta analysis", "authors": "Guo, L.B., Gifford, R.M.", "journal": "Global Change Biology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "8", "first page": "345", "last page": "360", "DOI": "10.1046/j.1354-1013.2002.00486.x"}]}
