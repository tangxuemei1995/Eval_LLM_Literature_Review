{"Literature Review": "Abnormal grain growth (AGG) is a phenomenon in materials science where certain grains within a polycrystalline material grow significantly larger than their neighbors, often by an order of magnitude. This process can lead to a variety of grain shapes, including prismatic and dendritic forms, and has significant implications for the mechanical and physical properties of materials. Understanding the mechanisms behind AGG and its microstructural outcomes is crucial for controlling material properties in applications ranging from metallurgy to ceramics. \n\nThe phenomenon of AGG is primarily driven by differences in grain boundary (GB) mobility and energy. Grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet, and their properties significantly influence grain growth. The classical theory of grain growth suggests that grains grow to reduce the total energy of the system, which is primarily stored in the grain boundaries. However, in AGG, certain grains grow disproportionately, suggesting that these grains have a growth advantage due to variations in GB properties. \n\nOne of the key factors influencing AGG is the anisotropy in GB mobility. Anisotropic GB mobility means that the rate at which a grain boundary moves can vary depending on its orientation relative to the crystallographic axes. This anisotropy can lead to preferential growth of certain grains, as demonstrated in studies by Gottstein and Shvindlerman (1999), who showed that anisotropic mobility can result in abnormal grain growth patterns. Their work highlighted that grains with higher mobility boundaries grow faster, leading to the development of abnormal grains. \n\nAnother important factor is the anisotropy in GB energy. The energy of a grain boundary is dependent on its orientation and the misorientation between the adjoining grains. Grains with lower energy boundaries are more stable and less likely to grow, while those with higher energy boundaries are more likely to grow to reduce the system's overall energy. This concept was further explored by Humphreys and Hatherly (2004), who demonstrated that variations in GB energy can lead to the preferential growth of certain grains, contributing to AGG. \n\nThe role of Zener pinning in AGG is also significant. Zener pinning occurs when second-phase particles impede the movement of grain boundaries, stabilizing the microstructure and preventing normal grain growth. However, in some cases, these particles can lead to AGG by pinning certain boundaries more effectively than others, allowing unpinned grains to grow abnormally. This mechanism was investigated by Manohar et al. (1998), who found that the distribution and size of second-phase particles can significantly influence the occurrence of AGG. \n\nSimulations of AGG have provided further insights into the mechanisms driving this phenomenon. Computational models, such as those developed by Holm et al. (2001), have shown that the morphological signature of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. These models simulate the evolution of grain structures under different conditions, allowing researchers to predict the outcomes of AGG based on variations in GB properties. \n\nDespite these advances, open questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms by which the growth advantage in AGG is established and maintained. For instance, the role of solute drag, where solute atoms at the grain boundary slow down its movement, is not fully understood. Solute drag can either promote or inhibit AGG depending on the specific interactions between solute atoms and the grain boundary, as discussed by Cahn and Hagel (1962). \n\nFurthermore, the interaction between GB mobility and energy anisotropies and their combined effect on AGG is complex and not yet fully elucidated. The interplay between these factors can lead to a wide range of microstructural outcomes, making it challenging to predict AGG behavior in different materials. Recent studies by Rollett et al. (2015) have emphasized the need for more comprehensive models that incorporate both mobility and energy anisotropies to better understand AGG. \n\nIn conclusion, AGG is a complex phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, including GB mobility and energy anisotropies, Zener pinning, and solute drag. While significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms behind AGG, further research is needed to fully elucidate the conditions under which AGG occurs and to develop strategies for controlling it in materials processing.", "References": [{"title": "Grain Boundary Migration in Metals: Thermodynamics, Kinetics, Applications", "authors": "Gottstein, G., Shvindlerman, L.
