{"Literature Review": "Grain boundary migration is a fundamental process in the evolution of microstructures in polycrystalline materials. It is driven by the reduction of the system's total excess energy, which is primarily associated with the grain boundaries themselves. The migration of grain boundaries has been extensively studied in bicrystals, where the factors influencing migration rates are relatively well understood. However, recent studies have highlighted that these factors are insufficient to fully explain grain boundary migration in polycrystals, which are more complex due to the presence of multiple grains and grain boundary interactions. \n\nAt the atomistic level, grain boundary migration is influenced by the atomic structure and chemistry of the boundary. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and atomistic simulations have provided insights into the mechanisms of migration. For instance, studies have shown that the migration of grain boundaries can be facilitated by the movement of disconnections, which are line defects that possess both step and dislocation character (Cahn et al., 2006). These disconnections can move along the boundary, leading to its migration. The role of impurities and solute atoms in pinning or dragging grain boundaries has also been investigated, with findings indicating that solute atoms can significantly alter the mobility of grain boundaries (Mishin et al., 2010). \n\nAt the continuum scale, the migration of grain boundaries in polycrystals is often studied using high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) and phase-field simulations. These methods allow for the observation and modeling of grain boundary migration over larger length scales. HEDM, in particular, has been instrumental in providing three-dimensional insights into the microstructural evolution of polycrystals (Li et al., 2012). Phase-field models have been used to simulate grain growth and boundary migration, incorporating factors such as boundary curvature and stored energy differences between grains (Steinbach, 2009). However, these models often assume that the driving force for migration is solely due to curvature, which may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of polycrystalline systems. \n\nRecent studies have suggested that additional factors, such as the presence of triple junctions and the interaction between multiple grain boundaries, play a significant role in the migration process in polycrystals (Upmanyu et al., 2006). Triple junctions, where three grain boundaries meet, can act as sources or sinks for disconnections, influencing the overall migration behavior. Moreover, the anisotropy in grain boundary energy and mobility can lead to non-uniform migration rates, further complicating the prediction of microstructural evolution (Olmsted et al., 2009). \n\nThe inadequacy of current simulations to reproduce experimental observations of grain growth in polycrystals may be attributed to the simplified representation of the driving force for migration. While curvature is a significant factor, it is not the only one. The stored energy differences due to dislocations, the presence of second-phase particles, and the influence of external stresses are all factors that can contribute to the driving force for grain boundary migration (Humphreys et al., 2004). \n\nTo improve our understanding of grain boundary migration in polycrystals, it is essential to conduct detailed comparisons between experimental observations and atomistic simulations. Such comparisons can help identify the limitations of current models and suggest modifications to better capture the complexity of polycrystalline systems. For instance, incorporating the effects of solute drag, triple junction dynamics, and anisotropic boundary properties into simulations could lead to more accurate predictions of grain growth and microstructural evolution. \n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding grain boundary migration in bicrystals, the migration in polycrystals remains a complex phenomenon that requires further investigation. The integration of experimental techniques such as HRTEM and HEDM with advanced simulation methods holds promise for unraveling the mechanisms governing grain boundary migration in polycrystalline materials.", "References": [{"title": "A unified theory of disconnections and grain boundary migration", "authors": "John W.
