{"Literature Review": "The quest for sustainable polymers derived from biological matter has gained significant momentum in recent years, driven by the urgent need to reduce reliance on nonrenewable resources and mitigate environmental impacts. This literature review explores the progress in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter, focusing on the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, the emergence of polymers from unprocessed biomatter, and their applications in various fields. \n\nThe extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers have been a focal point in the development of sustainable materials. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most extensively studied biopolymers, derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane. PLA is biodegradable and has been used in a variety of applications, including packaging and biomedical devices (Auras et al., 2004). Another notable example is polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are produced by microbial fermentation of sugars or lipids. PHAs are biodegradable and have properties similar to conventional plastics, making them suitable for a wide range of applications (Chen, 2009). \n\nIn addition to these well-known biopolymers, there has been significant progress in developing new bioderived monomers. For instance, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a promising monomer derived from biomass, which can be used to produce polyethylene furanoate (PEF), a potential replacement for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (van Berkel et al., 2019). The development of such monomers is crucial for expanding the range of sustainable polymers available for various applications. \n\nThe emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter, such as entire cells or tissues, represents a novel approach to sustainable material development. This approach leverages the inherent properties of biological materials, such as their hierarchical structures and multifunctionality. For example, bacterial cellulose, produced by certain bacteria, has been explored for applications in wound dressings and tissue engineering due to its high purity, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility (Klemm et al., 2005). Similarly, mycelium-based materials, derived from fungal networks, have been investigated for use in packaging and construction due to their lightweight and insulating properties (Jones et al., 2020). \n\nSustainable polymers have found applications in various fields, including bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials. Bioplastics, such as PLA and PHAs, are increasingly used as alternatives to conventional plastics in packaging, agriculture, and consumer goods (Shen et al., 2009). Biocomposites, which combine natural fibers with biopolymers, offer enhanced mechanical properties and reduced environmental impact compared to traditional composites. For instance, flax fiber-reinforced PLA composites have been developed for automotive applications, providing a lightweight and sustainable alternative to glass fiber-reinforced plastics (Bledzki et al., 2007). \n\nCementitious biomaterials, which incorporate biological matter into cement-based materials, represent another promising application of sustainable polymers. These materials can improve the sustainability of construction by reducing the carbon footprint of cement production and enhancing the durability of concrete structures. For example, the incorporation of bacterial cellulose into cementitious materials has been shown to improve their mechanical properties and resistance to cracking (Chandrakaran et al., 2019). \n\nDespite the progress made in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter, several challenges remain. One of the key challenges is the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing the life-cycle impacts of these materials. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a critical tool for evaluating the environmental performance of materials, but its application to biopolymers is often limited by data availability and methodological uncertainties (Hermann et al., 2011). \n\nFurthermore, the socioeconomic challenges associated with the transition to sustainable materials must be addressed. This includes the need for policies and incentives to support the development and adoption of sustainable polymers, as well as the consideration of social and economic impacts on communities involved in the production of biological matter (Carus et al., 2010). \n\nIn conclusion, the development of sustainable polymers from biological matter holds great promise for reducing the environmental impact of materials and advancing towards a more sustainable future. Continued research and innovation in this field, coupled with the development of robust tools for life-cycle assessment and supportive policies, will be essential for realizing the full potential of these materials.", "References": [{"title": "Poly(lactic acid) packaging: The route to sustainable food packaging", "authors": "R.
