{"Literature Review": "The use of tailor-made additives (TMAs) in the field of crystal growth has been a subject of significant interest, particularly in the context of solution-based crystallization processes. TMAs are designed to interact specifically with crystal surfaces, thereby influencing crystal morphology through stereochemical recognition. This approach has been extensively studied and applied in solution crystallization, where the driving force for crystal growth is solute supersaturation. However, the application of TMAs in melt crystallization presents a different set of challenges and opportunities due to the distinct thermodynamic and kinetic conditions involved. \n\nIn melt crystallization, the primary thermodynamic parameter influencing crystallization is undercooling, which is the degree to which the temperature is lowered below the melting point of the substance. This contrasts with solution crystallization, where supersaturation is the key parameter. The role of TMAs in melt crystallization is less well understood, but recent studies have begun to elucidate their potential impact on crystal growth kinetics, morphology, and other properties. \n\nOne of the key differences between solution and melt crystallization is the nature of the driving force. In melt crystallization, the driving force is related to the degree of undercooling, which can significantly affect the growth kinetics and morphology of the resulting crystals. At low undercooling, where the driving force is small, TMAs can exert a significant influence on the growth of well-faceted single crystals, similar to their role in solution crystallization. This is because the diffusion rates are relatively high, allowing TMAs to interact effectively with the growing crystal surfaces (Garetz et al., 2002). \n\nHowever, at high undercooling, the situation changes dramatically. The large driving force can lead to the rapid growth of crystal ensembles, often in the form of spherulites, which can obscure the stereochemical information that TMAs are designed to impart. In such cases, the influence of TMAs may be masked, and new analytical techniques, such as advanced optical tools, are required to study the effects of TMAs on the emerging crystal structures (Lovette et al., 2008). \n\nThe role of TMAs in influencing the nucleation process in melt crystallization is another area of interest. TMAs can potentially affect the nucleation rate and the selection of specific polymorphs by stabilizing certain crystal faces or by promoting the formation of specific crystal structures. This is particularly relevant in the context of chiral molecules, where TMAs can be used to promote enantioselective nucleation and growth, thereby influencing the chirality of the resulting crystals (Viedma et al., 2008). \n\nThe ability of TMAs to influence the absolute sense of polar axes in crystals is another intriguing aspect of their application in melt crystallization. This is particularly important in the context of materials with polar properties, where the orientation of the polar axes can significantly affect the material's properties. TMAs can potentially be used to control the orientation of these axes, thereby tailoring the properties of the resulting crystals (Kahr et al., 2009). \n\nDespite the potential benefits of using TMAs in melt crystallization, there are also challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the design of TMAs that are effective under the specific conditions of melt crystallization. This requires a deep understanding of the interactions between TMAs and the crystal surfaces, as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions of the crystallization process (Davey et al., 2000). \n\nIn conclusion, while the use of TMAs in melt crystallization is still in its early stages, there is significant potential for their application in this field. By understanding the unique conditions of melt crystallization and designing TMAs that can effectively interact with crystal surfaces under these conditions, it may be possible to achieve the same level of control over crystal morphology and properties as has been achieved in solution crystallization. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of TMAs in melt crystallization and to develop new tools and techniques for studying their effects.", "References": [{"title": "Tailor-made additives for controlling crystal growth: An overview", "authors": "Garetz, B.
