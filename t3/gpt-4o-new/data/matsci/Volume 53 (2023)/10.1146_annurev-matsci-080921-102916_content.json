{"Literature Review": "The field of soft robotics has emerged as a promising area of research, aiming to bridge the gap between artificial and biological systems by leveraging the unique properties of soft, compliant materials. These materials enable soft robots to exhibit traits akin to living organisms, such as adaptability and morphological computation, which are essential for achieving physical intelligence (Kim et al., 2013). However, the selection of materials for soft robotics often involves trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency, particularly when it comes to actuation. Electrically controllable materials have been identified as key to overcoming these challenges, offering a pathway to more efficient and versatile soft robotic systems (Shintake et al., 2018).\n\nElectroprogrammable materials, which can be actuated by electric currents and fields, are at the forefront of this research. These materials can be broadly categorized into thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical actuation strategies. Thermomechanical actuators, such as shape memory alloys (SMAs) and shape memory polymers (SMPs), rely on temperature changes induced by electrical currents to achieve actuation. SMAs, for instance, have been widely studied for their ability to undergo significant deformation upon heating, making them suitable for applications requiring large strokes and high force outputs (Jani et al., 2014). SMPs, on the other hand, offer the advantage of lower density and greater flexibility, although they typically exhibit slower response times compared to SMAs (Lendlein and Kelch, 2002).\n\nElectrostatic actuation, which involves the use of electric fields to induce motion, is another promising approach for soft robotics. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a prime example of this strategy, as they can produce large strains and are capable of rapid actuation. DEAs consist of a soft elastomeric material sandwiched between two compliant electrodes, and their actuation is driven by the electrostatic forces generated when a voltage is applied across the electrodes (Pelrine et al., 2000). Despite their potential, DEAs face challenges related to high operating voltages and material durability, which have spurred ongoing research into new materials and configurations to enhance their performance (Keplinger et al., 2012).\n\nElectrochemical actuation, which exploits chemical reactions driven by electrical currents, offers another avenue for developing soft robotic materials. Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) and conducting polymers are two notable examples of electrochemical actuators. IPMCs consist of a polymer membrane plated with metal electrodes, and their actuation is driven by the migration of ions within the polymer matrix in response to an applied voltage (Shahinpoor et al., 1998). Conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole and polyaniline, undergo reversible redox reactions that result in volume changes, enabling actuation (Smela, 2003). These materials are particularly attractive for applications requiring low-voltage operation and biocompatibility, although their response times and mechanical properties can be limiting factors.\n\nThe integration of sensors and control systems is another critical aspect of developing soft, bioinspired machines. Advances in flexible and stretchable electronics have enabled the development of sensors that can be seamlessly integrated into soft robotic systems, providing real-time feedback on parameters such as strain, pressure, and temperature (Rogers et al., 2010). These sensors, combined with advanced control algorithms, can enhance the autonomy and adaptability of soft robots, allowing them to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments (Majidi, 2014).\n\nLooking ahead, the design and fabrication of next-generation robotic materials will require a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from materials science, biology, and engineering. The development of multifunctional materials that can simultaneously act as actuators, sensors, and structural components will be crucial for achieving true bioinspired autonomy in soft robots. Additionally, advances in additive manufacturing and nanotechnology hold promise for creating complex, hierarchical structures that mimic the intricate architectures found in natural systems (Truby and Lewis, 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, electrically controllable materials represent a vital component in the quest to develop soft, bioinspired machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent. By harnessing the unique properties of thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical actuators, researchers are paving the way for soft robots that can operate efficiently and autonomously in a wide range of applications. Continued research in this area will undoubtedly lead to new breakthroughs in materials design and fabrication, bringing us closer to realizing the full potential of soft robotics.", "References": [{"title": "Soft robotics: A bioinspired evolution in robotics", "authors": "Kim, Sangbae, Laschi, Cecilia, Trimmer, Barry", "journal": "Trends in Biotechnology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "31", "first page": "287", "last page": "294", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.03.002"}, {"title": "Soft robotic grippers", "authors": "Shintake, Jun, Cacucciolo, Vincenzo, Floreano, Dario, Shea, Herbert", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2018", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1707035", "last page": "1707035", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201707035"}, {"title": "A review of shape memory alloy research, applications and opportunities", "authors": "Jani, J.
