{"Literature Review": "Polar metals represent a fascinating class of materials where the seemingly contradictory properties of polarity and metallicity coexist. The concept of polar metals was first introduced over half a century ago, but the realization of such materials has been fraught with challenges due to the inherent conflict between the itinerant carriers necessary for metallicity and the screening of polarization. However, recent advancements have led to the identification of materials such as LiOsO3 and WTe2, which exhibit these dual characteristics, thus opening new avenues for research and application in various fields including topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity, spintronics, and superconductivity. \n\nThe theoretical foundation for polar metals lies in the understanding of ferroelectricity and metallicity. Ferroelectric materials are characterized by a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by an external electric field. This property is typically associated with insulators, as the presence of free carriers in metals tends to screen the electric fields that drive polarization. However, the discovery of polar metals challenges this traditional view, suggesting that under certain conditions, metallicity and ferroelectricity can coexist. This has been supported by the work of Anderson and Blount, who first proposed the concept of polar metals in 1965, suggesting that certain structural distortions could lead to a polar metallic state (Anderson & Blount, 1965). \n\nThe breakthrough in the experimental realization of polar metals came with the discovery of LiOsO3, which was identified as the first polar metal. Shi et al. demonstrated that LiOsO3 undergoes a structural phase transition similar to that of ferroelectric insulators, but without the accompanying loss of metallicity (Shi et al., 2013). This discovery was pivotal as it provided a tangible example of a material that defies the conventional dichotomy between ferroelectricity and metallicity. \n\nAnother significant development in the field was the identification of WTe2 as a polar metal. WTe2 is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide that exhibits a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, leading to polar metallic behavior. The work by Fei et al. highlighted the potential of WTe2 in applications such as spintronics, due to its unique electronic properties and the presence of Weyl fermions (Fei et al., 2018). \n\nThe design and engineering of polar metals have been greatly facilitated by advances in computational methods and materials synthesis techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) has been instrumental in predicting the electronic structure and stability of potential polar metals. For instance, the work by Benedek and Fennie utilized DFT to explore the possibility of improper ferroelectricity in metallic systems, providing a theoretical framework for the design of new polar metals (Benedek & Fennie, 2011). \n\nImproper ferroelectricity, where the polarization arises as a secondary effect of a primary structural distortion, has emerged as a promising mechanism for achieving polar metallicity. This concept has been explored in perovskite oxides, where the coupling between different lattice modes can lead to a polar metallic state. The work by Bousquet et al. demonstrated that such coupling can be engineered to produce materials with both ferroelectric and metallic properties (Bousquet et al., 2008). \n\nThe implications of polar metals extend beyond fundamental science to potential technological applications. In the field of spintronics, the coexistence of polarity and metallicity in materials like WTe2 offers the possibility of controlling spin currents through electric fields, a key requirement for the development of spintronic devices. Additionally, the unique electronic properties of polar metals make them candidates for novel superconducting states, as suggested by the work of Puggioni and Rondinelli, who explored the interplay between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in polar metals (Puggioni & Rondinelli, 2014). \n\nThe exploration of polar metals is still in its nascent stages, with many open questions and challenges remaining. The development of new materials with enhanced polar metallic properties, the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that enable the coexistence of polarity and metallicity, and the exploration of their potential applications in technology are all promising directions for future research. As the field progresses, the integration of experimental and theoretical approaches will be crucial in advancing our understanding of these intriguing materials and unlocking their full potential.", "References": [{"title": "Symmetry considerations on martensitic transformations: Application to the transition from the rutile structure to the CaCl2 structure", "authors": "P.
