{"Literature Review": "The concepts of decent work and meaningful work have garnered significant attention in recent years, reflecting a growing interest in understanding the quality of work life and its implications for individuals, organizations, and society. Decent work, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO), encompasses opportunities for work that are productive and deliver a fair income, security in the workplace, social protection for families, better prospects for personal development, and social integration (International Labour Organization, 1999). On the other hand, meaningful work is often described as work that is perceived as significant and purposeful by the individual (Rosso, Dekas, & Wrzesniewski, 2010). While these constructs emerge from distinct perspectives, they are interconnected through the psychology of working theory, which posits that need satisfaction is a critical link between the two (Duffy et al., 2016).\n\nDecent work is a fundamental human right and a key component of sustainable development. It is associated with basic workplace conditions, including fair wages, safe working environments, and the absence of discrimination (Ghai, 2003). The ILO's decent work agenda emphasizes the importance of creating jobs, guaranteeing rights at work, extending social protection, and promoting social dialogue (International Labour Organization, 1999). Research has shown that decent work is positively correlated with job satisfaction, employee well-being, and organizational commitment (Burchell et al., 2014). Moreover, decent work is crucial for reducing poverty and inequality, promoting social cohesion, and fostering economic growth (Anker et al., 2003).\n\nMeaningful work, in contrast, is more aspirational and subjective, reflecting the significance and purpose individuals find in their work. It is often linked to intrinsic motivation, personal fulfillment, and a sense of contribution to a greater good (Steger, Dik, & Duffy, 2012). Meaningful work has been associated with numerous positive outcomes, including higher job satisfaction, increased engagement, and improved mental health (Allan, Autin, & Duffy, 2016). The search for meaningful work is deeply rooted in existential and humanistic psychology, which emphasizes the importance of finding purpose and meaning in life (Frankl, 1963).\n\nThe psychology of working theory provides a framework for understanding the relationship between decent work and meaningful work. This theory suggests that work fulfills three core human needs: survival and power, social connection, and self-determination (Duffy et al., 2016). Decent work primarily addresses the need for survival and power by ensuring fair wages and job security, while meaningful work fulfills the need for self-determination and social connection by providing opportunities for personal growth and community involvement (Duffy et al., 2016). Thus, need satisfaction serves as the primary connector between these two constructs.\n\nSocietal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices play crucial roles in promoting access to decent and meaningful work. At the societal level, policies that support labor rights, social protection, and inclusive economic growth are essential for ensuring decent work (Ghai, 2003). Organizational conditions, such as job design, leadership style, and workplace culture, significantly influence the meaningfulness of work (Hackman & Oldham, 1976). For instance, jobs that offer autonomy, task variety, and opportunities for skill development are more likely to be perceived as meaningful (Hackman & Oldham, 1976). Finally, individual practices, such as job crafting and career self-management, can enhance the experience of meaningful work by allowing employees to align their work with their values and interests (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001).\n\nFuture research should focus on broadening the available scholarship and methods used to study decent and meaningful work. This includes exploring the complex intersection of macrolevel factors, such as economic and cultural contexts, and psychological factors, such as personality and motivation, in determining the quality of work (Dik et al., 2013). Interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from psychology, sociology, economics, and management are particularly valuable for advancing our understanding of work quality (Rosso et al., 2010). Additionally, intervention research aimed at improving work conditions and enhancing the meaningfulness of work can provide practical insights for organizations and policymakers (Allan et al., 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, decent work and meaningful work are interconnected constructs that are essential for promoting individual well-being, organizational effectiveness, and societal progress. By understanding the factors that contribute to each type of work and their interrelationship, researchers and practitioners can develop strategies to improve the quality of work life and foster a more equitable and sustainable world.", "References": [{"title": "Decent work: Concepts, models and indicators", "authors": "Ghai, Dharam", "journal": "International Labour Review", "year": "2003", "volumes": "142", "first page": "113", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1564-913X.2003.tb00256.x"}, {"title": "The psychology of working theory", "authors": "Duffy, Ryan D., Blustein, David L., Diemer, Matthew A., Autin, Kelsey L.", "journal": "Journal of Counseling Psychology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "63", "first page": "127", "last page": "148", "DOI": "10.1037/cou0000140"}, {"title": "The meaning of work: A review of the literature and implications for human resource development", "authors": "Rosso, Brent D., Dekas, Kathryn H., Wrzesniewski, Amy", "journal": "Human Resource Development Review", "year": "2010", "volumes": "9", "first page": "225", "last page": "294", "DOI": "10.1177/1534484310371492"}, {"title": "The job characteristics model: An extension to entrepreneurial work", "authors": "Hackman, J.
