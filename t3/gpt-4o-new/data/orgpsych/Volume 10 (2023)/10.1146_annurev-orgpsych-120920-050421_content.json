{"Literature Review": "The increasing emphasis on environmental sustainability within organizations has led to a burgeoning interest in understanding employee green behavior (EGB) as a critical component of sustainable organizational practices. EGB refers to the voluntary actions of employees that contribute to environmental sustainability, encompassing behaviors such as recycling, energy conservation, and advocating for sustainable practices within the workplace. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on EGB, focusing on its definitions, theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical findings, while also proposing an integrative conceptual model and offering recommendations for future research and practice.\n\nThe concept of EGB is rooted in the broader field of pro-environmental behavior, which has been extensively studied in environmental psychology. Pro-environmental behavior is defined as behavior that consciously seeks to minimize the negative impact of one's actions on the natural environment (Kollmuss & Agyeman, 2002). Within the organizational context, EGB is often seen as a subset of organizational citizenship behavior, specifically targeting environmental outcomes (Boiral, 2009). Theoretical frameworks such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) and the Norm Activation Model (Schwartz, 1977) have been employed to understand the antecedents of EGB, highlighting the role of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and personal norms in shaping such behaviors.\n\nEmpirical studies have identified a range of individual-level antecedents of EGB, including environmental values, knowledge, and personal norms (Stern, 2000). For instance, employees with strong environmental values are more likely to engage in EGB, as they perceive such behaviors as congruent with their self-identity (Norton et al., 2015). Additionally, environmental knowledge has been shown to enhance EGB by increasing awareness of the environmental impact of one's actions and the efficacy of pro-environmental behaviors (Bamberg & Möser, 2007).\n\nAt the team and organizational levels, leadership and organizational culture play pivotal roles in fostering EGB. Transformational leadership, characterized by the ability to inspire and motivate employees towards a shared vision, has been positively associated with EGB (Robertson & Barling, 2013). Leaders who demonstrate commitment to environmental sustainability can influence employees' attitudes and behaviors through role modeling and the establishment of pro-environmental norms (Graves et al., 2013). Furthermore, an organizational culture that prioritizes sustainability and integrates environmental goals into its core values can create a supportive environment for EGB (Boiral & Paillé, 2012).\n\nThe work context, including job design and the availability of resources, also influences EGB. Jobs that provide autonomy and opportunities for employees to engage in problem-solving and innovation are more likely to encourage EGB (Ramus & Steger, 2000). Moreover, the provision of resources such as recycling facilities and energy-efficient technologies can facilitate EGB by reducing the barriers to engaging in such behaviors (Tudor et al., 2008).\n\nAt the societal level, external pressures such as regulatory requirements and societal expectations can drive organizations to promote EGB. Organizations that operate in regions with stringent environmental regulations or where there is strong public demand for corporate environmental responsibility are more likely to implement policies and practices that encourage EGB (Delmas & Toffel, 2008).\n\nDespite the growing body of research on EGB, several gaps remain. There is a need for more longitudinal studies to understand the dynamic nature of EGB and its long-term impact on organizational sustainability. Additionally, research should explore the potential trade-offs and unintended consequences of EGB, such as the possibility of greenwashing or the burden of additional responsibilities on employees (Lyon & Maxwell, 2011).\n\nTo advance the field, we propose an integrative conceptual model of EGB that considers the interplay between individual, team, organizational, and societal factors. This model emphasizes the importance of a multi-level approach to understanding EGB, recognizing that behaviors are influenced by a complex web of interrelated factors. Future research should also focus on developing and validating measurement tools that capture the multifaceted nature of EGB, as well as examining the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote EGB.\n\nIn conclusion, EGB is a critical component of organizational environmental sustainability, with implications for employees, leaders, and human resource management. By fostering a culture of sustainability and providing the necessary resources and support, organizations can enhance EGB and contribute to broader environmental goals. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential for researchers and practitioners to collaborate in developing evidence-based strategies that promote EGB and drive sustainable organizational change.", "References": [{"title": "Mind the gap: why do people act environmentally and what are the barriers to pro-environmental behavior?", "authors": "Anja Kollmuss, Julian Agyeman", "journal": "Environmental Education Research", "year": "2002", "volumes": "8", "first page": "239", "last page": "260", "DOI": "10.1080/13504620220145401"}, {"title": "Greening the corporation through organizational citizenship behaviors", "authors": "Olivier Boiral", "journal": "Journal of Business Ethics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "87", "first page": "221", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1007/s10551-008-9881-2"}, {"title": "The theory of planned behavior", "authors": "Icek Ajzen", "journal": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "year": "1991", "volumes": "50", "first page": "179", "last page": "211", "DOI": "10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"}, {"title": "Normative influences on altruism", "authors": "Shalom H.
