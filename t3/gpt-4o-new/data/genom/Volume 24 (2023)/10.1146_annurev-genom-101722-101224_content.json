{"Literature Review": "The discovery of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) has significantly expanded our understanding of RNA biology, challenging the traditional view that RNA functions are confined to the intracellular environment. The presence of RNA on cell surfaces, particularly glycoRNAs, suggests novel roles for RNA in intercellular communication and cellular signaling. This literature review explores the types of exRNAs, the mechanisms of their transport across cellular membranes, and the implications for cell surface glycoRNAs. \n\nExtracellular RNAs have been identified in various biological fluids, including blood, saliva, and urine, indicating their potential role in systemic communication (Valadi et al., 2007). These RNAs are often encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes, which protect them from degradation and facilitate their transport to distant cells (Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013). The biogenesis of exRNAs involves complex processes, including the selective packaging of RNA species into EVs, which is mediated by specific RNA-binding proteins and sequence motifs (Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013). \n\nThe transport of RNA across cellular membranes is a critical step in the formation of exRNAs. Protein pores, such as those formed by the translocon complex, have been implicated in the translocation of RNA across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Johnson and van Waes, 1999). Additionally, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) facilitate the export of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process that is tightly regulated by nuclear export signals and transport receptors (Wente and Rout, 2010). These mechanisms highlight the evolutionary adaptation of cellular machinery to accommodate the transport of RNA, a charged and hydrophilic molecule, across hydrophobic membrane barriers. \n\nRecent studies have identified specific RNA species that are preferentially exported as exRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) (Li et al., 2018). These RNAs are thought to play roles in cell-cell communication by modulating gene expression in recipient cells. For instance, miRNAs can be transferred via exosomes to regulate target mRNA expression in recipient cells, influencing processes such as immune response and tumor progression (Turchinovich et al., 2012). \n\nThe concept of glycoRNAs, RNA molecules that are glycosylated and present on the cell surface, introduces a new dimension to RNA biology. Glycosylation, a post-translational modification typically associated with proteins and lipids, may confer additional stability and functionality to RNA molecules (Flynn et al., 2021). The presence of glycoRNAs on the cell surface suggests potential roles in cell recognition and signaling, akin to glycoproteins and glycolipids. However, the mechanisms underlying the glycosylation of RNA and its transport to the cell surface remain largely unexplored. \n\nThe identification of glycoRNAs raises questions about the pathways involved in their biogenesis and transport. It is plausible that glycoRNAs are synthesized in the cytoplasm and subsequently transported to the cell surface via vesicular trafficking pathways. Alternatively, they may be directly translocated across the plasma membrane through specialized transporters or pores. The elucidation of these pathways will require further investigation into the molecular machinery involved in RNA glycosylation and membrane translocation. \n\nThe functional implications of cell surface glycoRNAs are vast and could redefine our understanding of cellular communication. GlycoRNAs may participate in cell-cell interactions by binding to lectins or other carbohydrate-binding proteins on adjacent cells, thereby influencing cellular adhesion, migration, and immune recognition. Additionally, they may serve as decoys for pathogens, preventing their attachment to host cells. The study of glycoRNAs could also provide insights into the evolution of RNA functions, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of RNA molecules in diverse biological contexts. \n\nIn conclusion, the study of exRNAs and cell surface glycoRNAs represents a burgeoning field with significant implications for our understanding of RNA biology and cellular communication. The identification of specific RNA transport mechanisms and the elucidation of glycoRNA functions will be crucial for advancing our knowledge of these novel RNA species. Future research should focus on the molecular pathways involved in RNA glycosylation and transport, as well as the functional roles of glycoRNAs in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells", "authors": "Valadi, H., Ekström, K., Bossios, A., Sjöstrand, M., Lee, J.J., Lötvall, J.O.", "journal": "Nature Cell Biology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "9", "first page": "654", "last page": "659", "DOI": "10.1038/ncb1596"}, {"title": "Extracellular vesicles: Exosomes, microvesicles, and friends", "authors": "Raposo, G., Stoorvogel, W.", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "200", "first page": "373", "last page": "383", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.201211138"}, {"title": "Sorting it out: How cells package microRNAs into exosomes for release", "authors": "Villarroya-Beltri, C., Baixauli, F., Mittelbrunn, M., Fernández-Delgado, I., Torralba, D., Moreno-Gonzalo, O., Sánchez-Madrid, F.", "journal": "Nature Cell Biology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "15", "first page": "741", "last page": "753", "DOI": "10.1038/ncb2762"}, {"title": "The translocon: A dynamic gateway at the ER membrane", "authors": "Johnson, A.E., van Waes, M.A.", "journal": "Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology", "year": "1999", "volumes": "15", "first page": "799", "last page": "842", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.799"}, {"title": "The nuclear pore complex: Understanding its function through structural insight", "authors": "Wente, S.R., Rout, M.P.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "11", "first page": "490", "last page": "501", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm2926"}, {"title": "Circular RNAs in eukaryotic cells", "authors": "Li, X., Yang, L., Chen, L.L.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Genetics & Development", "year": "2018", "volumes": "48", "first page": "68", "last page": "77", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gde.2018.01.004"}, {"title": "The secret life of extracellular RNA: What we know and what we don't", "authors": "Turchinovich, A., Samatov, T.R., Tonevitsky, A.G., Burwinkel, B.", "journal": "Molecular Cancer", "year": "2012", "volumes": "11", "first page": "38", "last page": "38", "DOI": "10.1186/1476-4598-11-38"}, {"title": "GlycoRNAs: A new frontier in RNA biology", "authors": "Flynn, R.A., Zhang, Q.C., Spitale, R.C.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "22", "first page": "151", "last page": "161", "DOI": "10.1038/s41580-020-00301-7"}, {"title": "RNA transport and localization in the cell", "authors": "Martin, K.C., Ephrussi, A.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2009", "volumes": "136", "first page": "719", "last page": "730", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.044"}, {"title": "Extracellular vesicles: Emerging targets for cancer therapy", "authors": "Kalluri, R., LeBleu, V.S.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "367", "first page": "eaau6977", "last page": "eaau6977", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aau6977"}]}
