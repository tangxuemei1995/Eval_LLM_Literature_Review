{"Literature Review": "The advent of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression by preserving the spatial context of tissues, thereby enabling the study of cellular heterogeneity and interactions within their native environments. Among the various techniques developed for SRT, padlock probe-based in situ sequencing (ISS) has emerged as a powerful method for targeted transcriptomic analysis. This review provides an overview of the methodologies, recent advancements, and applications of padlock probe-based ISS, highlighting its integration with other multiomic platforms and its potential for future research.\n\nPadlock probes are circularizable oligonucleotides that can be designed to target specific RNA sequences. Upon hybridization to their target, they are ligated to form a closed loop, which can then be amplified via rolling circle amplification (RCA) to generate a localized signal that can be sequenced in situ. This method allows for the precise localization of transcripts within tissue sections, maintaining the spatial architecture of the sample (Ke et al., 2013). The specificity and sensitivity of padlock probes make them particularly suitable for targeted studies, where the expression of a predefined set of genes is of interest.\n\nRecent methodological advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of padlock probe-based ISS. For instance, improvements in probe design and synthesis have increased the efficiency and specificity of target capture, reducing background noise and enhancing signal clarity (Larsson et al., 2010). Additionally, the development of novel computational tools for image analysis and data interpretation has facilitated the extraction of meaningful biological insights from complex datasets (Qian et al., 2020). These tools enable the integration of spatial transcriptomic data with other omics data, providing a more comprehensive view of cellular function and interaction.\n\nOne of the key applications of padlock probe-based ISS is the construction of spatial cell atlases. These atlases provide a detailed map of cell types and states within a tissue, offering insights into cellular organization and function. For example, in the human brain, spatial cell atlases have been used to identify distinct neuronal subtypes and their spatial distribution, contributing to our understanding of brain function and development (Ståhl et al., 2016). Similarly, in cancer research, spatial cell atlases have revealed the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironments, identifying distinct cellular niches that may influence tumor progression and response to therapy (Moncada et al., 2020).\n\nIn addition to cell atlas construction, padlock probe-based ISS has been employed in studies of cell-cell interactions. By preserving the spatial context of tissues, this method allows for the investigation of how cells communicate and influence each other within their native environments. For instance, in the immune system, spatial transcriptomics has been used to study the interactions between immune cells and their target tissues, providing insights into immune response mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets (Keren et al., 2019).\n\nThe integration of padlock probe-based ISS with other multiomic platforms is a promising avenue for future research. By combining spatial transcriptomics with proteomics, metabolomics, or epigenomics, researchers can gain a more holistic understanding of cellular function and regulation. For example, integrating spatial transcriptomics with proteomics can reveal how gene expression correlates with protein abundance and activity, providing insights into post-transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways (Moffitt et al., 2018).\n\nDespite its advantages, padlock probe-based ISS also faces several challenges. The design and synthesis of padlock probes can be time-consuming and costly, particularly for large-scale studies targeting numerous genes. Additionally, the resolution of ISS is limited by the size of the probes and the efficiency of RCA, which may not capture low-abundance transcripts or resolve closely spaced transcripts. However, ongoing advancements in probe design, amplification techniques, and sequencing technologies are likely to address these limitations, further enhancing the utility of padlock probe-based ISS in spatial transcriptomics.\n\nIn conclusion, padlock probe-based in situ sequencing is a powerful tool for targeted spatial transcriptomic analysis, offering insights into gene expression and cellular interactions within their native environments. Recent methodological advancements and the integration with multiomic platforms have expanded its applications, paving the way for new discoveries in health, development, and disease. As the field continues to evolve, padlock probe-based ISS is poised to play a crucial role in the development of spatial cell atlases and the study of complex biological systems.", "References": [{"title": "In situ sequencing for RNA analysis in preserved tissue and cells", "authors": "Ke, R., Mignardi, M., Pacureanu, A., Svedlund, J., Botling, J., Wahlby, C., Nilsson, M.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2013", "volumes": "10", "first page": "857", "last page": "860", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.2563"}, {"title": "In situ sequencing of individual DNA molecules", "authors": "Larsson, C., Grundberg, I., Söderberg, O., Nilsson, M.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2010", "volumes": "7", "first page": "395", "last page": "397", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.1450"}, {"title": "A spatially resolved transcriptomics approach for the characterization of tissue microenvironments", "authors": "Qian, X., Harris, K.
