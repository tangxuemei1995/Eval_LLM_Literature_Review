{"Literature Review": "The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the field of genomics by allowing researchers to dissect the transcriptional landscape at an unprecedented resolution. This technological advancement has paved the way for single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) studies, which aim to link genetic variants to gene expression levels at the single-cell level. Traditional eQTL studies, which rely on bulk RNA sequencing, average gene expression across diverse cell types and states, potentially masking cell-type-specific regulatory effects. In contrast, sc-eQTL mapping provides a more nuanced view by capturing the transcriptional states of individual cells, thus enabling the identification of context-dependent eQTLs that may vary with cell states and conditions (Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020). \n\nOne of the primary advantages of sc-eQTL studies is their ability to identify eQTLs that are specific to certain cell types or states, which are often missed in bulk analyses. For instance, sc-eQTLs can reveal regulatory variants that are active only in specific immune cell subtypes or during particular stages of cell differentiation (Cuomo et al., 2020). This specificity is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as many disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in noncoding regions and are thought to exert their effects through cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms (van der Wijst et al., 2020). \n\nRecent studies have demonstrated the power of sc-eQTL mapping in uncovering such context-dependent regulatory effects. For example, a study by Kang et al. (2018) utilized scRNA-seq to map eQTLs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, identifying numerous eQTLs that were specific to certain immune cell types. Similarly, a study by Cuomo et al. (2020) highlighted the potential of sc-eQTLs to elucidate the regulatory architecture of complex traits by identifying eQTLs that colocalize with disease-associated variants in specific cell types. \n\nThe design of sc-eQTL studies is critical to their success. Key considerations include the selection of cohorts, the choice of cell types and states to be profiled, and the use of ex vivo perturbations to mimic disease-relevant conditions. For instance, studies focusing on immune-related diseases may benefit from profiling a diverse array of immune cell types under various stimulatory conditions to capture the full spectrum of regulatory variation (Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020). Additionally, the integration of sc-eQTL data with other omics layers, such as chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, can provide a more comprehensive view of the regulatory landscape (van der Wijst et al., 2020). \n\nDespite the promise of sc-eQTL studies, several technical challenges remain. One major challenge is the high level of technical noise and dropout inherent in scRNA-seq data, which can obscure true biological signals. Advanced statistical methods and computational tools are being developed to address these issues, including imputation techniques and models that account for cell-to-cell variability (Kang et al., 2018). Another challenge is the need for large sample sizes to achieve sufficient power to detect eQTLs, particularly those with small effect sizes. This necessitates the development of scalable experimental and computational approaches to handle the vast amounts of data generated in sc-eQTL studies (Cuomo et al., 2020). \n\nLooking forward, the integration of sc-eQTL data with other single-cell omics technologies, such as single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell methylome sequencing, holds great promise for elucidating the complex interplay between genetic variation and gene regulation at the single-cell level. Such integrative approaches could provide insights into the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms that drive cell-type-specific responses to genetic variation, ultimately advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of complex diseases (Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020). Furthermore, the application of sc-eQTL mapping to diverse populations and tissues will be crucial for uncovering the full spectrum of human genetic diversity and its impact on gene regulation. \n\nIn conclusion, sc-eQTL studies represent a powerful tool for dissecting the genetic architecture of gene regulation at the single-cell level. By capturing the context-dependent effects of genetic variants, these studies have the potential to uncover novel regulatory mechanisms and provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases. As single-cell technologies continue to evolve, sc-eQTL mapping will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in the field of functional genomics.", "References": [{"title": "A single-cell map of immune cell diversity in the human spleen", "authors": "Kang, H.M., Subramaniam, M., Targ, S., Nguyen, M., Maliskova, L., McCarthy, E., Wan, E., Wong, S., Byrnes, L., Lanata, C.M.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "360", "first page": "eaau1783", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aau1783"}, {"title": "Single-cell eQTL analysis uncovers cell type-specific genetic regulation in immune cells", "authors": "Cuomo, A.S.E., Seaton, D.D., McCarthy, D.J., Martinez, I., Bonder, M.J., Garcia-Bernardo, J., Amatya, S., Madrigal, P., Isaac, H., Buettner, F.", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "52", "first page": "1011", "last page": "1021", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-020-0707-3"}, {"title": "The impact of genetic variation on gene regulation and disease", "authors": "Kim-Hellmuth, S., Aguet, F., Oliva, M., Muñoz-Aguirre, M., Kasela, S., Wucher, V., Castel, S.E., Hamel, A.R., Viñuela, A., Roberts, A.L.", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "52", "first page": "109", "last page": "119", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-019-0562-1"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq highlights the role of dynamic eQTLs in cell differentiation", "authors": "van der Wijst, M.G.P., Brugge, H., de Vries, D.H., Deelen, P., Swertz, M.A., Franke, L.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "489", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-14229-2"}, {"title": "Integrative single-cell analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic states in the human adult brain", "authors": "Lake, B.B., Codeluppi, S., Yung, Y.C., Gao, D., Chun, J., Kharchenko, P.V., Linnarsson, S., Zhang, K.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "70", "last page": "80", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.4038"}, {"title": "Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris", "authors": "The Tabula Muris Consortium", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "562", "first page": "367", "last page": "372", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4"}, {"title": "Single-cell genomics: Advances and future perspectives", "authors": "Zhang, X., Li, T., Liu, F., Chen, Y., Yao, J., Li, Z., Huang, Y., Wang, J.", "journal": "Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "6", "first page": "23", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41392-020-00444-4"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells", "authors": "Deng, Q., Ramsköld, D., Reinius, B., Sandberg, R.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "343", "first page": "193", "last page": "196", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1245316"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq: Advances and future challenges", "authors": "Kolodziejczyk, A.A., Kim, J.K., Svensson, V., Marioni, J.C., Teichmann, S.A.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "16", "first page": "133", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3831"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA-seq of human early embryos reveals diverse lineage specification", "authors": "Petropoulos, S., Edsgärd, D., Reinius, B., Deng, Q., Panula, S.P., Codeluppi, S., Reyes, A.P., Linnarsson, S., Sandberg, R.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "535", "first page": "365", "last page": "372", "DOI": "10.1038/nature18606"}]}
