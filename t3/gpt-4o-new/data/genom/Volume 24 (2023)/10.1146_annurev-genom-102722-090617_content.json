{"Literature Review": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of visual acuity, as it influences the eye's ability to focus light precisely on the retina. The average axial length of an adult human eye is approximately 23.5 mm, but deviations from this norm can lead to significant visual impairments. Microphthalmia, characterized by an abnormally small eye, and high myopia, characterized by an excessively elongated eye, represent two extremes of axial length variation. Both conditions are associated with substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, posing challenges for diagnosis and treatment. \n\nMicrophthalmia is a developmental anomaly that occurs when the eye fails to grow to its normal size during embryogenesis. It is defined by an axial length of less than 19 mm at one year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood. The condition is often associated with other ocular and systemic abnormalities, reflecting its complex genetic underpinnings. More than 90 genes have been implicated in microphthalmia, including those involved in eye development, such as SOX2, OTX2, and RAX (Fitzpatrick et al., 2003). These genes play crucial roles in the early stages of eye formation, influencing processes such as optic vesicle development and retinal differentiation. Mutations in these genes can disrupt normal eye growth, leading to microphthalmia and associated visual deficits.\n\nHigh myopia, on the other hand, is characterized by an axial length of 26.5 mm or more, resulting in a refractive error that causes distant objects to appear blurred. This condition is highly prevalent worldwide, with significant implications for public health due to its association with sight-threatening complications such as retinal detachment and glaucoma. The genetic basis of high myopia is complex, with several hundred genes implicated in its pathogenesis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with myopia, including genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, such as COL1A1 and COL2A1, and those regulating eye growth, such as PAX6 and ZNF644 (Hysi et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2011). These findings suggest that high myopia results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as near work and limited outdoor activity.\n\nDespite the identification of numerous genes associated with microphthalmia and high myopia, the diagnostic yield for these conditions remains low. This is partly due to the high degree of genetic heterogeneity and the involvement of multiple pathways in eye development and growth. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated the discovery of novel genetic variants associated with these conditions, but much remains to be understood about the molecular mechanisms regulating axial length. \n\nEmerging evidence suggests that shared molecular pathways may regulate both the undergrowth and overgrowth of the eye. For instance, the Wnt signaling pathway, which is known to play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, has been implicated in both microphthalmia and myopia (Liu et al., 2013). Dysregulation of this pathway can lead to abnormal eye development and growth, highlighting the importance of understanding the intricate network of genetic interactions that determine axial length. \n\nImproving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination is crucial for developing effective therapies for microphthalmia and high myopia. By elucidating the genetic pathways involved in eye growth, researchers can better understand genotype-phenotype correlations and identify potential targets for intervention. For example, gene therapy approaches that target specific genetic mutations could offer a promising avenue for treating microphthalmia, while pharmacological interventions that modulate eye growth pathways could help prevent or slow the progression of high myopia. \n\nFurthermore, understanding the gene-environment interactions that contribute to myopia development is essential for designing effective prevention strategies. Environmental factors, such as increased time spent indoors and excessive near work, have been shown to influence myopia progression, suggesting that lifestyle modifications could play a role in mitigating the risk of developing high myopia (Rose et al., 2008). By integrating genetic and environmental data, researchers can develop personalized approaches to myopia prevention and management, ultimately reducing the burden of this condition on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "SOX2 mutations cause anophthalmia", "authors": "Fitzpatrick, D.
