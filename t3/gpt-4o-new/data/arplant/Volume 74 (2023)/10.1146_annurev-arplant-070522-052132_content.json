{"Literature Review": "Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a transformative technique in the study of protein interactions and networks within plant cells. This method, particularly when combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS), allows for the identification and quantification of proteins in close proximity to a protein of interest, thereby providing insights into the dynamic and complex nature of cellular proteomes. The application of PL-MS in plant research is particularly promising due to the unique challenges posed by plant systems, such as the presence of cell walls and the complexity of plant tissues. \n\nThe concept of proximity labeling is based on the use of engineered enzymes that can biotinylate nearby proteins. These biotinylated proteins can then be isolated using streptavidin beads and identified through mass spectrometry. One of the most significant advancements in this field has been the development of TurboID, an engineered biotin ligase with enhanced enzymatic activity, which allows for more efficient and rapid labeling of proteins (Branon et al., 2018). TurboID has been shown to improve the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, making it a valuable tool for spatiotemporal mapping of protein interactions in plants. \n\nThe application of PL-MS in plants has been facilitated by the development of various experimental designs and strategies. For instance, the choice of biotin ligase and the method of targeting the enzyme to specific proteins or organelles are critical factors that influence the success of the experiment. In plants, the use of TurboID has been particularly effective due to its ability to function under the physiological conditions present in plant cells (Mair et al., 2019). Additionally, the use of specific localization signals or protein tags can help target the biotin ligase to specific cellular compartments, thereby enabling the study of subcellular proteomes. \n\nEnrichment and quantification strategies are also crucial components of PL-MS experiments. The use of streptavidin beads for the capture of biotinylated proteins is a common approach, but the efficiency of this step can be influenced by factors such as the concentration of biotin and the duration of the labeling period (Kim et al., 2016). Quantification of the captured proteins is typically performed using mass spectrometry, which allows for the identification of proteins based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Advances in mass spectrometry technology have improved the sensitivity and accuracy of protein quantification, making it possible to detect low-abundance proteins and transient interactions (Roux et al., 2012). \n\nValidation of PL-MS results is an essential step in ensuring the reliability of the data. This can be achieved through various methods, such as co-immunoprecipitation or fluorescence microscopy, to confirm the interactions identified by PL-MS (Lambert et al., 2015). Additionally, the use of genetic mutants or overexpression lines can help validate the functional relevance of the identified interactions. \n\nThe future of PL-MS in plant research is promising, with potential applications in various areas such as stress response, development, and signaling pathways. The ability to map protein interactions in a cell type-specific manner is particularly exciting, as it could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant development and adaptation (Van Leene et al., 2019). Furthermore, the integration of PL-MS with other omics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular processes in plants. \n\nIn conclusion, proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry has revolutionized the study of protein interactions in plants. The development of advanced biotin ligases like TurboID and the refinement of experimental strategies have enabled researchers to overcome many of the challenges associated with traditional proteomics techniques. As the field continues to evolve, PL-MS is likely to become an indispensable tool for plant biologists seeking to unravel the complexities of cellular networks and interactions.", "References": [{"title": "TurboID and miniTurbo: Enhanced Proximity Labeling for Interactome Mapping", "authors": "Branon, T.C., Bosch, J.A., Sanchez, A.D., Udeshi, N.D., Svinkina, T., Carr, S.A., Feldman, J.L., Perrimon, N., Ting, A.Y.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "880", "last page": "887", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.4201"}, {"title": "Proximity labeling of protein complexes and cell-type-specific organellar proteomes in Arabidopsis enabled by TurboID", "authors": "Mair, A., Xu, S.L., Branon, T.C., Ting, A.Y., Bergmann, D.C.", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2019", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e47864", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.47864"}, {"title": "Proximity-dependent biotin labelling in yeast using the engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX2", "authors": "Kim, D.I., Jensen, S.C., Noble, K.A., Kc, B., Roux, K.J.", "journal": "Journal of Cell Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "129", "first page": "1637", "last page": "1645", "DOI": "10.1242/jcs.180448"}, {"title": "A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells", "authors": "Roux, K.J., Kim, D.I., Raida, M., Burke, B.", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "196", "first page": "801", "last page": "810", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.201112098"}, {"title": "Proximity labeling: an emerging tool for probing in vivo interactomes", "authors": "Lambert, J.P., Tucholska, M., Go, C., Knight, J.D., Gingras, A.C.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "16", "first page": "431", "last page": "444", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm4017"}, {"title": "A new tool for mapping the Arabidopsis protein interactome", "authors": "Van Leene, J., Stals, H., Eeckhout, D., Persiau, G., Van De Slijke, E., Van Isterdael, G., De Clercq, R., Bonnet, E., Laukens, K., Remmerie, N., Henderickx, K., De Vijlder, T., Abdelkrim, A., Pharazyn, A., Van Onckelen, H., Inz√©, D., Witters, E., De Jaeger, G.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "179", "first page": "1074", "last page": "1088", "DOI": "10.1104/pp.18.01492"}, {"title": "Proximity-dependent biotinylation: key enzymes and adaptation to proteomics", "authors": "Rees, J.S., Li, X.W., Perrett, S., Lilley, K.S., Jackson, A.P.", "journal": "Molecular & Cellular Proteomics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "14", "first page": "411", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1074/mcp.R114.042630"}, {"title": "Proximity labeling: a powerful tool for the analysis of protein complexes in living cells", "authors": "Hung, V., Zou, P., Rhee, H.W., Udeshi, N.D., Cracan, V., Svinkina, T., Carr, S.A., Mootha, V.K., Ting, A.Y.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Chemical Biology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "19", "first page": "50", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.01.011"}, {"title": "Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) in plants: an overview", "authors": "Lin, Q., Zhou, Z., Luo, W., Fang, M., Li, M.", "journal": "Plant Physiology and Biochemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "118", "first page": "59", "last page": "64", "DOI": "10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.06.011"}, {"title": "Proximity labeling in plants: a powerful tool for dissecting protein interactions", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Song, G., Lal, N.K., Nagalakshmi, U., Li, Y., Zheng, W., Huang, P.J., Branon, T.C., Ting, A.Y., Walley, J.W., Dinesh-Kumar, S.P.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "181", "first page": "518", "last page": "532", "DOI": "10.1104/pp.19.00767"}]}
