{"Literature Review": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors is a complex process that has been shaped by various evolutionary pressures over millions of years. The study of non-osteichthyan vertebrates, such as jawless and cartilaginous fishes, provides unique insights into the diversification and evolution of these molecular systems. These groups represent some of the earliest diverging lineages of vertebrates, and their genomes offer a window into the ancestral states of vertebrate endocrine systems. \n\nOne of the key aspects of hormone evolution is the presence or absence of specific genes across different taxa. For instance, the leptin hormone, which plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation in mammals, has been identified in some fish species, including cartilaginous fishes, but with varying degrees of sequence conservation and functional similarity (Gorissen et al., 2009). This suggests that while the leptin gene may have been present in the common ancestor of vertebrates, its function and regulation have diverged significantly across different lineages. \n\nThe multiplication and maintenance of paralogs is another important theme in the evolution of vertebrate hormones. Gene duplication events, such as those that occurred during the two rounds of whole-genome duplication in early vertebrate history, have resulted in multiple copies of hormone genes and their receptors. These paralogs can undergo subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, leading to the retention of multiple gene copies with distinct roles. For example, the oxytocin and vasopressin hormone systems, which are involved in social behavior and water balance, respectively, have undergone significant diversification in vertebrates. In non-osteichthyan vertebrates, these systems show a variety of gene duplications and losses, reflecting their adaptation to different ecological niches (Acher, 1996). \n\nThe differential fates of duplicated paralogs are evident in the evolution of the prolactin and ghrelin hormone systems. Prolactin, which is involved in lactation and osmoregulation, has multiple paralogs in fish species, some of which have been lost or have acquired new functions in different lineages (Bole-Feysot et al., 1998). Similarly, ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite and growth hormone release, shows a complex pattern of gene duplication and divergence in non-osteichthyan vertebrates, indicating its role in adapting to diverse environmental conditions (Kaiya et al., 2008). \n\nThe evolutionary timing of gene origins is crucial for understanding the development of vertebrate endocrine systems. The availability of genome sequences from non-osteichthyan vertebrates has allowed researchers to estimate the timing of key gene duplication events and the emergence of novel hormone-receptor pairs. For instance, the cyclostomes, which include jawless fishes like lampreys and hagfish, possess unique hormone systems that provide insights into the early evolution of vertebrate endocrinology. Studies have shown that some hormone-receptor pairs, such as those involved in stress response and reproduction, originated before the divergence of cyclostomes and gnathostomes, highlighting their ancient evolutionary roots (Ocampo Daza et al., 2012). \n\nIn conclusion, the study of non-osteichthyan vertebrate genomes has significantly advanced our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors. By examining the presence or absence of genes, the multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, the differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and the evolutionary timing of gene origins, researchers can reconstruct the complex evolutionary history of these molecular systems. This research not only sheds light on the diversity of vertebrate endocrine systems but also provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of hormone function and regulation across different species.", "References": [{"title": "Leptin in teleost fish: a review", "authors": "Gorissen, M., Flik, G., Huising, M.
