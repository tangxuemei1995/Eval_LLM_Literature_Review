{"Literature Review": "Zoonotic diseases, which are infections transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals, have been a significant concern for global health, particularly as they constitute a substantial portion of emerging infectious diseases (EID). The role of domestic animals as potential reservoirs for zoonotic viral diseases is a critical area of study, given that approximately 25% of zoonoses originate from these animals. This literature review explores the dynamics of zoonotic viral diseases, focusing on domestic animals as reservoirs, the mechanisms of transmission, and the implications for public health under the One Health framework. \n\nThe concept of zoonoses has been well-documented, with historical accounts of diseases such as rabies and influenza highlighting the interspecies transmission of pathogens (Woolhouse et al., 2005). The increasing incidence of zoonotic diseases is attributed to several factors, including ecological changes, human behavior, and the adaptability of pathogens. Domestic animals, due to their close proximity to humans, serve as critical reservoirs for these pathogens, facilitating their transmission to human populations (Karesh et al., 2012). \n\nViruses are particularly significant among zoonotic pathogens, accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. The ability of viruses to mutate and adapt to new hosts makes them formidable agents of zoonotic diseases. For instance, the H1N1 influenza virus, which caused a global pandemic in 2009, is believed to have originated from swine, a domestic animal (Smith et al., 2009). Similarly, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been linked to domestic animals such as camels and civet cats (Zaki et al., 2012). \n\nThe transmission of zoonotic viruses from domestic animals to humans can occur through various pathways, including direct contact, aerosols, vectors, and vertical transmission. Direct contact with infected animals or their secretions is a common route, as seen in the transmission of rabies and brucellosis (Cleaveland et al., 2001). Aerosol transmission is another significant pathway, particularly for respiratory viruses such as influenza. Vector-borne transmission, involving insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, is also a critical mechanism, as demonstrated by the spread of West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever (Patz et al., 2004). \n\nThe emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases are influenced by a complex interplay of factors related to the pathogen, host, and environment. Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion have increased human-animal interactions, thereby facilitating the spillover of pathogens from animals to humans (Jones et al., 2008). Climate change also plays a role by altering the habitats of vectors and hosts, thus affecting the transmission dynamics of zoonotic diseases (Patz et al., 2005). \n\nThe One Health approach, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, is crucial for the effective management of zoonotic diseases. This multidisciplinary strategy involves collaboration across various sectors, including public health, veterinary medicine, and environmental science, to address the complex challenges posed by zoonotic diseases (Zinsstag et al., 2011). The One Health approach has been instrumental in controlling outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, such as the H5N1 avian influenza, by promoting surveillance, early detection, and coordinated response efforts (FAO, 2011). \n\nIn conclusion, domestic animals play a significant role as reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, posing a continuous threat to global health. Understanding the mechanisms of transmission and the factors influencing the emergence of these diseases is essential for developing effective control and prevention strategies. The One Health approach provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges of zoonotic diseases, emphasizing the need for collaboration across disciplines and sectors. Continued research and surveillance are necessary to mitigate the impact of zoonotic diseases and protect public health.", "References": [{"title": "Emerging zoonoses and pathogens of public health significance", "authors": "Woolhouse, M.
