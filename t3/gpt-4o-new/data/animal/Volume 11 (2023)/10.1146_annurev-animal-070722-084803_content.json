{"Literature Review": "The illegal poaching and trade of wildlife have become significant global issues, driven by factors such as poverty, greed, and the operations of sophisticated criminal networks. This illicit activity not only threatens biodiversity but also poses a challenge to law enforcement agencies worldwide. The application of forensic science, particularly forensic genetics, has emerged as a crucial tool in combating wildlife crime, providing the necessary evidence for prosecution and conviction in courtrooms. This literature review explores the development and implementation of forensic tools in wildlife crime investigations, highlighting recent advances and case studies that demonstrate their effectiveness. \n\nForensic science has long been a cornerstone of criminal investigations, providing objective evidence that can link suspects to crimes. In the context of wildlife crime, forensic tools have been adapted to address the unique challenges posed by these cases. Forensic genetics, in particular, has seen significant advancements, allowing for the identification of species, individuals, and even geographic origin of seized wildlife products. This capability is crucial in cases where the physical evidence is limited or where the species involved are difficult to identify visually (Ogden et al., 2009). \n\nOne of the primary applications of forensic genetics in wildlife crime is species identification. DNA barcoding, a technique that uses a short genetic sequence from a standardized region of the genome, has been widely adopted for this purpose. This method has proven effective in identifying species from a variety of biological materials, including hair, skin, and bone, which are often found in wildlife crime scenes (Hebert et al., 2003). The use of DNA barcoding has been instrumental in several high-profile cases, such as the identification of shark fins in illegal trade (Clarke et al., 2006). \n\nBeyond species identification, forensic genetics can also be used to determine the geographic origin of wildlife products. This is particularly important in cases involving species that are protected in certain regions but not others. By analyzing genetic markers that vary geographically, forensic scientists can trace the origin of seized products, providing critical evidence for prosecution (Wasser et al., 2008). This approach has been successfully applied in cases involving elephant ivory, where genetic analysis has helped pinpoint poaching hotspots in Africa (Wasser et al., 2015). \n\nThe development of forensic tools for wildlife crime has been accompanied by advances in technology and methodology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the field, allowing for the rapid and cost-effective analysis of large amounts of genetic data. NGS has enabled the development of comprehensive genetic databases, which are essential for the accurate identification and tracing of wildlife products (Allendorf et al., 2010). These databases have been used in conjunction with forensic tools to build strong cases against poachers and traffickers, leading to successful prosecutions. \n\nIn addition to genetic tools, other forensic techniques have been adapted for use in wildlife crime investigations. For example, stable isotope analysis can provide information about the diet and habitat of an animal, which can be used to infer its geographic origin (Hobson, 1999). This technique has been used in conjunction with genetic analysis to provide a more comprehensive picture of wildlife crime networks. \n\nThe application of forensic science in wildlife crime investigations has not only led to successful prosecutions but has also had a deterrent effect on poaching and trafficking activities. By demonstrating the ability to trace and identify illegal wildlife products, forensic tools have increased the perceived risk of engaging in wildlife crime, thus discouraging potential offenders (Gonçalves et al., 2015). \n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain in the application of forensic science to wildlife crime. The development of standardized protocols and the establishment of international collaborations are essential to ensure the reliability and admissibility of forensic evidence in court. Additionally, there is a need for continued investment in research and training to keep pace with the evolving tactics of wildlife criminals (Ogden et al., 2009). \n\nIn conclusion, forensic science, particularly forensic genetics, has become an indispensable tool in the fight against wildlife crime. The ability to identify species, trace geographic origins, and link evidence to criminal networks has strengthened the capacity of law enforcement agencies to prosecute offenders and protect biodiversity. As technology continues to advance, the potential for forensic tools to disrupt wildlife crime networks and safeguard endangered species will only increase.", "References": [{"title": "Wildlife DNA forensics—bridging the gap between conservation genetics and law enforcement", "authors": "Rob Ogden, Richard Dawnay, Ross McEwing", "journal": "Endangered Species Research", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "179", "last page": "195", "DOI": "10.3354/esr00144"}, {"title": "Biological identifications through DNA barcodes", "authors": "Paul D.
