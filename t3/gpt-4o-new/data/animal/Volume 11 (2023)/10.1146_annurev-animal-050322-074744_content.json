{"Literature Review": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a fascinating model for studying healthy aging due to its exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. Unlike other rodents, naked mole-rats can live over 37 years, exhibiting a delayed aging phenotype and maintaining physiological functions until the end of their lifespan. This review explores the unique characteristics of naked mole-rats, including their ecology, hypoxia tolerance, longevity, and cancer resistance, and discusses the potential mechanisms contributing to their healthy aging. \n\nNaked mole-rats are eusocial mammals native to the underground burrows of East Africa, where they live in colonies with a single breeding queen and non-reproductive workers. This social structure is thought to contribute to their longevity by reducing stress and promoting cooperative behaviors that enhance survival (Jarvis, 1981). The hypoxic environment of their burrows has led to adaptations that allow naked mole-rats to tolerate low oxygen levels, which may play a role in their resistance to age-related diseases (Park et al., 2017). \n\nOne of the most remarkable features of naked mole-rats is their resistance to cancer. Studies have shown that naked mole-rats possess unique mechanisms that prevent the uncontrolled cell proliferation characteristic of cancer. For instance, they produce high-molecular-mass hyaluronan, which is thought to contribute to their cancer resistance by enhancing tissue integrity and preventing metastasis (Tian et al., 2013). Additionally, naked mole-rats exhibit a unique form of contact inhibition, where cells stop dividing when they come into contact with each other, further preventing tumor formation (Seluanov et al., 2009). \n\nThe longevity of naked mole-rats is also attributed to their ability to maintain protein homeostasis and resist oxidative stress. Unlike other mammals, naked mole-rats do not show an increase in oxidative damage with age, suggesting that they have efficient mechanisms for repairing or preventing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (Perez et al., 2009). This resistance to oxidative stress is thought to be a key factor in their delayed aging phenotype. \n\nFurthermore, naked mole-rats exhibit a unique metabolic profile that may contribute to their longevity. They have a low metabolic rate and can switch to anaerobic metabolism under hypoxic conditions, which reduces the production of harmful byproducts associated with aerobic respiration (Buffenstein, 2008). This metabolic flexibility may protect them from age-related diseases and contribute to their extended lifespan. \n\nIn addition to their physiological adaptations, naked mole-rats have a unique genetic profile that may underlie their healthy aging. Recent studies have identified several genes associated with DNA repair, protein homeostasis, and stress resistance that are differentially expressed in naked mole-rats compared to other rodents (Kim et al., 2011). These genetic differences may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to their longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. \n\nDespite the significant progress in understanding the biology of naked mole-rats, several questions remain unanswered. For instance, the exact mechanisms by which naked mole-rats resist cancer and maintain physiological functions with age are not fully understood. Additionally, the role of their social structure and environment in promoting healthy aging requires further investigation. \n\nFuture research should focus on elucidating the molecular pathways that contribute to the unique aging phenotype of naked mole-rats. Comparative studies with other long-lived species may also provide valuable insights into the evolution of longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. Moreover, understanding the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the healthy aging of naked mole-rats could have important implications for developing interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. \n\nIn conclusion, the naked mole-rat is a valuable model for studying healthy aging due to its exceptional longevity, resistance to cancer, and ability to maintain physiological functions with age. By exploring the unique characteristics of naked mole-rats, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms underlying healthy aging and develop strategies to combat age-related diseases in humans.", "References": [{"title": "The biology of the naked mole-rat", "authors": "Jarvis, J.
