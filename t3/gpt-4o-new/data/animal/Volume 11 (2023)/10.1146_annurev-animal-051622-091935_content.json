{"Literature Review": "The integration of Indigenous perspectives into animal biosciences is a burgeoning area of interest that seeks to address the historical and ongoing marginalization of Indigenous knowledge systems in scientific research and education. Indigenous perspectives offer a holistic understanding of the natural world, emphasizing interconnectedness and sustainability, which contrasts with the often reductionist approach of Western scientific paradigms. This literature review explores the contributions of Indigenous perspectives in three key areas: human–animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).\n\nHuman–animal bonds are a central aspect of many Indigenous cultures, where animals are often seen as kin or spiritual beings rather than mere resources. This perspective is crucial in understanding the complex relationships between humans and animals, which are often overlooked in Western animal sciences. For instance, Kimmerer (2013) highlights the reciprocal relationships between humans and animals in Indigenous cultures, where animals are respected as teachers and guides. This contrasts with the Western view, which often prioritizes human needs over animal welfare (Kimmerer, 2013). The inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in this area can lead to more ethical and sustainable practices in animal management and conservation.\n\nIn the realm of genetic testing and breeding programs, Indigenous perspectives emphasize the importance of maintaining biodiversity and respecting the natural genetic makeup of animal populations. Western approaches to genetic testing often focus on optimizing traits for human benefit, such as increased productivity or disease resistance, sometimes at the expense of genetic diversity (Anderson, 2014). Indigenous knowledge systems, however, advocate for the preservation of genetic diversity as a means of ensuring ecosystem resilience and adaptability (Anderson, 2014). This perspective is increasingly recognized in conservation biology, where the loss of genetic diversity is seen as a significant threat to species survival (Frankham et al., 2014).\n\nTraditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is a comprehensive system of understanding the environment, developed over millennia by Indigenous peoples. TEK encompasses a wide range of practices and beliefs that are deeply rooted in the cultural and spiritual lives of Indigenous communities. It offers valuable insights into sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation (Berkes, 2012). For example, TEK has been instrumental in the management of fisheries, where Indigenous practices have been shown to enhance fish populations and ecosystem health (Houde, 2007). The integration of TEK into animal biosciences can provide innovative solutions to contemporary environmental challenges, such as climate change and habitat loss.\n\nDespite the potential benefits of incorporating Indigenous perspectives into animal biosciences, several barriers hinder their integration. One significant barrier is the siloed nature of scientific disciplines, which often compartmentalizes knowledge and methodologies. This compartmentalization can marginalize holistic approaches, such as those offered by Indigenous knowledge systems, which do not fit neatly into established scientific categories (Nadasdy, 1999). Furthermore, the hierarchy of methodologies in Western science often privileges quantitative data over qualitative insights, which can devalue the rich, narrative-based knowledge of Indigenous peoples (Smith, 2012).\n\nTo address these challenges, it is essential to foster environments that support the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in scientific research and education. This includes proper tribal consultation, which respects the sovereignty and knowledge of Indigenous communities and ensures that research is conducted ethically and collaboratively (Smith, 2012). Additionally, contextualizing the history of research in Native communities is crucial for understanding the mistrust that often exists between Indigenous peoples and scientific institutions. Acknowledging past injustices and working towards reconciliation can help build trust and facilitate meaningful collaboration (Kovach, 2009).\n\nCreating scholarly spaces that support conversations around Indigenous perspectives in animal biosciences is also vital. These spaces can serve as platforms for sharing knowledge, fostering dialogue, and developing interdisciplinary approaches that integrate Indigenous and Western scientific paradigms. Such initiatives can lead to more inclusive and innovative research that benefits both Indigenous communities and the broader scientific community (Battiste, 2000).\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of Indigenous perspectives into animal biosciences offers a promising avenue for enhancing our understanding of human–animal relationships, genetic diversity, and ecological sustainability. By challenging the dominance of Western scientific paradigms and embracing the holistic and interconnected worldview of Indigenous knowledge systems, we can develop more ethical, sustainable, and inclusive approaches to animal sciences. This requires a concerted effort to support tribal consultation, contextualize historical research practices, and create spaces for dialogue and collaboration. As the field of animal biosciences continues to evolve, the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives will be crucial for addressing the complex challenges of the 21st century.", "References": [{"title": "Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants", "authors": "Robin Wall Kimmerer", "journal": "Milkweed Editions", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Indigenous Knowledge and Technology: Creating a Holistic and Culturally Responsive Curriculum", "authors": "Jane Anderson", "journal": "International Journal of Technology and Design Education", "year": "2014", "volumes": "24", "first page": "107", "last page": "128", "DOI": "10.1007/s10798-013-9240-0"}, {"title": "Genetic Adaptation to Captivity in Species Conservation Programs", "authors": "Richard Frankham, Jonathan D.
