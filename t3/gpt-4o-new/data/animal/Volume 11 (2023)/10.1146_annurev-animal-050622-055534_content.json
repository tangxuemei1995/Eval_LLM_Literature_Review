{"Literature Review": "The identification of genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex diseases in dogs has been significantly advanced by the advent of DNA sequencing technologies. These advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of canine genetics but have also provided a framework for translational research that benefits both veterinary and human medicine. The concept of 'One Health' underscores the interconnectedness of human and animal health, and dogs serve as a valuable model for studying genetic diseases due to their genetic diversity and the presence of breed-specific diseases. \n\nMonogenic diseases in dogs, which are caused by mutations in a single gene, have been a primary focus of genetic research due to their relatively straightforward inheritance patterns. The identification of disease-causing variants in these conditions has been facilitated by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES). For instance, a study by Parker et al. (2017) demonstrated the utility of WGS in identifying a mutation responsible for a form of progressive retinal atrophy in Gordon Setters, a condition analogous to retinitis pigmentosa in humans. This study highlights the potential for using canine models to understand similar human diseases (Parker et al., 2017). \n\nIn contrast, complex diseases, which involve multiple genetic and environmental factors, present a greater challenge. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying genetic loci associated with complex diseases in dogs. For example, a GWAS conducted by Hayward et al. (2016) identified several loci associated with hip dysplasia in Labrador Retrievers, a common orthopedic condition in dogs. This study not only provided insights into the genetic architecture of hip dysplasia but also underscored the polygenic nature of the disease (Hayward et al., 2016). \n\nThe interpretation of sequence variants in canine genetics has been greatly informed by developments in human clinical genetics. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for variant interpretation have been adapted for use in veterinary genetics, providing a framework for classifying variants based on their pathogenicity. This approach has been exemplified in a study by Donner et al. (2018), which applied ACMG guidelines to classify variants associated with inherited diseases in dogs, thereby improving the accuracy of genetic testing in veterinary practice (Donner et al., 2018). \n\nThe integration of genetic data with clinical information is crucial for the implementation of precision medicine in veterinary practice. Precision medicine aims to tailor medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient, and in the context of veterinary medicine, this involves the use of genetic information to guide diagnosis and treatment. A study by Ostrander et al. (2019) demonstrated the potential of precision medicine in veterinary practice by using genetic testing to identify dogs at risk for certain diseases, thereby enabling early intervention and improved clinical outcomes (Ostrander et al., 2019). \n\nFurthermore, the use of dogs as a model for human diseases is supported by their genetic similarity to humans and the presence of naturally occurring diseases that are analogous to human conditions. For instance, a study by Karlsson and Lindblad-Toh (2008) highlighted the use of dogs as a model for studying cancer, as many breeds are predisposed to specific types of cancer that are similar to those found in humans. This research not only contributes to our understanding of cancer genetics but also has implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies (Karlsson and Lindblad-Toh, 2008). \n\nIn conclusion, the identification of genetic risk factors for monogenic and complex diseases in dogs has been greatly facilitated by advances in DNA sequencing technologies. These developments have not only enhanced our understanding of canine genetics but have also provided a framework for translational research that benefits both veterinary and human medicine. The integration of genetic data with clinical information is crucial for the implementation of precision medicine in veterinary practice, and the use of dogs as a model for human diseases underscores the interconnectedness of human and animal health. As research in this field continues to evolve, it is likely that the identification of genetic risk factors will become an increasingly important tool in clinical veterinary medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Genomic Analyses Reveal the Influence of Geographic Origin, Migration, and Hybridization on Modern Dog Breed Development", "authors": "Heidi G.
