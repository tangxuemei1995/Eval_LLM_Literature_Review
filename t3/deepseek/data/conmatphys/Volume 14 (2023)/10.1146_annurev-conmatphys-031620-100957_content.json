{"Literature Review": "The quest for sustainable and renewable energy sources has intensified the search for efficient photocatalytic materials capable of converting solar energy into chemical energy. This literature review focuses on the data-driven discovery of robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion, a field that has seen significant advancements due to the Materials Genome Initiative and the development of comprehensive materials databases. The integration of computational and experimental data, alongside machine learning and high-throughput methods, has accelerated the identification of photocatalysts for reactions such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. A critical aspect of this research is the determination of the (photo)electrochemical stability of these materials, ensuring their durability under operational conditions. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of aqueous stability in the performance of photocatalysts, with several materials demonstrating promising results in both efficiency and longevity. For instance, the discovery of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and perovskite oxides has opened new avenues for the development of photocatalysts with enhanced stability and activity. Moreover, the application of machine learning algorithms has enabled the prediction of material properties and the identification of novel photocatalysts from vast datasets, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with traditional experimental approaches. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the scalability and practical application of these materials, necessitating further research into their synthesis, characterization, and integration into energy conversion devices. This review underscores the potential of data-driven approaches in the discovery of robust photocatalytic materials, paving the way for the development of efficient and sustainable energy conversion technologies.", "References": [{"title": "High-throughput computational screening of metal-organic frameworks for photocatalytic water splitting", "authors": "Jian Liu, David S.
