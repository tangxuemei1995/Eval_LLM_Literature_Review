{"Literature Review": "Floquet theory has emerged as a cornerstone in the study of periodically driven quantum systems, offering a framework to analyze the dynamics of such systems through the lens of an effective static Hamiltonian. This approach, known as Floquet engineering, has enabled the realization of novel phases of matter that defy the constraints of thermal equilibrium. However, the majority of research in this domain has focused on closed systems, neglecting the inevitable presence of dissipation in real-world scenarios. The interplay between periodic driving and dissipation presents a rich landscape for exploration within nonequilibrium statistical physics, especially given the recent experimental capabilities to engineer dissipation in a controlled manner. This literature review delves into the formalism of quantum master equations for open Floquet systems and examines the applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics to Floquet states, highlighting recent advancements in the field.\n\nThe foundation of Floquet theory lies in the Floquet theorem, which asserts that the solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a periodically driven system can be expressed in terms of Floquet states, characterized by quasi-energies and periodic time dependence. This theorem facilitates the mapping of a time-dependent Hamiltonian to an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, thereby simplifying the analysis of driven systems. The application of Floquet theory to closed systems has been extensively documented, with significant contributions to the understanding of topological phases, time crystals, and other exotic states of matter. However, the extension of Floquet theory to open systems, where dissipation and decoherence play pivotal roles, remains a challenging frontier.\n\nDissipation in quantum systems is typically modeled using quantum master equations, which describe the evolution of the system's density matrix in the presence of an environment. The Lindblad master equation, in particular, provides a general framework for incorporating Markovian dissipation into the dynamics of a quantum system. Recent studies have sought to adapt the Lindblad formalism to Floquet systems, leading to the development of Floquet-Lindblad equations. These equations account for the periodic driving by incorporating the Floquet states and quasi-energies into the dissipative dynamics, offering a comprehensive description of open Floquet systems.\n\nOne of the central questions in the study of open Floquet systems is whether equilibrium statistical mechanics can be applied to Floquet states. This question arises from the observation that, in the absence of dissipation, Floquet systems do not thermalize in the conventional sense, as they are driven out of equilibrium by the periodic driving. However, the introduction of dissipation can lead to a steady state that may resemble a thermal equilibrium state, albeit with modified properties. Recent theoretical and experimental work has explored this possibility, investigating the conditions under which Floquet states can be described by an effective temperature or other thermodynamic quantities.\n\nFor instance, studies have shown that in the presence of weak dissipation, Floquet systems can reach a nonequilibrium steady state that exhibits features akin to thermal equilibrium, such as the establishment of a Floquet-Gibbs ensemble. This ensemble is characterized by a distribution over Floquet states that depends on the quasi-energies and the effective temperature of the environment. However, the applicability of the Floquet-Gibbs ensemble is contingent on the nature of the dissipation and the driving protocol, with strong driving or non-Markovian dissipation potentially leading to deviations from thermal-like behavior.\n\nExperimental advances have played a crucial role in validating theoretical predictions and exploring new phenomena in open Floquet systems. Techniques such as quantum simulation with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits have enabled the precise control of both the driving and the dissipation, allowing for the observation of Floquet states and their response to environmental coupling. These experiments have not only confirmed the existence of Floquet-Gibbs states but have also uncovered novel phases of matter that emerge from the interplay of driving and dissipation, such as dissipative time crystals and Floquet topological insulators.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of Floquet states in open quantum systems represents a vibrant area of research at the intersection of nonequilibrium statistical physics and quantum engineering. The development of Floquet-Lindblad equations has provided a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of driven-dissipative systems, while the exploration of Floquet-Gibbs ensembles and other thermodynamic concepts has shed light on the thermalization of Floquet states. As experimental techniques continue to advance, we can anticipate further discoveries in this field, with potential applications in quantum computing, materials science, and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Floquet engineering of quantum materials", "authors": "Takashi Oka, Sota Kitamura", "journal": "Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "387", "last page": "408", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031218-013423"}, {"title": "Periodically driven quantum systems: Effective Hamiltonians and engineered gauge fields", "authors": "Netanel H.
