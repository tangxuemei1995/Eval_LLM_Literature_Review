{"Literature Review": "The study of Fermi surfaces, or fermiology, has evolved significantly with the discovery of topological metals. These materials are characterized by Fermi surfaces that exhibit a nontrivial Berry phase, a geometric phase acquired by a quantum state over a closed loop in parameter space. This review focuses on the fermiology of topological metals, emphasizing the role of magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations in diagnosing their topological properties. Quantum oscillations, such as those observed in the Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen effects, provide a window into the geometry and topology of Fermi surfaces. The waveform of these oscillations encodes information about the Berry phase, the separation of Fermi-surface pockets, and the symmetry class of the material. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of analyzing the phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, and temperature-dependent frequency of quantum oscillations to uncover the topological nature of Fermi surfaces. For instance, the phase offset can reveal the Berry phase directly, while the presence of high harmonics may indicate the existence of multiple Fermi-surface pockets or magnetic breakdown effects. The orientation of the magnetic field relative to crystallographic axes plays a crucial role in these measurements, as it can selectively probe different aspects of the Fermi surface topology. Moreover, the symmetry class of the topological metal, whether it be a Dirac or Weyl semimetal, influences the nature of the quantum oscillations. The separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum space is another critical factor. In cases where spin-split pockets nearly overlap due to weak spin-orbit coupling, a pseudospin degree of freedom emerges, leading to unique quantum oscillation signatures. Similarly, when two pockets touch at an isolated point, which could be a topological band-touching point or a saddlepoint in the energy-momentum dispersion, magnetic breakdown can occur, further complicating the oscillation pattern. The nonabelian Berry connection, which generalizes the concept of the Berry phase to systems with multiple bands, introduces new dimensions to the analysis of quantum oscillations in topological metals. Future directions in topofermiology may explore the impact of electron-electron interactions on Fermi-liquid instabilities and the behavior of two-dimensional electron liquids in topological materials. These advancements promise to deepen our understanding of the interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum mechanics in condensed matter systems.", "References": [{"title": "Topological semimetals", "authors": "B.
