{"Literature Review": "The exploration of non-Hermitian topological phenomena has emerged as a vibrant field of research, bridging the gap between mathematical theory and condensed matter physics. This review delves into the intricate relationship between non-Hermitian physics and topological phases, with a particular emphasis on the bulk-boundary correspondence and the non-Hermitian skin effect. The bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of topological physics, posits a direct relationship between the bulk topological invariants and the existence of robust boundary states. This principle has been extensively studied in Hermitian systems, where it has led to the discovery of topological insulators and superconductors. However, the extension of these concepts to non-Hermitian systems, characterized by complex eigenvalues, has unveiled a plethora of novel phenomena and challenges. One of the most striking manifestations of non-Hermiticity is the skin effect, where the eigenstates of the system are exponentially localized at the boundary, leading to an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to boundary conditions. This effect, which has no direct counterpart in Hermitian systems, has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation. The interplay between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena has been explored in various contexts, including photonic systems, cold atoms, and electronic materials. These studies have revealed that non-Hermiticity can significantly alter the topological properties of a system, leading to the emergence of new topological phases and phase transitions. Moreover, the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself has been a topic of considerable interest. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian systems can exhibit topological invariants that are distinct from those found in Hermitian systems, opening up new avenues for the classification and characterization of topological phases. The exploration of non-Hermitian topological phenomena has also led to the development of new theoretical tools and frameworks, such as the non-Hermitian extension of the Berry phase and the introduction of non-Hermitian topological band theory. These advances have not only deepened our understanding of non-Hermitian systems but have also provided new insights into the nature of topological phases in general. As the field continues to evolve, it is clear that non-Hermitian topological phenomena will play a central role in the future of condensed matter physics and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Topological insulators and superconductors", "authors": "Xiao-Liang Qi, Shou-Cheng Zhang", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "83", "first page": "1057", "last page": "1110", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.83.1057"}, {"title": "Non-Hermitian physics and PT symmetry", "authors": "Carl M.
