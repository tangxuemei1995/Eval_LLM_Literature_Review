{"Literature Review": "Swimming in complex fluids presents a fascinating intersection of locomotion, soft matter, and active matter physics, with significant implications for biological systems and engineered applications. This literature review synthesizes current understanding and identifies gaps in research on swimming in environments characterized by complex stresses, confining boundaries, and collective motion of swimmers. The classification of these systems based on length- and timescales, as well as swimmer concentration, provides a structured framework for discussing recent advancements and future directions. Complex fluids, by definition, exhibit non-Newtonian behavior due to the presence of microstructures such as polymers, colloids, or biological cells, which introduce elasticity, yield stress, and other rheological complexities. The interaction of swimmers with these microstructures and with each other leads to a rich variety of phenomena that challenge our understanding of fluid dynamics and locomotion. Recent studies have explored the effects of fluid elasticity on swimming efficiency and speed, revealing that certain swimmers can exploit elastic stresses to enhance propulsion. For example, Lauga (2007) demonstrated that the swimming speed of a microorganism in a viscoelastic fluid can increase with fluid elasticity, contrary to the intuition derived from Newtonian fluid dynamics. This finding has been corroborated by subsequent experiments and simulations, highlighting the importance of considering fluid microstructure in the design of microswimmers. Confinement introduces another layer of complexity, as swimmers navigate through narrow channels or near boundaries that alter flow fields and induce hydrodynamic interactions. The work of Spagnolie and Lauga (2012) on the hydrodynamics of swimming near surfaces has shown that boundaries can significantly affect the trajectory and stability of swimmers, with implications for bacterial biofilm formation and the design of microfluidic devices. Moreover, the collective motion of swimmers in dense suspensions leads to emergent phenomena such as swarming, clustering, and turbulence at low Reynolds numbers. Saintillan and Shelley (2013) have provided a comprehensive review of active suspensions, emphasizing the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the self-organization of swimming microorganisms. These studies underscore the interplay between individual locomotion and collective dynamics, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of biological fluids and the development of synthetic active matter. Despite these advancements, several areas remain underexplored. The impact of fluid heterogeneity, such as gradients in viscosity or elasticity, on swimming strategies is not well understood. Additionally, the role of swimmer shape and flexibility in complex fluids has received limited attention, despite its relevance to biological systems and potential applications in targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, the integration of experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches is essential for advancing our understanding of swimming in complex fluids. Future research should aim to bridge these gaps, leveraging interdisciplinary insights to unravel the complexities of locomotion in non-Newtonian environments. In conclusion, swimming in complex fluids is a vibrant field of research that spans multiple disciplines and offers rich opportunities for discovery. By classifying systems based on length- and timescales, as well as swimmer concentration, this review highlights the diversity of phenomena encountered in these environments and the need for a multifaceted approach to understand and harness them.", "References": [{"title": "Propulsion in a viscoelastic fluid", "authors": "Eric Lauga", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2007", "volumes": "19", "first page": "083104", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1063/1.2751388"}, {"title": "Hydrodynamics of self-propulsion near a boundary: predictions and accuracy of far-field approximations", "authors": "Sebastian E.
