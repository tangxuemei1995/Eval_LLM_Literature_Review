{"Literature Review": "The exploration of odd viscosity and odd elasticity has opened new avenues in the study of materials that defy conventional mechanical responses. Traditionally, elasticity and viscosity are understood as a material's capacity to store and dissipate energy, respectively. However, certain materials exhibit additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity, which introduce transverse responses and modify the dynamics of dislocations and topological waves (Avron, 1998; Banerjee et al., 2017). These phenomena are not merely academic curiosities but have profound implications across various fields, from quantum fluids to active matter systems.\n\nOdd viscosity, a concept first introduced in the context of quantum Hall fluids, refers to a non-dissipative viscosity that arises in systems breaking time-reversal symmetry (Avron, 1998). This type of viscosity leads to transverse stress responses in the absence of a velocity gradient, a hallmark of systems with broken parity and time-reversal symmetries. Similarly, odd elasticity describes a material's ability to exhibit elastic responses that are not aligned with the applied strain, a feature that can significantly alter the material's mechanical properties (Scheibner et al., 2020).\n\nThe phenomenology of odd viscosity and odd elasticity is rich and varied. For instance, in active matter systems, such as collections of self-propelled particles, odd viscosity can lead to the emergence of spontaneous flows and pattern formation (Banerjee et al., 2017). In the realm of quantum fluids, odd viscosity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of vortices and the stability of topological defects (Read, 2009). Furthermore, the study of odd elasticity has shed light on the mechanical behavior of biological tissues and engineered metamaterials, where unconventional elastic responses can be harnessed for novel functionalities (Scheibner et al., 2020).\n\nMicroscopic mechanisms underlying odd viscosity and odd elasticity are diverse and system-dependent. In quantum Hall fluids, odd viscosity arises from the topological nature of the electronic states (Avron, 1998). In active matter, it is the result of the nonequilibrium dynamics of the constituent particles (Banerjee et al., 2017). Similarly, odd elasticity can emerge from the chiral interactions in biological polymers or the designed asymmetry in mechanical metamaterials (Scheibner et al., 2020).\n\nRecent advances in experimental techniques have enabled the direct measurement of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in various systems. For example, optical trapping and microrheology have been used to probe the odd viscous responses in active colloids (Soni et al., 2019). Similarly, mechanical testing of chiral metamaterials has provided insights into the odd elastic properties of these structures (Chen et al., 2021).\n\nThe implications of odd viscosity and odd elasticity extend beyond fundamental science. In materials science, understanding these phenomena can lead to the design of materials with tailored mechanical responses. In biology, they offer new perspectives on the mechanics of cells and tissues. Moreover, in the field of soft matter physics, odd viscosity and odd elasticity provide a framework for understanding the complex dynamics of active and driven systems.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of odd viscosity and odd elasticity represents a vibrant area of research that bridges multiple disciplines. By uncovering the principles governing these unconventional mechanical responses, researchers are not only expanding our understanding of material behavior but also paving the way for technological innovations. As experimental and theoretical efforts continue to advance, we can expect to uncover even more fascinating aspects of odd viscosity and odd elasticity, further enriching the landscape of modern physics and materials science.", "References": [{"title": "Odd viscosity", "authors": "Avron, J.
