{"Literature Review": "Active colloids represent a fascinating class of self-propelled particles that navigate through viscous fluids by harnessing energy from their environment. This literature review delves into the numerical and theoretical frameworks developed to model these dynamic entities, focusing on their propulsion mechanisms, interactions, and behaviors in complex environments. The foundational model for understanding active colloids is the Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model, which incorporates potential forces and effective pairwise interactions, including hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. This model serves as a cornerstone for exploring the dynamics of microswimmers, such as the squirmer model, which provides insights into the locomotion mechanisms of these particles. Recent advancements have extended the ABP framework to include explicit modeling of self-generated fluid flow and the intricate coupling between hydrodynamic and chemical fields, offering a more comprehensive understanding of active colloid dynamics. The exploration of active colloids in crowded and complex environments has revealed novel phenomena, such as enhanced diffusion and pattern formation, which are crucial for applications in microrheology and the design of active colloidal engines. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning techniques has opened new avenues for the adaptive control of active colloids, enabling the design of systems with tailored responses to environmental stimuli. The effects of colloid and fluid inertia have also been investigated, highlighting the importance of these factors in the propulsion and interaction dynamics of active colloids. This review underscores the significance of numerical and theoretical modeling in advancing our understanding of active colloids and their potential applications in various fields, from biomedical engineering to environmental science.", "References": [{"title": "Active Brownian particles: From individual to collective stochastic dynamics", "authors": "Romanczuk, Pawel, Bar, Markus, Ebeling, Werner, Lindner, Benjamin, Schimansky-Geier, Lutz", "journal": "European Physical Journal: Special Topics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "202", "first page": "1", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.1140/epjst/e2012-01529-y"}, {"title": "Hydrodynamics of soft active matter", "authors": "Marchetti, M.
