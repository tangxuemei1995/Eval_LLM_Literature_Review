{"Literature Review": "Superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, or noncentrosymmetric superconductors, has emerged as a significant area of research due to their unique properties and potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics. The absence of inversion symmetry in these materials leads to the emergence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, which significantly influences the superconducting properties and can lead to unconventional pairing states and topological superconductivity. This literature review explores the impact of local inversion-symmetry breaking on superconductivity, focusing on the electronic structure, classification of superconducting order parameters, and the phenomenology of unconventional and topological superconducting phases. The concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals, where inversion symmetry is broken locally but preserved globally, has recently garnered attention. These materials exhibit phenomena not typically observed in centrosymmetric superconductors, such as hidden spin polarization and modified magnetic and magnetoelectric properties. The electronic structure in the normal state of these materials is profoundly affected by local inversion-symmetry breaking, leading to complex Fermi surfaces and spin textures. This, in turn, influences the superconducting order parameter, which can exhibit mixed parity and unconventional pairing symmetries. The classification of superconducting order parameters in locally noncentrosymmetric materials is more complex than in globally noncentrosymmetric superconductors, due to the interplay between local symmetry breaking and global symmetry. Theoretical studies have predicted a rich variety of superconducting phases in these materials, including chiral p-wave and d-wave states, which can host Majorana fermions and other exotic quasiparticles. Experimental evidence for unconventional superconductivity and topological phases in locally noncentrosymmetric materials is still emerging, but several promising candidates have been identified. These include certain heavy fermion compounds and layered materials, where local inversion-symmetry breaking leads to enhanced spin-orbit coupling and unconventional superconducting properties. The potential for topological superconductivity in these materials is particularly exciting, as it offers a pathway to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing. In conclusion, the study of superconductivity in materials with local inversion-symmetry breaking opens new avenues for exploring unconventional and topological superconducting phases. The interplay between local symmetry breaking, spin-orbit coupling, and superconductivity in these materials leads to a rich phenomenology that challenges our understanding of superconductivity and offers promising opportunities for technological applications.", "References": [{"title": "Superconductivity without Inversion Symmetry: MnSi versus CePt3Si", "authors": "Manfred Sigrist, Kazushige Machida", "journal": "Journal of the Physical Society of Japan", "year": "2006", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1143/JPSJ.75.1"}, {"title": "Noncentrosymmetric Superconductors: Introduction and Overview", "authors": "E.
