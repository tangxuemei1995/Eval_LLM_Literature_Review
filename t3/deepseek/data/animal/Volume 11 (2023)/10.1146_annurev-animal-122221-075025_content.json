{"Literature Review": "Insects play a pivotal role in ecosystems, contributing to pollination, nutrient cycling, and serving as a food source for other species. However, recent studies have highlighted a concerning decline in insect diversity, abundance, and biomass globally, attributed to anthropogenic factors such as habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution (Wagner et al., 2021). This decline poses significant threats to ecosystem functionality and human food security, underscoring the urgent need for effective conservation strategies. Population genomics emerges as a powerful tool in this context, offering insights into genetic diversity, demographic history, and adaptive potential of insect populations. Despite its potential, conservation genetics has historically focused more on vertebrates, with invertebrates, including insects, receiving less attention (Stork, 2018). This oversight is critical given that insects represent the majority of biodiversity and face unique challenges due to their shorter generation times and larger population sizes, which may require distinct analytical approaches and conservation strategies (Cardoso et al., 2020). The advent of high-quality reference genome assemblies has significantly advanced the field of insect conservation genomics. These resources enable precise inference of past demographic fluctuations and recent population declines, assessment of genetic load, identification of evolutionarily significant units and cryptic species, and analysis of genetic adaptation to environmental stressors (Ellegren, 2014). Such genomic insights are crucial for identifying populations at risk and informing conservation actions tailored to the specific needs and adaptive capacities of insect species. For instance, population genomics can reveal the genetic basis of adaptation to climate change, guiding the selection of populations for conservation efforts based on their resilience to future environmental changes (Bay et al., 2018). Moreover, the delineation of evolutionarily significant units through genomic data can aid in the prioritization of conservation efforts, ensuring the preservation of genetic diversity essential for species' long-term survival (Funk et al., 2012). Despite these advances, challenges remain in applying population genomics to insect conservation. These include the need for comprehensive genomic resources across a wide range of insect species, the development of analytical methods suited to the unique characteristics of insect populations, and the integration of genomic data into conservation planning and policy (Allendorf et al., 2010). Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts among researchers, conservation practitioners, and policymakers to harness the full potential of population genomics in averting insect declines. In conclusion, population genomics offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of insect biodiversity and inform conservation strategies. By leveraging genomic tools and data, we can identify vulnerable populations, understand the genetic basis of adaptation, and implement targeted conservation actions to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic drivers on insect populations. As we move forward, it is imperative to expand genomic research to encompass a broader range of insect species, refine analytical approaches, and integrate genomic insights into conservation practices to safeguard insect biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide.", "References": [{"title": "Insect declines in the Anthropocene", "authors": "David L.
