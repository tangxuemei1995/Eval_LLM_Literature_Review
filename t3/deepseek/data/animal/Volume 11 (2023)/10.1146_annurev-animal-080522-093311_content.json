{"Literature Review": "Deleterious mutations, which negatively impact the fitness of individuals, are a pervasive feature of genomes across species. Their study is crucial in conservation genetics, as they can significantly influence the viability of populations facing extinction risks. The quantification and understanding of deleterious variation in natural populations are complex, primarily due to the challenges in determining the selection coefficients of individual mutations and the interplay between selection strength and demographic history (Charlesworth & Willis, 2009). This literature review aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which deleterious variation affects natural populations and to explore the implications for conservation strategies. The genetic load, or the cumulative burden of deleterious mutations within a population, is a critical concept in this context. It is influenced by factors such as mutation rate, selection efficiency, and population size (Lynch et al., 2016). Small populations, in particular, are susceptible to the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to genetic drift overpowering selection, a phenomenon known as the 'drift load' (Ohta, 1992). Furthermore, nonequilibrium population size changes, such as bottlenecks and expansions, can alter the frequency and distribution of deleterious mutations, potentially leading to increased extinction risks (Peischl & Excoffier, 2015). Inbreeding, which increases homozygosity, can exacerbate the effects of deleterious recessive mutations, leading to inbreeding depression (Keller & Waller, 2002). Conversely, gene flow can introduce new genetic variation, potentially masking deleterious mutations and reducing inbreeding depression (Frankham, 2015). However, the benefits of gene flow depend on the genetic compatibility between source and recipient populations. Simulations have become an invaluable tool in studying deleterious variation, allowing researchers to model complex scenarios and predict the outcomes of different conservation strategies (Hoban et al., 2016). These models can incorporate various factors, including mutation rates, selection coefficients, and demographic parameters, to assess the impact of deleterious mutations on population viability. In nonmodel species, which often lack detailed genomic resources, indirect methods such as pedigree analysis and quantitative genetics are employed to estimate genetic load and inbreeding depression (Kardos et al., 2016). Conservation strategies must account for deleterious variation to mitigate its impact on endangered populations. This includes maintaining genetic diversity, managing population sizes to minimize genetic drift, and facilitating gene flow where appropriate (Allendorf et al., 2013). Additionally, genomic tools can be leveraged to identify and monitor deleterious mutations, informing targeted management actions (Fuentes-Pardo & Ruzzante, 2017). In conclusion, understanding and managing deleterious variation is essential for the conservation of biodiversity. By integrating genetic, demographic, and ecological data, conservationists can develop more effective strategies to safeguard the genetic health of populations at risk.", "References": [{"title": "The genetic basis of inbreeding depression", "authors": "Charlesworth Deborah, Willis John H.", "journal": "Genetics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "182", "first page": "1119", "last page": "1132", "DOI": "10.1534/genetics.109.102871"}, {"title": "Genetic drift, selection and the evolution of the mutation rate", "authors": "Lynch Michael, Ackerman Matthew S., Gout Jean-Francois, Long Hongan, Sung Way, Thomas William K., Foster Patricia L.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "704", "last page": "714", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg.2016.104"}, {"title": "The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution", "authors": "Ohta Tomoko", "journal": "Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics", "year": "1992", "volumes": "23", "first page": "263", "last page": "286", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.es.23.110192.001403"}, {"title": "Expansion load and the evolutionary dynamics of a species range", "authors": "Peischl Stephan, Excoffier Laurent", "journal": "The American Naturalist", "year": "2015", "volumes": "185", "first page": "E81", "last page": "E93", "DOI": "10.1086/680220"}, {"title": "Inbreeding effects in wild populations", "authors": "Keller Lukas F., Waller David M.", "journal": "Trends in Ecology & Evolution", "year": "2002", "volumes": "17", "first page": "230", "last page": "241", "DOI": "10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02489-8"}, {"title": "Genetic rescue of small inbred populations: meta-analysis reveals large and consistent benefits of gene flow", "authors": "Frankham Richard", "journal": "Molecular Ecology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "24", "first page": "2610", "last page": "2618", "DOI": "10.1111/mec.13139"}, {"title": "Finding the genomic basis of local adaptation: pitfalls, practical solutions, and future directions", "authors": "Hoban Sean, Kelley Joanna L., Lotterhos Katie E., Antolin Michael F., Bradburd Gideon, Lowry David B., Poss Mary L., Reed Laura K., Storfer Andrew, Whitlock Michael C.", "journal": "The American Naturalist", "year": "2016", "volumes": "188", "first page": "379", "last page": "397", "DOI": "10.1086/688018"}, {"title": "The crucial role of genome-wide genetic variation in conservation", "authors": "Kardos Marty, Luikart Gordon, Allendorf Fred W.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2016", "volumes": "113", "first page": "7984", "last page": "7991", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1601648113"}, {"title": "Conservation and the Genetics of Populations", "authors": "Allendorf Fred W., Luikart Gordon, Aitken Sally N.", "journal": "Wiley-Blackwell", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Whole-genome sequencing approaches for conservation biology: Advantages, limitations and practical recommendations", "authors": "Fuentes-Pardo Angela P., Ruzzante Daniel E.", "journal": "Molecular Ecology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "26", "first page": "5369", "last page": "5406", "DOI": "10.1111/mec.14264"}]}
