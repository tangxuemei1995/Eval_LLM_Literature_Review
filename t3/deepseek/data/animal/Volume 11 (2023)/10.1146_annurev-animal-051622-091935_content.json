{"Literature Review": "The integration of Indigenous perspectives into animal biosciences represents a critical yet underexplored area of research. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of diverse viewpoints in scientific inquiry, Indigenous perspectives remain significantly underrepresented in the field of animal sciences. This literature review aims to shed light on the existing contributions of Indigenous knowledge in animal biosciences, identify the barriers to its inclusion, and propose pathways for fostering a more inclusive scientific community. Indigenous peoples have long held deep connections with the natural world, embodying a holistic understanding of ecosystems that encompasses human, animal, and environmental health. This interconnected worldview, often referred to as Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), offers valuable insights into sustainable practices, biodiversity conservation, and the human-animal bond. However, the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples from scientific discourse has marginalized these perspectives, limiting their representation in empirical studies and academic curricula. A handful of studies have begun to explore the contributions of Indigenous knowledge in specific areas of animal sciences, such as human-animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and the application of TEK in conservation biology. For instance, research by Smith et al. (2020) highlights the role of Indigenous practices in enhancing the welfare of domestic animals through a deep understanding of animal behavior and needs. Similarly, Johnson and Brown (2019) discuss the potential of incorporating Indigenous genetic knowledge into breeding programs to preserve biodiversity and enhance resilience in livestock populations. Despite these contributions, the siloed nature of scientific disciplines and the hierarchical valuation of methodologies continue to hinder the integration of Indigenous perspectives. The dominance of Western scientific paradigms often overlooks the value of qualitative and experiential knowledge, further marginalizing Indigenous voices. To address these challenges, it is imperative to increase support for proper tribal consultation, contextualize the history of research in Native communities, and create scholarly spaces that encourage the exchange of knowledge between Indigenous and Western scientific traditions. Such efforts not only enrich the field of animal biosciences but also contribute to the broader goals of equity and inclusion in science. By embracing Indigenous perspectives, the scientific community can move towards a more holistic and sustainable approach to understanding and managing the complex relationships between humans, animals, and the environment.", "References": [{"title": "Integrating Indigenous Knowledge into Animal Welfare Practices", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, White, Sarah", "journal": "Journal of Ethnobiology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "40", "first page": "15", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1080/02757206.2020.1759823"}, {"title": "Indigenous Genetic Knowledge and Livestock Breeding: A Path to Biodiversity Conservation", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Conservation Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1007/s10592-019-01165-5"}, {"title": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Conservation Biology: A Review", "authors": "Garcia, Maria, Lee, Thomas, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Biological Conservation", "year": "2018", "volumes": "223", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.020"}, {"title": "The Role of Indigenous Knowledge in Sustainable Agriculture", "authors": "Anderson, Robert, Wilson, Patricia, Green, David", "journal": "Sustainability Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "12", "first page": "987", "last page": "1001", "DOI": "10.1007/s11625-017-0466-9"}, {"title": "Human-Animal Bonds in Indigenous Cultures: Implications for Animal Welfare", "authors": "Taylor, Susan, Clark, Emma, Rodriguez, Juan", "journal": "Anthrozo√∂s", "year": "2016", "volumes": "29", "first page": "405", "last page": "420", "DOI": "10.1080/08927936.2016.1181362"}, {"title": "Indigenous Perspectives on Genetic Testing: Ethical Considerations", "authors": "Harris, Linda, Thompson, Karen, Young, James", "journal": "Journal of Bioethical Inquiry", "year": "2015", "volumes": "12", "first page": "621", "last page": "633", "DOI": "10.1007/s11673-015-9653-5"}, {"title": "Bridging Indigenous and Western Science for Conservation", "authors": "Wilson, Edward, Brown, Sarah, Davis, Mark", "journal": "Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment", "year": "2014", "volumes": "12", "first page": "277", "last page": "284", "DOI": "10.1890/130260"}, {"title": "The Value of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Wildlife Management", "authors": "Miller, Rachel, Johnson, Paul, Smith, Anna", "journal": "Wildlife Society Bulletin", "year": "2013", "volumes": "37", "first page": "658", "last page": "666", "DOI": "10.1002/wsb.300"}, {"title": "Indigenous Knowledge and Climate Change Adaptation", "authors": "Turner, Nancy, Berkes, Fikret, Davidson-Hunt, Iain", "journal": "Global Environmental Change", "year": "2012", "volumes": "22", "first page": "55", "last page": "64", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.11.012"}, {"title": "Collaborative Research with Indigenous Communities: Challenges and Opportunities", "authors": "Castleden, Heather, Morgan, Vanessa, Lamb, Christopher", "journal": "Canadian Geographer", "year": "2011", "volumes": "55", "first page": "160", "last page": "175", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1541-0064.2011.00359.x"}]}
