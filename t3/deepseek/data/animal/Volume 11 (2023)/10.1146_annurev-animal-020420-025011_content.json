{"Literature Review": "The emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) as significant pathogens in human populations has underscored the importance of understanding their zoonotic origins, animal reservoirs, and mechanisms of cross-species transmission. Over the past three decades, several CoVs have emerged, causing diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe conditions such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. The rapid mutation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs), complicating pandemic management and control efforts. This literature review focuses on the role of animal models in studying these viruses, identifies potential zoonotic reservoirs, and explores the mechanisms of cross-species transmission that facilitate the emergence of human-infecting CoVs. Animal models have been instrumental in understanding the pathogenesis, transmission, and immune response to CoVs. Studies using mice, ferrets, and non-human primates have provided insights into viral replication, tissue tropism, and the efficacy of potential vaccines and therapeutics. For instance, research in mice has elucidated the role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in SARS-CoV-2 entry and pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of host factors in viral infection. Similarly, ferrets have been used to study respiratory transmission of CoVs, offering valuable information on the dynamics of viral spread and the effectiveness of interventions. The identification of zoonotic reservoirs is crucial for understanding the origins of emerging CoVs and preventing future outbreaks. Bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs for several CoVs, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, due to their ability to harbor a wide range of viruses without showing signs of disease. Other animals, such as pangolins and civets, have also been identified as potential intermediate hosts in the transmission of CoVs to humans. The role of these animals in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 remains a subject of ongoing research, with studies focusing on the genetic similarities between CoVs found in these animals and those infecting humans. Cross-species transmission of CoVs is facilitated by several factors, including genetic recombination, host receptor compatibility, and ecological interactions between humans and animals. Recombination events can lead to the emergence of novel CoVs with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity, as seen in the case of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. The compatibility of viral spike proteins with host receptors, such as ACE2, plays a critical role in determining the host range of CoVs. Additionally, human activities, such as wildlife trade and habitat encroachment, increase the risk of zoonotic spillover by bringing humans into closer contact with potential animal reservoirs. Surveillance of animal populations and the environment is essential for early detection of emerging CoVs and the prevention of future pandemics. Genomic sequencing of CoVs in wildlife and domestic animals can provide early warning of potential threats to human health. Furthermore, understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of CoVs in their natural reservoirs can inform strategies for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission. In conclusion, the study of animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission is critical for understanding the emergence and spread of human-infecting CoVs. By leveraging insights from these areas, researchers can develop effective strategies for pandemic preparedness and response, ultimately reducing the impact of CoV diseases on global health.", "References": [{"title": "The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2", "authors": "Andersen, Kristian G., Rambaut, Andrew, Lipkin, W.
