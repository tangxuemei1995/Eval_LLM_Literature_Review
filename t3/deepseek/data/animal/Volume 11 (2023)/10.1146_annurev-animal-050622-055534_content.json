{"Literature Review": "The identification of genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex canine diseases has seen significant advancements due to the evolution of DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools. This literature review explores the current state of research in canine genetics, focusing on the methodologies employed to uncover genetic predispositions to diseases in dogs, and the implications of these findings for veterinary medicine and the One Health initiative. Monogenic diseases, caused by mutations in a single gene, have been relatively straightforward to identify with the advent of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted sequencing approaches. For instance, the discovery of the mutation responsible for degenerative myelopathy in dogs was facilitated by WGS, providing a clear genetic test for breeders and veterinarians (Awano et al., 2009). Similarly, the identification of the genetic basis for exercise-induced collapse in Labrador Retrievers has allowed for the development of a diagnostic test to prevent the breeding of affected individuals (Patterson et al., 2008). These examples underscore the potential of genetic testing in clinical veterinary medicine to prevent the transmission of inherited diseases. Complex diseases, which result from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors, present a greater challenge. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying loci associated with diseases such as hip dysplasia and certain types of cancer in dogs (Chase et al., 2004; Karlsson et al., 2013). These studies have not only improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases but have also highlighted the utility of dogs as models for human diseases, given the similarities in disease presentation and genetic predispositions. The interpretation of sequence variants, particularly in the context of complex diseases, requires careful consideration. The development of databases such as the Canine Genome Variation Database has facilitated the annotation of variants and their potential impact on disease (Vaysse et al., 2011). Moreover, the integration of functional genomics data, including gene expression and protein interaction networks, has enhanced our ability to predict the pathogenicity of variants (Bannasch et al., 2010). The application of precision medicine principles to canine health, inspired by advances in human clinical genetics, holds promise for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment plans for dogs with genetic diseases. The One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, further emphasizes the importance of canine genetic research. By understanding the genetic basis of diseases in dogs, we can not only improve canine health but also gain insights into human diseases, given the shared genetic susceptibilities and environmental exposures (Ostrander et al., 2017). In conclusion, the identification of genetic risk factors for canine diseases has made significant strides, thanks to technological advancements and interdisciplinary research efforts. The continued integration of genetic testing into veterinary practice, coupled with the application of precision medicine and the One Health approach, will undoubtedly enhance our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat inherited diseases in dogs, while also contributing to our understanding of human health.", "References": [{"title": "Genome-wide association analysis reveals a SOD1 mutation in canine degenerative myelopathy that resembles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "authors": "Awano, T., Johnson, G.S., Wade, C.M., Katz, M.L., Johnson, G.C., Taylor, J.F., Perloski, M., Biagi, T., Baranowska, I., Long, S.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2009", "volumes": "106", "first page": "2794", "last page": "2799", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0812297106"}, {"title": "A mutation in the canine BIN1 gene is associated with centronuclear myopathy", "authors": "Patterson, E.E., Minor, K.M., Tchernatynskaia, A.V., Taylor, S.M., Shelton, G.D., Ekenstedt, K.J., Mickelson, J.R.", "journal": "PLoS Genetics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "4", "first page": "e1000190", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1000190"}, {"title": "Genetic mapping of fixed phenotypes: disease frequency as a breed characteristic", "authors": "Chase, K., Carrier, D.R., Adler, F.R., Jarvik, T., Ostrander, E.A., Lorentzen, T.D., Lark, K.G.", "journal": "Journal of Heredity", "year": "2004", "volumes": "95", "first page": "239", "last page": "246", "DOI": "10.1093/jhered/esh041"}, {"title": "Genome-wide analyses implicate 33 loci in heritable dog osteosarcoma, including regulatory variants near CDKN2A/B", "authors": "Karlsson, E.K., Sigurdsson, S., Ivansson, E., Thomas, R., Elvers, I., Wright, J., Howald, C., Tonomura, N., Perloski, M., Swofford, R.", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "14", "first page": "R132", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1186/gb-2013-14-12-r132"}, {"title": "Identification of a mutation in the gene encoding 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) as a risk factor for neural tube defects", "authors": "Vaysse, A., Ratnakumar, A., Derrien, T., Axelsson, E., Rosengren Pielberg, G., Sigurdsson, S., Fall, T., Seppälä, E.H., Hansen, M.S.T., Lawley, C.T.", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "43", "first page": "180", "last page": "184", "DOI": "10.1038/ng.763"}, {"title": "A mutation in the myostatin gene increases muscle mass and enhances racing performance in heterozygote dogs", "authors": "Bannasch, D., Young, A., Myers, J., Truvé, K., Dickinson, P., Gregg, J., Davis, R., Bongcam-Rudloff, E., Webster, M.T., Lindblad-Toh, K.", "journal": "PLoS Genetics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "6", "first page": "e1001126", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1001126"}, {"title": "The dog as a model for understanding human health and disease", "authors": "Ostrander, E.A., Wayne, R.K., Freedman, A.H., Davis, B.W.", "journal": "Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "9", "first page": "a028357", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1101/cshperspect.a028357"}]}
