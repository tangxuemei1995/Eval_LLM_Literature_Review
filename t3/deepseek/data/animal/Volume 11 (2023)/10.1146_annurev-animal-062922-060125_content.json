{"Literature Review": "Zoonotic diseases, which are infections transmitted between animals and humans, have been recognized as significant threats to global health. The role of domestic animals as reservoirs for zoonotic viral diseases has been increasingly documented, highlighting the complex interplay between human activities, environmental changes, and pathogen evolution. This literature review explores the current understanding of domestic animals as potential reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, emphasizing the importance of the One Health approach in addressing these challenges. Domestic animals, including livestock and pets, are integral to human societies but also serve as reservoirs for various zoonotic viruses. Studies have shown that approximately 25% of zoonotic diseases originate from domestic animals, underscoring their role in the transmission of pathogens to humans (Jones et al., 2008). Viruses, accounting for about 30% of all zoonotic infections, are particularly concerning due to their ability to rapidly evolve and adapt to new hosts (Taylor et al., 2001). The transmission of zoonotic viruses from domestic animals to humans can occur through direct contact, aerosols, vectors, or vertically in utero, making these diseases a pervasive threat across different environments and communities (Cleaveland et al., 2001). Emerging viral zoonoses, such as those caused by influenza viruses and coronaviruses, have highlighted the dynamic nature of zoonotic disease emergence and the critical role of domestic animals in these processes (Morens et al., 2004). Endemic viral zoonoses, including rabies and hantavirus infections, continue to pose significant health burdens, particularly in regions where close human-animal interactions are common (Rupprecht et al., 2002). The emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic diseases are influenced by a multitude of factors, including changes in land use, agricultural practices, and climate, which can alter the distribution and behavior of both domestic animals and wildlife (Patz et al., 2004). The One Health concept, which advocates for a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to health, has been increasingly recognized as essential for the effective prevention and control of zoonotic diseases (Zinsstag et al., 2011). This approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health and calls for integrated surveillance, research, and intervention strategies (Mackenzie et al., 2014). In conclusion, domestic animals play a crucial role as reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, necessitating comprehensive and collaborative efforts to mitigate the risks posed by these infections. The One Health framework offers a promising pathway for addressing the complex challenges of zoonotic disease emergence and transmission, highlighting the need for continued research, surveillance, and cross-sectoral collaboration.", "References": [{"title": "Global trends in emerging infectious diseases", "authors": "Jones, Kate E., Patel, Nikkita G., Levy, Marc A., Storeygard, Adam, Balk, Deborah, Gittleman, John L., Daszak, Peter", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2008", "volumes": "451", "first page": "990", "last page": "993", "DOI": "10.1038/nature06536"}, {"title": "Risk factors for human disease emergence", "authors": "Taylor, Louise H., Latham, Sophia M., Woolhouse, Mark E.J.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2001", "volumes": "356", "first page": "983", "last page": "989", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2001.0888"}, {"title": "Diseases of humans and their domestic mammals: pathogen characteristics, host range and the risk of emergence", "authors": "Cleaveland, Sarah, Laurenson, M.
