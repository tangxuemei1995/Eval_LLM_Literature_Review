{"Literature Review": "The naked mole-rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a fascinating model for studying healthy aging due to its exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. With a maximum lifespan exceeding 37 years, NMRs significantly outlive other rodents of similar size, presenting a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms underlying delayed aging and disease resistance (Buffenstein, 2008). This literature review delves into the ecological, physiological, and molecular characteristics of NMRs that contribute to their remarkable healthspan, focusing on their longevity, cancer resistance, and hypoxia tolerance. NMRs inhabit underground colonies in East Africa, where they are exposed to hypoxic conditions. Their ability to thrive in such environments has been linked to their enhanced hypoxia tolerance, a trait that may also contribute to their longevity and resistance to age-related diseases (Park et al., 2017). Studies have shown that NMRs possess unique adaptations at the cellular and molecular levels, including efficient DNA repair mechanisms and a stable proteome, which protect them from the accumulation of damage over time (Tian et al., 2013). Furthermore, NMRs exhibit a delayed aging phenotype, maintaining physiological functions and reproductive capacity well into their later years, a stark contrast to the rapid senescence observed in other mammals (Buffenstein, 2005). One of the most striking features of NMRs is their resistance to cancer. Despite their long lifespan, which typically increases cancer risk, NMRs rarely develop tumors. This cancer resistance has been attributed to several factors, including the production of high-molecular-mass hyaluronan, which may prevent tumor formation (Tian et al., 2013), and an enhanced cellular response to oncogenic stimuli (Seluanov et al., 2009). The social structure of NMR colonies, characterized by a single breeding pair and non-reproductive workers, may also play a role in their longevity and health. This eusociality could reduce the stress and competition typically associated with reproduction, potentially contributing to the extended lifespan of colony members (Jarvis, 1981). Despite these insights, the mechanisms underlying the delayed aging and disease resistance in NMRs remain incompletely understood. Future research should aim to elucidate the genetic and molecular pathways that confer these benefits, with the goal of translating these findings into therapeutic strategies for humans. Additionally, the impact of the NMR's hypoxic environment on its aging process warrants further investigation, as it may offer clues to enhancing human resilience to hypoxia-related diseases (Park et al., 2017). In conclusion, the naked mole-rat serves as a valuable model for understanding the biological basis of healthy aging. Its unique characteristics, including exceptional longevity, cancer resistance, and hypoxia tolerance, provide a rich area of study for researchers aiming to uncover the secrets of a long and healthy life. As we continue to explore the mysteries of the NMR, we move closer to developing interventions that could extend human healthspan and mitigate the effects of aging.", "References": [{"title": "The naked mole-rat: a new long-living model for human aging research", "authors": "Rochelle Buffenstein", "journal": "The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences", "year": "2005", "volumes": "60", "first page": "1369", "last page": "1377", "DOI": "10.1093/gerona/60.11.1369"}, {"title": "Negligible senescence in the longest living rodent, the naked mole-rat: insights from a successfully aging species", "authors": "Rochelle Buffenstein", "journal": "Journal of Comparative Physiology B", "year": "2008", "volumes": "178", "first page": "439", "last page": "445", "DOI": "10.1007/s00360-007-0237-5"}, {"title": "High-molecular-mass hyaluronan mediates the cancer resistance of the naked mole rat", "authors": "Xiao Tian, Jorge Azpurua, Christopher Hine, Amita Vaidya, Max Myakishev-Rempel, Julia Ablaeva, Zhiyong Mao, Eviatar Nevo, Vera Gorbunova, Andrei Seluanov", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "499", "first page": "346", "last page": "349", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12234"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of cancer resistance in long-lived mammals", "authors": "Andrei Seluanov, Christopher Hine, Jorge Azpurua, Max Myakishev-Rempel, Julia Ablaeva, Zhiyong Mao, Eviatar Nevo, Vera Gorbunova", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "834", "last page": "842", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc2522"}, {"title": "Eusociality in a mammal: cooperative breeding in naked mole-rat colonies", "authors": "Jennifer U.
