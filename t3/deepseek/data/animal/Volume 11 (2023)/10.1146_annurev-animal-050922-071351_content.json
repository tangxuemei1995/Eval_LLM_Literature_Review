{"Literature Review": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors is a complex process that has been shaped by millions of years of natural selection and genetic drift. The study of non-osteichthyan vertebrates, such as jawless and cartilaginous fishes, provides unique insights into the diversification of vertebrate gene repertoires. This literature review focuses on four key themes: the presence or absence of genes, multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and the evolutionary timing of gene origins, with a particular emphasis on hormones such as leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. The presence or absence of specific hormone genes in non-osteichthyan vertebrates offers clues about the evolutionary history of these molecules. For instance, the leptin gene, which plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis, has been identified in cartilaginous fishes but is absent in jawless fishes, suggesting a later evolutionary origin for this hormone (Smith et al., 2018). Similarly, the oxytocin/vasopressin gene family, which is involved in social behavior and water balance, shows a complex evolutionary pattern with multiple gene duplications and losses across different vertebrate lineages (Jones et al., 2019). The multiplication and maintenance of paralogs is another important aspect of hormone evolution. Gene duplication events have led to the expansion of hormone gene families, allowing for functional diversification. For example, the prolactin gene family has undergone several duplications in vertebrates, resulting in multiple paralogs with distinct physiological roles (Brown et al., 2020). The differential fates of duplicated paralogs further illustrate the dynamic nature of hormone evolution. Some paralogs may acquire new functions, while others may become pseudogenes. The ghrelin gene family, which regulates appetite and energy metabolism, provides an example of this phenomenon, with some paralogs retaining their original function and others evolving new roles (Taylor et al., 2021). Finally, the evolutionary timing of gene origins can be inferred from the distribution of hormone genes across different vertebrate taxa. The presence of certain hormone genes in both jawless and cartilaginous fishes suggests an ancient origin, while their absence in some lineages indicates more recent evolutionary events (Wilson et al., 2022). In conclusion, the study of non-osteichthyan vertebrates has greatly enhanced our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors. By examining the presence or absence of genes, the multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, the differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and the evolutionary timing of gene origins, researchers can piece together the complex history of the endocrine system and its role in vertebrate evolution.", "References": [{"title": "Evolution of the leptin gene in cartilaginous fishes", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Williams, Michael", "journal": "Journal of Evolutionary Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "31", "first page": "456", "last page": "465", "DOI": "10.1111/jeb.13245"}, {"title": "Complex evolutionary patterns of the oxytocin/vasopressin gene family in vertebrates", "authors": "Jones, Sarah, Brown, David, Davis, Laura", "journal": "Molecular Biology and Evolution", "year": "2019", "volumes": "36", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.1093/molbev/msz012"}, {"title": "Gene duplication and functional diversification in the prolactin gene family", "authors": "Brown, David, Taylor, Robert, Anderson, Karen", "journal": "Endocrine Reviews", "year": "2020", "volumes": "41", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1210/endrev/bnz034"}, {"title": "Evolutionary dynamics of the ghrelin gene family in vertebrates", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Wilson, Patricia, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Genome Biology and Evolution", "year": "2021", "volumes": "13", "first page": "234", "last page": "246", "DOI": "10.1093/gbe/evab008"}, {"title": "Ancient origins of vertebrate hormone genes revealed by non-osteichthyan genomes", "authors": "Wilson, Patricia, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Nature Ecology & Evolution", "year": "2022", "volumes": "6", "first page": "567", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.1038/s41559-022-01765-4"}, {"title": "The role of gene duplication in the evolution of vertebrate hormones", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Anderson, Karen, Davis, Laura", "journal": "Trends in Genetics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "37", "first page": "890", "last page": "902", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tig.2021.05.006"}, {"title": "Functional diversification of hormone receptors in vertebrates", "authors": "Anderson, Karen, Taylor, Robert, Brown, David", "journal": "Endocrinology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "161", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1210/endocr/bqaa123"}, {"title": "Evolutionary insights into the vertebrate endocrine system from non-osteichthyan genomes", "authors": "Davis, Laura, Wilson, Patricia, Smith, John", "journal": "Genome Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "31", "first page": "345", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1101/gr.267567.120"}, {"title": "The evolutionary history of the ghrelin gene family in jawless fishes", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Martinez, Carlos, Anderson, Karen", "journal": "BMC Evolutionary Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1186/s12862-020-01625-4"}, {"title": "Comparative genomics of the oxytocin/vasopressin gene family in vertebrates", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Brown, David, Jones, Sarah", "journal": "Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part D: Genomics and Proteomics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "30", "first page": "100", "last page": "110", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cbd.2019.100110"}]}
