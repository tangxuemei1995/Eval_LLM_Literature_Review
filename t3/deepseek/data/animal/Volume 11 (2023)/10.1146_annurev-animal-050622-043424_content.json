{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of female masculinization in certain species, such as talpid moles and spotted hyenas, presents a fascinating area of study within evolutionary biology and endocrinology. These species exhibit unique anatomical and behavioral traits that challenge traditional notions of sexual dimorphism. This literature review explores the biology and evolution of these 'fierce females,' focusing on their anatomical peculiarities, the physiological implications of these features, and the underlying genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that contribute to their development. Additionally, the review highlights the exceptional maternal capabilities of these females, underscoring the complexity of their femininity despite their masculinized traits. Talpid moles, particularly those within the genus Talpa, exhibit a remarkable form of female masculinization characterized by the development of ovotestes—gonads that possess both ovarian and testicular tissue. These ovotestes produce significant levels of testosterone, contributing to the masculinization of external genitalia and the closure of the vaginal orifice post-estrus (Jiménez et al., 1993). This anatomical configuration poses unique challenges for reproduction, yet mole females have evolved efficient mechanisms to overcome these obstacles, demonstrating their adaptability and resilience. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) present another striking example of female masculinization. Female hyenas possess a pseudopenis and pseudoscrotum, structures that are morphologically similar to the male genitalia but serve distinct functions in females, including urination, mating, and parturition (Frank et al., 1990). The development of these structures is influenced by high levels of androgens during fetal development, which also contribute to the aggressive behavior and social dominance observed in female hyenas (Glickman et al., 1992). Despite these masculinized traits, female hyenas are highly effective mothers, capable of nurturing their offspring in the competitive social hierarchies characteristic of hyena clans. The role of steroid hormones in the development of masculinized traits in both moles and hyenas has been extensively studied. Testosterone, in particular, plays a crucial role in the differentiation of the urogenital system and the manifestation of aggressive behaviors (Drea et al., 1998). Genetic factors also contribute to these developmental processes, with certain genes implicated in the regulation of androgen synthesis and receptor activity (Place et al., 2002). Environmental factors, such as intrauterine position and maternal stress, have been shown to influence the levels of circulating androgens and, consequently, the degree of masculinization in offspring (Racey & Skinner, 1979). The evolution of female masculinization in moles and hyenas raises intriguing questions about the selective pressures that have shaped these traits. In moles, the development of ovotestes and masculinized genitalia may confer advantages in terms of reproductive efficiency and territorial defense (Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2006). In hyenas, the pseudopenis and social dominance of females may have evolved in response to the intense competition for resources within their clans (East et al., 1993). These evolutionary adaptations highlight the complex interplay between anatomy, behavior, and ecology in shaping the biology of these species. Despite their masculinized traits, female moles and hyenas exhibit remarkable maternal behaviors that are essential for the survival of their offspring. Mole females, for instance, are known for their extensive burrow systems, which provide protection and resources for their young (Gorman & Stone, 1990). Hyena females, on the other hand, invest heavily in the care and education of their cubs, ensuring their integration into the social structure of the clan (Holekamp et al., 1996). These maternal capabilities underscore the multifaceted nature of femininity in these species, challenging simplistic interpretations of their masculinized traits. In conclusion, the biology and evolution of female masculinization in talpid moles and spotted hyenas offer valuable insights into the diversity of reproductive strategies and sexual dimorphism in the animal kingdom. The anatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits of these females are the result of complex interactions between genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors, shaped by the selective pressures of their respective ecologies. Despite their unique challenges, female moles and hyenas have evolved to be highly effective mothers, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of life in the face of evolutionary constraints.", "References": [{"title": "The development of the ovotestis in Talpa occidentalis", "authors": "Jiménez, Rafael, Burgos, Miguel, Sánchez, Adolfo, Díaz de la Guardia, Rafael", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Zoology", "year": "1993", "volumes": "265", "first page": "552", "last page": "561", "DOI": "10.1002/jez.1402650606"}, {"title": "Sexual dimorphism in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta)", "authors": "Frank, Laurence G., Glickman, Stephen E., Licht, Paul", "journal": "Journal of Zoology", "year": "1990", "volumes": "221", "first page": "308", "last page": "313", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-7998.1990.tb04000.x"}, {"title": "Androgens and masculinization of genitalia in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta). 1.
