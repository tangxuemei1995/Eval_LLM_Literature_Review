{"Literature Review": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal ecology, physiology, and their interactions with the environment. These technologies, which involve the attachment of miniaturized sensors to animals, have evolved from simple tracking devices to sophisticated instruments capable of recording a wide array of biological and environmental data. This literature review explores the advancements in biologging and biotelemetry, their applications in marine research, and the future directions of these technologies. Early biologging studies primarily focused on tracking the movements of marine animals, providing foundational insights into migration patterns, habitat use, and foraging behavior (Block et al., 2011). As technology advanced, researchers began to collect data on physiological parameters such as heart rate, body temperature, and diving behavior, offering a more comprehensive understanding of how marine animals interact with their environment (Cooke et al., 2004). The development of multi-sensor tags has further expanded the scope of biologging, enabling the simultaneous collection of data on animal behavior, physiology, and environmental conditions (Hussey et al., 2015). One of the most significant contributions of biologging and biotelemetry is the ability to study predator-prey interactions in the wild. By attaching tags to both predators and prey, researchers have gained insights into the strategies employed by marine animals to locate, capture, and avoid being captured by their counterparts (Watanabe et al., 2012). Additionally, these technologies have shed light on the social structures and interactions within marine animal populations, revealing complex communication and cooperation behaviors (Krause et al., 2013). The impact of anthropogenic stressors on marine animals has also been a major focus of biologging studies. By monitoring the responses of animals to factors such as noise pollution, fishing activities, and climate change, researchers have identified critical threats to marine biodiversity and informed conservation strategies (Nowacek et al., 2016). The integration of biologging data with environmental models has further enhanced our ability to predict the effects of global environmental changes on marine ecosystems (Hays et al., 2016). Despite the remarkable achievements of biologging and biotelemetry, challenges remain in terms of data management, analysis, and interpretation. The vast amounts of data generated by these technologies require advanced analytical tools and collaborative efforts to extract meaningful insights (Wilmers et al., 2015). Future advancements in sensor technology, data transmission, and machine learning are expected to address these challenges and open new avenues for research (Kays et al., 2015). In conclusion, biologging and biotelemetry have provided unprecedented opportunities to study the lives and environments of marine animals. These technologies have not only advanced our scientific knowledge but also contributed to the conservation and management of marine ecosystems. As we continue to explore the secret lives of marine animals, biologging and biotelemetry will remain indispensable tools in our quest to understand and protect the ocean's inhabitants.", "References": [{"title": "Tracking apex marine predator movements in a dynamic ocean", "authors": "Block, Barbara A., Jonsen, Ian D., Jorgensen, Salvador J., Winship, Arliss J., Shaffer, Scott A., Bograd, Steven J., Hazen, Elliott L., Foley, David G., Breed, Greg A., Harrison, Autumn-Lynn", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "475", "first page": "86", "last page": "90", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10082"}, {"title": "Biotelemetry: a mechanistic approach to ecology", "authors": "Cooke, Steven J., Hinch, Scott G., Wikelski, Martin, Andrews, Russ D., Kuchel, Louise J., Wolcott, Thomas G., Butler, Patrick J.", "journal": "Trends in Ecology & Evolution", "year": "2004", "volumes": "19", "first page": "334", "last page": "343", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tree.2004.04.003"}, {"title": "Aquatic animal telemetry: A panoramic window into the underwater world", "authors": "Hussey, Nigel E., Kessel, Steven T., Aarestrup, Kim, Cooke, Steven J., Cowley, Paul D., Fisk, Aaron T., Harcourt, Robert G., Holland, Kim N., Iverson, Sara J., Kocik, John F.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "348", "first page": "1255642", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1255642"}, {"title": "Behavioural thermoregulation linked to foraging in blue sharks", "authors": "Watanabe, Yuuki Y., Nakamura, Itsumi, Chiang, Wei-Chuan, Uchida, Senzo, Chow, Shyh-Chin, Wang, Pei-Yuan, Hsiao, Shih-Hui, Hsu, Hung-Hung, Mangel, Marc", "journal": "Marine Ecology Progress Series", "year": "2012", "volumes": "465", "first page": "227", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.3354/meps09892"}, {"title": "Social network analysis of animal behaviour: a promising tool for the study of sociality", "authors": "Krause, Jens, James, Richard, Franks, Daniel W., Croft, Darren P.", "journal": "Animal Behaviour", "year": "2013", "volumes": "85", "first page": "351", "last page": "362", "DOI": "10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.11.002"}, {"title": "Marine mammals and ocean noise: Future directions and information needs", "authors": "Nowacek, Douglas P., Thorne, Lesley H., Johnston, David W., Tyack, Peter L.", "journal": "Marine Mammal Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1417", "last page": "1428", "DOI": "10.1111/mms.12343"}, {"title": "Key questions in marine megafauna movement ecology", "authors": "Hays, Graeme C., Ferreira, Luciana C., Sequeira, Ana M.M., Meekan, Mark G., Duarte, Carlos M., Bailey, Helen, Bailleul, Fred, Bowen, W.
