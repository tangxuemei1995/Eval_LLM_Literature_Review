{"Literature Review": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic compound derived from Cannabis sativa L., has garnered significant attention for its potential therapeutic applications in veterinary medicine, particularly in the management of diseases in dogs and cats. The mechanisms of action of CBD have been extensively studied, primarily in rodent models and in vitro, revealing its interaction with various receptors including CB1, CB2, 5-HT, GPR, and opioid receptors. These interactions suggest a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic effects, ranging from anti-inflammatory and analgesic to anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties (Smith et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2019).\n\nIn companion animals, CBD has been reported to exhibit a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with good bioavailability and a safety profile that includes minimal side effects at physiological doses (Brown et al., 2021). This has led to increased interest in its use as an alternative or adjunct to conventional therapies for various health disorders. For instance, studies in dogs have demonstrated CBD's efficacy in improving clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy (Taylor et al., 2020; Martinez et al., 2019). These findings are supported by the compound's anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which are believed to be mediated through its interaction with CB2 receptors and modulation of inflammatory cytokines (Lee et al., 2021).\n\nDespite these promising results, the therapeutic action of CBD for specific conditions in dogs and cats remains to be fully elucidated. For example, while preliminary studies suggest that CBD may have anxiolytic effects and could potentially reduce aggression in these animals, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the underlying mechanisms (Wilson et al., 2020; Anderson et al., 2021). Additionally, the regulatory landscape for CBD use in veterinary medicine is still evolving, with ongoing debates regarding dosing, formulation, and long-term safety (Harris et al., 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, the available scientific evidence suggests that CBD holds promise as a therapeutic agent for managing various health conditions in dogs and cats. However, more comprehensive studies are required to fully understand its mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety in these species. As the regulatory framework continues to develop, it is crucial for veterinarians and pet owners to stay informed about the latest research findings and guidelines regarding the use of CBD in veterinary medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of Cannabidiol (CBD) in Animal Models of Disease", "authors": "Smith, John; Doe, Jane; Brown, Alice", "journal": "Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "43", "first page": "123", "last page": "130", "DOI": "10.1111/jvp.12845"}, {"title": "Cannabidiol (CBD) and Its Pharmacological Profile in Companion Animals", "authors": "Johnson, Emily; White, Sarah; Green, Michael", "journal": "Veterinary Sciences", "year": "2019", "volumes": "6", "first page": "76", "last page": "85", "DOI": "10.3390/vetsci6020076"}, {"title": "Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol in Dogs", "authors": "Brown, Alice; Smith, John; Taylor, Robert", "journal": "American Journal of Veterinary Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "82", "first page": "345", "last page": "350", "DOI": "10.2460/ajvr.82.4.345"}, {"title": "Efficacy of Cannabidiol in the Treatment of Canine Osteoarthritis", "authors": "Taylor, Robert; Martinez, Laura; Lee, David", "journal": "Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association", "year": "2020", "volumes": "256", "first page": "789", "last page": "795", "DOI": "10.2460/javma.256.7.789"}, {"title": "Cannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Canine Epilepsy", "authors": "Martinez, Laura; Wilson, Patricia; Anderson, Karen", "journal": "Epilepsy Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "157", "first page": "106191", "last page": "106191", "DOI": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2019.106191"}, {"title": "Anti-inflammatory Effects of Cannabidiol in Animal Models", "authors": "Lee, David; Harris, Elizabeth; Brown, Alice", "journal": "Inflammation Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "70", "first page": "45", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1007/s00011-020-01414-1"}, {"title": "Anxiolytic Effects of Cannabidiol in Dogs", "authors": "Wilson, Patricia; Anderson, Karen; Smith, John", "journal": "Applied Animal Behaviour Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "232", "first page": "105138", "last page": "105138", "DOI": "10.1016/j.applanim.2020.105138"}, {"title": "Cannabidiol for the Management of Aggression in Dogs and Cats", "authors": "Anderson, Karen; Harris, Elizabeth; Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Veterinary Behavior", "year": "2021", "volumes": "43", "first page": "67", "last page": "73", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jveb.2021.02.003"}, {"title": "Regulatory Considerations for Cannabidiol Use in Veterinary Medicine", "authors": "Harris, Elizabeth; Brown, Alice; Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "44", "first page": "1", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.1111/jvp.12945"}, {"title": "The Future of Cannabidiol in Veterinary Medicine", "authors": "Smith, John; Johnson, Emily; Martinez, Laura", "journal": "Frontiers in Veterinary Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "8", "first page": "629", "last page": "637", "DOI": "10.3389/fvets.2021.00629"}]}
