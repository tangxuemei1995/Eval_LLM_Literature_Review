{"Literature Review": "The exploration of bias and discrimination within social contexts has been a focal point of psychological and sociological research for decades. The concept of implicit bias, which refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner, has been particularly scrutinized. Studies have shown that implicit biases are pervasive and can significantly influence behavior towards different social groups, often leading to discrimination and social disparities (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). In response, a variety of debiasing strategies have been developed, aiming to mitigate these biases and their detrimental effects. However, research indicates that the effectiveness of such interventions, particularly one-time debias trainings, is limited. These interventions often result in short-lived changes in patterns of thinking, with effects lasting less than 24 hours, and have minimal impact on actual behaviors (Lai et al., 2014). This limitation underscores the complexity of bias as a deeply ingrained aspect of human cognition, shaped by a myriad of factors including social structures, cultural norms, and personal experiences. The segregated and stratified social structure, a product of historic and contemporary laws and policies, plays a crucial role in perpetuating biases. Laws and policies have historically been used to institutionalize segregation and inequality, thereby embedding biases into the fabric of society (Massey & Denton, 1993). For instance, residential segregation laws have led to the physical separation of racial groups, limiting intergroup contact and reinforcing stereotypes and prejudices (Charles, 2003). Similarly, policies in education and employment have created disparities in access to resources and opportunities, further entrenching social hierarchies and biases (Pager & Shepherd, 2008). Given this context, it is evident that addressing bias requires more than individual-level interventions; it necessitates structural changes that can alter the social environment in which biases are formed and maintained. This perspective aligns with the contact hypothesis, which posits that under appropriate conditions, interpersonal contact is one of the most effective ways to reduce prejudice between majority and minority group members (Allport, 1954). However, for contact to be effective, it must be supported by laws and policies that promote integration and equality. Recent research has begun to explore how laws and policies can serve as powerful levers for creating long-lasting changes in biases. For example, anti-discrimination laws and affirmative action policies have been shown to reduce explicit biases and improve attitudes towards marginalized groups (Dovidio et al., 2017). Similarly, policies that promote diversity and inclusion in workplaces and educational institutions can facilitate positive intergroup interactions, thereby reducing implicit biases (Richeson & Nussbaum, 2004). Moreover, legal interventions that address systemic inequalities, such as housing policies that promote residential integration, can have a profound impact on reducing biases by altering the social contexts in which people live and interact (Oliver & Shapiro, 2006). In conclusion, while individual-level debiasing interventions have their place, their effectiveness is limited by the broader social and structural context. To achieve meaningful and sustainable reductions in bias and discrimination, it is imperative to leverage laws and policies as tools for social change. By addressing the root causes of bias and creating environments that foster equality and integration, we can cultivate more equal minds and build a more just society.", "References": [{"title": "Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes", "authors": "Greenwald, Anthony G., Banaji, Mahzarin R.", "journal": "Psychological Review", "year": "1995", "volumes": "102", "first page": "4", "last page": "27", "DOI": "10.1037/0033-295X.102.1.4"}, {"title": "Reducing implicit racial preferences: I.
