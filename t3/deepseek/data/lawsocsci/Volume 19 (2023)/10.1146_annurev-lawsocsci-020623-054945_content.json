{"Literature Review": "The Guantánamo Bay detention facility has become a symbol of the United States' 'war on terror,' embodying the complexities and controversies of post-9/11 security policies. Since its establishment in 2002, Guantánamo has been at the center of debates over human rights, the rule of law, and the limits of executive power. This literature review explores the multifaceted legacy of Guantánamo, focusing on its implications for torture, military commissions, habeas corpus, and the broader rule of law. The detention facility's history is marked by the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which have been widely condemned as torture. Studies by McCoy (2006) and Sands (2008) detail the CIA's use of black sites and the development of interrogation methods that violate international law. These practices have not only tarnished the United States' global reputation but have also raised serious questions about the effectiveness and morality of such techniques in combating terrorism. Military commissions at Guantánamo have been another source of controversy, criticized for their lack of transparency and fairness. Denbeaux and Hafetz (2012) argue that these commissions undermine the principles of justice and due process, highlighting the challenges of prosecuting terrorism suspects in a manner consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court's intervention in cases such as Boumediene v. Bush (2008) has been pivotal in affirming the right of detainees to challenge their detention through habeas corpus petitions. However, as Chesney (2009) notes, the practical impact of these rulings has been limited, with many detainees remaining in legal limbo. The legacy of Guantánamo is also a reflection of the broader political and legal struggles over the balance between security and liberty in the post-9/11 era. Greenberg and Dratel (2005) provide a comprehensive overview of the legal memos and policies that authorized the use of torture and indefinite detention, illustrating the erosion of legal norms in the face of perceived security threats. The lack of a national consensus on Guantánamo's role and significance underscores the deep partisan divides that characterize contemporary U.S. politics. As Smith (2011) observes, the facility has become a symbol of the broader challenges facing the United States in reconciling its security needs with its commitment to human rights and the rule of law. In conclusion, Guantánamo's legacy is a complex and enduring one, reflecting the tensions and contradictions of the United States' response to terrorism. The facility's history raises critical questions about the limits of executive power, the role of the judiciary in safeguarding rights, and the challenges of upholding the rule of law in times of crisis. As the United States continues to grapple with these issues, the lessons of Guantánamo remain as relevant as ever.", "References": [{"title": "A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror", "authors": "Alfred W.
