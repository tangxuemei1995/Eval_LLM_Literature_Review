{"Literature Review": "The concept of authoritarian legality in China has been a subject of extensive scholarly debate, particularly in the context of its Leninist single-party state. This literature review explores the multifaceted nature of legality in China, its implications for regime legitimacy, and its role in the transition from a planned to a market economy within the framework of state capitalism. The discussion is structured around three central questions that have guided research in this area. Firstly, the existence and nature of legality in China's political system are examined. Scholars such as Peerenboom (2002) argue that China exhibits a form of 'thin' or 'bare' legality, where legal institutions and practices serve to maintain order and facilitate economic transactions without embodying the full principles of the rule of law as understood in liberal democracies. This perspective is contrasted with views that see Chinese legality as purely instrumental, serving the interests of the party-state without genuine commitment to legal principles (Tanner, 1999). Secondly, the role of authoritarian legality in bolstering regime legitimacy is considered. Empirical studies, including those by Gallagher (2006), suggest that the Chinese state has increasingly relied on legal reforms and the rhetoric of the rule of law to enhance its legitimacy among the populace and the international community. However, the effectiveness of these efforts in achieving genuine legitimacy remains contested. Finally, the transition from plan to market and the role of law in this process are analyzed. Scholars like Hsu (2011) highlight the persistence of illiberal elements in China's property rights and factor markets, challenging the teleological assumptions of the transition paradigm. The dual state model, which posits a coexistence of plan and market elements, is identified as a key factor in reinforcing state power and shaping the trajectory of China's economic development. This review concludes that the institution of the dual state and the perpetuation of plan elements are central to understanding the resilience of the Chinese regime, its economic growth, and the challenges it faces, including economic crisis and inequality.", "References": [{"title": "China's Long March toward Rule of Law", "authors": "Randall Peerenboom", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Politics of Lawmaking in Post-Mao China: Institutions, Processes, and Democratic Prospects", "authors": "Murray Scot Tanner", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1999", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Contagious Capitalism: Globalization and the Politics of Labor in China", "authors": "Mary Elizabeth Gallagher", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Political Economy of China's Great Transformation", "authors": "Philip Hsu", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Law and Society in China: The Dynamics of Authoritarian Legality", "authors": "Carl Minzner", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "China's Legal System: New Developments, New Challenges", "authors": "Donald Clarke", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Role of Law in China's Economic Development", "authors": "Franklin Allen, Jun Qian, Meijun Qian", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2005", "volumes": "43", "first page": "595", "last page": "639", "DOI": "10.1257/002205105774431243"}, {"title": "China's Transition to a Market Economy: How Far Across the River?", "authors": "Barry Naughton", "journal": "Brookings Institution Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Property Rights and Land Policies", "authors": "Gregory K.
