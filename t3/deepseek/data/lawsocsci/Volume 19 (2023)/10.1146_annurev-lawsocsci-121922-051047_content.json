{"Literature Review": "The concept of social reproduction has been a central theme in feminist theory, highlighting the critical yet often invisible labor that sustains human life and societal structures. This labor, predominantly performed by women, includes childbearing, child-rearing, and the maintenance of households, which are essential for the continuation of the workforce and society at large. Feminist scholars have long argued that this reproductive labor is undervalued and unrecognized, leading to systemic inequalities between genders. The literature on social reproduction theory (SRT) provides a framework for understanding the ways in which this labor is organized, exploited, and contested within capitalist societies. SRT posits that the reproduction of labor power is as crucial to the capitalist system as the production of goods and services, yet it remains largely unacknowledged in economic and legal discourses. Feminist legal theorists have drawn on SRT to critique the ways in which law regulates reproductive labor, often reinforcing gender inequalities. They argue for a materialist approach to law that recognizes the economic value of reproductive labor and seeks to redistribute this labor more equitably. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed attention to the importance of reproductive labor, as lockdowns and school closures have increased the burden of unpaid domestic and care work on women. This has sparked a resurgence of interest in SRT and its implications for law and policy. Scholars have called for legal reforms that address the gendered division of labor, provide support for caregivers, and ensure that reproductive labor is adequately compensated and recognized. The intersection of SRT with legal realism and materialist feminism offers a powerful lens for analyzing the regulation of reproductive labor and advocating for social and economic justice. By recuperating the rich tradition of theorizing on social reproduction, feminist legal scholars can contribute to the development of laws and policies that challenge the devaluation of women's labor and promote a more equitable distribution of reproductive responsibilities.", "References": [{"title": "The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union", "authors": "Heidi Hartmann", "journal": "Capital & Class", "year": "1979", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1177/030981687900800102"}, {"title": "Social Reproduction Theory: Remapping Class, Recentering Oppression", "authors": "Tithi Bhattacharya", "journal": "Historical Materialism", "year": "2017", "volumes": "25", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1163/1569206X-12341511"}, {"title": "Theorizing Women's Work", "authors": "Nancy Folbre", "journal": "Gender & Society", "year": "1991", "volumes": "5", "first page": "311", "last page": "333", "DOI": "10.1177/089124391005003002"}, {"title": "The Second Shift: Working Families and the Revolution at Home", "authors": "Arlie Hochschild, Anne Machung", "journal": "Penguin Books", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Feminism and the Power of Law", "authors": "Carol Smart", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "1989", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Wages of Care: Bargaining Power, Earnings, and Inequality", "authors": "Nancy Folbre, Julie A.
