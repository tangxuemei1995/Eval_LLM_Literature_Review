{"Literature Review": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into government operations presents a transformative shift in public administration, offering both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. This literature review explores the regulatory landscape of government AI, focusing on the sociotechnical design challenges that emerge at the intersection of computer science, organizational behavior, and law. The discourse on AI in government often oscillates between its potential to enhance efficiency and the risks it poses in terms of error, bias, and inequity. However, a critical examination reveals that the most pressing concern is AI's encroachment into discretion-laden policy areas, where traditional legal accountability mechanisms are already strained. This review argues for a nuanced approach to regulation that balances the need for accountability with the imperative to foster innovation. It emphasizes the importance of understanding internal agency practices in AI system design and implementation, alongside the limitations of external legal constraints in shaping organizational behavior. The challenge lies in fortifying public law paradigms to accommodate AI's unique characteristics without stifling its potential benefits. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that draws on emerging research in computer science, insights from organizational behavior, and lessons from legal studies to develop a regulatory framework that is both effective and adaptable. The literature underscores the need for a robust understanding of how AI permeates bureaucratic routines and the implications for institutional design. It calls for regulatory strategies that are informed by a deep understanding of the sociotechnical systems in which AI operates, ensuring that government AI serves the public interest while safeguarding against its potential harms.", "References": [{"title": "Algorithmic Decision-Making and the Cost of Fairness", "authors": "Sam Corbett-Davies, Emma Pierson, Avi Feller, Sharad Goel, Aziz Huq", "journal": "Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "797", "last page": "806", "DOI": "10.1145/3097983.3098095"}, {"title": "The Ethics of Algorithms: Mapping the Debate", "authors": "Brent Mittelstadt, Patrick Allo, Mariarosaria Taddeo, Sandra Wachter, Luciano Floridi", "journal": "Big Data & Society", "year": "2016", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1", "last page": "21", "DOI": "10.1177/2053951716679679"}, {"title": "Governing Algorithms: Myth, Mess, and Methods", "authors": "Malte Ziewitz", "journal": "Science, Technology, & Human Values", "year": "2016", "volumes": "41", "first page": "3", "last page": "16", "DOI": "10.1177/0162243915608948"}, {"title": "Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation", "authors": "Finale Doshi-Velez, Mason Kortz", "journal": "Berkeley Technology Law Journal", "year": "2017", "volumes": "33", "first page": "1", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.15779/Z38H41JM6P"}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence and the 'Good Society': The US, EU, and UK Approach", "authors": "Mark Coeckelbergh", "journal": "Science and Engineering Ethics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1007/s11948-019-00119-x"}, {"title": "The Role of the State in Governing Artificial Intelligence", "authors": "Joshua A.
