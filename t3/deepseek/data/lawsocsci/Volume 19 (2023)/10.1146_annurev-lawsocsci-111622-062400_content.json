{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race, immigration, and labor has been a critical area of study, particularly in understanding the precarity faced by low-wage immigrant workers. This literature review centers race in the analysis of low-wage immigrant labor, drawing on the framework of racial capitalism to explore the historical and contemporary factors that contribute to worker precarity and the struggle for justice. The legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession have laid the foundation for an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally, which continues to shape the experiences of immigrant workers today (Robinson, 1983). Racism and colonial legacies not only create conditions for migrant displacement but also permeate the immigration bureaucracy, exacerbating the precarity of migrant workers (Ngai, 2004). The traditional labor movement has historically played a role in addressing these issues, but the emergence of worker centers and the broader immigrant rights movement has introduced new dynamics and strategies for achieving worker justice (Fine, 2006). These movements have had to navigate coalitional tensions, reflecting the complex interplay of race, class, and immigration status in the fight for immigrant worker rights (Milkman, 2006). The literature highlights the importance of centering race in studies of low-wage immigrant labor, not only to understand the structural barriers faced by these workers but also to inform more inclusive and effective strategies for achieving justice (Bonacich & Wilson, 2008). This review draws on a range of studies to explore these themes, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of the role of race in shaping the experiences and struggles of low-wage immigrant workers. The following sections delve into the historical context of racial capitalism, the impact of racism and colonial legacies on migrant displacement and worker precarity, the role of the labor movement and worker centers in advocating for immigrant worker rights, and the challenges and opportunities in building coalitions for justice. Through this analysis, the review aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the central role of race in the study of low-wage immigrant labor and the ongoing struggle for worker justice.", "References": [{"title": "Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition", "authors": "Cedric J.
