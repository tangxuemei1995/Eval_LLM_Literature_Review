{"Literature Review": "The concept of legitimacy has long been central to the understanding of legal authority and governance. Legitimacy-based models of governance, which emphasize the importance of public trust and confidence in legal and political institutions, have shaped the way authority is exercised and perceived. However, recent decades have witnessed a decline in the legitimacy of these institutions, prompting scholars to question the future viability of legitimacy-based governance. This literature review explores the ascension and potential decline of legitimacy-based governance, examines alternative forms of authority, and considers the contingencies under which different forms of authority may be most desirable. The legitimacy of legal and political institutions is fundamentally linked to the public's trust and confidence in these entities. Tyler (2006) argues that legitimacy is crucial for encouraging voluntary compliance with the law, as it fosters a sense of obligation among citizens to adhere to legal norms. Similarly, Sunshine and Tyler (2003) found that perceptions of legitimacy significantly influence public cooperation with law enforcement, highlighting the importance of normative alignment between institutions and the communities they serve. However, the decline in legitimacy observed in recent years raises concerns about the sustainability of this model. Rothstein (2011) attributes this decline to a combination of factors, including corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of transparency in governance. These issues erode public trust and confidence, undermining the foundation of legitimacy-based governance. In response to these challenges, scholars have proposed alternative models of authority that may better address the complexities of twenty-first-century governance. One such alternative is the reliance on social norms and moral values as sources of authority. Ellickson (1991) demonstrates how social norms can effectively regulate behavior in the absence of formal legal rules, suggesting that normative alignment may be achieved through informal mechanisms. Similarly, Haidt (2012) argues that moral values play a crucial role in shaping public attitudes toward authority, emphasizing the potential for moral psychology to inform governance strategies. Another alternative is the use of ideologies as a basis for authority. Fukuyama (2014) contends that ideological alignment can foster a sense of collective identity and purpose, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of political institutions. However, the effectiveness of ideological authority may be limited by the diversity of values and beliefs within a society, as noted by Kymlicka (1995). Given the limitations of both legitimacy-based and alternative models of authority, some scholars advocate for a more contingent approach to governance. Such an approach recognizes that no single form of authority is universally applicable and instead focuses on identifying the conditions under which different forms of authority are most effective. Levi and Sacks (2009) argue that the desirability of a particular form of authority depends on the specific context, including the nature of the issue at hand and the characteristics of the population. Similarly, Ostrom (2010) emphasizes the importance of polycentric governance, which involves multiple, overlapping centers of authority that can adapt to different circumstances. In conclusion, the decline in the legitimacy of legal and political institutions poses significant challenges for legitimacy-based governance. While alternative models of authority, such as those based on social norms, moral values, or ideologies, offer potential solutions, they also have their limitations. A contingent approach to governance, which considers the specific context and adapts accordingly, may provide a more flexible and effective framework for addressing the complexities of twenty-first-century authority. Future research should continue to explore the conditions under which different forms of authority are most desirable, with the aim of developing more nuanced and context-sensitive theories of governance.", "References": [{"title": "Why People Obey the Law", "authors": "Tom R.
