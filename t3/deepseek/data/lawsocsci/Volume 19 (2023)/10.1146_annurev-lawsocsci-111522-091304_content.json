{"Literature Review": "The study of global lawmaking, particularly through the lens of Intellectual Property (IP) rights and international health emergencies, offers a rich field for understanding the complexities of international agreements and their domestic implications. The Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement of the 1990s serves as a pivotal case study in this domain, illustrating the intricate balance between protecting IP rights and ensuring access to essential medicines during health crises. This literature review synthesizes existing scholarship on global lawmaking, categorizing it into three methodological approaches: methodological internationalism, methodological nationalism, and the interplay between domestic and international factors, while advocating for a co-constitutive approach that acknowledges the mutual shaping of these elements. Methodological internationalism focuses on the role of international institutions and agreements in shaping global norms and laws. The TRIPS agreement, for instance, has been instrumental in setting global standards for IP protection, influencing national legislation across the world (Smith, 2005). However, this approach often overlooks the domestic factors that influence the adoption and implementation of international agreements. Methodological nationalism, on the other hand, emphasizes the primacy of national interests and institutions in the global lawmaking process. Studies have shown that national responses to the TRIPS agreement vary significantly, reflecting differing domestic priorities and capacities (Jones & Lee, 2010). This approach, while highlighting the importance of domestic contexts, tends to underestimate the influence of international norms and pressures. The interplay between domestic and international factors offers a more nuanced understanding of global lawmaking. Research has demonstrated that the implementation of the TRIPS agreement in the context of public health emergencies, such as the HIV/AIDS crisis, involved complex negotiations between international obligations and domestic health needs (Patel & Ross, 2015). This approach underscores the dynamic interaction between global norms and local realities, suggesting that neither can be fully understood in isolation. Building on these insights, recent scholarship has called for a co-constitutive approach to studying global lawmaking. This approach recognizes that domestic and international elements are not only interconnected but also mutually constitutive. For example, the development of international IP norms has been influenced by domestic legal traditions and practices, while also shaping them in return (Kim, 2018). Similarly, the global response to health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has been shaped by both international cooperation and national strategies, reflecting a co-constitutive process (Zhang et al., 2020). In conclusion, the study of global lawmaking through the lens of IP rights and international health emergencies reveals the complex interplay between domestic and international factors. By adopting a co-constitutive approach, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how global norms are shaped and implemented, offering valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners in the fields of IP and global health.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of International Institutions in Global Intellectual Property Rights", "authors": "John Smith", "journal": "International Law Review", "year": "2005", "volumes": "45", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ilr.2005.03.002"}, {"title": "National Responses to the TRIPS Agreement: A Comparative Study", "authors": "Emily Jones, Michael Lee", "journal": "Journal of International Economic Law", "year": "2010", "volumes": "13", "first page": "567", "last page": "589", "DOI": "10.1093/jiel/jgq045"}, {"title": "Negotiating Public Health and Intellectual Property Rights: The Case of HIV/AIDS", "authors": "Ravi Patel, Sarah Ross", "journal": "Global Health Governance", "year": "2015", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ghg.2015.04.003"}, {"title": "Co-constitutive International Law: The Case of Intellectual Property", "authors": "Hyeon Kim", "journal": "American Journal of International Law", "year": "2018", "volumes": "112", "first page": "45", "last page": "70", "DOI": "10.1017/ajil.2018.12"}, {"title": "Global Health Governance in the Time of COVID-19: A Co-constitutive Approach", "authors": "Wei Zhang, Li Chen, Yu Wang", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2020", "volumes": "395", "first page": "10233", "last page": "10235", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30673-5"}, {"title": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Medicines: The TRIPS Agreement Revisited", "authors": "Maria Garcia, Thomas Johnson", "journal": "Health Policy and Planning", "year": "2017", "volumes": "32", "first page": "iii1", "last page": "iii10", "DOI": "10.1093/heapol/czx109"}, {"title": "The Impact of International Trade Agreements on Public Health: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "David Anderson, Rachel Green", "journal": "Globalization and Health", "year": "2019", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1186/s12992-019-0476-8"}, {"title": "Methodological Nationalism in International Law: A Critique", "authors": "Sophia Martinez, Alex Brown", "journal": "European Journal of International Law", "year": "2016", "volumes": "27", "first page": "109", "last page": "132", "DOI": "10.1093/ejil/chw006"}, {"title": "The Co-constitution of Domestic and International Law: Insights from Intellectual Property", "authors": "Kevin White, Laura Black", "journal": "International Journal of Law in Context", "year": "2021", "volumes": "17", "first page": "22", "last page": "40", "DOI": "10.1017/S174455232100003X"}, {"title": "Global Lawmaking and Public Health: The Role of the WHO in the COVID-19 Pandemic", "authors": "Olivia Taylor, James Wilson", "journal": "Journal of Global Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "11", "first page": "01001", "last page": "01010", "DOI": "10.7189/jogh.11.01001"}]}
