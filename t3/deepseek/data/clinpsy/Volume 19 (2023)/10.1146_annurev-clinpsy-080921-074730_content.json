{"Literature Review": "Racism, recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a significant public health threat, has profound implications for mental health, particularly in the context of psychosis. Structural racism, a pervasive system that perpetuates inequity across various institutions and social environments, significantly influences the risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. This literature review explores the impact of ethnoracial inequities on psychosis risk, focusing on the experiences of Black and Latinx populations in the United States, who are disproportionately affected by social determinants such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. The chronic stress and biological consequences stemming from race-based stress and trauma not only affect individuals directly but also have intergenerational impacts, particularly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. While multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions offer hope for improving prognosis, there is a pressing need for more accessible coordinated care and treatments that specifically address the racism-specific adversities faced by Black and Latinx individuals in their neighborhoods and social environments. Research has consistently shown that racial discrimination is a significant stressor that can lead to increased risk of psychotic experiences. For instance, a study by Veling et al. (2007) found that individuals from ethnic minority groups living in areas with low ethnic density were at higher risk for psychosis, suggesting that social isolation and discrimination play critical roles in the development of psychotic disorders. Similarly, Anglin et al. (2014) highlighted the association between perceived racial discrimination and increased risk of psychotic experiences among African American and Caribbean Black populations. Food insecurity, another critical social determinant, has also been linked to mental health issues, including psychosis. A study by Seligman et al. (2010) demonstrated that food insecurity is associated with a higher prevalence of mental health disorders, including psychosis, underscoring the importance of addressing basic needs in mental health interventions. Police violence, a manifestation of structural racism, has been shown to have detrimental effects on community mental health. Bor et al. (2018) found that police killings of unarmed Black Americans were associated with poor mental health outcomes among Black American adults in the general population, including symptoms of psychosis. The intergenerational impact of racism on psychosis risk is another critical area of concern. A study by Bécares et al. (2015) revealed that maternal experiences of racial discrimination during pregnancy were associated with adverse mental health outcomes in children, including increased risk for psychotic experiences. This highlights the need for interventions that address the root causes of racial inequities to prevent the transmission of trauma and stress across generations. Despite the challenges, there is evidence that early psychosis interventions can be effective. A study by Kane et al. (2016) demonstrated that coordinated specialty care for first-episode psychosis significantly improved outcomes, including symptom reduction and functional recovery. However, these interventions must be made more accessible and tailored to address the specific needs of Black and Latinx populations, who face unique adversities due to racism. In conclusion, racism and its associated social determinants play a critical role in the risk for psychosis among Black and Latinx populations. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach that includes dismantling structural racism, improving access to mental health care, and developing interventions that specifically target the racism-specific adversities faced by these communities. Only through concerted efforts can we hope to reduce the burden of psychosis and improve mental health outcomes for all individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity.", "References": [{"title": "Ethnic density and risk of psychotic disorders among ethnic minorities in the Netherlands", "authors": "Wim Veling, Ezra Susser, Jim van Os, Jean-Paul Selten, Hans W.
