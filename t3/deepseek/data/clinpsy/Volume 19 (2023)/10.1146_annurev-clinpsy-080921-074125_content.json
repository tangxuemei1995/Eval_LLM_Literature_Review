{"Literature Review": "Eating disorders (EDs) have traditionally been viewed as a predominantly female issue, leading to a significant underrepresentation of boys and men in both research and clinical settings. However, the twenty-first century has seen a growing recognition of the prevalence and unique manifestations of EDs in males, prompting an increase in research aimed at understanding these conditions in this population. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the epidemiology, risk factors, assessment, prevention, and treatment of EDs and muscle dysmorphia in boys and men, highlighting gaps and future directions for research. Epidemiological studies have begun to shed light on the prevalence of EDs among males, with findings indicating that while the overall prevalence is lower than in females, a significant number of boys and men are affected. For instance, a study by Murray et al. (2017) found that approximately 25% of individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are male, and the prevalence of binge eating disorder is nearly equal across genders. Muscle dysmorphia, a condition characterized by a pathological pursuit of muscularity, has been identified as a particularly male-specific manifestation of body image disturbance, with research suggesting it may be more common in males than traditional EDs (Pope et al., 2000). Certain groups of men are at increased risk for EDs, including athletes, particularly those in sports emphasizing weight classes or aesthetics, and sexual minority men, who face unique sociocultural pressures regarding body image (Anderson & Bulik, 2004). Sociocultural factors, such as the media's portrayal of the ideal male body as lean and muscular, have been implicated in the development of EDs and muscle dysmorphia in males. Psychological factors, including perfectionism and body dissatisfaction, and biological factors, such as genetic predispositions and hormonal influences, also contribute to vulnerability (Strother et al., 2012). The assessment of EDs in males has been challenged by the lack of male-specific diagnostic criteria and assessment tools. However, recent developments, such as the Male Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), aim to address this gap by including items relevant to male body image concerns, such as muscularity (Darcy et al., 2013). Prevention and treatment efforts for EDs in males are still in their infancy, with most programs adapted from those developed for females. However, there is a growing consensus on the need for male-specific approaches that address the unique risk factors and manifestations of EDs in males. Research on treatment outcomes suggests that males can benefit from existing ED treatments, but there is a need for more studies focusing specifically on male populations to refine these interventions (Raevuori et al., 2014). Mortality risk in males with EDs is an area of concern, with some studies suggesting that males may have a higher mortality rate than females, possibly due to later diagnosis and treatment initiation (Crow et al., 2009). Future research priorities include the inclusion of males in epidemiological studies to track changes in incidence, the identification of neurobiological factors contributing to risk, the elimination of barriers to treatment access and utilization, and the refinement of male-specific prevention and treatment efforts. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding EDs in boys and men, there is a pressing need for continued research to address the gaps in knowledge and to develop effective, male-specific interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Prevalence of eating disorders in males: a review of rates reported in academic research and UK mass media", "authors": "Murray, Stuart B., Nagata, Jason M., Griffiths, Scott, Calzo, Jerel P., Brown, Tiffany A., Mitchison, Deborah, Blashill, Aaron J., Mond, Jonathan M.", "journal": "International Journal of Men's Health", "year": "2017", "volumes": "16", "first page": "89", "last page": "103", "DOI": "10.3149/jmh.1602.89"}, {"title": "Muscle dysmorphia: an underrecognized form of body dysmorphic disorder", "authors": "Pope, Harrison G., Gruber, Amanda J., Choi, Philip, Olivardia, Roberto, Phillips, Katharine A.", "journal": "Psychosomatics", "year": "2000", "volumes": "41", "first page": "381", "last page": "386", "DOI": "10.1176/appi.psy.41.5.381"}, {"title": "Gender differences in compensatory behaviors, weight and shape salience, and drive for thinness", "authors": "Anderson, Drew A., Bulik, Cynthia M.", "journal": "Eating Behaviors", "year": "2004", "volumes": "5", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1016/S1471-0153(03)00055-9"}, {"title": "Eating disorders in men: underdiagnosed, undertreated, and misunderstood", "authors": "Strother, Eric, Lemberg, Raymond, Stanford, Stevie C., Turberville, Dayton", "journal": "Eating Disorders", "year": "2012", "volumes": "20", "first page": "346", "last page": "355", "DOI": "10.1080/10640266.2012.715512"}, {"title": "The Male Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q): Psychometric properties and norms for a sample of male university students", "authors": "Darcy, Alison M., Hardy, Kristina K., Crosby, Ross D., Lock, James, Peebles, Rebecka", "journal": "International Journal of Eating Disorders", "year": "2013", "volumes": "46", "first page": "758", "last page": "764", "DOI": "10.1002/eat.22169"}, {"title": "The outcome of anorexia nervosa in the 20th century", "authors": "Raevuori, Anu, Suokas, Jaana, Haukka, Jari, Gissler, Mika, Linna, Milla, Grainger, Megan, Suvisaari, Jaana", "journal": "American Journal of Psychiatry", "year": "2014", "volumes": "171", "first page": "1244", "last page": "1253", "DOI": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13111525"}, {"title": "Increased mortality in bulimia nervosa and other eating disorders", "authors": "Crow, Scott J., Peterson, Carol B., Swanson, Sonja A., Raymond, Nancy C., Specker, Sheila, Eckert, Elke D., Mitchell, James E.", "journal": "American Journal of Psychiatry", "year": "2009", "volumes": "166", "first page": "1342", "last page": "1346", "DOI": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09020247"}]}
