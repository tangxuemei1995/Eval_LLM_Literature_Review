{"Literature Review": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is an interdisciplinary field that explores the complex interactions between the psychological, neurological, and immunological systems. This literature review aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of immune-to-brain communication and its implications for clinical psychology, focusing on inflammation, psychosocial stress, and their impact on psychological health and disorders. The immune system communicates with the brain through various pathways, including the release of cytokines, which are signaling molecules that can influence brain function and behavior. This communication is crucial for the development of sickness behavior, a set of adaptive behavioral changes that occur in response to infection or inflammation (Dantzer et al., 2008). Inflammation, a key component of the immune response, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia (Miller & Raison, 2016). Research has shown that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to alterations in mood, cognition, and social behavior, highlighting the role of the immune system in psychological health (Haroon et al., 2012). Psychosocial stress is a significant modulator of neuroimmune activity, with chronic stress leading to dysregulation of the immune system and increased susceptibility to inflammation-related disorders (Slavich & Irwin, 2014). Early life adversity, such as childhood trauma, has been associated with long-term alterations in immune function and increased risk for psychological disorders in adulthood (Danese & Lewis, 2017). The impact of psychosocial stress on the immune system underscores the importance of considering environmental and psychological factors in the study of psychoneuroimmunology. Interventions that target the immune system, such as psychosocial and mindâ€“body therapies, have shown promise in promoting neuroimmune resilience and improving psychological outcomes (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2010). These interventions include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and physical activity, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms of depression and anxiety (Pascoe et al., 2017). The field of psychoneuroimmunology offers valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying psychological disorders and provides a framework for developing novel interventions that target the immune system. By integrating knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, and immunology, researchers and clinicians can better understand the complex interplay between the mind and body and develop more effective treatments for psychological disorders.", "References": [{"title": "From inflammation to sickness and depression: when the immune system subjugates the brain", "authors": "Robert Dantzer, Jason C.
