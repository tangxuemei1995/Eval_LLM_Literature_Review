{"Literature Review": "Parental incarceration represents a profound form of adversity that disproportionately affects children in the United States, with significant implications for their emotional and behavioral health. Research has consistently documented the adverse effects of parental incarceration on children, including increased risks for mental health issues, academic difficulties, and behavioral problems (Murray & Farrington, 2008). However, an emerging body of literature highlights the resilience exhibited by some children in the face of such adversity, suggesting that not all children with incarcerated parents experience negative outcomes (Arditti, 2012). This literature review explores the dual themes of risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, with a focus on the factors that contribute to these outcomes and the implications for intervention and social justice. The adverse effects of parental incarceration on children are well-documented. Studies have shown that children with incarcerated parents are at a higher risk for developing mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, compared to their peers (Wakefield & Wildeman, 2013). Additionally, these children often face academic challenges, including lower school performance and higher rates of school dropout (Turney & Haskins, 2014). Behavioral problems, such as aggression and delinquency, are also more prevalent among this population (Geller et al., 2009). These risks are compounded by the social stigma and economic hardship that often accompany parental incarceration, further exacerbating the challenges faced by these children (Comfort, 2007). Despite these risks, research has identified factors that contribute to resilience among children with incarcerated parents. Protective factors at the individual, family, and community levels can mitigate the adverse effects of parental incarceration and promote positive youth development. For example, strong relationships with non-incarcerated caregivers and positive peer relationships have been shown to buffer against the negative impacts of parental incarceration (Arditti, 2012). Additionally, access to supportive educational environments and community resources can enhance resilience and foster positive outcomes (Shlafer et al., 2013). Interventions aimed at supporting children with incarcerated parents have also demonstrated promise in promoting resilience. Programs that provide emotional support, educational assistance, and opportunities for positive social interaction can help mitigate the risks associated with parental incarceration (Poehlmann-Tynan et al., 2015). Moreover, interventions that address the broader social and institutional factors contributing to parental incarceration, such as poverty and systemic racism, are critical for promoting social justice and reducing the inequitable distribution of this form of adversity (Alexander, 2010). A critical reframing of resilience research is necessary to address the intersecting inequalities that shape the experiences of children with incarcerated parents. Scholars must adopt more contextualized approaches that consider the complex interplay of race, class, gender, and other social identities in shaping resilience (Crenshaw, 1991). Furthermore, resilience research and practice should be conceptualized as complements to, rather than substitutes for, broader social and institutional change. Efforts to promote resilience among children with incarcerated parents must be accompanied by advocacy for policies that address the root causes of parental incarceration and promote equity and justice (Davis, 2003). In conclusion, while parental incarceration poses significant risks to children's emotional and behavioral health, resilience is possible in the face of such adversity. Protective factors at multiple levels can mitigate these risks and promote positive youth development. However, a critical reframing of resilience research is necessary to address the intersecting inequalities that shape the experiences of children with incarcerated parents. Social justiceâ€“informed recommendations for future research and practice include adopting contextualized approaches to resilience, implementing supportive interventions, and advocating for broader social and institutional change.", "References": [{"title": "The effects of parental imprisonment on children", "authors": "Joseph Murray, David P.
