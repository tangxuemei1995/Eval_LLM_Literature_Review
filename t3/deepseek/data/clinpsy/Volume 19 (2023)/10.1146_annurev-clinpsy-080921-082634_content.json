{"Literature Review": "The Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial Act, enacted in 2004, represents a significant federal effort to address the critical issue of youth suicide in the United States. This legislation has funded comprehensive, community-based suicide prevention initiatives aimed at reducing suicide rates among young people. The GLS Memorial Act has been the subject of various evaluations and studies, which have sought to assess its effectiveness and impact on youth suicide prevention. This literature review synthesizes findings from these studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the GLS initiative's outcomes, challenges, and implications for future suicide prevention efforts. Research indicates that communities implementing GLS-funded suicide prevention activities have experienced lower rates of suicide attempts and mortality among youth compared to matched communities without such initiatives. For instance, a study by Godoy Garraza et al. (2015) found that GLS-funded communities saw a significant reduction in suicide rates among individuals aged 10 to 24, highlighting the program's potential to save lives. Moreover, the positive outcomes of GLS initiatives appear to be more pronounced in communities with continuous years of implementation and in less densely populated areas, suggesting that sustained efforts and tailored approaches are crucial for maximizing the program's impact. Cost-effectiveness analyses further underscore the value of GLS-funded programs. Walrath et al. (2015) demonstrated that the implementation of GLS suicide prevention activities not only reduces the incidence of suicide attempts but also results in substantial savings in healthcare costs by decreasing emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Despite these encouraging findings, the heterogeneity of community suicide prevention programs funded by the GLS Memorial Act poses challenges for evaluating its overall effectiveness. The lack of randomized controlled trials, as noted by Aseltine et al. (2010), complicates the ability to establish causal relationships between GLS initiatives and reductions in youth suicide rates. Additionally, the GLS initiative has not been fully scaled to impact all communities across the United States simultaneously, limiting its potential to effect nationwide reductions in suicide rates. This gap underscores the need for broader implementation and further research to explore the scalability and generalizability of GLS-funded programs. In conclusion, the GLS Memorial Act has made significant strides in youth suicide prevention, with evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing suicide attempts and mortality among young people. However, challenges related to program heterogeneity, evaluation methodologies, and scalability highlight areas for future research and policy development. Expanding the reach of GLS-funded initiatives and conducting rigorous, randomized evaluations will be essential for enhancing our understanding of their impact and for informing the development of more effective, nationwide suicide prevention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Suicide Prevention Program", "authors": "Lucas Godoy Garraza, Richard McKeon, Richard W.
