{"Literature Review": "Acculturation, the process of cultural and psychological change that results following meeting between cultures, has been extensively studied in relation to psychopathology. This literature review explores the intricate relationship between acculturation and psychopathology, emphasizing the developmental psychopathology approach to understand the mechanisms through which acculturation influences psychological adaptation or maladaptation. The review is structured around the Integrated Process Framework of Acculturation Variables (IP-FAV), which integrates both proximal and remote acculturation variables to provide a comprehensive understanding of the acculturation process. The developmental psychopathology approach offers a unique lens to examine why, how, and what aspects of psychological acculturation lead to later adaptation or maladaptation among acculturating individuals. This approach considers the dynamic and interactional nature of acculturation, highlighting the importance of context, timescales, and levels of analysis in understanding the acculturation-psychopathology link. Research has shown that acculturation can lead to both positive and negative psychological outcomes. Positive outcomes, such as increased resilience and psychological well-being, are often associated with successful integration into the host culture while maintaining connections to the original culture. Conversely, negative outcomes, including increased risk for psychopathology, are linked to acculturation stress, discrimination, and marginalization. The IP-FAV model posits that predisposing acculturation conditions (why), such as the reasons for migration and the characteristics of the host and original cultures, set the stage for the acculturation process. Acculturation orientations and processes (how), including the strategies individuals use to navigate between cultures, play a crucial role in determining the outcomes of acculturation. These processes are influenced by both proximal factors, such as social support and language proficiency, and remote factors, such as globalization and transnational ties. The model also highlights the importance of considering the developmental stage of the individual, as the impact of acculturation can vary significantly across the lifespan. For example, acculturating youth may face unique challenges related to identity formation and peer relationships, while acculturating adults may struggle with employment and family responsibilities. The IP-FAV model underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the acculturation process, taking into account the complex interplay of individual, social, and cultural factors. This comprehensive framework has important implications for research, practice, and policy, offering a roadmap for developing interventions that promote positive acculturation outcomes and mitigate the risk of psychopathology among acculturating populations.", "References": [{"title": "Acculturation: Living successfully in two cultures", "authors": "John W.
