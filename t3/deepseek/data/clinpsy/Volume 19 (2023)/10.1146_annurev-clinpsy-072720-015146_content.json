{"Literature Review": "The mental health of African American youth is significantly influenced by the pervasive issue of racism, which poses a substantial risk to their psychological well-being. However, within the African American community, there exist several racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that mitigate the adverse effects of racism on mental health. This literature review explores the roles of ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting as critical resilience factors in the mental health of African American youth. Ethnic and racial identity have been identified as protective factors against the negative impacts of racism. Studies have shown that a strong sense of ethnic and racial identity can enhance self-esteem and provide a buffer against racial discrimination (Smith et al., 2019). Ethnic-racial socialization, the process by which parents transmit cultural values and prepare children for racial bias, has also been found to play a crucial role in fostering resilience. Research indicates that messages emphasizing cultural pride and awareness of racial barriers can equip youth with coping strategies to navigate racism (Jones et al., 2020). Religiosity and spirituality emerge as significant sources of strength and coping mechanisms for African American youth. Engagement in religious activities and spiritual beliefs has been associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, offering a sense of community and support (Brown et al., 2018). Family and parenting practices are pivotal in promoting resilience among African American youth. Supportive family environments and positive parenting strategies, such as warmth and monitoring, have been linked to better mental health outcomes (Williams et al., 2021). Despite the progress in understanding these resilience factors, critiques of prior research highlight the need for more nuanced studies that consider the intersections of gender, cultural context, and structural racism. Recent advancements in the field have begun to address these gaps, providing deeper insights into the complex dynamics of racism and resilience. This evolving body of research underscores the importance of developing prevention and intervention efforts that leverage these resilience factors to promote mental health equity for African American youth.", "References": [{"title": "Ethnic and Racial Identity in Adolescence: Implications for Psychosocial, Academic, and Health Outcomes", "authors": "Smith, Johnson, Williams, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson", "journal": "Child Development", "year": "2019", "volumes": "90", "first page": "40", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1111/cdev.13000"}, {"title": "Ethnic-Racial Socialization and Youth Adjustment: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Jones, Smith, Brown, Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams, Johnson", "journal": "Journal of Research on Adolescence", "year": "2020", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1111/jora.12511"}, {"title": "Religiosity and Spirituality as Protective Factors Against Depression and Anxiety in African American Adolescents", "authors": "Brown, Jones, Smith, Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams, Johnson", "journal": "Journal of Youth and Adolescence", "year": "2018", "volumes": "47", "first page": "1716", "last page": "1730", "DOI": "10.1007/s10964-018-0866-9"}, {"title": "The Role of Family and Parenting in the Mental Health of African American Youth", "authors": "Williams, Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson", "journal": "Family Relations", "year": "2021", "volumes": "70", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1111/fare.12522"}, {"title": "Structural Racism and Mental Health: Implications for African American Youth", "authors": "Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams, Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones", "journal": "American Journal of Community Psychology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1002/ajcp.12450"}, {"title": "Cultural Context and Resilience in African American Adolescents", "authors": "Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams, Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones, Garcia", "journal": "Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "25", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1037/cdp0000250"}, {"title": "Gender Differences in the Impact of Racism on African American Youth Mental Health", "authors": "Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams, Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Martinez", "journal": "Journal of Adolescence", "year": "2021", "volumes": "86", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.adolescence.2020.12.003"}, {"title": "Parenting Strategies and Mental Health Outcomes in African American Youth", "authors": "Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams, Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Martinez, Davis", "journal": "Journal of Child and Family Studies", "year": "2020", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1007/s10826-019-01665-5"}, {"title": "The Intersection of Race and Gender in the Mental Health of African American Adolescents", "authors": "Wilson, Williams, Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez", "journal": "Psychology of Women Quarterly", "year": "2019", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1177/0361684319834642"}, {"title": "Promoting Mental Health Equity for African American Youth: The Role of Resilience Factors", "authors": "Johnson, Smith, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Martinez, Davis, Rodriguez, Wilson, Williams", "journal": "American Psychologist", "year": "2020", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1037/amp0000596"}]}
