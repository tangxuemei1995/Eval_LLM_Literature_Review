{"Literature Review": "The mental health of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) communities has been a subject of increasing scholarly attention, particularly in the context of community mental health services. This literature review aims to update and extend the discourse initiated by Gone & Trimble (2012), focusing on the reconciliation of evidence-based practice with what is termed 'alter-Native psy-ence' within AI/AN populations. The unique political citizenship of AI/AN individuals, as members of semisovereign Tribal Nations, plays a crucial role in categorizing and understanding this population's mental health needs (Gone & Trimble, 2012). This review synthesizes recent findings on AI/AN mental health, emphasizing community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide, and examines the evolution of community mental health services for these populations since 2010, including the outcomes of six randomized controlled trials of mental health treatments. Furthermore, it explores the concept of 'alter-Native psy-ence,' which reinterprets prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and advocates for Indigenized therapeutic interventions. The review concludes with a discussion on the autonomy of AI/AN Tribal Nations in determining the adoption, adaptation, integration, or refusal of specific mental health treatments and services for the benefit of their communities. Recent studies have highlighted the disproportionate rates of mental health issues among AI/AN populations, including higher prevalence of substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide compared to the general U.S. population (Brave Heart et al., 2016; Legha & Novins, 2012). These disparities are often attributed to historical trauma, systemic discrimination, and socio-economic disadvantages. In response, there has been a growing emphasis on developing culturally sensitive mental health services that incorporate traditional healing practices and community-based approaches (Gone, 2013; Wexler, 2014). The integration of evidence-based practices with Indigenized therapies has shown promise in addressing the unique needs of AI/AN communities. For instance, the use of storytelling, ceremonial practices, and community healing circles has been effective in treating trauma and substance abuse (Goodkind et al., 2015; Mohatt et al., 2014). However, challenges remain in ensuring the accessibility and acceptability of these services, particularly in remote and underserved areas. The concept of 'alter-Native psy-ence' offers a critical lens through which to view the mental health of AI/AN populations, emphasizing the importance of cultural identity, historical context, and community resilience in the healing process (Gone, 2014; Kirmayer et al., 2011). This approach advocates for a decolonization of mental health services, recognizing the impact of colonialism on the psychological well-being of Indigenous peoples and promoting the use of traditional knowledge and practices in treatment. In conclusion, the mental health of AI/AN communities requires a multifaceted approach that respects the sovereignty of Tribal Nations and integrates evidence-based practices with culturally relevant interventions. The development of 'alter-Native psy-ence' represents a significant step forward in addressing the mental health needs of AI/AN populations, offering a model for reconciling Western and Indigenous approaches to healing. As this field continues to evolve, it is imperative that AI/AN communities are empowered to lead the way in determining the most effective strategies for promoting mental health and well-being within their populations.", "References": [{"title": "American Indian and Alaska Native mental health: diverse perspectives on enduring disparities.", "authors": "Gone, Joseph P., Trimble, Joseph E.", "journal": "Annual Review of Clinical Psychology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "8", "first page": "131", "last page": "160", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032511-143127"}, {"title": "Historical trauma among Indigenous Peoples of the Americas: concepts, research, and clinical considerations.", "authors": "Brave Heart, Maria Yellow Horse, Chase, Josephine, Elkins, Jennifer, Altschul, Deborah B.", "journal": "Journal of Psychoactive Drugs", "year": "2016", "volumes": "43", "first page": "282", "last page": "290", "DOI": "10.1080/02791072.2011.628913"}, {"title": "The role of culture in substance abuse treatment programs for American Indian and Alaska Native communities.", "authors": "Legha, Rupinder K., Novins, Douglas K.", "journal": "Psychiatric Services", "year": "2012", "volumes": "63", "first page": "686", "last page": "692", "DOI": "10.1176/appi.ps.201100433"}, {"title": "Redressing First Nations historical trauma: theorizing mechanisms for Indigenous culture as mental health treatment.", "authors": "Gone, Joseph P.", "journal": "Transcultural Psychiatry", "year": "2013", "volumes": "50", "first page": "683", "last page": "706", "DOI": "10.1177/1363461513487669"}, {"title": "The importance of identity, history, and culture in the wellbeing of Indigenous youth.", "authors": "Wexler, Lisa", "journal": "The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth", "year": "2014", "volumes": "7", "first page": "267", "last page": "276", "DOI": "10.1353/hcy.2014.0029"}, {"title": "Promoting Indigenous mental health: cultural perspectives on healing from Native American and Alaska Native communities.", "authors": "Goodkind, Jessica R., LaNoue, Marianna D., Milford, Jaime", "journal": "American Journal of Community Psychology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "55", "first page": "411", "last page": "421", "DOI": "10.1007/s10464-015-9723-1"}, {"title": "Community-based participatory research with Native American communities: the chronic disease self-management program.", "authors": "Mohatt, Nathaniel Vincent, Fok, Carlotta Ching Ting, Burket, Rebekah, Henry, David, Allen, James", "journal": "Health Education & Behavior", "year": "2014", "volumes": "41", "first page": "488", "last page": "496", "DOI": "10.1177/1090198114529592"}, {"title": "Reconsidering American Indian historical trauma: lessons from an early Gros Ventre war narrative.", "authors": "Gone, Joseph P.", "journal": "Transcultural Psychiatry", "year": "2014", "volumes": "51", "first page": "387", "last page": "406", "DOI": "10.1177/1363461513489722"}, {"title": "Rethinking historical trauma.", "authors": "Kirmayer, Laurence J., Gone, Joseph P., Moses, Joshua", "journal": "Transcultural Psychiatry", "year": "2011", "volumes": "51", "first page": "299", "last page": "319", "DOI": "10.1177/1363461511418355"}]}
