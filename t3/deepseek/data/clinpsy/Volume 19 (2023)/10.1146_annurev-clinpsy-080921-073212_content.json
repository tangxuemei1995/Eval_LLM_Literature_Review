{"Literature Review": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into the digital measurement of psychological health represents a paradigm shift in psychometrics, offering novel methodologies for understanding and treating mental health conditions. This literature review explores the theoretical underpinnings and empirical advancements in this interdisciplinary field, focusing on digital phenotyping, digital biomarkers, and the application of ML models in psychological assessment and intervention. Digital phenotyping, the moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in situ using data from personal digital devices, has emerged as a promising approach for capturing the complexity of psychological health in real-time (Insel, 2017). This method leverages the ubiquity of smartphones and wearable devices to collect a wide array of data types, including geolocation, physical activity, and social interactions, which can be analyzed to infer psychological states and traits (Torous et al., 2016). The development of digital biomarkers, objective, quantifiable physiological and behavioral data collected through digital technologies that can serve as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, has further enhanced the potential of digital phenotyping in psychological research (Huckvale et al., 2019). These biomarkers offer a more granular and continuous measure of psychological health, enabling early detection of mental health issues and personalized treatment strategies. Machine learning models, with their ability to learn from and make predictions on data, have been instrumental in analyzing the vast and complex datasets generated by digital phenotyping and digital biomarkers. These models have been applied to various aspects of psychological health, from predicting depressive episodes based on smartphone usage patterns (Saeb et al., 2016) to identifying stress markers through wearable device data (Ghandeharioun et al., 2017). The application of ML in psychometrics has also led to the development of more sophisticated assessment tools, capable of capturing the multidimensional nature of psychological constructs with greater accuracy and efficiency (Jacobson et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the digital measurement of psychological health. Issues related to data privacy, the ethical use of personal data, and the need for standardized methodologies in digital phenotyping and biomarker development are critical areas of concern (Martinez-Martin et al., 2018). Furthermore, the interpretability of ML models and the generalizability of findings across different populations and contexts are ongoing challenges that require further research (Chekroud et al., 2016). In conclusion, the integration of machine learning and digital technologies into the measurement of psychological health offers unprecedented opportunities for advancing our understanding of mental health and illness. By leveraging the power of digital phenotyping, digital biomarkers, and ML models, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective and personalized approaches to psychological assessment and treatment. However, addressing the ethical, methodological, and interpretative challenges associated with these technologies is essential for realizing their full potential in the field of psychology.", "References": [{"title": "Digital Phenotyping: Technology for a New Science of Behavior", "authors": "Thomas R.
