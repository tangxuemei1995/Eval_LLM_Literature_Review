{"Literature Review": "Supernatural attributions, encompassing beliefs in entities and forces such as God, the devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma, play a significant role in the lives of many individuals across the globe. These beliefs, often intertwined with cultural and religious practices, influence perceptions of causality, moral judgments, and coping mechanisms in the face of life's challenges. Despite their prevalence, the psychological implications of supernatural attributions have not been extensively explored within clinical psychology, presenting a rich area for further investigation. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on supernatural beliefs and attributions, highlighting their psychological relevance and the factors that influence their adoption. Supernatural attributions can serve as both coping resources and sources of distress. For instance, attributing positive events to divine intervention can enhance feelings of gratitude and well-being, whereas attributing negative events to malevolent supernatural forces may exacerbate feelings of fear and helplessness (Pargament, 1997). Moreover, these beliefs can signal underlying psychopathology, such as in cases where individuals attribute their thoughts and actions to external spiritual entities, a phenomenon often observed in certain psychotic disorders (Peters, Joseph, & Garety, 1999). The role of supernatural beliefs as moral guides and decision-making tools is also noteworthy. Research has shown that belief in karma, for example, can promote prosocial behavior by instilling a sense of moral accountability (White, Norenzayan, & Schaller, 2019). Similarly, beliefs in divine retribution can deter individuals from engaging in unethical behavior (Shariff & Norenzayan, 2007). However, the impact of these beliefs is not uniformly positive; they can also lead to spiritual struggles, where individuals experience conflict, doubt, and fear regarding their spiritual beliefs and practices (Exline, 2013). A variety of factors contribute to the adoption of supernatural attributions. Contextual factors, such as exposure to traumatic events, can heighten the likelihood of attributing events to supernatural causes (McIntosh, Silver, & Wortman, 1993). Specific beliefs, shaped by cultural and religious teachings, also play a crucial role in determining the nature of these attributions (Gervais & Henrich, 2010). Additionally, cognitive styles and personality traits, such as a tendency towards intuitive thinking and openness to experience, have been linked to a greater propensity for supernatural beliefs (Lindeman & Aarnio, 2007). Social and cultural influences further shape the prevalence and expression of supernatural attributions. In societies where supernatural beliefs are widely accepted and integrated into the cultural fabric, individuals are more likely to interpret events through a supernatural lens (Legare & Gelman, 2008). Conversely, in more secular societies, such attributions may be less common or expressed in different forms. In conclusion, supernatural attributions are a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with significant psychological implications. They can serve as valuable coping resources, moral guides, and decision-making tools, but can also be sources of distress and indicators of psychopathology. A deeper understanding of these beliefs and the factors that influence them can provide clinical psychologists with valuable insights into the diverse ways in which individuals make sense of their experiences and navigate the challenges of life.", "References": [{"title": "The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice", "authors": "Kenneth I.
