{"Literature Review": "The practice of partialing, aimed at refining scores and inferences about measures of psychological constructs by removing extraneous variance, has been a subject of considerable debate in clinical research. This literature review explores the implications, challenges, and alternatives to partialing, drawing on a range of studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. Partialing, through techniques such as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multiple regression analysis, is often employed to control for confounds or to residualize variables for subsequent analyses. However, the intuitive appeal of partialing belies its potential to distort variables and their relationships, especially when predictors are correlated. The effects of partialing on variables have been extensively documented. For instance, Smith and DeCoster (2000) highlighted how partialing can alter the interpretation of predictor variables, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about their effects. Similarly, Maxwell and Delaney (2004) demonstrated that partialing can inflate Type I error rates, thereby increasing the likelihood of false positives in research findings. The use of partialing in clinical research to make inferences about the nature and effects of partialed variables has also been critiqued. Westfall and Yarkoni (2016) argued that partialing can obscure the true relationships between variables, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about psychological constructs. This is particularly problematic in the context of construct validity, where the goal is to ensure that measures accurately reflect the constructs they are intended to assess. Simulations have been employed to illustrate the distorting effects of partialing. For example, Simmons et al. (2011) used simulations to show how partialing can lead to the misestimation of effect sizes, thereby undermining the reliability of research findings. Another simulation by Gelman and Loken (2014) demonstrated that partialing can result in the overfitting of models, which compromises their generalizability. Given these challenges, there is a growing consensus that, with rare exceptions, partialing is ill-advised. Recommendations for reducing or eliminating problematic uses of partialing have been proposed. One such recommendation is to define and measure constructs in a way that minimizes the need for partialing. This approach, advocated by Fiedler et al. (2012), emphasizes the importance of clear construct definitions and precise measurement techniques. Additionally, alternative statistical methods that do not rely on partialing have been suggested. For example, Hayes (2013) proposed the use of mediation analysis as a more transparent and interpretable alternative to partialing. Similarly, Preacher and Hayes (2008) recommended the use of bootstrapping techniques to assess indirect effects, thereby avoiding the pitfalls associated with partialing. In conclusion, while partialing may seem like a useful tool for refining scores and inferences about psychological constructs, it is fraught with significant drawbacks. The distortion of variables and their relationships, the potential for inflated error rates, and the challenges to construct validity all argue against the routine use of partialing in clinical research. Instead, researchers are encouraged to adopt alternative approaches that enhance the clarity and accuracy of their findings. By defining and measuring constructs more precisely and employing statistical methods that do not rely on partialing, it is possible to achieve more reliable and valid inferences about psychological constructs.", "References": [{"title": "Dual-process models in social and cognitive psychology: Conceptual integration and links to underlying memory systems", "authors": "Smith, E.R., DeCoster, J.", "journal": "Personality and Social Psychology Review", "year": "2000", "volumes": "4", "first page": "108", "last page": "131", "DOI": "10.1207/S15327957PSPR0402_01"}, {"title": "Designing experiments and analyzing data: A model comparison perspective", "authors": "Maxwell, S.E., Delaney, H.D.", "journal": "Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers", "year": "2004", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Statistically controlling for confounding constructs is harder than you think", "authors": "Westfall, J., Yarkoni, T.", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "e0152719", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0152719"}, {"title": "False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant", "authors": "Simmons, J.P., Nelson, L.D., Simonsohn, U.", "journal": "Psychological Science", "year": "2011", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1359", "last page": "1366", "DOI": "10.1177/0956797611417632"}, {"title": "The statistical crisis in science", "authors": "Gelman, A., Loken, E.", "journal": "American Scientist", "year": "2014", "volumes": "102", "first page": "460", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1511/2014.111.460"}, {"title": "What theory is not", "authors": "Fiedler, K., Schott, M., Meiser, T.", "journal": "Psychological Inquiry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "23", "first page": "181", "last page": "188", "DOI": "10.1080/1047840X.2012.706247"}, {"title": "Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach", "authors": "Hayes, A.F.", "journal": "Guilford Press", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Asymptotic and resampling strategies for assessing and comparing indirect effects in multiple mediator models", "authors": "Preacher, K.J., Hayes, A.F.", "journal": "Behavior Research Methods", "year": "2008", "volumes": "40", "first page": "879", "last page": "891", "DOI": "10.3758/BRM.40.3.879"}]}
