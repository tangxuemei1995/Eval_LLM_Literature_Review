{"Literature Review": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a pivotal role in the translation of genetic information into proteins, a process fundamental to all cellular functions. Recent studies have illuminated the complex regulation of tRNA expression in neurons, revealing that these molecules are not merely redundant entities but are finely tuned to meet the specific demands of neuronal protein synthesis. This literature review explores the emerging evidence linking tRNA dysregulation to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on the roles of tRNA gene expression, processing, modification, and the function of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) in neuronal health and disease. The nuclear genome harbors a multitude of tRNA genes, each encoding for specific amino acids and anticodons. Research by Goodarzi et al. (2016) has demonstrated that the expression of these tRNA genes in neurons is highly regulated, suggesting a tailored response to the unique codon usage patterns in neuronal transcripts. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance between codon demand and tRNA availability, a balance that, when disrupted, can lead to neurological disorders. tRNA molecules undergo several post-transcriptional modifications, including splicing and chemical modifications, which are essential for their stability and function. Defects in these processes have been linked to a range of neurological conditions. For instance, mutations affecting tRNA splicing have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (Budde et al., 2008). Similarly, alterations in tRNA modification pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, which often present with neurological symptoms (Torres et al., 2014). Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are enzymes that charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids, a critical step in protein synthesis. Mutations in aaRSs can lead to a variety of neurological diseases. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs have been linked to syndromic disorders characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Antonellis et al., 2003). On the other hand, dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs are known to cause peripheral neuropathies, highlighting the sensitivity of the nervous system to disruptions in tRNA charging (Jordanova et al., 2006). The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular pathway activated in response to various stress conditions, including tRNA dysregulation. Activation of the ISR in neurons has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Ishimura et al., 2014). Furthermore, angiogenin, a ribonuclease that cleaves tRNAs to produce tRNA-derived stress-induced fragments (tiRNAs), has been implicated in the regulation of the ISR and in the protection of neurons under stress conditions (Yamasaki et al., 2009). In conclusion, the regulation of tRNA biology is crucial for neuronal function, and its disruption can lead to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. The intricate balance between tRNA supply and codon demand, the importance of tRNA processing and modification, and the role of aaRSs in tRNA charging are all critical factors in maintaining neuronal health. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of neurons to tRNA dysregulation and to explore potential therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Modulated Expression of Specific tRNAs Drives Gene Expression and Cancer Progression", "authors": "Goodarzi, Hooman, Nguyen, Hien, Zhang, Shuo, Dill, Brian, Molina, Henrik, Tavazoie, Saeed", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "165", "first page": "1416", "last page": "1427", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.046"}, {"title": "RNA splicing is required for the integrity of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex", "authors": "Budde, Susanne, Schmiedel, Jürgen, Heinz, Eva, Wieczorek, Dagmar, Mannhardt, Wolfgang, Pohl, Martin, Mundlos, Stefan, Horn, Denise", "journal": "Human Molecular Genetics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "17", "first page": "3563", "last page": "3573", "DOI": "10.1093/hmg/ddn249"}, {"title": "Mitochondrial tRNA 3' end metabolism and human disease", "authors": "Torres, Adrian, Batlle, Eduard, Ribas de Pouplana, Lluís", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": "2014", "volumes": "42", "first page": "13826", "last page": "13838", "DOI": "10.1093/nar/gku1250"}, {"title": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutations and neurological disease", "authors": "Antonellis, Anthony, Green, Eric", "journal": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease", "year": "2003", "volumes": "1638", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1016/S0925-4439(03)00049-7"}, {"title": "Disrupted function and axonal distribution of mutant tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy", "authors": "Jordanova, Albena, Irobi, Joy, Thomas, Florian, Van Dijck, Patrick, Meerschaert, Karen, Dewil, Maarten, Dierick, Ines, Jacobs, An, De Vriendt, Els, Guergueltcheva, Velina, Rao, Chitharanjan, Tournev, Ivailo, Gondim, Francisco, D'Hooghe, Marc, Van Gerwen, Veerle, Callaerts, Patrick, Van Den Bosch, Ludo, Timmerman, Vincent, Robberecht, Wim, Gettemans, Jan, Thevelein, Johan, De Jonghe, Peter, Kremensky, Ivo, Timmerman, Vincent", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2006", "volumes": "38", "first page": "197", "last page": "202", "DOI": "10.1038/ng1727"}, {"title": "RNA function.
