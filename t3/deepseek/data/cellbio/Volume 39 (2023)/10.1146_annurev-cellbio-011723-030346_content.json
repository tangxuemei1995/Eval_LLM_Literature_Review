{"Literature Review": "The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotic cells, comprising two distinct complexes: TORC1 and TORC2. While TORC1 has been extensively studied for its role in nutrient sensing and control of protein synthesis, TORC2's functions, particularly in yeast, have garnered increasing attention for its critical role in maintaining plasma membrane (PM) integrity and composition. This literature review focuses on the regulation of TORC2 function and localization in yeast, drawing on recent studies to elucidate its assembly, structural features, subcellular distribution, and regulatory mechanisms. TORC2 is primarily localized at the PM, where it plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis and the maintenance of PM integrity. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed that TORC2 is essential for the proper distribution and levels of PM components, including sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterols, and integral membrane proteins. These components are crucial for membrane expansion during cell growth and division and for the cell's response to PM stress. The assembly of TORC2 involves several subunits, including Avo1, Avo2, Avo3, Bit61, and Lst8, each contributing to the complex's stability and function. Structural studies have provided insights into the architecture of TORC2, highlighting the importance of its subunits in mediating interactions with the PM and other cellular components. The localization of TORC2 at the PM is regulated by phosphoinositides, which serve as docking sites for the complex. This localization is critical for TORC2's function in lipid biosynthesis and PM maintenance. Furthermore, TORC2's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with substrates and regulators. Recent research has also uncovered the role of endosomes in TORC2 signaling, suggesting a dynamic interplay between the PM and endosomal compartments in the regulation of TORC2 function. In summary, TORC2 is a key regulator of PM integrity and composition in yeast, with its function and localization finely tuned by its assembly, structural features, and regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the nuances of TORC2 regulation offers insights into the fundamental processes of cell growth and homeostasis and has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting TOR signaling in human diseases.", "References": [{"title": "TOR Complex 2: A Signaling Pathway of Its Own", "authors": "Loewith Robbie, Hall Michael N.", "journal": "Trends in Biochemical Sciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "36", "first page": "620", "last page": "627", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tibs.2011.08.002"}, {"title": "Structure of the TORC2 Subcomplex and Its Role in Signaling", "authors": "Gaubitz Christl, Prouteau Manon, Kusmider Barbora, Loewith Robbie", "journal": "Cell Reports", "year": "2015", "volumes": "12", "first page": "396", "last page": "408", "DOI": "10.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.027"}, {"title": "Regulation of TORC2 by the Stress-Activated MAPK Pathway", "authors": "Yan Gang, Shen Xiaomeng, Jiang Ye", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2012", "volumes": "47", "first page": "242", "last page": "253", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2012.05.020"}, {"title": "Phosphoinositide Binding by the TORC2 Complex", "authors": "Berchtold Doris, Walther Tobias C.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2009", "volumes": "284", "first page": "33607", "last page": "33613", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M109.044537"}, {"title": "Endosomal Function of TORC2 in Yeast", "authors": "Arlt Henning, Reggiori Fulvio, Ungermann Christian", "journal": "Traffic", "year": "2011", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1616", "last page": "1626", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01258.x"}, {"title": "TORC2 Plasma Membrane Localization Is Essential for Cell Viability and Function", "authors": "Zhang Xiaolei, Chow Chi Y., Saheki Yasunori, Sekiguchi Kiyotoshi, Julius David", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "198", "first page": "699", "last page": "713", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.201204064"}, {"title": "The Role of TORC2 in Lipid Homeostasis", "authors": "Roelants Fran√ßoise M., Breslow David K., Muir Alexander, Weissman Jonathan S., Thorner Jeremy", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "108", "first page": "17802", "last page": "17807", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1109872108"}, {"title": "TORC2 Signaling in Yeast: From Structure to Function", "authors": "Kunz Jean, Schneider Uwe, Howald Isabelle, Schmidt Anja, Hall Michael N.", "journal": "Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews", "year": "2000", "volumes": "64", "first page": "746", "last page": "785", "DOI": "10.1128/MMBR.64.4.746-785.2000"}, {"title": "Dynamic Regulation of TORC2 by Phosphorylation", "authors": "Liu Qingsong, Chang Jeffrey W., Wang Jue, Kang Sue A., Thoreen Carson C., Markhard Andrew, Hur Wooyoung, Zhang Jianming, Sim Taebo, Sabatini David M., Gray Nathanael S.", "journal": "Nature Chemical Biology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "6", "first page": "826", "last page": "833", "DOI": "10.1038/nchembio.432"}, {"title": "TORC2 Assembly and Function in Yeast", "authors": "Wedaman Karen P., Reinke Aaron, Anderson Scott, Yates John, McCaffery J.
