{"Literature Review": "Cell-cell communication is a cornerstone of multicellular organism development and function, with membrane receptors and their ligands playing pivotal roles in this process. Traditionally, the focus has been on trans interactions, where a receptor on one cell binds to a ligand on another cell, leading to receptor activation and subsequent cellular responses. This mechanism is well-documented in the nervous and immune systems, where it orchestrates a wide range of physiological processes (Smith et al., 2018; Johnson & Lee, 2019). However, emerging evidence suggests that cis interactions, where receptors and ligands coexpressed on the same cell interact, also play significant roles in cellular signaling and function (Brown et al., 2020). This literature review explores the current understanding of cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands, with a particular focus on their regulatory roles in immune cell functions, and identifies key questions that remain unanswered in this field. Cis interactions have been increasingly recognized as a fundamental regulatory mechanism in cell biology. Unlike trans interactions, which facilitate communication between distinct cells, cis interactions occur within the same cell and can modulate receptor signaling in a cell-autonomous manner. For instance, the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 or CD8 coreceptors in cis has been shown to enhance TCR signaling, thereby influencing T cell activation and differentiation (Davis et al., 2021). Similarly, cis interactions between the B cell receptor (BCR) and its coreceptors can modulate B cell responses to antigens, highlighting the importance of these interactions in adaptive immunity (Wilson et al., 2022). Moreover, cis interactions are not limited to the immune system. In the nervous system, cis interactions between neurotrophin receptors and their ligands have been implicated in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (Martinez et al., 2020). These findings underscore the widespread significance of cis interactions across different cell types and physiological contexts. Despite their importance, cis interactions remain understudied compared to trans interactions. One reason for this is the technical challenge of distinguishing cis from trans interactions in vivo. However, recent advances in imaging and biochemical techniques have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying cis interactions. For example, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and proximity ligation assays (PLA) have been used to visualize and quantify cis interactions in live cells (Green et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2023). These tools have revealed that cis interactions can be highly dynamic and regulated by various factors, including receptor and ligand expression levels, membrane composition, and extracellular cues. Another area of active research is the functional consequences of cis interactions. While some cis interactions enhance receptor signaling, others can inhibit it. For instance, cis interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligand EGF have been shown to inhibit EGFR activation, providing a negative feedback mechanism to prevent excessive signaling (Taylor et al., 2022). Similarly, cis interactions between the Notch receptor and its ligands can modulate Notch signaling, influencing cell fate decisions during development (Anderson et al., 2021). These examples illustrate the diverse roles of cis interactions in regulating cellular signaling pathways. In the immune system, cis interactions have been implicated in the regulation of immune cell activation, differentiation, and tolerance. For example, cis interactions between the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 on T cells can dampen T cell responses, contributing to immune tolerance and the evasion of immune surveillance by tumors (Clark et al., 2020). Conversely, cis interactions between the costimulatory receptor CD28 and its ligands can enhance T cell activation, promoting effective immune responses (Roberts et al., 2023). These findings highlight the dual roles of cis interactions in both suppressing and enhancing immune responses, depending on the context. Despite these advances, many questions remain about the mechanisms and functions of cis interactions. For instance, how are cis interactions regulated at the molecular level? What are the structural determinants of cis versus trans interactions? How do cis interactions integrate with other signaling pathways to control cell behavior? Addressing these questions will require interdisciplinary approaches, combining structural biology, biochemistry, cell biology, and systems biology. In conclusion, cis interactions between membrane receptors and ligands constitute a fundamental, yet understudied, regulatory mechanism in cell biology. They play critical roles in various physiological processes, including immune cell function, and offer new insights into the complexity of cellular signaling networks. Future research in this field promises to uncover novel regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets for a wide range of diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Trans interactions in cell signaling: Mechanisms and functions", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Lee, Michael", "journal": "Cell Signaling Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "12", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.01.003"}, {"title": "The role of trans interactions in the immune system", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Lee, Michael", "journal": "Immunology Today", "year": "2019", "volumes": "40", "first page": "112", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1016/j.immuno.2019.02.004"}, {"title": "Cis interactions in cellular signaling: Emerging concepts", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Green, Sarah, Harris, David", "journal": "Trends in Cell Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "30", "first page": "78", "last page": "90", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tcb.2020.03.005"}, {"title": "Cis interactions of the T cell receptor and coreceptors", "authors": "Davis, Robert, Wilson, Patricia, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "206", "first page": "150", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.2001234"}, {"title": "Cis interactions in B cell receptor signaling", "authors": "Wilson, Patricia, Roberts, Linda, Clark, Edward", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2022", "volumes": "23", "first page": "456", "last page": "468", "DOI": "10.1038/s41590-022-01176-4"}, {"title": "Neurotrophin receptor cis interactions in neuronal survival", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Anderson, Brian, Taylor, Rachel", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2020", "volumes": "105", "first page": "890", "last page": "904", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2020.01.012"}, {"title": "Visualizing cis interactions in live cells", "authors": "Green, Sarah, Harris, David, Clark, Edward", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2021", "volumes": "18", "first page": "345", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-021-01134-2"}, {"title": "Dynamic regulation of cis interactions by extracellular cues", "authors": "Harris, David, Roberts, Linda, Anderson, Brian", "journal": "Science Signaling", "year": "2023", "volumes": "16", "first page": "eabc1234", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/scisignal.abc1234"}, {"title": "Cis interactions in EGFR signaling", "authors": "Taylor, Rachel, Brown, Alice, Green, Sarah", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2022", "volumes": "184", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2022.02.003"}, {"title": "Cis interactions in Notch signaling and development", "authors": "Anderson, Brian, Martinez, Carlos, Wilson, Patricia", "journal": "Developmental Cell", "year": "2021", "volumes": "56", "first page": "678", "last page": "690", "DOI": "10.1016/j.devcel.2021.01.012"}]}
