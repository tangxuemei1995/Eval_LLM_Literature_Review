{"Literature Review": "The transport of lipids across the aqueous cytosol is a fundamental process in eukaryotic cells, essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. This process is facilitated by vesicle-mediated traffic and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), which have traditionally been understood to operate via shuttle-like mechanisms, transporting one or a few lipids at a time. However, the discovery of a new family of LTPs characterized by a repeating β-groove (RBG) rod-like structure has introduced a novel paradigm in lipid transport mechanisms. These proteins, including VPS13, ATG2, BLTP, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164, feature a hydrophobic channel that spans their length, suggesting a bridge-like mechanism for lipid transport at membrane contact sites (MCSs). This review synthesizes current knowledge on the structure, functions, and physiological roles of RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins, while also highlighting the open questions that remain in understanding their full biological significance. The RBG motif proteins are distinguished by their unique structural architecture, which includes a long, rod-like domain composed of repeating β-grooves. This structure forms a hydrophobic channel that is hypothesized to facilitate the direct transfer of lipids between membranes at MCSs, a mechanism that contrasts with the shuttle-like transport of traditional LTPs. The localization of these proteins at MCSs, regions where two organelles are closely apposed but do not fuse, supports their role in non-vesicular lipid transport. The discovery of RBG motif proteins has expanded our understanding of lipid transport mechanisms, suggesting that bridge-like transport may play a critical role in cellular lipid homeostasis. Mutations in genes encoding RBG motif proteins have been linked to a range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. For example, mutations in VPS13A are associated with chorea-acanthocytosis, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal movements and red blood cell morphology. Similarly, mutations in ATG2 have been implicated in autophagy-related disorders, highlighting the importance of these proteins in cellular processes beyond lipid transport. Despite these advances, many questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms of action, regulation, and physiological roles of RBG motif proteins. For instance, the specificity of lipid transport by these proteins is not fully understood, nor is the extent to which their functions overlap with or complement those of traditional LTPs. Additionally, the regulation of RBG motif protein activity at MCSs and their interactions with other proteins and lipids are areas of active investigation. Future research aimed at elucidating the structure-function relationships of RBG motif proteins, their roles in disease, and their potential as therapeutic targets will be crucial for advancing our understanding of lipid transport and its implications for human health.", "References": [{"title": "VPS13, a protein involved in lipid transport at membrane contact sites", "authors": "Seong Joo Koo, John H.
