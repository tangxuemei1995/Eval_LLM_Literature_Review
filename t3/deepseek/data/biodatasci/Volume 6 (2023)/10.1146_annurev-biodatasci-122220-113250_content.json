{"Literature Review": "The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) marked a pivotal shift in the exploration of genetic contributions to human diseases and traits. Initially, GWAS predominantly focused on populations of European descent, leading to a significant gap in our understanding of genetic diversity and its implications for precision medicine. This literature review delves into the evolution of GWAS, the challenges posed by the lack of diversity in early studies, and the strides made toward incorporating a broader range of ancestry groups to enhance the generalizability of genetic associations and improve the identification of disease susceptibility variants. Early GWAS, conducted in the mid-2000s, were instrumental in identifying numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. However, the overwhelming focus on European populations limited the applicability of these findings to other ancestry groups, underscoring the need for more inclusive research practices. The underrepresentation of non-European populations in GWAS has been widely recognized as a critical barrier to the advancement of precision medicine, which aims to tailor medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. Efforts to address this gap have led to the formation of collaborative consortia and the initiation of studies specifically designed to include diverse populations. These initiatives have not only expanded the genotype–phenotype catalog but have also facilitated the discovery of novel genetic associations in non-European descent populations. The integration of diverse cohorts into GWAS has been shown to improve the accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are used to predict an individual's risk of developing certain diseases based on their genetic makeup. Studies have demonstrated that PRS derived from European populations often perform poorly when applied to individuals of different ancestries, highlighting the importance of diversity in genetic research. The development of data resources and collaborative networks has been crucial in advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of diseases across different populations. These efforts have laid the groundwork for the next generation of genetic association studies, which will benefit from the decreasing costs of whole-genome sequencing and the increasing availability of genomic data from diverse populations. The inclusion of diverse ancestry groups in GWAS is essential for the realization of precision medicine's full potential. By ensuring that genetic research reflects the diversity of the human population, we can improve the generalizability of genetic findings, enhance the predictive power of PRS, and ultimately contribute to more equitable healthcare outcomes. The journey toward a more inclusive genomic landscape is ongoing, but the progress made thus far offers promising prospects for the future of genetic research and precision medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Genome-wide association studies for complex traits: consensus, uncertainty and challenges", "authors": "McCarthy, Mark I., Abecasis, Gonçalo R., Cardon, Lon R., Goldstein, David B., Little, John, Ioannidis, John P.A., Hirschhorn, Joel N.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "9", "first page": "356", "last page": "369", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg2344"}, {"title": "The importance of diversity in genomics: The case of the missing heritability", "authors": "Bustamante, Carlos D., De La Vega, Francisco M., Burchard, Esteban G.", "journal": "Genome Medicine", "year": "2011", "volumes": "3", "first page": "79", "last page": "79", "DOI": "10.1186/gm295"}, {"title": "The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases", "authors": "Visscher, Peter M., Brown, Matthew A., McCarthy, Mark I., Yang, Jian", "journal": "Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "337", "first page": "6100", "last page": "6100", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1222794"}, {"title": "Genetics of human gene expression: mapping DNA variants that influence gene expression", "authors": "Stranger, Barbara E., Nica, Alexandra C., Forrest, Matthew S., Dimas, Antigone, Bird, Christine P., Beazley, Claude, Ingle, Catherine E., Dunning, Mark, Flicek, Paul, Koller, Daphne, Montgomery, Stephen, Tavaré, Simon, Deloukas, Panos, Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2007", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1217", "last page": "1224", "DOI": "10.1038/ng2142"}, {"title": "The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project", "authors": "Lonsdale, John, Thomas, Jeffrey, Salvatore, Mike, Phillips, Rebecca, Lo, Edmund, Shad, Saboor, Hasz, Richard, Walters, Gary, Garcia, Fernando, Young, Nancy, Foster, Barbara, Moser, Mike, Karasik, Ellen, Gillard, Bryan, Ramsey, Kimberley, Sullivan, Susan, Bridge, Jason, Magazine, Harold, Syron, John, Fleming, Johnelle, Siminoff, Laura, Traino, Heather, Mosavel, Maghboeba, Barker, Laura, Rohrer, Dan, Maxim, Dan, Filkins, Dana, Harbach, Philip, Cortadillo, Eddie, Berghuis, Bree, Turner, Lisa, Hudson, Eric, Feenstra, Kristin, Sobin, Leslie, Robb, James, Branton, Phillip, Korzeniewski, Greg, Shive, Charles, Tabor, David, Qi, Liqun, Groch, Kevin, Nampally, Sreenath, Buia, Steve, Zimmerman, Angela, Smith, Anna, Burges, Robin, Robinson, Karna, Valentino, Kim, Bradbury, Deborah, Cosentino, Mark, Diaz-Mayoral, Norma, Kennedy, Mary, Engel, Theresa, Williams, Penelope, Erickson, Kenyon, Ardlie, Kristin, Winckler, Wendy, Getz, Gad, DeLuca, David, MacArthur, Daniel, Kellis, Manolis, Thomson, Alexander, Young, Taylor, Gelfand, Ellen, Donovan, Molly, Meng, Yan, Grant, George, Mash, Deborah, Marcus, Yudate, Basile, Margaret, Liu, Jun, Zhu, Jun, Tu, Zhidong, Cox, Nancy J., Nicolae, Dan L., Gamazon, Eric R., Im, Hae Kyung, Konkashbaev, Anuar, Pritchard, Jonathan K., Stevens, Matthew, Flutre, Timothée, Wen, Xiaoquan, Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T., Lappalainen, Tuuli, Guigo, Roderic, Monlong, Jean, Sammeth, Michael, Koller, Daphne, Battle, Alexis, Mostafavi, Sara, McCarthy, Mark I., Rivas, Manuel A., Maller, Julian, Rusyn, Ivan, Nobel, Andrew, Wright, Fred, Shabalin, Andrey, Feolo, Michael, Sharopova, Nataliya, Sturcke, Anne, Paschal, Justin, Anderson, James M., Wilder, Elizabeth L., Derr, Leslie K., Green, Eric D., Struewing, Jeffery P., Temple, Gary, Volpi, Simona, Boyer, Joy T., Thomson, Elizabeth J., Guyer, Mark S., Ng, Catherine, Abdallah, Assya, Colantuoni, Deborah, Insel, Thomas R., Koester, Susan E., Little, A.
