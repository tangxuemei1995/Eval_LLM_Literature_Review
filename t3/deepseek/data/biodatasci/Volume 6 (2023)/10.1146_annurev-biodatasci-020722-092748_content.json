{"Literature Review": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with its risk assessment being pivotal for the implementation of personalized medicine strategies. The integration of molecular and radiomic features presents a promising avenue for enhancing the accuracy of breast cancer risk prediction models. This literature review explores the current state of research in combining these two domains for improved risk assessment in breast cancer. Breast density, as measured through conventional mammography, has been consistently identified as a strong independent risk factor for breast cancer. Studies have shown that women with higher breast density are at a significantly increased risk of developing breast cancer compared to those with lower breast density (Boyd et al., 2007). However, the reliance on breast density alone for risk assessment is limited by its inability to capture the complexity of breast parenchymal patterns, which have been shown to provide additional predictive information (Li et al., 2015). On the molecular front, genetic factors play a crucial role in breast cancer risk. High-penetrance mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 are well-established risk factors, but they account for only a small fraction of breast cancer cases. In contrast, polygenic risk scores (PRS), which aggregate the effects of numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) each with a low penetrance, have emerged as a powerful tool for assessing breast cancer risk in the general population (Mavaddat et al., 2019). The combination of imaging biomarkers, such as those derived from radiomics, with molecular biomarkers, including PRS, has the potential to significantly improve risk stratification. Radiomics, the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images, has shown promise in capturing the heterogeneity of breast tissue and its association with cancer risk (Lambin et al., 2012). Recent studies have begun to explore the integration of radiomic features with genetic information for breast cancer risk assessment. For instance, a study by Dembrower et al. (2020) demonstrated that combining radiomic features from mammograms with a PRS could improve the prediction of breast cancer risk compared to using either method alone. Similarly, another study highlighted the potential of integrating radiomic features with molecular biomarkers for identifying women at high risk of interval cancers, which are cancers diagnosed between regular screening mammograms (Eriksson et al., 2018). Despite these promising findings, the field faces several challenges, including the need for large, diverse datasets to validate these integrated models and the development of standardized methodologies for feature extraction and analysis. Furthermore, the ethical implications of using genetic information for risk assessment, including issues related to privacy and discrimination, must be carefully considered (Clayton et al., 2019). In conclusion, the combination of molecular and radiomic features represents a frontier in breast cancer risk assessment, offering the potential for more personalized and accurate risk prediction. Future research should focus on addressing the current limitations and exploring the full potential of this integrated approach for improving breast cancer screening and prevention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Mammographic density and the risk and detection of breast cancer", "authors": "Norman F.
