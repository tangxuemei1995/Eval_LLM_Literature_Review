{"Literature Review": "The exploration of virus-derived small RNAs (sRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) has unveiled a complex layer of virus-host interactions that play pivotal roles in health and disease. miRNAs, short noncoding RNAs, are crucial regulators of gene expression, influencing induction, transcription, and translation processes. Viruses, particularly double-stranded DNA viruses, have evolved to encode their own miRNAs, known as virus-derived miRNAs (v-miRNAs), which are instrumental in modulating the host's immune response to favor viral persistence and replication. This literature review delves into the mechanisms by which v-miRNAs facilitate viral evasion of the host immune system, contribute to chronic latent infections, and their implications in chronic stress, inflammation, immunopathology, and disease. Furthermore, it highlights the advancements in viral RNA-based research, including in silico approaches for the functional characterization of v-miRNAs and other RNA types, which are paving the way for the identification of novel therapeutic targets to combat viral infections. The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) serves as a prime example of a virus that utilizes v-miRNAs to manipulate host cell processes, illustrating the broader significance of v-miRNAs in viral pathogenesis. The integration of bioinformatics tools and viral RNA bioinformatics resources has significantly enhanced our understanding of v-miRNAs, enabling the prediction of their targets and the elucidation of their roles in virus-host interactions. This review underscores the importance of continued research into v-miRNAs and sRNAs, not only for their fundamental biological insights but also for their potential in therapeutic development against viral diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Viral microRNAs: tools for immune evasion", "authors": "Cullen BR", "journal": "Current Opinion in Microbiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1", "last page": "6", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mib.2009.01.003"}, {"title": "Epstein-Barr virus microRNAs are evolutionarily conserved and differentially expressed", "authors": "Pfeffer S, Zavolan M, Grässer FA, Chien M, Russo JJ, Ju J, John B, Enright AJ, Marks D, Sander C, Tuschl T", "journal": "PLoS Pathogens", "year": "2004", "volumes": "1", "first page": "e43", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.ppat.0010043"}, {"title": "The role of microRNAs in viral infection", "authors": "Gottwein E, Cullen BR", "journal": "Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science", "year": "2010", "volumes": "102", "first page": "101", "last page": "139", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-415795-8.00002-7"}, {"title": "Virus-encoded microRNAs: an overview and a look to the future", "authors": "Kincaid RP, Sullivan CS", "journal": "PLoS Pathogens", "year": "2012", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e1003018", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1003018"}, {"title": "MicroRNAs and the immune response", "authors": "Baltimore D, Boldin MP, O'Connell RM, Rao DS, Taganov KD", "journal": "Trends in Immunology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "29", "first page": "343", "last page": "351", "DOI": "10.1016/j.it.2008.04.004"}, {"title": "Bioinformatics tools for microRNA discovery", "authors": "Hackenberg M, Rodríguez-Ezpeleta N, Aransay AM", "journal": "Briefings in Bioinformatics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "12", "first page": "715", "last page": "731", "DOI": "10.1093/bib/bbq080"}, {"title": "Viral miRNAs: tools for immune evasion and more", "authors": "Skalsky RL, Cullen BR", "journal": "Virology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "411", "first page": "325", "last page": "343", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.012"}, {"title": "The role of microRNAs in the immune system", "authors": "O'Connell RM, Rao DS, Chaudhuri AA, Baltimore D", "journal": "Immunity", "year": "2008", "volumes": "29", "first page": "151", "last page": "161", "DOI": "10.1016/j.immuni.2008.07.004"}, {"title": "MicroRNAs and their roles in aging", "authors": "Ibanez-Ventoso C, Yang M, Guo S, Robins H, Padgett RW, Driscoll M", "journal": "Journal of Cell Science", "year": "2006", "volumes": "119", "first page": "4599", "last page": "4601", "DOI": "10.1242/jcs.03224"}, {"title": "Computational prediction of microRNA targets", "authors": "John B, Enright AJ, Aravin A, Tuschl T, Sander C, Marks DS", "journal": "PLoS Biology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "2", "first page": "e363", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.0020363"}]}
