{"Literature Review": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare has been heralded as a transformative force, particularly in the realm of precision medicine. However, the efficacy of AI models is contingent upon the quality and diversity of the biomedical data they are trained on. A growing body of literature has highlighted the issue of biomedical data inequality, where datasets predominantly represent European populations, thereby marginalizing non-European groups. This disparity not only undermines the universality of AI applications but also poses significant health risks to underrepresented populations. Recent studies have underscored the critical need for diverse biomedical datasets to ensure the equitable application of AI in healthcare. For instance, Popejoy and Fullerton (2016) emphasized the underrepresentation of non-European populations in genomic databases, which limits the generalizability of genetic findings and AI models derived from these data. Similarly, Sirugo et al. (2019) discussed the implications of this lack of diversity on the development of precision medicine, highlighting the potential for misdiagnosis and ineffective treatments for underrepresented groups.The challenge of biomedical data inequality is further compounded by the phenomenon of subpopulation shift, where AI models trained on data from one population perform poorly when applied to another. This issue has been extensively documented in the literature, with studies such as that by Oakden-Rayner et al. (2020) demonstrating the adverse effects of subpopulation shift on the accuracy of diagnostic AI models. To address this, researchers have proposed various algorithmic interventions, including transfer learning, which involves adapting models trained on one dataset to perform well on another, potentially more diverse dataset. Pan and Yang (2010) provided a comprehensive overview of transfer learning techniques, highlighting their potential to mitigate the effects of data inequality.Moreover, the quality of biomedical data varies significantly among ethnic groups, a disparity that has only recently begun to receive attention. This variation in data quality can exacerbate the challenges posed by data inequality, as AI models may be less effective when trained on lower-quality data. A study by Chen et al. (2021) explored the impact of data quality disparities on machine learning models, finding that models trained on higher-quality data from European populations outperformed those trained on lower-quality data from non-European populations.In response to these challenges, there has been a concerted effort to develop multiethnic machine learning models that can perform well across diverse populations. These models leverage advanced techniques such as domain adaptation and ensemble learning to improve their generalizability. For example, Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrated the effectiveness of domain adaptation techniques in enhancing the performance of diagnostic models across different ethnic groups.Despite these advances, significant barriers remain to achieving health equity through AI. The development of more inclusive biomedical datasets is paramount, as is the need for ongoing research into algorithmic interventions that can address the challenges posed by data inequality and subpopulation shift. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for policies and initiatives that promote the collection and sharing of high-quality biomedical data from diverse populations.In conclusion, while AI holds immense promise for transforming healthcare, the issue of biomedical data inequality poses a significant challenge to its equitable application. Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing the development of more diverse datasets, the refinement of algorithmic interventions, and the implementation of policies that promote health equity. Only by tackling the root causes of biomedical data inequality can we fully realize the potential of AI to improve health outcomes for all populations.", "References": [{"title": "Genomics is failing on diversity", "authors": "Alice B.
