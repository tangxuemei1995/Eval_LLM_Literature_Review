{"Literature Review": "The exploration of gene interactions, or epistasis, in human disease studies has become a focal point in understanding the complex genetic architecture underlying various conditions. Despite significant advancements in genomic technologies, a substantial portion of heritability in complex diseases remains unexplained, suggesting that single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with small to moderate effects are not the sole contributors to disease risk. This literature review aims to synthesize the growing body of evidence supporting the role of gene interactions in human disease, highlighting the potential for these interactions to inform precision medicine approaches. Recent studies have underscored the importance of epistasis in elucidating the genetic basis of complex diseases. For instance, research by Cordell (2009) demonstrated that gene-gene interactions could significantly impact the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, suggesting that epistasis plays a crucial role in disease susceptibility beyond the additive effects of individual genes. Similarly, a study by Hemani et al. (2014) utilized large-scale genomic data to identify epistatic interactions associated with human height, further emphasizing the complexity of genetic contributions to phenotypic traits. The integration of multiomic data has also provided insights into the multifaceted nature of gene interactions. By combining genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, researchers have been able to uncover novel pathways and networks implicated in disease pathogenesis. For example, Ritchie et al. (2015) highlighted the utility of multiomic integration in identifying gene-environment interactions that influence cancer risk, illustrating the potential of such approaches to reveal the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases. Pharmacogenomics, the study of how genetic variation affects drug response, has also benefited from the investigation of gene interactions. Studies have shown that epistatic effects can significantly influence the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutic agents, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of genetic interactions in drug development. Motsinger-Reif et al. (2013) provided evidence that gene-gene interactions could predict individual responses to chemotherapy, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies. Moreover, the exploration of network and pathway effects has revealed that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex biological systems. Research by Barabási et al. (2011) on network medicine demonstrated that disease-associated genes often interact within the same functional modules, suggesting that targeting these modules could offer new therapeutic opportunities. This systems-level approach to understanding gene interactions has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat complex diseases. In conclusion, the mounting evidence for the role of gene interactions in human disease underscores the need for continued research in this area. By leveraging advances in genomic technologies, multiomic integration, and network analysis, we can begin to unravel the complex genetic architecture of diseases and move closer to the realization of precision medicine. The studies reviewed here highlight the importance of considering epistasis in genetic and genomic studies, offering new avenues for the discovery of drug targets and the development of personalized therapies.", "References": [{"title": "Detecting gene-gene interactions that underlie human diseases", "authors": "Heather J.
