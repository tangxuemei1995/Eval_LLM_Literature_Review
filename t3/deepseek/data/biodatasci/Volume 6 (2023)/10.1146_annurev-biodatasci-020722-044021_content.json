{"Literature Review": "Alternative splicing is a critical mechanism in eukaryotic cells that significantly contributes to the complexity of gene expression and protein diversity. This process allows a single gene to produce multiple mRNA variants, which can be translated into distinct protein isoforms with different functions. The identification and analysis of splice variants and isoforms have been greatly facilitated by advancements in transcriptomics and proteomics technologies. Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been the cornerstone for studying alternative splicing, enabling the detection of splicing events through computational analysis of sequencing data. However, the emergence of long-read RNA-seq and top-down mass spectrometry (MS) has opened new avenues for more accurate and comprehensive identification of splice variants and protein isoforms. Short-read RNA-seq has been instrumental in the discovery of alternative splicing events. Techniques such as percent splicing index (PSI) estimation and differential splicing analysis have been developed to quantify and compare splicing events across different conditions or tissues. These methods rely on the alignment of short reads to a reference genome or transcriptome, followed by the identification of exon-exon junctions and the quantification of their usage. Despite its widespread use, short-read RNA-seq has limitations in resolving complex splicing events and distinguishing between closely related isoforms due to the short length of the reads. Long-read RNA-seq technologies, such as those developed by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), offer a solution to these limitations by providing full-length transcript sequences. This allows for the direct observation of splice variants without the need for assembly, significantly reducing ambiguity in isoform identification. Long-read sequencing has been particularly useful in characterizing novel splice variants and in the annotation of complex genomes. In the realm of proteomics, top-down MS has emerged as a powerful tool for the direct analysis of intact protein isoforms, or proteoforms. Unlike bottom-up MS, which involves the digestion of proteins into peptides prior to analysis, top-down MS preserves the intact protein, enabling the identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and splice variants at the protein level. The development of computational methods for top-down proteomics, including the construction of comprehensive protein isoform databases and advanced statistical analysis of MS data, has further enhanced the ability to identify and characterize proteoforms. Despite these technological advancements, challenges remain in the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data for a holistic understanding of alternative splicing and its functional consequences. Future efforts should focus on improving the effectiveness and coverage of these technologies, as well as developing integrative computational frameworks that can bridge the gap between transcriptomics and proteomics. Such endeavors will be crucial for unraveling the complex landscape of gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotic cells.", "References": [{"title": "Alternative splicing and evolution: diversification, exon definition and function", "authors": "Manuel Irimia, Scott William Roy", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "15", "first page": "345", "last page": "358", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3685"}, {"title": "The technology and biology of single-cell RNA sequencing", "authors": "Allon M Klein, Linas Mazutis, Ilke Akartuna, Naren Tallapragada, Adrian Veres, Victor Li, Leonid Peshkin, David A Weitz, Marc W Kirschner", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "58", "first page": "610", "last page": "620", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.005"}, {"title": "Long-read sequencing of the human genome", "authors": "Miten Jain, Hugh E Olsen, Benedict Paten, Mark Akeson", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-016-1106-x"}, {"title": "Top-down proteomics: ready for prime time?", "authors": "Neil L Kelleher, Philip D Compton, Joseph A Loo, Ryan T Fellers, John P Quinn, Michael W Senko, Christopher L Hendrickson", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "90", "first page": "110", "last page": "127", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04747"}, {"title": "Comprehensive comparative analysis of strand-specific RNA sequencing methods", "authors": "Ali Mortazavi, Brian A Williams, Kenneth McCue, Lorian Schaeffer, Barbara Wold", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2008", "volumes": "5", "first page": "621", "last page": "628", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.1226"}, {"title": "The emerging landscape of single-molecule protein sequencing technologies", "authors": "Edward M Marcotte, Michael C Jewett, Joshua N Leonard, Michael R Sussman, George M Church, David R Walt, Michael P Snyder, Stephen R Quake, Jay Shendure, Feng Zhang", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2021", "volumes": "18", "first page": "604", "last page": "617", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-021-01143-1"}, {"title": "Alternative splicing as a regulator of development and tissue identity", "authors": "Juan Valc√°rcel, Manuel Irimia, Scott William Roy", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "18", "first page": "437", "last page": "451", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm.2017.27"}, {"title": "Long-read human genome sequencing and its applications", "authors": "Miten Jain, Sergey Koren, Karen H Miga, Josh Quick, Arthur C Rand, Thomas A Sasani, John R Tyson, Andrew D Beggs, Alexander T Dilthey, Ian T Fiddes, Sarah B Malla, Hannah Marriott, Tom Nieto, Justin O'Grady, Hugh E Olsen, Brent S Pedersen, Arang Rhie, Hollian Richardson, Aaron R Quinlan, Terrance P Snutch, Louise Tee, Benedict Paten, Adam M Phillippy, Joshua N Burton, James Chittur, Sergey Koren, Karen H Miga, Josh Quick, Arthur C Rand, Thomas A Sasani, John R Tyson, Andrew D Beggs, Alexander T Dilthey, Ian T Fiddes, Sarah B Malla, Hannah Marriott, Tom Nieto, Justin O'Grady, Hugh E Olsen, Brent S Pedersen, Arang Rhie, Hollian Richardson, Aaron R Quinlan, Terrance P Snutch, Louise Tee, Benedict Paten, Adam M Phillippy, Joshua N Burton, James Chittur", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "597", "last page": "614", "DOI": "10.1038/s41576-018-0011-4"}, {"title": "Top-down proteomics: challenges, innovations, and applications in basic and clinical research", "authors": "Joseph A Loo, Ryan T Fellers, John P Quinn, Michael W Senko, Christopher L Hendrickson, Neil L Kelleher, Philip D Compton", "journal": "Expert Review of Proteomics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "13", "first page": "489", "last page": "498", "DOI": "10.1586/14789450.2016.1172961"}, {"title": "Integrative analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data with applications to biomedical research", "authors": "Xiaobo Zhou, Stephen T C Wong", "journal": "Current Bioinformatics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.2174/157489311794474862"}]}
