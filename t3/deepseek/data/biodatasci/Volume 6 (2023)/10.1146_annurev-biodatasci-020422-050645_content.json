{"Literature Review": "The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptomic landscape within complex biological systems. This technology has enabled researchers to dissect the intricate details of cellular function and disease at an unprecedented resolution. However, the biological complexity of cells extends beyond the transcriptome, encompassing the genome, epigenome, proteome, and spatial organization. The emergence of single-cell multiomics technologies, which allow for the simultaneous or parallel measurement of multiple modalities from the same or different cells, has opened new avenues for comprehensive cellular profiling. These advancements have been complemented by the development of sophisticated computational methods for integrating multimodal data, thereby enhancing our ability to infer biological insights from complex datasets. Single-cell multiomics technologies can be broadly categorized into those that measure multiple modalities simultaneously from the same cell and those that measure different modalities from different cells. Simultaneous measurement technologies, such as CITE-seq (Stoeckius et al., 2017) and REAP-seq (Peterson et al., 2017), enable the co-profiling of transcriptomes and surface proteins, providing a more holistic view of cellular states. Similarly, technologies like scATAC-seq (Buenrostro et al., 2015) and scChIP-seq (Rotem et al., 2015) allow for the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic data, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression. On the other hand, technologies that measure different modalities from different cells, such as scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq, require computational integration to align the data and infer cellular identities and states. Computational integration methods play a pivotal role in leveraging the rich information contained within multimodal single-cell data. These methods can be classified into those designed for paired data, where multiple modalities are measured from the same cells, and those for unpaired data, where modalities are measured from different cells. For paired data, methods like MOFA+ (Argelaguet et al., 2020) and Seurat v3 (Stuart et al., 2019) have been developed to integrate transcriptomic and proteomic data, enabling the identification of cell types and states with greater accuracy. For unpaired data, methods such as LIGER (Welch et al., 2019) and Harmony (Korsunsky et al., 2019) facilitate the alignment of datasets across different modalities, allowing for the inference of cellular trajectories and interactions between different levels of biology. The integration of single-cell multiomics data has profound implications for our understanding of cellular biology and disease. By combining information from the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and spatial organization, researchers can uncover the complex interplay between genetic variation, gene expression, and cellular function. This integrated approach has been instrumental in identifying novel cell types, elucidating the mechanisms of disease, and guiding the development of targeted therapies. For instance, the integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data has revealed the regulatory networks driving cell fate decisions during development (Cusanovich et al., 2018). Similarly, the combination of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics has provided insights into the spatial organization of cells within tissues, highlighting the importance of cellular context in determining function (Ståhl et al., 2016). Despite the significant advancements in single-cell multiomics technologies and computational integration methods, challenges remain. The scalability of these technologies to large datasets, the accuracy of computational methods in integrating diverse modalities, and the interpretation of the resulting complex datasets are areas of ongoing research. Moreover, the development of standardized protocols and benchmarks for evaluating the performance of integration methods is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of findings. In conclusion, single-cell multiomics technologies and computational integration methods represent a powerful toolkit for dissecting the complexity of cellular biology. By enabling the simultaneous or parallel measurement of multiple modalities and the integration of these data, these approaches have the potential to transform our understanding of cellular function and disease. As the field continues to evolve, the development of novel technologies and computational methods will be essential for unlocking the full potential of single-cell multiomics.", "References": [{"title": "Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells", "authors": "Stoeckius, Marlon, Hafemeister, Christoph, Stephenson, William, Houck-Loomis, Brian, Chattopadhyay, Pratip K, Swerdlow, Harold, Satija, Rahul, Smibert, Peter", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2017", "volumes": "14", "first page": "865", "last page": "868", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.4380"}, {"title": "Multiplexed quantification of proteins and transcripts in single cells", "authors": "Peterson, Vanessa M, Zhang, Kelvin Xi, Kumar, Naveen, Wong, Jerelyn, Li, Lixia, Wilson, Douglas C, Moore, Renee, McClanahan, Terri K, Sadekova, Svetlana, Kljavin, Noelyn M", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "35", "first page": "936", "last page": "939", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.3973"}, {"title": "Single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals principles of regulatory variation", "authors": "Buenrostro, Jason D, Wu, Beijing, Litzenburger, Ulrike M, Ruff, David, Gonzales, Michael L, Snyder, Michael P, Chang, Howard Y, Greenleaf, William J", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "523", "first page": "486", "last page": "490", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14590"}, {"title": "Single-cell ChIP-seq reveals cell subpopulations defined by chromatin state", "authors": "Rotem, Asaf, Ram, Oren, Shoresh, Noam, Sperling, Ralph A, Goren, Alon, Weitz, David A, Bernstein, Bradley E", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "33", "first page": "1165", "last page": "1172", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.3383"}, {"title": "MOFA+: a statistical framework for comprehensive integration of multi-modal single-cell data", "authors": "Argelaguet, Ricard, Velten, Britta, Arnol, Damien, Dietrich, Sascha, Zenz, Thorsten, Marioni, John C, Buettner, Florian, Huber, Wolfgang, Stegle, Oliver", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "111", "last page": "111", "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-020-02015-1"}, {"title": "Comprehensive integration of single-cell data", "authors": "Stuart, Tim, Butler, Andrew, Hoffman, Paul, Hafemeister, Christoph, Papalexi, Efthymia, Mauck, William M, Hao, Yuhan, Stoeckius, Marlon, Smibert, Peter, Satija, Rahul", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2019", "volumes": "177", "first page": "1888", "last page": "1902.e21", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031"}, {"title": "Single-cell multi-omic integration compares and contrasts features of brain cell identity", "authors": "Welch, Joshua D, Kozareva, Viktoriya, Ferreira, Ashley, Vanderburg, Charles, Martin, Carly, Macosko, Evan Z", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2019", "volumes": "177", "first page": "1873", "last page": "1887.e17", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.006"}, {"title": "Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony", "authors": "Korsunsky, Ilya, Millard, Nghia, Fan, Jean, Slowikowski, Kamil, Zhang, Fan, Wei, Kevin, Baglaenko, Yuriy, Brenner, Michael, Loh, Po-Ru, Raychaudhuri, Soumya", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2019", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1289", "last page": "1296", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-019-0619-0"}, {"title": "A single-cell atlas of in vivo mammalian chromatin accessibility", "authors": "Cusanovich, Darren A, Hill, Andrew J, Aghamirzaie, Delasa, Daza, Riza M, Pliner, Hannah A, Berletch, Joel B, Filippova, Galina N, Huang, Xingfan, Christiansen, Lena, DeWitt, William S", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2018", "volumes": "174", "first page": "1309", "last page": "1324.e18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.052"}, {"title": "Visualization and analysis of gene expression in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics", "authors": "Ståhl, Patrik L, Salmén, Fredrik, Vickovic, Sanja, Lundmark, Anna, Navarro, José Fernández, Magnusson, Jens, Giacomello, Stefania, Asp, Michaela, Westholm, Jakub O, Huss, Mikael", "journal": "Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "353", "first page": "78", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaf2403"}]}
