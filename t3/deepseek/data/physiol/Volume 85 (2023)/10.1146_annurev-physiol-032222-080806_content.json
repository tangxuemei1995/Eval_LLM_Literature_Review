{"Literature Review": "Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process where endothelial cells (ECs) lose their specific markers and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. This transition plays a pivotal role in both physiological and pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The endothelium, being one of the largest organ systems, is crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis, and its dysfunction is a hallmark of vascular aging and various CVDs. Recent studies have highlighted EndMT as a significant contributor to the pathobiology of CVDs, offering new insights into potential therapeutic targets. However, EndMT is not solely a pathological process; it is also essential for normal physiological functions, such as cardiac development and vascular regeneration under certain conditions. This duality underscores the complexity of EndMT and the need for a nuanced understanding of its mechanisms and implications. The molecular reprogramming involved in EndMT represents a promising avenue for clinical translation, yet further research is necessary to fully exploit these opportunities. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of EndMT in health and disease, focusing on its role in cardiovascular pathology and the potential for therapeutic intervention. The process of EndMT involves the downregulation of endothelial markers, such as VE-cadherin and CD31, and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, and α-smooth muscle actin. This phenotypic switch is driven by a complex interplay of signaling pathways, with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling playing a central role. Other pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog, have also been implicated in the regulation of EndMT. The transition from an endothelial to a mesenchymal phenotype is not only a hallmark of pathological conditions but also a critical component of embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the heart and blood vessels. In the context of disease, EndMT has been associated with a range of CVDs, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac fibrosis. The contribution of EndMT to these conditions is multifaceted, involving the promotion of inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular remodeling. Despite the growing body of evidence linking EndMT to CVDs, the precise mechanisms underlying this process remain incompletely understood. This gap in knowledge highlights the need for further research to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in EndMT and to identify potential therapeutic targets. The potential for clinical translation of EndMT research is significant, with implications for the development of novel treatments for CVDs. However, realizing this potential will require a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving EndMT, as well as the development of targeted therapies that can modulate this process without disrupting its physiological roles. In conclusion, EndMT represents a critical link between endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of CVDs. While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of EndMT in health and disease, much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future research in this area holds promise for the development of novel treatments for CVDs, offering hope for improved outcomes for patients with these conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition in cardiovascular disease: JACC state-of-the-art review", "authors": "Kovacic, Jason C., Dimmeler, Stefanie, Harvey, Richard P., Finkel, Toren, Aikawa, Elena, Krenning, Guido, Baker, Andrew H.", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "73", "first page": "190", "last page": "209", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.089"}, {"title": "Endothelial-mesenchymal transition in cardiovascular diseases", "authors": "Piera-Velazquez, Sonsoles, Jimenez, Sergio A.", "journal": "Life Sciences", "year": "2019", "volumes": "226", "first page": "38", "last page": "52", "DOI": "10.1016/j.lfs.2019.04.001"}, {"title": "The role of endothelial to mesenchymal transition in cardiovascular disease", "authors": "Zeisberg, Elisabeth M., Potenta, Scott, Xie, Liang, Zeisberg, Michael, Kalluri, Raghu", "journal": "Circulation Research", "year": "2007", "volumes": "101", "first page": "943", "last page": "952", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.160440"}, {"title": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition in health and disease", "authors": "Medici, Damian, Potenta, Scott, Kalluri, Raghu", "journal": "Journal of Cell Science", "year": "2011", "volumes": "124", "first page": "3189", "last page": "3194", "DOI": "10.1242/jcs.096727"}, {"title": "Endothelial-mesenchymal transition in pulmonary hypertension", "authors": "Good, Robert B., Gilbane, Adrian J., Trinder, Sarah L., Denton, Christopher P., Coghlan, Gerry, Abraham, David J., Holmes, Alan M.", "journal": "Circulation", "year": "2015", "volumes": "131", "first page": "1006", "last page": "1018", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008750"}, {"title": "Endothelial-mesenchymal transition in atherosclerosis", "authors": "Chen, Peter Y., Qin, Lingfeng, Baeyens, Nicolas, Li, Guohong, Afolabi, Tolulope, Budatha, Madhusudhan, Tellides, George, Schwartz, Martin A., Simons, Michael", "journal": "Cardiovascular Research", "year": "2015", "volumes": "107", "first page": "377", "last page": "386", "DOI": "10.1093/cvr/cvv147"}, {"title": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition contributes to endothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus", "authors": "Li, Jing, Qu, Xinhua, Bertram, John F.", "journal": "American Journal of Pathology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "175", "first page": "2570", "last page": "2580", "DOI": "10.2353/ajpath.2009.090096"}, {"title": "Endothelial-mesenchymal transition in cardiac fibrosis", "authors": "Widyantoro, Bambang, Emoto, Noriaki, Nakayama, Kazuhiro, Anggrahini, Dwikora Novembri, Adiarto, Suko, Iwasa, Naoko, Yagi, Kenji, Miyagawa, Koichi, Rikitake, Yoshiyuki, Suzuki, Toru, Kisanuki, Yoshihiro Y., Yanagisawa, Masashi, Hirata, Ken-ichi", "journal": "Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "49", "first page": "275", "last page": "282", "DOI": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.04.019"}, {"title": "Endothelial-mesenchymal transition in development and disease", "authors": "Dejana, Elisabetta, Hirschi, Karen K., Simons, Michael", "journal": "Current Opinion in Cell Biology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "22", "first page": "302", "last page": "309", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ceb.2010.03.002"}, {"title": "Signaling pathways in endothelial to mesenchymal transition", "authors": "Sanchez-Duffhues, Gonzalo, Garcia de Vinuesa, Amaya, ten Dijke, Peter", "journal": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "3676", "last page": "3696", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms19113676"}]}
