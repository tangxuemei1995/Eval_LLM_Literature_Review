{"Literature Review": "The mammalian liver exhibits a remarkable capacity for regeneration, a process that has fascinated scientists and clinicians alike. This regenerative ability is crucial for maintaining liver function in the face of acute and chronic injuries, as well as after surgical interventions such as partial hepatectomy. The liver's regenerative capacity is underpinned by its complex cellular architecture and the dynamic interplay between different cell types, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and hepatic stellate cells, among others. Liver zonation, the spatial organization of metabolic functions across the liver lobule, plays a pivotal role in this process, ensuring that regeneration is both efficient and functional. The heterogeneity of liver cells, coupled with their plasticity, allows for the adaptation and response to various forms of injury, facilitating the restoration of liver mass and function. Acute injuries, such as those induced by toxins or viral infections, trigger a rapid proliferative response primarily from hepatocytes. In contrast, chronic injuries, which result from prolonged exposure to damaging agents or conditions, engage a more complex regenerative process involving the activation of progenitor cells and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Cellular plasticity, the ability of cells to change their phenotype in response to environmental cues, is a key feature of liver regeneration. This plasticity enables hepatocytes to dedifferentiate and proliferate, and in some cases, for other cell types to transdifferentiate into hepatocytes, thereby contributing to the regenerative process. The molecular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration involve a network of signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo, and Notch pathways, which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Understanding these mechanisms offers insights into potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing liver regeneration and treating liver diseases. The clinical application of liver regeneration is most evident in living donor liver transplantation, where the donor's liver regenerates to its original size, ensuring the health of both donor and recipient. This review highlights the multiple facets of cellular homeostasis and regeneration in the mammalian liver, emphasizing the importance of liver zonation, cellular heterogeneity, and plasticity in maintaining liver function and facilitating recovery from injury.", "References": [{"title": "Liver regeneration: biological and pathological mechanisms and implications", "authors": "Taub Rebecca", "journal": "Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "1", "first page": "199", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1038/nrgastro.2004.26"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of liver regeneration and their clinical implications", "authors": "Michalopoulos George K., DeFrances Marie C.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "1997", "volumes": "27", "first page": "239", "last page": "247", "DOI": "10.1016/S0168-8278(97)80309-5"}, {"title": "Liver zonation: Novel aspects of its regulation and its impact on homeostasis", "authors": "Gebhardt Rolf, Matz-Soja Madlen", "journal": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "20", "first page": "8491", "last page": "8504", "DOI": "10.3748/wjg.v20.i26.8491"}, {"title": "Cellular plasticity in liver regeneration: Spotlight on cholangiocytes", "authors": "Alvaro Domenico, Mancino Maria G.", "journal": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "14", "first page": "3533", "last page": "3539", "DOI": "10.3748/wjg.14.3533"}, {"title": "The role of hepatic stellate cells in liver regeneration", "authors": "Friedman Scott L.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "48", "first page": "S5", "last page": "S13", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2008.01.018"}, {"title": "Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver development, homeostasis, and pathobiology", "authors": "Thompson Michael D., Monga Satdarshan P.S.", "journal": "Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease", "year": "2007", "volumes": "2", "first page": "369", "last page": "396", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.092052"}, {"title": "Hippo pathway in organ size control, tissue homeostasis, and cancer", "authors": "Yu Fa-Xing, Guan Kun-Liang", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2013", "volumes": "153", "first page": "1194", "last page": "1217", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.001"}, {"title": "Notch signaling in liver development, homeostasis, and disease", "authors": "Zong Yuwen, Stanger Ben Z.", "journal": "Hepatology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "55", "first page": "965", "last page": "973", "DOI": "10.1002/hep.24814"}, {"title": "Liver regeneration after living donor liver transplantation", "authors": "Akamatsu Nobuhisa, Sugawara Yasuhiko, Kokudo Norihiro", "journal": "Liver Transplantation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "20", "first page": "S2", "last page": "S6", "DOI": "10.1002/lt.23950"}, {"title": "The role of cellular plasticity in liver repair and regeneration", "authors": "Duncan Andrew W., Dorrell Corinne, Grompe Markus", "journal": "Cell Stem Cell", "year": "2009", "volumes": "4", "first page": "153", "last page": "161", "DOI": "10.1016/j.stem.2009.01.006"}]}
