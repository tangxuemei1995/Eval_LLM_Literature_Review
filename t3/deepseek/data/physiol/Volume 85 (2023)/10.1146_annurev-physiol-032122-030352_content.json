{"Literature Review": "Fatty acids (FAs) play a pivotal role in cellular metabolism, serving not only as structural components of plasma membranes and efficient fuel sources but also as metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. The transport and signaling of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have significant physiological implications. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been associated with major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying FA transport and signaling. This literature review focuses on the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and signaling, specifically CD36 and the G protein–coupled FA receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4, and discusses their key signaling pathways and metabolic outcomes. CD36, also known as fatty acid translocase (FAT), is a multifunctional membrane glycoprotein that facilitates the uptake of LCFAs into cells. It is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, muscle, and heart, and plays a crucial role in FA metabolism. CD36-mediated FA uptake is essential for energy production through β-oxidation and for the synthesis of complex lipids. Moreover, CD36 has been implicated in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that CD36 deficiency leads to impaired FA uptake and utilization, contributing to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. On the other hand, overexpression of CD36 has been associated with increased FA uptake and storage, leading to lipid accumulation and metabolic dysfunction. The signaling pathways activated by CD36 involve the recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules, such as Src kinases and protein kinase C (PKC), which modulate various cellular processes, including nutrient uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation. In addition to CD36, the G protein–coupled FA receptors FFAR1 (GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) play significant roles in FA signaling. FFAR1 is primarily expressed in pancreatic β-cells and enteroendocrine cells, where it mediates the effects of LCFAs on insulin secretion and incretin hormone release. Activation of FFAR1 by LCFAs stimulates the Gq/11 signaling pathway, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels and enhanced insulin secretion. This mechanism has been exploited in the development of FFAR1 agonists as potential therapeutic agents for type 2 diabetes. FFAR4, on the other hand, is widely expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, macrophages, and the gastrointestinal tract, and is involved in the regulation of inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and energy homeostasis. Activation of FFAR4 by LCFAs triggers the Gq/11 and β-arrestin-2 signaling pathways, which modulate anti-inflammatory responses and improve insulin sensitivity. The anti-inflammatory effects of FFAR4 activation are particularly relevant in the context of obesity-related metabolic disorders, where chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, FFAR4 has been implicated in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, highlighting its role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The interplay between CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 in FA transport and signaling provides insight into the complex regulation of cell function by FAs. These receptors not only facilitate the uptake and utilization of FAs but also modulate various cellular processes through distinct signaling pathways. The parallels between the signaling mechanisms of CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 underscore the importance of FA signaling in the regulation of nutrient uptake and processing, cell proliferation and differentiation, and the secretion of bioactive factors. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying FA transport and signaling is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to combat metabolic disorders associated with impaired FA metabolism. In conclusion, CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 are key players in FA transport and signaling, with significant implications for cellular metabolism and physiological function. Further research is needed to elucidate the intricate signaling networks and regulatory mechanisms involving these receptors and to explore their potential as therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases.", "References": [{"title": "CD36 actions in the heart: Lipids, calcium, inflammation, repair and more?", "authors": "Glatz Jan F.C., Luiken Joost J.F.P., Bonen Arend", "journal": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids", "year": "2016", "volumes": "1861", "first page": "1442", "last page": "1449", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.03.015"}, {"title": "GPR40 (FFAR1) – Combined Gs and Gq signaling in vitro is associated with robust incretin secretagogue action ex vivo and in vivo", "authors": "Srivastava Ankit, Yano Junko, Hirozane Yoshihiko, Maruyama Toru, Nagai Yumiko, Nakamura Masaya, Matsuo Kenji, Takemoto Hiroyuki, Nishimura Akira, Akihisa Matsuyama", "journal": "Molecular Metabolism", "year": "2018", "volumes": "16", "first page": "45", "last page": "58", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molmet.2018.07.003"}, {"title": "The role of GPR120 (FFAR4) in the regulation of inflammation and insulin sensitivity", "authors": "Oh Da Young, Talukdar Saswata, Bae Eun Ju, Imamura Takeshi, Morinaga Hidetaka, Fan Wanqing, Li Pingping, Lu Wendell J., Watkins Steven M., Olefsky Jerrold M.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2010", "volumes": "466", "first page": "350", "last page": "354", "DOI": "10.1038/nature09198"}, {"title": "Fatty acid-induced mitochondrial uncoupling elicits inflammasome-independent IL-1α and sterile vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis", "authors": "Wen Hong, Gris Denis, Lei Yu, Jha Shruti, Zhang Lu, Huang Michael T.H., Brickey W.
