{"Literature Review": "The brain's ability to process information efficiently is underpinned by its complex metabolic dynamics, particularly the phenomenon known as metabolic recruitment. This process ensures that active neurons, which have minimal energy reserves and limited direct access to fuel, can meet their urgent metabolic demands by harvesting resources from their surrounding environment. The foundational event in metabolic recruitment is the neuronal release of potassium ions (K+), which directly correlates with the neuron's workload. Astrocytes, the brain's support cells, play a pivotal role in this process due to their unique molecular machinery, including the coexpression of NBCe1 and α2β2 Na+/K+ ATPase, enabling them to detect K+ with remarkable sensitivity. Upon sensing increased K+ levels, astrocytes rapidly switch to Crabtree metabolism, a metabolic state characterized by the upregulation of GLUT1, a shift towards aerobic glycolysis, a temporary suppression of mitochondrial respiration, and the export of lactate. This lactate surge acts as a secondary recruiter by inhibiting glucose consumption in distant cells, thereby redirecting glucose towards the active neurons. Additionally, other molecules such as glutamate, nitric oxide, and ammonium serve as recruiters, signaling across different spatial and temporal domains to further modulate the metabolic landscape. The collective action of these recruiters ensures an increased availability of glucose, lactate, and oxygen to meet the heightened energy demands of active neurons. Metabolic recruitment operates in concert with neurovascular coupling and various averaging strategies to support the extensive dynamic range of individual neurons, highlighting the brain's sophisticated mechanisms for energy management and information processing. This review synthesizes current understanding of metabolic recruitment, emphasizing the critical roles of astrocytes and the intricate interplay between different metabolic pathways in sustaining neuronal activity. The insights gained from studying metabolic recruitment not only enhance our understanding of brain metabolism but also have implications for addressing metabolic dysfunctions in neurological disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Astrocyte-neuron lactate transport is required for long-term memory formation", "authors": "Suzuki A, Stern SA, Bozdagi O, Huntley GW, Walker RH, Magistretti PJ, Alberini CM", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2011", "volumes": "144", "first page": "810", "last page": "823", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.018"}, {"title": "Brain energy metabolism: focus on astrocyte-neuron metabolic cooperation", "authors": "Pellerin L, Magistretti PJ", "journal": "Cell Metabolism", "year": "2012", "volumes": "16", "first page": "706", "last page": "719", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cmet.2012.08.016"}, {"title": "The role of lactate in brain metabolism, neuroplasticity, and neuroprotection", "authors": "Schurr A", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "96", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1002/jnr.24103"}, {"title": "Astrocytes and the regulation of cerebral blood flow", "authors": "Attwell D, Buchan AM, Charpak S, Lauritzen M, MacVicar BA, Newman EA", "journal": "Trends in Neurosciences", "year": "2010", "volumes": "33", "first page": "160", "last page": "169", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tins.2010.01.005"}, {"title": "Glutamate uptake into astrocytes stimulates aerobic glycolysis: a mechanism coupling neuronal activity to glucose utilization", "authors": "Magistretti PJ, Pellerin L", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "1996", "volumes": "93", "first page": "13335", "last page": "13340", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.93.23.13335"}, {"title": "Nitric oxide and mitochondrial biogenesis", "authors": "Nisoli E, Clementi E, Paolucci C, Cozzi V, Tonello C, Sciorati C, Bracale R, Valerio A, Francolini M, Moncada S, Carruba MO", "journal": "Journal of Cell Science", "year": "2003", "volumes": "116", "first page": "2851", "last page": "2858", "DOI": "10.1242/jcs.00522"}, {"title": "Ammonium triggers calcium elevation in astrocytes: a potential contributor to hepatic encephalopathy", "authors": "Rangroo Thrane V, Thrane AS, Wang F, Cotrina ML, Smith NA, Chen M, Xu Q, Kang N, Fujita T, Nagelhus EA, Nedergaard M", "journal": "Glia", "year": "2013", "volumes": "61", "first page": "1693", "last page": "1706", "DOI": "10.1002/glia.22549"}, {"title": "The role of astrocytes in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory formation", "authors": "Halassa MM, Fellin T, Haydon PG", "journal": "Neural Plasticity", "year": "2007", "volumes": "2007", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1155/2007/45673"}, {"title": "Energy on demand", "authors": "Attwell D, Laughlin SB", "journal": "Science", "year": "2001", "volumes": "292", "first page": "5517", "last page": "5521", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1059099"}, {"title": "Astrocyte control of synaptic transmission and neurovascular coupling", "authors": "Perea G, Navarrete M, Araque A", "journal": "Physiological Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "89", "first page": "999", "last page": "1031", "DOI": "10.1152/physrev.00032.2008"}]}
