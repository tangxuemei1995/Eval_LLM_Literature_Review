{"Literature Review": "The conversation with Sir Partha Dasgupta, as highlighted in the abstract, delves into the intricate relationship between biodiversity and economic theory, emphasizing the necessity of integrating ecological considerations into economic policy and growth models. This literature review aims to explore the themes discussed in the interview, supported by existing research and scholarly articles. Biodiversity, as a cornerstone of ecosystem services, plays a pivotal role in sustaining economic activities and human well-being. The degradation of biodiversity, therefore, poses significant risks to economic stability and growth. Dasgupta's emphasis on 'inclusive wealth' as a measure of economic progress that accounts for natural capital is a critical departure from traditional GDP-centric models. This approach aligns with the findings of Costanza et al. (1997), who argue for the valuation of ecosystem services in economic terms to ensure sustainable development. Furthermore, the concept of 'asset management' in the context of biodiversity underscores the importance of preserving natural assets for future generations, a theme echoed in the work of Arrow et al. (2004), who discuss the implications of biodiversity loss for intergenerational equity. The integration of biodiversity into economic theory also necessitates a reevaluation of growth models. As highlighted by Dasgupta, traditional models often overlook the ecological limits to growth, a critique supported by Rockström et al. (2009), who propose the concept of planetary boundaries to define a safe operating space for humanity. The conversation also touches upon the role of policy in addressing biodiversity loss. Effective policy measures, as discussed by TEEB (2010), require a comprehensive understanding of the economic value of biodiversity and the implementation of incentives for conservation. Moreover, the importance of global cooperation in biodiversity conservation is emphasized, a point reinforced by Barrett (2003), who examines the challenges of international environmental agreements. The interview with Dasgupta also highlights the need for interdisciplinary research to bridge the gap between economics and ecology. This call for interdisciplinary approaches is supported by Daily et al. (2000), who advocate for the integration of ecological and economic perspectives in policy-making. Additionally, the role of technological innovation in mitigating biodiversity loss is discussed, with reference to the potential of green technologies to reduce environmental impacts, a theme explored by Jaffe et al. (2005). In conclusion, the conversation with Sir Partha Dasgupta underscores the critical importance of biodiversity for economic theory and policy. The integration of ecological considerations into economic models, the valuation of natural capital, and the implementation of effective policy measures are essential for sustainable development. The themes discussed in the interview are supported by a wealth of scholarly research, highlighting the need for continued interdisciplinary collaboration to address the challenges of biodiversity loss.", "References": [{"title": "The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital", "authors": "Robert Costanza, Ralph d'Arge, Rudolf de Groot, Stephen Farber, Monica Grasso, Bruce Hannon, Karin Limburg, Shahid Naeem, Robert V.
