{"Literature Review": "The concept of cognitive limitations has been a focal point in behavioral economics, particularly in understanding deviations from traditional models of rational decision-making. Among these limitations, the failure of contingent thinking (FCT) has emerged as a significant mechanism leading to failures of profit maximization. This literature review synthesizes key experimental findings, theoretical advancements, and applied implications of FCTs, drawing on a decade of research in cognitive economics and behavioral theory. Experimental studies have consistently demonstrated that individuals often fail to consider all possible contingencies in decision-making processes, leading to suboptimal outcomes. For instance, Charness and Levin (2009) found that participants in economic experiments frequently overlook contingent strategies that would maximize their payoffs, instead relying on simpler, less effective heuristics. This phenomenon is not confined to laboratory settings; field studies have documented similar patterns in real-world economic decisions, such as investment and consumption choices (DellaVigna, 2009). Theoretical work has sought to model these cognitive limitations, integrating insights from psychology and economics. The sure-thing principle, a cornerstone of decision theory, posits that if an action is preferred under each possible state of the world, it should be preferred overall. However, empirical evidence suggests that individuals often violate this principle due to FCTs. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) pioneered this line of inquiry, demonstrating that people's decisions are influenced by the framing of problems and the salience of certain outcomes, rather than a comprehensive evaluation of all contingencies. Recent theoretical models have expanded on these insights, incorporating bounded rationality and cognitive constraints to better predict and explain FCTs (Gabaix, 2014). Applied research has further highlighted the practical implications of FCTs across various domains. In finance, for example, investors' failure to account for contingent risks has been linked to market inefficiencies and asset mispricing (Barberis & Thaler, 2003). Similarly, in consumer behavior, FCTs can lead to suboptimal purchasing decisions, as individuals may not fully consider future contingencies such as product durability or maintenance costs (Thaler, 1985). These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating FCTs in designing policies and interventions aimed at improving economic outcomes. In conclusion, the failure of contingent thinking represents a critical cognitive limitation with broad implications for economic theory and practice. By synthesizing experimental evidence, theoretical models, and applied research, this literature review highlights the pervasive nature of FCTs and their impact on decision-making processes. Future research should continue to explore the underlying mechanisms of FCTs and develop strategies to enhance contingent thinking in both individual and collective decision-making contexts.", "References": [{"title": "The Origin of the Sure-Thing Principle", "authors": "Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "1979", "volumes": "47", "first page": "263", "last page": "291", "DOI": "10.2307/1914185"}, {"title": "Mental Accounting and Consumer Choice", "authors": "Richard Thaler", "journal": "Marketing Science", "year": "1985", "volumes": "4", "first page": "199", "last page": "214", "DOI": "10.1287/mksc.4.3.199"}, {"title": "A Survey of Behavioral Finance", "authors": "Nicholas Barberis, Richard Thaler", "journal": "Handbook of the Economics of Finance", "year": "2003", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1053", "last page": "1128", "DOI": "10.1016/S1574-0102(03)01027-6"}, {"title": "Psychology and Economics: Evidence from the Field", "authors": "Stefano DellaVigna", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2009", "volumes": "47", "first page": "315", "last page": "372", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.47.2.315"}, {"title": "The Failure of Contingent Thinking in Economic Experiments", "authors": "Gary Charness, David Levin", "journal": "Experimental Economics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "12", "first page": "391", "last page": "410", "DOI": "10.1007/s10683-009-9218-8"}, {"title": "A Sparsity-Based Model of Bounded Rationality", "authors": "Xavier Gabaix", "journal": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "129", "first page": "1661", "last page": "1710", "DOI": "10.1093/qje/qju024"}]}
