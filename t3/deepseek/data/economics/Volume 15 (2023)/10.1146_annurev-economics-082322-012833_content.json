{"Literature Review": "The study of microeconomic shocks and their aggregation and propagation in general equilibrium has been a central theme in economic research. This literature review synthesizes key findings and theoretical advancements in understanding how microeconomic shocks affect aggregate measures of real economic activity, such as real GDP, real domestic absorption, and aggregate productivity. The framework for analyzing these phenomena is applicable across various scales, from individual producers to entire economies, and encompasses both efficient and inefficient environments. A critical aspect of this framework is its ability to elucidate the transmission mechanisms of shocks through prices and quantities across different sets of producers. This review also highlights the role of production networks in the propagation of shocks and the implications for aggregate productivity and economic comovement. Furthermore, it explores the concept of misallocation and its impact on aggregate economic outcomes. The literature underscores the importance of understanding the determinants of aggregate measures of economic activity and the pathways through which microeconomic shocks are transmitted and aggregated. This review concludes by identifying applied questions that can be addressed using the analytical tools discussed and suggests avenues for future research in this area.", "References": [{"title": "The Granular Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations", "authors": "Xavier Gabaix", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2011", "volumes": "79", "first page": "733", "last page": "772", "DOI": "10.3982/ECTA8769"}, {"title": "Input Specificity and the Propagation of Idiosyncratic Shocks in Production Networks", "authors": "Daron Acemoglu, Vasco M.
