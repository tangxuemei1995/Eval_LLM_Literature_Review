{"Literature Review": "The landscape of global finance has undergone significant transformation over the past two decades, with non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) emerging as a pivotal force in the allocation of international capital flows. This shift has been particularly pronounced in the context of emerging markets, where investment funds, including open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have become a dominant source of external financing. According to recent studies, these funds now account for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, surpassing traditional cross-border lending by global banks (Cerutti et al., 2017). This evolution in financial intermediation has facilitated enhanced risk sharing across borders and provided emerging markets with access to a more diversified array of financing options (Rey, 2015). However, the growing reliance on investment funds has also introduced new vulnerabilities, particularly in the face of global financial market stress. Research indicates that investment funds are inherently more susceptible to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of heightened global uncertainty, which can exacerbate the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets (Forbes & Warnock, 2012). The phenomenon of benchmark-driven investments, particularly passive funds, has been identified as a key factor amplifying these vulnerabilities. Passive funds, which track specific indices, appear to be especially sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts (Raddatz et al., 2017). This sensitivity can lead to procyclical investment behaviors, where fund flows to emerging markets increase during periods of global financial stability but rapidly reverse in times of stress, thereby posing significant financial stability concerns (Broner et al., 2013). The implications of these dynamics for macroprudential policy are profound. Policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need to develop regulatory frameworks that can mitigate the risks associated with NBFI, particularly in the context of emerging markets. This includes the implementation of measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of investment funds to liquidity shocks, as well as the development of tools to monitor and manage the procyclicality of capital flows (Claessens et al., 2018). Furthermore, the role of global risk factors, such as US dollar funding conditions, in driving investment fund flows to emerging markets underscores the importance of international coordination in the design and implementation of macroprudential policies (Bruno & Shin, 2015). In conclusion, while the rise of NBFI has provided emerging markets with new opportunities for financing and risk sharing, it has also introduced significant challenges in terms of financial stability. Addressing these challenges will require a nuanced understanding of the dynamics of investment fund flows, as well as the development of comprehensive policy frameworks that can effectively mitigate the risks associated with NBFI in the context of global financial markets.", "References": [{"title": "The Drivers of Capital Flows in Emerging Markets Post Global Financial Crisis", "authors": "Eugenio Cerutti, Stijn Claessens, Damien Puy", "journal": "Journal of International Money and Finance", "year": "2017", "volumes": "74", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jimonfin.2017.02.004"}, {"title": "Dilemma not Trilemma: The Global Financial Cycle and Monetary Policy Independence", "authors": "Hélène Rey", "journal": "NBER Working Paper", "year": "2015", "volumes": "21162", "first page": "1", "last page": "37", "DOI": "10.3386/w21162"}, {"title": "Capital Flow Waves: Surges, Stops, Flight, and Retrenchment", "authors": "Kristin J.
