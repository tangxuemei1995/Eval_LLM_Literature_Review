{"Literature Review": "The integration of text algorithms into economics has revolutionized the way researchers analyze and interpret textual data. This literature review explores the methodologies and applications of text algorithms in economics, focusing on their contributions, empirical tasks, and current limitations. The first significant contribution of text algorithms in economics is the representation of documents as high-dimensional count vectors over vocabulary terms. This approach, often referred to as the 'bag of words' model, has been foundational in text-as-data research. Gentzkow, Kelly, and Taddy (2019) discuss how this method allows for the quantitative analysis of textual data, enabling economists to measure and compare the content of documents across different contexts. Another critical advancement is the representation of words as vectors, known as word embeddings. Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, and Dean (2013) introduced the Word2Vec model, which captures the semantic relationships between words, allowing for more nuanced analysis of textual data. Furthermore, the representation of word sequences as embedding vectors, particularly through transformer models like BERT (Devlin, Chang, Lee, and Toutanova, 2019), has enabled the analysis of context-dependent meanings in text, offering deeper insights into economic documents. The second contribution of text algorithms in economics is the definition of four core empirical tasks: classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Classification tasks involve assigning documents to predefined categories, a method extensively used in sentiment analysis and topic classification. Regression tasks, on the other hand, predict continuous outcomes based on textual data, such as forecasting economic indicators from news articles. Clustering tasks group similar documents together, facilitating the discovery of underlying themes or topics in large datasets. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003), help in identifying the latent structure in text data, making it easier to analyze and interpret. Despite these advancements, the current literature faces several limitations, particularly in validating algorithmic output. The challenge of ensuring that text algorithms accurately capture the intended economic phenomena is significant. Moreover, the interpretability of complex models like transformer models remains a concern, as their 'black-box' nature can obscure the reasoning behind their predictions. Future research should focus on developing more transparent and interpretable models, as well as establishing robust validation frameworks to ensure the reliability of text-as-data analyses in economics.", "References": [{"title": "Text as Data", "authors": "Matthew Gentzkow, Bryan Kelly, Matt Taddy", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "57", "first page": "535", "last page": "574", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.20181020"}, {"title": "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space", "authors": "Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, Jeffrey Dean", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.3781", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding", "authors": "Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Latent Dirichlet Allocation", "authors": "David M.
