{"Literature Review": "The concept of Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) has emerged as a pivotal strategy in the global effort to mitigate climate change, particularly in addressing the issue of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs when there is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in one country as a result of an emissions reduction policy in another country, often due to the relocation of carbon-intensive industries to regions with less stringent environmental regulations. This phenomenon undermines global efforts to reduce emissions and highlights the need for mechanisms like BCA to ensure that carbon pricing policies are effective across borders. The rationale behind BCA is to level the playing field by imposing a cost on the carbon content of imported goods equivalent to that faced by domestic producers, thereby preventing the shift of emissions rather than their reduction. The design and implementation of BCA mechanisms, however, present a complex challenge that involves balancing environmental effectiveness, economic competitiveness, technical feasibility, and compliance with international trade laws. Studies have shown that an import-limited BCA can be more effective in reducing carbon leakage compared to other measures such as free emissions allowances. However, it does not address the issue of export competitiveness, which remains a significant concern for countries implementing such policies. The effectiveness of BCA in reducing global emissions also depends on its acceptance and adoption by a critical mass of countries, leading to the concept of 'climate clubs' where groups of countries agree to implement similar carbon pricing mechanisms. The compatibility of BCA with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is another critical aspect, as any form of trade restriction must comply with international trade laws to avoid disputes. The literature suggests that a well-designed BCA can be compatible with WTO rules if it is applied in a non-discriminatory manner and is based on the carbon content of products rather than their origin. The economic impacts of BCA are multifaceted, affecting not only the competitiveness of domestic industries but also the global trade patterns and the distribution of carbon emissions. While BCA can provide an incentive for countries to adopt more stringent climate policies, it can also lead to trade tensions and retaliatory measures if not implemented carefully. The technical feasibility of implementing BCA is another area of concern, as it requires accurate measurement of the carbon content of imported goods, which can be challenging given the complexity of global supply chains. Despite these challenges, the potential of BCA to contribute to global emissions reduction efforts makes it a critical area of research and policy development. As the international community continues to seek effective solutions to climate change, the role of BCA in achieving a balance between environmental protection and economic competitiveness will remain a key focus of discussion.", "References": [{"title": "Border Carbon Adjustments: A Feasibility Assessment and Framework for International Cooperation", "authors": "Joseph E.
