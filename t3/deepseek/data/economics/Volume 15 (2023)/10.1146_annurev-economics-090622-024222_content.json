{"Literature Review": "The digital age has ushered in unprecedented challenges and opportunities for industrial competition, particularly in the context of tech giants' dominance. This literature review explores the evolving landscape of competition, regulation, and industrial policy, drawing on recent scholarly work to understand the dynamics at play and to consider pathways for reform. The dominance of tech giants has sparked a vigorous debate on the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks to ensure fair competition and contestability in the digital marketplace. Traditional antitrust laws, designed for a pre-digital era, are increasingly seen as ill-equipped to address the unique challenges posed by digital platforms, including network effects, data monopolies, and the rapid pace of technological change (Khan, 2017). This has led to calls for a reimagining of antitrust principles to better capture the nuances of digital markets and to prevent anti-competitive practices that stifle innovation and harm consumers. One area of focus has been the role of mergers and acquisitions in consolidating market power among tech giants. Critics argue that the current merger review process often underestimates the long-term competitive harm of such transactions, particularly in fast-evolving digital markets (Crémer, de Montjoye, & Schweitzer, 2019). This has prompted suggestions for more stringent scrutiny of mergers, including the consideration of potential competition and innovation effects. Another critical issue is the concept of fairness in the digital economy. The concentration of market power in the hands of a few platforms raises concerns about equitable access to digital markets for smaller players and the potential for discriminatory practices (Stucke & Ezrachi, 2020). This has led to proposals for regulatory interventions aimed at leveling the playing field, such as data portability and interoperability requirements, and the establishment of digital market regulators with the authority to enforce these rules. The debate also extends to the role of industrial policy in fostering a competitive and innovative digital economy. Some scholars argue for a more active role of the state in supporting the development of digital infrastructure, promoting digital skills, and investing in research and development to ensure that the benefits of the digital revolution are widely shared (Mazzucato, 2018). This includes the consideration of public options in digital services to provide competition to dominant platforms and to safeguard public interests. In conclusion, the digital age presents complex challenges for competition policy and industrial strategy. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that updates antitrust laws for the digital era, ensures fairness and contestability in digital markets, and leverages industrial policy to promote innovation and inclusivity. The literature suggests that a balanced approach, combining regulatory interventions with support for competition and innovation, is essential to harness the benefits of the digital economy while mitigating its risks.", "References": [{"title": "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox", "authors": "Lina M.
