{"Literature Review": "Gender differences in negotiation have been extensively documented in the literature, with a significant body of research indicating that these differences contribute to the persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes, particularly in terms of pay equity. This literature review explores the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at reducing these disparities by either encouraging women to negotiate more like men or by altering the conditions under which negotiations occur. The shift from focusing on changing individual behavior to modifying institutional practices reflects a broader understanding of the complexities involved in achieving gender equity in the workplace. Early interventions primarily focused on encouraging women to adopt negotiation strategies traditionally used by men, under the assumption that this would help close the gender pay gap. However, research has shown that such approaches often fail to account for the societal and organizational biases that women face, leading to limited success in achieving pay equity. For example, negotiation training programs designed to 'lean in' and encourage women to negotiate more assertively have been critiqued for not addressing the underlying structural barriers that women encounter. In response, there has been a growing emphasis on institutional changes that aim to create a more equitable negotiation environment. These include banning negotiations altogether, prohibiting requests for salary history, and improving wage transparency. Studies have found that such measures can be more effective in reducing the gender pay gap by leveling the playing field and mitigating the impact of implicit biases. For instance, the implementation of salary history bans has been associated with a reduction in the gender pay gap, as it prevents the perpetuation of past inequities. Similarly, increasing wage transparency has been shown to empower women to negotiate more effectively by providing them with the information needed to advocate for fair compensation. However, it is important to note that these interventions can also have unintended consequences. For example, banning negotiations may lead to a decrease in overall compensation if employers are not required to offer competitive salaries. Additionally, while wage transparency can empower employees, it may also lead to increased tension and dissatisfaction if not implemented carefully. In conclusion, the literature suggests that interventions aimed at reducing gender differences in negotiation are most effective when they focus on altering the conditions of the negotiation rather than solely encouraging women to change their behavior. By addressing the structural and institutional barriers that contribute to the gender pay gap, these interventions offer a more promising path toward achieving pay equity. However, careful consideration must be given to the potential unintended consequences of such measures to ensure that they do not inadvertently exacerbate existing inequalities.", "References": [{"title": "Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide", "authors": "Linda Babcock, Sara Laschever", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Gender Gap in Top Corporate Jobs", "authors": "Marianne Bertrand, Kevin F.
