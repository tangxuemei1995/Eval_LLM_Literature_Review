{"Literature Review": "The economic relationship between the United States and China has been a focal point of international trade studies over the past two decades. This literature review synthesizes theoretical and empirical research on the economic effects of US-China trade relations, with a particular emphasis on the 'China shock' and the recent US-China trade war. The 'China shock' refers to the rapid increase in Chinese exports to the United States following China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. This event has been extensively studied to understand its impact on various economic outcomes, including manufacturing employment, wage inequality, and regional economic disparities in the United States. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) provided seminal empirical evidence on the adverse effects of the China shock on US manufacturing employment, highlighting significant job losses in industries exposed to Chinese import competition. However, subsequent research has nuanced this view. Pierce and Schott (2016) argued that the decline in US manufacturing employment was also influenced by other factors, such as technological advancements and changes in consumer preferences, suggesting that China's trade expansion was not the sole driver. The methods used to study the economic effects of the China shock have evolved over time. Early studies relied on cross-sectional data and simple regression models, but more recent research has employed advanced econometric techniques, such as instrumental variables and difference-in-differences approaches, to address endogeneity and causality concerns. Acemoglu et al. (2016) utilized input-output linkages to trace the indirect effects of Chinese imports on upstream and downstream industries, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the China shock's impact. The recent US-China trade war, initiated in 2018, has introduced a new dimension to the study of US-China trade relations. Researchers have sought to evaluate the economic effects of the trade war, focusing on its impact on welfare, employment, and the distributional consequences of trade protectionism. Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) developed a general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare losses resulting from the trade war, estimating that the US and China both experienced significant reductions in real income. Moreover, the trade war's employment effects have been relatively small, as documented by Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019), who found that the tariffs imposed during the trade war had limited impact on overall employment levels in the United States. One of the key questions addressed in the literature is whether the trade war has been effective in reversing the distributional effects of the China shock. The evidence suggests that the trade war has not achieved this objective. Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Majlesi (2020) found that the tariffs imposed during the trade war did not significantly alter the geographic distribution of economic activity in the United States, indicating that the trade war was ineffective in mitigating the regional disparities caused by the China shock. In summary, the literature on US-China trade relations highlights several important lessons. First, the aggregate gains from US-China trade have created both winners and losers, with some industries and regions benefiting from increased trade while others have suffered from import competition. Second, China's trade expansion is not the primary cause of the decline in US manufacturing employment, as other factors have also played a significant role. Third, the recent US-China trade war has resulted in welfare losses, had limited employment effects, and failed to reverse the distributional consequences of the China shock. These findings underscore the complexity of US-China trade relations and the need for nuanced policy responses to address the challenges posed by globalization.", "References": [{"title": "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States", "authors": "David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon Hanson", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2013", "volumes": "103", "first page": "2121", "last page": "2168", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.103.6.2121"}, {"title": "The Surprisingly Swift Decline of U.S. Manufacturing Employment", "authors": "Justin Pierce, Peter Schott", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2016", "volumes": "106", "first page": "1632", "last page": "1662", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.20131578"}, {"title": "Import Competition and the Great U.S. Employment Sag of the 2000s", "authors": "Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon Hanson, Brendan Price", "journal": "Journal of Labor Economics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "34", "first page": "S141", "last page": "S198", "DOI": "10.1086/682384"}, {"title": "The Return to Protectionism", "authors": "Pablo Fajgelbaum, Pinelopi Goldberg, Patrick Kennedy, Amit Khandelwal", "journal": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "135", "first page": "1", "last page": "55", "DOI": "10.1093/qje/qjz036"}, {"title": "The Impact of the 2018 Tariffs on Prices and Welfare", "authors": "Mary Amiti, Stephen Redding, David Weinstein", "journal": "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "year": "2019", "volumes": "33", "first page": "187", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1257/jep.33.4.187"}, {"title": "The China Shock: Learning from Labor Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade", "authors": "David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon Hanson, Kaveh Majlesi", "journal": "Annual Review of Economics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "12", "first page": "205", "last page": "240", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-economics-070119-024841"}]}
