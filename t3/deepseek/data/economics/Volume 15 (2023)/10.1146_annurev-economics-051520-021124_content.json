{"Literature Review": "The concept of partial identification has emerged as a pivotal framework in econometrics and statistics, addressing the limitations of traditional identification strategies in uncovering the exact values of parameters of interest. This literature review delves into the recent developments in partial identification, focusing on the methodologies for characterizing identified sets and their applications in various empirical contexts. The foundational premise of partial identification is that, in many empirically relevant scenarios, it is not feasible to pinpoint the exact value of a parameter due to inherent uncertainties or model limitations. Instead, researchers can delineate a set of values within which the parameter must lie, given the data and model assumptions. This approach has been particularly useful in the analysis of treatment effects, where the exact impact of an intervention may be obscured by unobserved heterogeneity or selection bias. Recent advancements in the field have introduced sophisticated frameworks for conducting partial identification analysis. These include the use of shape restrictions and optimizing behavior to tighten the bounds on the identified set, thereby enhancing the precision of the inferences drawn. Shape restrictions, for instance, leverage prior knowledge about the functional form of the relationship between variables to impose constraints on the possible values of the parameter. Optimizing behavior, on the other hand, incorporates assumptions about the decision-making processes of agents to further refine the identified set. The literature has also seen a surge in the application of partial identification techniques to a wide array of empirical questions, ranging from the evaluation of policy interventions to the estimation of demand elasticities. These applications underscore the versatility and robustness of partial identification as a tool for empirical research. Moreover, the development of computational algorithms and software packages has facilitated the implementation of partial identification methods, making them more accessible to researchers. In conclusion, the field of partial identification continues to evolve, offering powerful tools for addressing the challenges of empirical research in the presence of uncertainty and model limitations. The recent developments surveyed in this review highlight the ongoing efforts to refine the methodologies for characterizing identified sets and to expand the scope of their applications. As the literature progresses, it is anticipated that partial identification will play an increasingly central role in the empirical sciences, providing a rigorous foundation for inference in complex and uncertain environments.", "References": [{"title": "Partial Identification in Econometrics", "authors": "Charles Manski", "journal": "Annual Review of Economics", "year": "2003", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "27", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.economics.1.1.1"}, {"title": "Identification for Prediction and Decision", "authors": "Charles Manski", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Sharp Bounds on Causal Effects under Sample Selection", "authors": "Charles Manski, John Pepper", "journal": "Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics", "year": "2000", "volumes": "62", "first page": "5", "last page": "34", "DOI": "10.1111/1468-0084.00161"}, {"title": "Nonparametric Bounds on Treatment Effects", "authors": "Charles Manski", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "1990", "volumes": "80", "first page": "319", "last page": "323", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Probability Distributions", "authors": "Charles Manski", "journal": "Springer", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Bounds on Treatment Effects from Studies with Imperfect Compliance", "authors": "Charles Manski, Elie Tamer", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2002", "volumes": "97", "first page": "149", "last page": "157", "DOI": "10.1198/016214502753479275"}, {"title": "Inference on Counterfactual Distributions", "authors": "Victor Chernozhukov, Ivan Fernandez-Val, Blaise Melly", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2013", "volumes": "81", "first page": "2205", "last page": "2268", "DOI": "10.3982/ECTA10582"}, {"title": "Shape Restrictions, Inequalities and Measurement Error", "authors": "Joel Horowitz, Charles Manski", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B", "year": "1995", "volumes": "57", "first page": "31", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02016.x"}, {"title": "Optimizing Behavior and Econometric Models", "authors": "Gary Chamberlain", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "1984", "volumes": "52", "first page": "1241", "last page": "1260", "DOI": "10.2307/1910991"}, {"title": "Partial Identification in Econometrics: A Review", "authors": "Elie Tamer", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2010", "volumes": "48", "first page": "175", "last page": "212", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.48.1.175"}]}
