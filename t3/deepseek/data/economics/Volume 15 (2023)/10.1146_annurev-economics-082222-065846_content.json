{"Literature Review": "The exploration of dynamic causal effects in economics has traditionally been bifurcated into two distinct approaches: the time series methods prevalent in macroeconomics and the treatment effect analysis common in microeconometrics. Local projections (LPs) have emerged as a pivotal methodology that bridges these two literatures, offering a unified framework for estimating the dynamic effects of interventions across different contexts. This literature review delves into the conceptual underpinnings of local projections, their methodological advantages, and their application in both macro- and microeconomic research, highlighting the potential for further integration and innovation in the field. Local projections, introduced by Jordà (2005), provide a flexible alternative to vector autoregressions (VARs) for estimating impulse response functions. Unlike VARs, which require the specification of a full dynamic model, LPs estimate the response of an outcome variable to a shock directly, period by period, using a series of separate regressions. This approach not only simplifies the estimation process but also allows for greater flexibility in modeling nonlinearities and structural breaks (Jordà, 2005). The adaptability of LPs has made them particularly useful in macroeconomic research, where they have been employed to study the effects of monetary policy shocks, fiscal policy interventions, and other macroeconomic phenomena (Ramey, 2016; Stock & Watson, 2018). In the realm of microeconometrics, local projections have been increasingly adopted to estimate treatment effects in panel data settings. By framing the estimation of dynamic treatment effects in terms of potential outcomes, LPs facilitate the application of causal inference techniques developed in the microeconometrics literature to time series and panel data (Athey & Imbens, 2018). This has opened new avenues for research in labor economics, development economics, and other fields where understanding the temporal evolution of treatment effects is crucial (Callaway & Sant'Anna, 2021). The integration of local projections into both macro- and microeconomic research has yielded significant methodological and empirical insights. For instance, the use of LPs has highlighted the importance of considering the timing and persistence of policy interventions, as well as the potential for heterogeneous effects across different groups or contexts (Montiel Olea & Plagborg-Møller, 2019). Moreover, the flexibility of LPs has encouraged the development of new econometric techniques, such as the use of machine learning algorithms for model selection and the incorporation of high-dimensional controls (Chernozhukov et al., 2018). Despite these advances, several challenges and opportunities for further research remain. One area of ongoing debate is the optimal choice of horizon for local projections, as the trade-off between bias and variance can vary depending on the specific application (Plagborg-Møller & Wolf, 2021). Additionally, the integration of LPs with other econometric methods, such as structural VARs and synthetic control methods, offers promising avenues for enhancing the robustness and interpretability of causal estimates (Kaul et al., 2021). In conclusion, local projections have significantly contributed to the convergence of macro- and microeconomic research by providing a versatile tool for estimating dynamic causal effects. As the methodology continues to evolve, it holds the potential to further bridge the gap between these two literatures, fostering a more integrated and comprehensive approach to economic analysis.", "References": [{"title": "Estimation and Inference of Impulse Responses by Local Projections", "authors": "Òscar Jordà", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2005", "volumes": "95", "first page": "161", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1257/0002828053828518"}, {"title": "Macroeconomic Shocks and Their Propagation", "authors": "Valerie A.
