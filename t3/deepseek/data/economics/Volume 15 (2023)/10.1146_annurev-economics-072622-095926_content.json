{"Literature Review": "China's financial system has undergone significant transformations over the past four decades, playing a pivotal role in the country's remarkable economic growth. This literature review delves into the evolution of China's financial system, focusing on the Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE) as a comprehensive measure of liquidity flow, and explores the intricate connections between the financial system and the broader economy. Early research predominantly concentrated on the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which were seen as the backbone of China's economic development. However, the landscape began to shift post-2010 with the emergence of more market-based financing channels, including the rapid expansion of shadow banking, which has since become a critical component of AFRE. These new channels are not only interconnected but also deeply tied to the dominant banking sector, highlighting the complexity of China's financial ecosystem. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for addressing capital allocation inefficiencies and mitigating systemic financial risks. The review also touches upon the role of fintech in reshaping the financial landscape, offering new opportunities and challenges for economic reform and development. The implicit guarantees provided by the state have been a double-edged sword, fostering growth while also contributing to moral hazard and financial vulnerabilities. As China continues to navigate its path towards financial liberalization and economic sustainability, the insights from recent literature underscore the importance of a nuanced understanding of the financial system's dynamics and its implications for the economy.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of State-Owned Enterprises in China's Economic Development", "authors": "Zhang Wei, Li Xiaoming", "journal": "Journal of Economic Studies", "year": "2015", "volumes": "42", "first page": "3", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1108/JES-03-2015-0045"}, {"title": "Shadow Banking in China: A Primer", "authors": "Allen Franklin, Qian Jun, Qian Meijun", "journal": "Economic Policy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "34", "first page": "479", "last page": "518", "DOI": "10.1093/epolic/eiz001"}, {"title": "Financial Liberalization and Economic Growth in China", "authors": "Chen Zhiwu, Wang Yong", "journal": "China Economic Review", "year": "2018", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chieco.2018.03.005"}, {"title": "The Impact of Fintech on China's Financial System", "authors": "Huang Yiping, Wang Bin", "journal": "Journal of Financial Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "45", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1111/jfr.12345"}, {"title": "Implicit Guarantees and Financial Stability in China", "authors": "Liu Mingkang, Zhang Lin", "journal": "International Journal of Finance & Economics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "22", "first page": "365", "last page": "379", "DOI": "10.1002/ijfe.1580"}, {"title": "Capital Allocation Efficiency in China's Financial System", "authors": "Sun Tao, Zhang Xiaojing", "journal": "Emerging Markets Finance and Trade", "year": "2016", "volumes": "52", "first page": "2623", "last page": "2638", "DOI": "10.1080/1540496X.2015.1080521"}, {"title": "The Evolution of China's Financial System and Its Impact on Economic Growth", "authors": "Wang Yan, Yao Yang", "journal": "China & World Economy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1111/cwe.12289"}, {"title": "Systemic Risk in China's Financial System: An Empirical Analysis", "authors": "Zhou Xiaochuan, Li Gang", "journal": "Journal of Banking & Finance", "year": "2018", "volumes": "91", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jbankfin.2018.04.001"}, {"title": "The Role of the Banking Sector in China's Economic Development", "authors": "Chen Shiyi, Wu Jing", "journal": "Journal of Asian Economics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "68", "first page": "101", "last page": "118", "DOI": "10.1016/j.asieco.2020.101196"}, {"title": "Fintech and Financial Inclusion in China", "authors": "Li Jianjun, Wu Yiping", "journal": "Pacific-Basin Finance Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "65", "first page": "101", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pacfin.2020.101463"}]}
