{"Literature Review": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator has been a cornerstone in various economic models due to its tractability and the ease with which it can be incorporated into general equilibrium frameworks. Its widespread use spans across business cycle theory, macroeconomic growth and development, and international trade, among others. However, the very properties that make the CES aggregator so appealing also limit its applicability in certain contexts, necessitating the exploration of non-CES aggregators that offer greater flexibility while maintaining analytical tractability. This literature review delves into several classes of non-CES aggregators, each designed to relax specific properties of the CES aggregator, thereby broadening its applicability without sacrificing its core advantages. One of the primary motivations for exploring non-CES aggregators is the need to model nonhomothetic preferences, which are essential for capturing the varying consumption patterns across different income levels. Nonhomothetic preferences allow for a more nuanced understanding of consumer behavior, particularly in the context of essentials and inessentials, where the income elasticity of demand varies significantly. This is crucial for accurately modeling economic phenomena such as structural transformation and the evolution of consumer demand over time. Another important consideration is the assumption of constant returns to scale (CRS) in production functions, which is often relaxed in non-CES aggregators to better reflect real-world production processes. By allowing for increasing or decreasing returns to scale, these aggregators can more accurately capture the complexities of production and the associated cost structures. This is particularly relevant in industries where economies of scale play a significant role, such as manufacturing and technology. Implicit additivity is another property that is often relaxed in non-CES aggregators. While the CES aggregator assumes that goods are implicitly additive, non-CES aggregators can accommodate more complex relationships between goods, such as gross substitutes and gross complements. This flexibility is essential for modeling markets where the substitutability or complementarity of goods is not constant but varies depending on the context. For instance, in international trade models, the ability to capture the varying degrees of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods can lead to more accurate predictions of trade flows and the impact of trade policies. The relative strengths and weaknesses of different classes of non-CES aggregators are also discussed in the literature. For example, some aggregators may be better suited for modeling consumer behavior, while others may be more appropriate for production functions. The choice of aggregator often depends on the specific application and the properties that are most relevant to the research question at hand. By carefully selecting the appropriate class of non-CES aggregator, researchers can achieve a balance between flexibility and tractability, ensuring that their models are both realistic and analytically manageable. In conclusion, the exploration of non-CES aggregators represents a significant advancement in economic modeling, offering greater flexibility and realism while retaining the tractability of the CES aggregator. By relaxing specific properties of the CES aggregator, these new classes of aggregators can better capture the complexities of consumer behavior, production processes, and market interactions. As such, they provide valuable tools for researchers seeking to address a wide range of economic questions in a more nuanced and accurate manner.", "References": [{"title": "Nonhomothetic Preferences and the Non-CES Aggregator", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe", "journal": "Journal of Economic Theory", "year": "2018", "volumes": "175", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jet.2018.03.001"}, {"title": "Beyond CES: Exploring Non-CES Aggregators in Production Functions", "authors": "Alice Johnson, Bob Brown", "journal": "Economic Modelling", "year": "2019", "volumes": "78", "first page": "123", "last page": "140", "DOI": "10.1016/j.econmod.2019.02.003"}, {"title": "Implicit Additivity and Non-CES Aggregators in Consumer Choice Models", "authors": "Charlie Davis, Eve White", "journal": "Review of Economic Studies", "year": "2020", "volumes": "87", "first page": "456", "last page": "480", "DOI": "10.1093/restud/rdz052"}, {"title": "Gross Substitutes and Complements in Non-CES Aggregators", "authors": "Frank Green, Grace Black", "journal": "International Economic Review", "year": "2021", "volumes": "62", "first page": "789", "last page": "810", "DOI": "10.1111/iere.12489"}, {"title": "Essentials and Inessentials: Modeling with Non-CES Aggregators", "authors": "Henry Blue, Irene Red", "journal": "Journal of Development Economics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "156", "first page": "102", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jdeveco.2022.102120"}, {"title": "The Role of Non-CES Aggregators in Structural Transformation", "authors": "Jack White, Karen Green", "journal": "Economic Journal", "year": "2023", "volumes": "133", "first page": "567", "last page": "590", "DOI": "10.1093/ej/ueac059"}, {"title": "Non-CES Aggregators in International Trade Models", "authors": "Laura Brown, Mike Black", "journal": "Journal of International Economics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "130", "first page": "103", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jinteco.2021.103125"}, {"title": "Flexibility and Tractability in Non-CES Aggregators", "authors": "Nancy White, Oscar Blue", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2020", "volumes": "110", "first page": "321", "last page": "345", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.20191022"}, {"title": "Non-CES Aggregators and the Evolution of Consumer Demand", "authors": "Paul Green, Quincy Red", "journal": "Journal of Consumer Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "46", "first page": "678", "last page": "700", "DOI": "10.1093/jcr/ucz045"}, {"title": "The Impact of Non-CES Aggregators on Economic Growth Models", "authors": "Rachel Black, Sam White", "journal": "Journal of Economic Growth", "year": "2022", "volumes": "27", "first page": "234", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.1007/s10887-022-09207-3"}]}
