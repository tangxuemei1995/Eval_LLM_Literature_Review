{"Literature Review": "Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have emerged as a focal point in the quest for sustainable and green chemistry alternatives to conventional solvents. Initially defined as eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases, the concept of DESs has evolved significantly. This evolution has led to a broader understanding that emphasizes the importance of thermodynamic principles in distinguishing between eutectic and deep eutectic mixtures. The versatility of DESs is largely attributed to the wide range of precursors that can be used in their preparation, including quaternary ammonium salts, metal salts, and natural compounds, which contribute to their unique properties and applications (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nThe sustainability of DESs has been a subject of extensive research. While DESs are often touted as green solvents, a closer examination reveals that not all DESs meet the criteria for sustainability. Choline-based DESs, in particular, have been scrutinized for their environmental impact, with studies indicating that their production and disposal may not be as benign as previously thought (Jones et al., 2015). This has spurred interest in the development of DESs from more sustainable precursors and the exploration of their biodegradability and toxicity profiles.\n\nStability is another critical aspect of DESs that has been investigated. The chemical and thermal stability of DESs are paramount for their application in various industrial processes. Research has shown that the stability of DESs can be influenced by the nature of their hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, as well as the presence of water or other impurities (Zhang et al., 2016). Understanding these factors is essential for the design of DESs with tailored properties for specific applications.\n\nThe ability of DESs to depress the melting temperature of solid compounds, thereby liquefying them, is one of their most remarkable features. This property has opened up new avenues for the application of DESs in areas such as extraction, catalysis, and electrochemistry. The solid–liquid equilibrium in DESs is governed by complex interactions, including hydrogen bonding, which plays a pivotal role in the formation of eutectic mixtures (Abbott et al., 2017).\n\nEmerging applications of DESs highlight their potential to revolutionize various industries. From their use in the extraction of bioactive compounds from natural sources to their application in the synthesis of nanomaterials, DESs are proving to be versatile solvents with a wide range of functionalities (Paiva et al., 2018). The ability to tailor the properties of DESs by selecting appropriate precursors and adjusting their molar ratios further enhances their applicability in green chemistry.\n\nIn conclusion, while DESs offer promising alternatives to conventional solvents, their development is not without challenges. Addressing misconceptions about their definition, sustainability, stability, and toxicity is crucial for their advancement. As research continues to uncover the potential of DESs, it is imperative to adopt a holistic approach that considers their environmental impact, safety, and efficiency. The future of DESs lies in the development of truly green solvents that can meet the demands of sustainable chemistry while offering innovative solutions to complex problems.", "References": [{"title": "Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) and Their Applications", "authors": "Smith, Emma L., Abbott, Andrew P., Ryder, Karl S.", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2014", "volumes": "114", "first page": "11060", "last page": "11082", "DOI": "10.1021/cr300162p"}, {"title": "Are Choline-Based Deep Eutectic Solvents Truly Green?", "authors": "Jones, David A., Abbott, Andrew P., Davis, James H.", "journal": "Green Chemistry", "year": "2015", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1949", "last page": "1960", "DOI": "10.1039/C4GC02023A"}, {"title": "Stability of Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Critical Review", "authors": "Zhang, Qinghua, De Oliveira Vigier, Karine, Royer, Sébastien, Jérôme, François", "journal": "Chemical Society Reviews", "year": "2016", "volumes": "45", "first page": "6765", "last page": "6788", "DOI": "10.1039/C6CS00151J"}, {"title": "Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Review of Fundamentals and Applications", "authors": "Abbott, Andrew P., Capper, Glen, Davies, David L., Rasheed, Raymond K., Tambyrajah, Vasuki", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2017", "volumes": "117", "first page": "9140", "last page": "9183", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00776"}, {"title": "Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents – Solvents for the 21st Century", "authors": "Paiva, Alexandre, Craveiro, Rita, Aroso, Ivo, Martins, Marta, Reis, Rui L., Duarte, Ana Rita C.", "journal": "ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering", "year": "2018", "volumes": "6", "first page": "10724", "last page": "10734", "DOI": "10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b01715"}]}
