{"Literature Review": "The integration of machine learning (ML) with physical knowledge in the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures represents a burgeoning field that promises to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of predictions concerning thermophysical properties. This literature review explores the synergy between traditional physical models and ML techniques, highlighting the potential of hybrid models to address the scarcity of experimental data in this domain. Traditional approaches to predicting the thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures have relied heavily on molecular models, equations of state, and models of excess properties. These methods, grounded in physical principles, have provided a solid foundation for understanding and predicting the behavior of fluid mixtures. However, the complexity and variability of fluid mixtures often challenge the limits of these models, necessitating the exploration of alternative or complementary approaches. The advent of ML has introduced a new paradigm in thermodynamic modeling. ML algorithms, capable of learning from data, offer the potential to uncover complex patterns and relationships that may not be explicitly captured by physical models alone. The integration of ML with physical knowledge aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches, combining the interpretability and reliability of physical models with the flexibility and predictive power of ML. Recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of hybrid models in various applications. For instance, ML techniques have been employed to refine the parameters of equations of state, enhancing their predictive accuracy for specific fluid mixtures. Similarly, ML has been used to predict excess properties by learning from experimental data, thereby complementing traditional models. These examples underscore the versatility of hybrid models in addressing the challenges of thermodynamic modeling. The development of hybrid models also raises important considerations regarding model selection, training data quality, and the interpretability of ML predictions. Ensuring that ML models are trained on high-quality, representative data is crucial for their reliability. Moreover, the integration of physical constraints into ML models can enhance their interpretability and ensure that predictions are consistent with established physical principles. Looking ahead, the field is poised for further advancements as researchers continue to explore innovative ways to combine ML with physical knowledge. The development of more sophisticated ML algorithms, coupled with the increasing availability of experimental and computational data, is expected to drive the evolution of hybrid models. Furthermore, the application of these models to a broader range of fluid mixtures and conditions will expand their utility in science and engineering. In conclusion, the combination of machine learning with physical knowledge in the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures offers a promising avenue for overcoming the limitations of traditional models. By harnessing the complementary strengths of both approaches, hybrid models can provide more accurate and efficient predictions, thereby advancing our understanding of fluid mixtures and their applications.", "References": [{"title": "Machine learning for molecular and materials science", "authors": "Keith T.
