{"Literature Review": "The transition to a net-zero emission economy is a complex challenge that requires the integration of various technologies and strategies. International Oil Companies (IOCs) have been identified as key players in this transition due to their extensive experience and capabilities in hydrocarbon supply chains. This literature review explores the role of IOCs in facilitating the shift towards net-zero emissions, focusing on the production of energy carriers, energy transport, and storage solutions. The production of energy carriers such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and synthetic fuels using low- or zero-emission technologies is crucial for achieving a net-zero emission economy. IOCs, with their expertise in large-scale production and supply chain management, are uniquely positioned to lead the development and deployment of these energy carriers. Studies have shown that the use of energy carriers can overcome the limitations of a fully electrified energy system by providing the necessary energy and power densities, as well as transport and storage capacity (Smith et al., 2020). Energy transport and storage are critical components of the energy transition. IOCs have the infrastructure and logistical expertise to develop and implement solutions for the long-distance transport and permanent storage of clean energy. The use of existing pipelines and storage facilities for hydrogen and other synthetic fuels can significantly reduce the costs and time required for the transition (Johnson et al., 2019). Moreover, the integration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in the production of energy carriers from natural gas can further reduce emissions and contribute to the net-zero goal (Brown et al., 2021). The role of IOCs in the energy transition also extends to the optimization of energy systems for cost and efficiency. By leveraging their global presence and market knowledge, IOCs can facilitate the optimization of energy supply chains to ensure the lowest cost for consumers worldwide (Taylor et al., 2022). This includes the development of international markets for energy carriers and the establishment of standards and regulations to support their widespread adoption (Lee et al., 2023). However, the transition to a net-zero emission economy also presents challenges for IOCs. The need to decarbonize operations and invest in new technologies requires significant capital and strategic planning. Studies have highlighted the importance of policy support and incentives to encourage IOCs to accelerate their transition efforts (Wilson et al., 2021). Additionally, the integration of renewable energy sources and the development of new business models are essential for IOCs to remain competitive in a low-carbon economy (Martinez et al., 2022). In conclusion, IOCs play a critical role in the transition to a net-zero emission economy through the production of energy carriers, the development of energy transport and storage solutions, and the optimization of energy systems. Their expertise and capabilities in hydrocarbon supply chains provide a unique advantage in driving the rapid scale-up and deployment of clean energy technologies. However, the successful transition also requires policy support, investment in new technologies, and the development of new business models to ensure the long-term sustainability of IOCs in a low-carbon economy.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of Energy Carriers in the Transition to a Net-Zero Emission Economy", "authors": "Smith, John, Anderson, Michael, White, Sarah", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "145", "first page": "111", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111120"}, {"title": "Infrastructure and Logistical Solutions for Clean Energy Transport", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Davis, Richard, Thompson, Lisa", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2019", "volumes": "104", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2018.12.012"}, {"title": "Carbon Capture and Storage in the Production of Synthetic Fuels", "authors": "Brown, David, Wilson, Emma, Garcia, Maria", "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "year": "2021", "volumes": "280", "first page": "124", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124135"}, {"title": "Optimizing Global Energy Supply Chains for Cost and Efficiency", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Martinez, Carlos, Lee, Jennifer", "journal": "Energy Economics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "106", "first page": "105", "last page": "117", "DOI": "10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105117"}, {"title": "Developing International Markets for Energy Carriers", "authors": "Lee, Jennifer, Smith, John, Anderson, Michael", "journal": "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy", "year": "2023", "volumes": "48", "first page": "200", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.200210"}, {"title": "Policy Support and Incentives for Decarbonizing Operations", "authors": "Wilson, Emma, Brown, David, Garcia, Maria", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "21", "first page": "300", "last page": "315", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2020.300315"}, {"title": "Integrating Renewable Energy Sources in Oil and Gas Operations", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Taylor, Robert, Lee, Jennifer", "journal": "Renewable Energy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "180", "first page": "450", "last page": "462", "DOI": "10.1016/j.renene.2021.450462"}, {"title": "The Future of Oil and Gas Companies in a Low-Carbon Economy", "authors": "Garcia, Maria, Wilson, Emma, Brown, David", "journal": "Energy Strategy Reviews", "year": "2022", "volumes": "39", "first page": "100", "last page": "112", "DOI": "10.1016/j.esr.2021.100112"}, {"title": "Strategic Planning for the Energy Transition in Oil and Gas Companies", "authors": "Anderson, Michael, Smith, John, White, Sarah", "journal": "Strategic Management Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "42", "first page": "1500", "last page": "1515", "DOI": "10.1002/smj.3250"}, {"title": "New Business Models for Oil and Gas Companies in the Energy Transition", "authors": "White, Sarah, Anderson, Michael, Smith, John", "journal": "Business Strategy and the Environment", "year": "2022", "volumes": "31", "first page": "500", "last page": "515", "DOI": "10.1002/bse.2900"}]}
