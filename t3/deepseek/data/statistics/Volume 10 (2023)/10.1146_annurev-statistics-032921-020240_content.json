{"Literature Review": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are critical components in the analysis and application of statistical models, particularly when forecasts are expressed in terms of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. This literature review explores the methodologies and tools used for assessing the in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictive performance of such models, with a focus on the concepts of calibration, coverage plots, Murphy diagrams, quantile regression, reliability diagrams, and scoring functions. The distinction between unconditional and conditional calibration is pivotal in understanding the nuances of model diagnostics and forecast evaluation. Unconditional calibration, which aligns with classical coverage criteria, ensures that the predicted quantiles cover the observed outcomes at the nominal rate across the entire dataset. In contrast, conditional calibration, a more stringent criterion, requires that this coverage holds within specific subsets of the data, as visualized through quantile reliability diagrams (Gneiting & Ranjan, 2011). Quantile regression, introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978), serves as a foundational technique for estimating conditional quantiles, offering a robust framework for modeling the relationship between independent variables and the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. This method has been widely applied across various fields, including economics, finance, and meteorology, due to its flexibility in handling heteroscedasticity and its ability to provide a comprehensive view of the conditional distribution (Koenker & Hallock, 2001). The evaluation of quantile forecasts necessitates the use of consistent scoring functions, which allow for the comparative assessment and ranking of competing models. The asymmetric piecewise linear score, or pinball loss, is a prominent example of such a function, directly linked to the quantile regression objective function (Gneiting & Raftery, 2007). Beyond the pinball loss, the Murphy diagram offers a graphical tool for comparing the predictive performance of different models across a range of quantiles, facilitating a deeper understanding of model strengths and weaknesses (Ehm et al., 2016). Coverage plots and reliability diagrams further aid in the diagnostic process by providing visual assessments of calibration, highlighting discrepancies between predicted and observed quantiles (Diebold & Mariano, 1995). The application of these tools to real-world datasets, such as Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub, underscores their practical utility in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of quantile forecasts (Gneiting & Katzfuss, 2014; Ray et al., 2020). In summary, the integration of model diagnostics and forecast evaluation techniques, grounded in the principles of calibration and supported by consistent scoring functions and visual tools, constitutes a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of quantile-based predictions. This review highlights the importance of these methodologies in advancing the field of predictive analytics and their potential to inform decision-making processes across a wide range of applications.", "References": [{"title": "Quantile Regression", "authors": "Roger Koenker, Gilbert Bassett", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "1978", "volumes": "46", "first page": "33", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.2307/1913643"}, {"title": "Quantile Regression", "authors": "Roger Koenker, Kevin F.
