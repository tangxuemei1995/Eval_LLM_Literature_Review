{"Literature Review": "The concept of three-decision methods in statistical testing offers a nuanced approach to interpreting the results of significance tests, particularly for real-valued parameters. This framework, as advocated by Tukey, diverges from the traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) by allowing for a decision to assert the sign of the parameter above or below a specified null value, or to withhold judgment altogether. This literature review explores the three-decision framework, its applications, and its advantages over NHST, supported by a range of studies that have contributed to this area of statistical methodology. The three-decision method's utility extends beyond simple significance testing to include Bayesian analogs of frequentist power calculations, p-values, confidence intervals, and multiple testing corrections. This approach also addresses some of the interpretative challenges associated with traditional testing methods. The literature on three-decision methods is rich and varied, with contributions from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. For instance, Berger and Sellke (1987) discuss the comparison of p-values to Bayesian measures of evidence, highlighting the interpretative clarity that three-decision methods can provide. Similarly, Gelman et al. (2012) critique the NHST framework and suggest that a more nuanced approach, akin to three-decision methods, could mitigate some of its shortcomings. The application of three-decision methods to multiple testing scenarios is particularly noteworthy. Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) introduced the concept of false discovery rate (FDR) control, which can be viewed through the lens of three-decision methods as a way to manage the trade-off between asserting the sign of parameters and the risk of false discoveries. This approach has been further developed and applied in various fields, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness. Moreover, the three-decision framework facilitates a more straightforward interpretation of testing results, especially in cases where the traditional NHST approach leads to ambiguity or misinterpretation. For example, Wasserstein and Lazar (2016) emphasize the importance of context and effect size in interpreting p-values, principles that are inherently supported by the three-decision method. In conclusion, the three-decision method represents a significant advancement in statistical testing, offering a more sensible and interpretable framework than the traditional NHST. Its application across a range of statistical tools and its ability to address well-known difficulties in testing interpretation underscore its value in both theoretical and applied statistics.", "References": [{"title": "Testing a Point Null Hypothesis: The Irreconcilability of P Values and Evidence", "authors": "Berger, James O., Sellke, Thomas", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "1987", "volumes": "82", "first page": "112", "last page": "122", "DOI": "10.1080/01621459.1987.10478397"}, {"title": "Why We (Usually) Don't Have to Worry About Multiple Comparisons", "authors": "Gelman, Andrew, Hill, Jennifer, Yajima, Masanao", "journal": "Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness", "year": "2012", "volumes": "5", "first page": "189", "last page": "211", "DOI": "10.1080/19345747.2011.618213"}, {"title": "Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing", "authors": "Benjamini, Yoav, Hochberg, Yosef", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
