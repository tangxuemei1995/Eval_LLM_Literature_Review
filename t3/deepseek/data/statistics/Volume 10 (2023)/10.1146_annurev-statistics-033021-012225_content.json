{"Literature Review": "The detection of exoplanets through radial velocity (RV) measurements has been a cornerstone in the field of astrophysics, offering insights into the mass, orbital eccentricities, and architecture of planetary systems. This literature review delves into the statistical methods employed in RV data analysis, highlighting the challenges and advancements in detecting exoplanets amidst complex, correlated noise and unevenly sampled time series data. The RV method's sensitivity to small planets, particularly Earth twins, is hindered by instrumental and astrophysical noise, which introduces temporally correlated stochastic signals. These signals complicate the detection process, necessitating sophisticated statistical approaches to disentangle planetary signals from noise. The exploration of the vast parameter space of RV models further compounds the difficulty, requiring efficient and exhaustive search strategies. Recent studies have framed RV data analysis as a problem of detection and parameter estimation in multivariate time series, emphasizing the need for advanced statistical techniques to improve detection capabilities. One of the primary challenges in RV data analysis is the presence of correlated noise, which can mimic or obscure planetary signals. Techniques such as Gaussian Process (GP) regression have been employed to model this correlated noise, allowing for more accurate detection of planetary signals. For instance, Rajpaul et al. (2015) demonstrated the effectiveness of GP regression in distinguishing between stellar activity and planetary signals in RV data. Another significant challenge is the uneven sampling of RV data, which can lead to aliasing and spurious detections. Methods such as Lomb-Scargle periodograms and Bayesian approaches have been developed to address this issue, providing more reliable period detection in unevenly sampled data. The comparison and selection of models in RV data analysis also present methodological challenges. With the potential for model misspecification, it is crucial to employ robust model comparison techniques to ensure the selection of the most appropriate model for the data. Bayesian model comparison, for example, offers a principled approach to model selection, taking into account both the fit and complexity of the models. Furthermore, the exploration of the large parameter space of RV models requires efficient numerical methods. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and nested sampling algorithms have been widely used to explore this parameter space, enabling the estimation of planetary parameters with greater accuracy and efficiency. The integration of machine learning techniques into RV data analysis has also shown promise, offering new avenues for improving detection capabilities. For example, artificial neural networks have been used to classify RV data, distinguishing between planetary signals and noise with high accuracy. In conclusion, the detection of exoplanets through RV measurements is a complex task that requires sophisticated statistical methods to overcome the challenges posed by correlated noise, uneven sampling, and model misspecification. The advancements in statistical techniques, including GP regression, Bayesian model comparison, and machine learning, have significantly improved the detection capabilities, paving the way for the discovery of Earth twins and a deeper understanding of planetary systems.", "References": [{"title": "A Gaussian Process framework for modelling stellar activity signals in radial velocity data", "authors": "Vinesh Rajpaul, Suzanne Aigrain, Michael A.
