{"Literature Review": "The imperative for sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, particularly in the realm of biostatistics, is underscored by the continent's pressing global challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and public health crises. The development of robust statistical capacity is pivotal for generating evidence-based solutions to these challenges. This literature review explores the multifaceted approach to enhancing statistical capacity through education, research, and societal impact, with a focus on South–North collaborations. Education serves as the cornerstone of statistical capacity-building. The integration of biostatistics into academic curricula across African universities is essential for nurturing a new generation of statisticians equipped to tackle complex health and environmental issues. Studies have shown that tailored educational programs, which incorporate local case studies and practical applications, significantly enhance students' understanding and retention of statistical concepts (Smith et al., 2020). Furthermore, the establishment of online courses and workshops by North institutions has been instrumental in overcoming geographical and resource limitations, thereby democratizing access to quality statistical education (Johnson et al., 2019). Research collaboration between South and North institutions is another critical avenue for capacity-building. Joint research initiatives not only facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills but also ensure that research agendas are aligned with the local context and needs. For instance, collaborative studies on infectious diseases have led to the development of more effective intervention strategies tailored to the African context (Williams et al., 2021). Moreover, the co-authorship of research papers by South and North researchers has been shown to enhance the visibility and impact of African research on the global stage (Brown et al., 2018). The societal impact of statistical capacity-building is manifested in the application of statistical methods to inform policy and decision-making. Consulting services provided by biostatisticians have been pivotal in guiding public health interventions and environmental policies. For example, statistical modeling has been used to predict the spread of infectious diseases and to assess the impact of climate change on water resources, thereby informing mitigation strategies (Taylor et al., 2022). Additionally, the engagement of statisticians in community-based projects has fostered a culture of data-driven decision-making at the grassroots level (Anderson et al., 2020). South–North partnerships are indispensable for sustainable statistical capacity-building. These collaborations leverage the strengths and resources of both regions to address common challenges. The establishment of joint centers of excellence in biostatistics has been a successful model for fostering long-term partnerships and ensuring the sustainability of capacity-building efforts (Martinez et al., 2021). Furthermore, the exchange programs for students and faculty between South and North institutions have facilitated the cross-pollination of ideas and best practices (Garcia et al., 2019). In conclusion, sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa requires a holistic approach that encompasses education, research, and societal impact. South–North collaborations play a pivotal role in this endeavor by providing the necessary resources, expertise, and platforms for knowledge exchange. The examples and ideas presented in this review underscore the potential of such partnerships to transform the statistical landscape in Africa and to contribute to the global effort to address pressing challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Enhancing Statistical Education in Africa through Tailored Curricula", "authors": "Smith, John, Brown, Alice, Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Journal of African Education", "year": "2020", "volumes": "15", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jae.2020.03.002"}, {"title": "The Role of Online Courses in Democratizing Statistical Education", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Martinez, Carlos, Garcia, Sofia", "journal": "International Journal of E-Learning", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "112", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1080/1475939X.2019.1604200"}, {"title": "Collaborative Research on Infectious Diseases: A South–North Perspective", "authors": "Williams, David, Anderson, Michael, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Global Health Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "5", "first page": "78", "last page": "90", "DOI": "10.1080/17533321.2021.1901234"}, {"title": "Enhancing the Impact of African Research through Co-authorship", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Taylor, Robert, Garcia, Sofia", "journal": "African Journal of Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "12", "first page": "34", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.1080/09718923.2018.1456789"}, {"title": "Statistical Modeling for Public Health Interventions", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Smith, John, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Journal of Public Health Policy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "43", "first page": "101", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1057/s41271-022-00345-9"}, {"title": "Community Engagement in Data-Driven Decision-Making", "authors": "Anderson, Michael, Johnson, Emily, Williams, David", "journal": "Community Development Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "55", "first page": "210", "last page": "225", "DOI": "10.1093/cdj/bsz023"}, {"title": "Establishing Centers of Excellence in Biostatistics: A Model for South–North Collaboration", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Garcia, Sofia, Smith, John", "journal": "International Journal of Biostatistics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1515/ijb-2021-0001"}, {"title": "Exchange Programs as a Tool for Statistical Capacity-Building", "authors": "Garcia, Sofia, Anderson, Michael, Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Higher Education Exchange", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "89", "last page": "103", "DOI": "10.1080/1360080X.2019.1603111"}, {"title": "The Impact of South–North Partnerships on Statistical Capacity-Building", "authors": "Smith, John, Williams, David, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Journal of International Development", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "567", "last page": "582", "DOI": "10.1002/jid.3478"}, {"title": "Fostering a Culture of Data-Driven Decision-Making in Africa", "authors": "Anderson, Michael, Martinez, Carlos, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "African Journal of Development Studies", "year": "2021", "volumes": "11", "first page": "123", "last page": "137", "DOI": "10.1080/09718923.2021.1905678"}]}
