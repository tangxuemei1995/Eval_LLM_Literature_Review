{"Literature Review": "The evolution of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods has significantly influenced the field of Bayesian analysis, enabling the practical application of Bayesian inference across a myriad of scientific domains. This literature review explores the development of MCMC methods, from the inception of Gibbs sampling in the late 1980s to the advent of contemporary gradient-based methods and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), and their implementation in statistical software for Bayesian inference. The journey of MCMC methods began with the introduction of Gibbs sampling, a technique that simplifies the sampling from complex multivariate distributions by breaking them down into simpler conditional distributions (Geman & Geman, 1984). This method laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in MCMC algorithms, including the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which offers a more general framework for sampling from probability distributions (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970). The development of these algorithms has been paralleled by the creation of statistical software packages designed to facilitate Bayesian inference. Early software like BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) provided a platform for implementing Gibbs sampling and other MCMC methods, abstracting the complexities of these algorithms from the user (Spiegelhalter et al., 1996). The introduction of JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) and Stan further expanded the capabilities of Bayesian software, incorporating more sophisticated MCMC techniques and offering more flexible modeling languages (Plummer, 2003; Carpenter et al., 2017). Stan, in particular, introduced Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a gradient-based MCMC method that significantly improves sampling efficiency for complex models (Neal, 2011). The development of INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) offered an alternative to MCMC for certain classes of models, providing fast and accurate approximations to posterior distributions (Rue et al., 2009). More recently, the exploration of PDMPs has opened new avenues for MCMC methods, offering continuous-time alternatives to traditional discrete-time algorithms (Bouchard-Côté et al., 2018). These advancements in MCMC methods and their implementation in statistical software have democratized Bayesian analysis, making it accessible to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. As research into new MCMC methods continues, it is anticipated that future generations of software will incorporate these innovations, further enhancing the user experience and expanding the applicability of Bayesian inference.", "References": [{"title": "Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images", "authors": "Stuart Geman, Donald Geman", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": "1984", "volumes": "PAMI-6", "first page": "721", "last page": "741", "DOI": "10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767596"}, {"title": "Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines", "authors": "Nicholas Metropolis, Arianna W.
