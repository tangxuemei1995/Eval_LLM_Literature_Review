{"Literature Review": "The study of models for integer data has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by their applicability across various domains such as finance, clinical trials, sports analytics, and time-series analysis. This literature review synthesizes the advancements in modeling integer data, focusing on discrete distributions, univariate and multivariate time-series models, and the incorporation of thinning operators and the Skellam distribution. Discrete distributions for integer data have been extensively studied, with the Poisson distribution being a cornerstone for modeling count data. However, the limitations of the Poisson distribution, particularly its equidispersion property, have led to the development of alternative models such as the Negative Binomial and Generalized Poisson distributions, which accommodate overdispersion and underdispersion, respectively (Cameron & Trivedi, 2013). The Skellam distribution, which models the difference between two Poisson-distributed random variables, has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing integer-valued data that represent differences, such as price changes in financial markets or goal differences in sports (Karlis & Ntzoufras, 2009). In the realm of time-series analysis, autoregressive (AR) models have been adapted for integer-valued data through the use of thinning operators, which allow for the construction of integer-valued AR (INAR) processes. The INAR model, introduced by Al-Osh and Alzaid (1987), has been extended in various ways to incorporate additional features such as seasonality, covariates, and overdispersion (Weiß, 2008). The class of ARCH-GARCH models, originally developed for continuous financial time series, has also been adapted for integer-valued data. These models, known as INARCH and INGARCH, provide a framework for modeling conditional heteroskedasticity in count data, offering insights into the volatility of integer-valued processes (Ferland et al., 2006). Multivariate extensions of these models have been proposed to capture the dependencies between multiple integer-valued time series. The multivariate INAR (MINAR) model and multivariate INGARCH (MINGARCH) model are examples of such extensions, enabling the analysis of complex interdependencies in high-dimensional integer-valued data (Pedeli & Karlis, 2013). The application of these models spans a wide range of fields. In finance, integer-valued models are used to analyze discrete price changes and trading volumes, providing a more accurate representation of market dynamics (Rydberg & Shephard, 2003). In clinical trials, these models facilitate the analysis of discrete outcomes, such as the number of adverse events or the difference in symptom counts before and after treatment (Zeger & Qaqish, 1988). In sports analytics, integer-valued models are employed to predict match outcomes based on goal differences and other discrete performance metrics (Dixon & Coles, 1997). Despite the advancements in modeling integer data, challenges remain. The development of models that can handle zero-inflation, excess zeros, and complex dependencies in high-dimensional data is an ongoing area of research. Additionally, the computational complexity of estimating parameters in these models, particularly in the multivariate case, poses significant challenges (Jung et al., 2011). Future research directions include the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional statistical models to enhance predictive accuracy and the development of more efficient algorithms for parameter estimation. In conclusion, the field of models for integer data has seen substantial progress, with a wide array of distributions and time-series models now available to researchers and practitioners. The continued evolution of these models, driven by both theoretical advancements and practical applications, promises to further enrich our understanding of integer-valued processes across various domains.", "References": [{"title": "Regression Analysis of Count Data", "authors": "Cameron, A.
