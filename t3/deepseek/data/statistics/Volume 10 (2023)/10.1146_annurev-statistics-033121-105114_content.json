{"Literature Review": "The increasing emphasis on research transparency and data-intensive research has significantly elevated the value of research data, making data sharing a requirement by funders and publishers and a disciplinary expectation across various fields. Despite this, the practices that promote data reusability and research transparency remain poorly understood, posing challenges for statisticians and researchers in adapting study methods to facilitate data sharing. This literature review explores the role of statistics in enhancing data reusability and research transparency, drawing on previous studies to highlight the importance of statistical thinking in the context of open research and data sharing. The landscape of open research is vast, with data sharing being a cornerstone for promoting transparency and reproducibility in scientific research. However, the mere act of sharing data does not guarantee its reusability. The quality and type of shared research artifacts play a crucial role in the capacity to reproduce or replicate studies. Statistical methods and quality evaluation frameworks are essential in understanding the nature of data errors and in mitigating these errors prior to sharing. Studies have shown that the application of statistical thinking can significantly improve the quality of shared data, thereby enhancing its reusability. For instance, the use of metadata and documentation standards can aid in the accurate interpretation and analysis of shared data, reducing the likelihood of errors and misinterpretations. Furthermore, the development and application of data quality evaluation frameworks can help identify and address potential issues in data sets before they are shared, ensuring that the data is of high quality and suitable for reuse. The role of statisticians in this process is pivotal. By updating their research approaches and incorporating best practices in data management and sharing, statisticians can contribute to the advancement of open science and the promotion of research transparency. Collaborative investigations, in particular, can benefit from the integration of statistical expertise, as it can lead to the development of more robust and reliable data sets that are conducive to reuse. In conclusion, the role of statistics in promoting data reusability and research transparency is multifaceted and essential. Through the application of statistical methods and quality evaluation frameworks, statisticians can enhance the quality and reusability of shared data, thereby contributing to the advancement of open science and the promotion of research transparency.", "References": [{"title": "Promoting an open research culture", "authors": "Brian A.
