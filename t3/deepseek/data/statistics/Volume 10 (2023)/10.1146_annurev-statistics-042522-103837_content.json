{"Literature Review": "The concepts of generalizability and transportability are central to the field of causal inference, particularly when the goal is to apply findings from a study to a broader or different population. Generalizability refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to other settings or populations, while transportability involves applying causal effects estimated in one population to a different population. Both concepts are crucial for ensuring that research findings have external validity, meaning they are applicable beyond the specific context in which they were derived. This literature review synthesizes current approaches to addressing external validity bias, focusing on the assumptions required for generalizability and transportability, and the methods for testing treatment effect heterogeneity and differences between study and target populations. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often considered the gold standard for estimating causal effects due to their high internal validity. However, the strict inclusion criteria and controlled environments of RCTs can limit their external validity, making it challenging to generalize findings to broader populations. Observational studies, on the other hand, may include a more representative sample of the target population, thereby enhancing external validity. Yet, they are susceptible to biases, particularly from unmeasured confounding, which can compromise internal validity. The trade-off between internal and external validity is a key consideration in causal inference research. Recent methodological advancements have sought to address these challenges by developing frameworks for generalizing and transporting causal effects. These frameworks often rely on assumptions about the exchangeability between the study sample and the target population, the consistency of treatment effects, and the absence of unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analyses and robustness checks are commonly employed to assess the validity of these assumptions. Testing for treatment effect heterogeneity is another critical aspect of ensuring generalizability and transportability. Heterogeneity in treatment effects can arise from differences in baseline characteristics, treatment implementation, or contextual factors between the study and target populations. Methods for detecting and accounting for heterogeneity include subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and the use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of effect modification. Differences between the study and target populations can also pose challenges for generalizability and transportability. These differences may be in terms of demographic characteristics, health status, or other relevant factors. Propensity score methods, weighting, and matching are among the techniques used to adjust for these differences and improve the comparability of the study sample to the target population. In conclusion, ensuring the generalizability and transportability of causal effects requires careful consideration of both internal and external validity. Methodological frameworks that address external validity bias, along with rigorous testing for treatment effect heterogeneity and population differences, are essential for applying research findings to broader or different populations. As the field of causal inference continues to evolve, further research is needed to refine these methods and develop new approaches for enhancing the external validity of study results.", "References": [{"title": "Generalizing evidence from randomized clinical trials to target populations: The ACTG 320 trial", "authors": "Cole, Stuart R., and Elizabeth A.
