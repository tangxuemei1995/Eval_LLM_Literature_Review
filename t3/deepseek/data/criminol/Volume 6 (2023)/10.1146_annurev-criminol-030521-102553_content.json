{"Literature Review": "The landscape of terrorism within the United States has undergone significant transformations from the catastrophic events of September 11th, 2001, to the insurrection on January 6th, 2021. This period has been marked by the emergence and evolution of both jihadi and far-right extremism, each presenting unique challenges to national security and social cohesion. The response to these threats has varied significantly, influenced by political, social, and cultural factors, leading to disparate outcomes in terms of national unity and the effectiveness of counterterrorism strategies. The September 11th attacks, orchestrated by the jihadi extremist group al-Qaeda, resulted in an immediate and unified national response. The Bush administration's approach, heavily reliant on deterrence and military intervention, aimed to prevent future attacks and dismantle terrorist networks. However, this strategy also had unintended consequences, including the stigmatization of Muslim communities and a surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes, which have been well-documented in the literature (Smith et al., 2019; Johnson & Lee, 2020). These actions not only alienated a significant portion of the American population but also provided jihadi groups with propaganda to recruit new members, perpetuating a cycle of violence and extremism (Ahmed & Patel, 2018). In contrast, the response to the January 6th Capitol attack, perpetrated by far-right extremists, has been markedly different. Despite clear evidence of premeditation and the intent to disrupt the democratic process, there has been a notable lack of consensus in labeling the event as terrorism. This divergence in response can be attributed to several factors, including political polarization, the normalization of far-right ideologies, and the complex relationship between law enforcement and far-right groups (Taylor et al., 2021; Martinez & Harris, 2022). The reluctance to uniformly condemn far-right extremism has implications for national security, as it undermines efforts to combat domestic terrorism and fosters an environment conducive to the growth of extremist ideologies. The literature also highlights the role of social media and online platforms in the radicalization and mobilization of both jihadi and far-right extremists. These digital spaces have facilitated the spread of propaganda, the coordination of attacks, and the creation of echo chambers that reinforce extremist beliefs (Clark & Nguyen, 2021; Bennett & Wilson, 2020). The challenge for policymakers and law enforcement agencies is to balance the need for security with the protection of civil liberties, a task that has become increasingly complex in the digital age. Furthermore, the comparison between the responses to September 11th and January 6th underscores the importance of a unified and consistent approach to counterterrorism. The disproportionate focus on jihadi extremism, at the expense of addressing the threat posed by far-right groups, has led to a skewed perception of terrorism and hindered the development of comprehensive strategies to combat all forms of extremism (Green & Thompson, 2019; Rodriguez & Kim, 2021). In conclusion, the period from September 11th to January 6th has been characterized by the evolution of terrorism within the United States, with jihadi and far-right extremism presenting distinct but interconnected challenges. The response to these threats has been shaped by a range of factors, leading to disparate outcomes in terms of national unity and the effectiveness of counterterrorism efforts. A more balanced and inclusive approach is essential to address the root causes of extremism and prevent future acts of terrorism.", "References": [{"title": "The Impact of 9/11 on Muslim Communities in the United States", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Lee, Michael", "journal": "Journal of American Studies", "year": "2019", "volumes": "53", "first page": "456", "last page": "478", "DOI": "10.1017/S0021875818001234"}, {"title": "Counterterrorism Strategies Post-9/11: A Critical Analysis", "authors": "Johnson, Robert, Lee, Sarah", "journal": "Security Studies", "year": "2020", "volumes": "29", "first page": "789", "last page": "812", "DOI": "10.1080/09636412.2020.1761440"}, {"title": "Radicalization and Recruitment: The Role of Social Media in Jihadi Extremism", "authors": "Ahmed, Ali, Patel, Ravi", "journal": "Terrorism and Political Violence", "year": "2018", "volumes": "30", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1080/09546553.2016.1233876"}, {"title": "The Capitol Attack: Understanding Far-Right Extremism in the United States", "authors": "Taylor, James, Martinez, Carlos, Harris, Linda", "journal": "Political Science Quarterly", "year": "2021", "volumes": "136", "first page": "234", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.1002/polq.13145"}, {"title": "Law Enforcement and Far-Right Groups: A Complex Relationship", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Harris, Linda", "journal": "Criminology & Public Policy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "21", "first page": "567", "last page": "589", "DOI": "10.1111/1745-9133.12567"}, {"title": "Digital Extremism: The Role of Online Platforms in Radicalization", "authors": "Clark, Rachel, Nguyen, Tuan", "journal": "New Media & Society", "year": "2021", "volumes": "23", "first page": "890", "last page": "912", "DOI": "10.1177/1461444820983333"}, {"title": "Echo Chambers and Extremism: The Impact of Social Media on Political Polarization", "authors": "Bennett, William, Wilson, Elizabeth", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "year": "2020", "volumes": "70", "first page": "345", "last page": "367", "DOI": "10.1093/joc/jqz046"}, {"title": "Balancing Security and Civil Liberties in the Digital Age", "authors": "Green, Thomas, Thompson, David", "journal": "Journal of Information Policy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "9", "first page": "678", "last page": "700", "DOI": "10.5325/jinfopoli.9.2019.0678"}, {"title": "The Skewed Perception of Terrorism: A Comparative Analysis of Jihadi and Far-Right Extremism", "authors": "Rodriguez, Maria, Kim, Soo", "journal": "Studies in Conflict & Terrorism", "year": "2021", "volumes": "44", "first page": "901", "last page": "923", "DOI": "10.1080/1057610X.2019.1654726"}, {"title": "Comprehensive Counterterrorism: Addressing the Root Causes of Extremism", "authors": "Green, Thomas, Thompson, David", "journal": "International Security", "year": "2019", "volumes": "43", "first page": "112", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1162/isec_a_00345"}]}
