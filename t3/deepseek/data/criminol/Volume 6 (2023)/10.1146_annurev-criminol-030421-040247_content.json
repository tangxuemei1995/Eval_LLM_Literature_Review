{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of fatal police violence (FPV) in the United States has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate, particularly when viewed through a comparative lens with other developed nations. The United States is often highlighted for its exceptionally high rates of police killings, a trend that starkly contrasts with the lower rates observed in many other developed countries. This literature review explores the factors contributing to this disparity, focusing on the role of gun violence, ethnoracial inequality, and the decentralized structure of U.S. policing, while also considering the experiences of other nations in the Americas and beyond. Gun violence emerges as a critical factor distinguishing the United States from other developed nations. The prevalence of firearms in the U.S. not only increases the likelihood of violent encounters but also shapes police practices and attitudes towards the use of deadly force. Research by Zimring (2017) underscores the unique gun culture in the U.S., which fosters a heightened sense of danger among law enforcement officers, leading to a more aggressive policing style. This preoccupation with potential threats is less pronounced in countries with stricter gun control laws, where police encounters are less likely to escalate to fatal violence. Ethnoracial inequality and discord further exacerbate the issue of FPV in the United States. Studies have shown that minority communities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately affected by police violence. The work of Alexander (2010) highlights the systemic racism embedded within the U.S. criminal justice system, which contributes to the over-policing of minority neighborhoods and the use of excessive force against people of color. This pattern of ethnoracial discrimination is less prevalent in countries with more homogeneous populations or those that have implemented policies to address racial disparities in policing. The decentralized structure of U.S. policing is another factor that sets it apart from many other developed nations. Bayley and Stenning (2016) argue that the hyperlocalism of U.S. law enforcement agencies limits the influence of external oversight and hampers the implementation of effective training and accountability measures. This lack of centralized control contrasts with the more unified policing models found in countries like the United Kingdom and Japan, where national standards and oversight mechanisms help to minimize instances of FPV. However, the experiences of some Latin American countries challenge the notion that decentralization is a necessary condition for high FPV. Despite having relatively centralized policing systems, nations such as Brazil and Venezuela report high rates of police killings, suggesting that other factors, such as societal violence and weak rule of law, play a significant role. Conversely, countries like Spain and Chile demonstrate that achieving low FPV is possible without the extensive resources and training available in wealthier Northern European nations. These examples indicate that while decentralization may contribute to high FPV in the U.S., it is not the sole determinant, and other contextual factors must be considered. In conclusion, the exceptionally high rates of police killings in the United States can be attributed to a combination of factors, including widespread gun violence, ethnoracial inequality, and the decentralized structure of policing. Comparative analyses with other nations reveal that while these factors are significant, they are not universally applicable, and the dynamics of FPV are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, and institutional elements. Addressing the issue of FPV in the U.S. will require a multifaceted approach that considers these diverse factors and draws lessons from the experiences of other countries.", "References": [{"title": "The Scale of Imprisonment", "authors": "Franklin E.
