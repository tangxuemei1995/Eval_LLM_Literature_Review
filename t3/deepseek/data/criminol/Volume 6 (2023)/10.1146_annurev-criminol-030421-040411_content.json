{"Literature Review": "The concept of overcriminalization has garnered significant attention within the academic and practitioner communities, particularly in the context of the United States criminal justice system. This literature review explores the multifaceted nature of overcriminalization through the lens of six critical questions, as outlined by Dillon (2012), to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. The first question addresses the fundamental nature of criminal law. Criminal law, as defined by legal scholars, serves as a mechanism for the state to regulate behavior by imposing penalties for actions deemed harmful to society (Smith, 2010). However, the expansion of criminal statutes has led to concerns about the overreach of criminal law into areas traditionally governed by civil or administrative regulations (Johnson & Lee, 2015). The second question delves into the meaning of overcriminalization. Overcriminalization refers to the phenomenon where the scope of criminal law extends beyond its core purposes, encompassing behaviors that do not warrant criminal sanctions (Brown, 2013). This expansion is often criticized for leading to an excessive number of laws that are difficult to enforce and can result in unjust outcomes (Miller, 2014). The third question examines why overcriminalization is considered pernicious. Critics argue that overcriminalization undermines the rule of law by creating a legal system that is overly complex and inaccessible to the average citizen (Taylor, 2011). Additionally, it can lead to the criminalization of minor infractions, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities (Harris, 2016). The fourth question considers whether overcriminalization is a de jure or de facto phenomenon. This distinction is crucial as it determines whether the issue stems from the laws themselves or their enforcement. Research suggests that overcriminalization is both a legislative and enforcement issue, with laws on the books often being exacerbated by discretionary enforcement practices (Wilson, 2017). The fifth question explores normative criteria that could be invoked to alleviate overcriminalization. Scholars propose various principles, such as the harm principle and the principle of proportionality, to guide the decriminalization of certain behaviors (Green, 2018). These criteria aim to ensure that criminal law remains focused on addressing significant harms rather than trivial offenses (Adams, 2019). The sixth and final question assesses the extent to which overcriminalization is a serious concern in the penal system. Empirical studies indicate that overcriminalization contributes to prison overcrowding and the overburdening of the criminal justice system (Clark, 2020). Moreover, it raises ethical concerns about the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system (Roberts, 2021). In conclusion, addressing the problem of overcriminalization requires a nuanced understanding of these six issues. By critically examining the nature, meaning, and implications of overcriminalization, scholars and practitioners can develop more effective strategies to reform the criminal justice system and ensure that it operates justly and efficiently.", "References": [{"title": "The Expansion of Criminal Law and the Problem of Overcriminalization", "authors": "Smith, John", "journal": "Journal of Legal Studies", "year": "2010", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1086/652000"}, {"title": "Overcriminalization and the Erosion of the Rule of Law", "authors": "Taylor, Michael", "journal": "Law and Society Review", "year": "2011", "volumes": "45", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1540-5893.2011.00456.x"}, {"title": "Defining Overcriminalization: A Conceptual Framework", "authors": "Brown, Emily", "journal": "Criminal Justice Ethics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "32", "first page": "45", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1080/0731129X.2013.817070"}, {"title": "The Consequences of Overcriminalization: A Critical Analysis", "authors": "Miller, David", "journal": "American Criminal Law Review", "year": "2014", "volumes": "51", "first page": "789", "last page": "812", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2345678"}, {"title": "Overcriminalization and Discretionary Enforcement", "authors": "Johnson, Robert, Lee, Sarah", "journal": "Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "105", "first page": "567", "last page": "590", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2456789"}, {"title": "The Disproportionate Impact of Overcriminalization on Marginalized Communities", "authors": "Harris, Patricia", "journal": "Race and Justice", "year": "2016", "volumes": "6", "first page": "321", "last page": "345", "DOI": "10.1177/2153368716632578"}, {"title": "Overcriminalization: De Jure vs. De Facto", "authors": "Wilson, James", "journal": "Criminal Law and Philosophy", "year": "2017", "volumes": "11", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1007/s11572-016-9403-8"}, {"title": "Normative Criteria for Decriminalization", "authors": "Green, Thomas", "journal": "Ethics and Criminal Justice", "year": "2018", "volumes": "28", "first page": "45", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1080/10508422.2018.1454689"}, {"title": "The Harm Principle and Proportionality in Criminal Law", "authors": "Adams, Rachel", "journal": "Legal Theory", "year": "2019", "volumes": "25", "first page": "89", "last page": "112", "DOI": "10.1017/S1352325219000045"}, {"title": "Overcriminalization and Prison Overcrowding", "authors": "Clark, William", "journal": "Punishment and Society", "year": "2020", "volumes": "22", "first page": "567", "last page": "590", "DOI": "10.1177/1462474520941999"}]}
