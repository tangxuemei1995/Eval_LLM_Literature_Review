{"Literature Review": "The measurement of homicide rates is a critical aspect of cross-national research, influencing the understanding of global and regional trends, as well as the development of theoretical explanations for geographical and temporal variations. The increasing number of cross-national homicide studies underscores the importance of scrutinizing how national homicide data are generated and the implications of using different data sources. This literature review examines the impact of homicide measurement on cross-national research, focusing on the four main centralized homicide data sources: the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, the WHO Global Health Observatory, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the World Bank World Development Indicators. The review highlights the differences in homicide trends, levels, and structural covariates across these data sources and discusses the implications for cross-national research. The WHO Mortality Database emerges as a particularly valuable source due to its methodological rigor and comprehensive coverage, despite the limitations inherent in all four systems. The review concludes with recommendations for researchers to better understand and account for the nuances of homicide data generation in their studies, ensuring more accurate and reliable cross-national comparisons and analyses.", "References": [{"title": "Global Burden of Armed Violence 2011: Lethal Encounters", "authors": "Geneva Declaration Secretariat", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9781139049368"}, {"title": "The Global Study on Homicide 2013: Trends, Contexts, Data", "authors": "United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime", "journal": "United Nations Publication", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "World Health Statistics 2018: Monitoring Health for the SDGs", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "World Health Organization", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Global Health Observatory (GHO) data", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "World Health Organization", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "World Development Indicators 2018", "authors": "World Bank", "journal": "World Bank", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Cross-National Homicide Trends in the 1980s: Why Did the United States Experience a Unique Trend?", "authors": "Steven F.
