{"Literature Review": "The concept of probation and parole as alternatives to incarceration has been a cornerstone of the criminal justice system in the United States for decades. Initially designed to rehabilitate offenders and reduce prison populations, these forms of community supervision have grown to encompass a significant portion of the population, leading to what is now termed 'mass supervision.' Despite their intended purpose, recent research and data analysis suggest that probation and parole may not be fulfilling their rehabilitative or diversionary roles effectively. This literature review explores the efficacy of community supervision, its impact on crime rates, and the potential for reducing its scope without compromising public safety. The use of probation and parole has seen a decline since its peak in 2007, yet it still affects approximately 3.9 million Americans, indicating a pervasive reach into the lives of individuals under the criminal legal system's watch. Studies have shown that rather than serving as a means of rehabilitation or diversion from incarceration, supervision often acts as a mechanism for further entanglement with the criminal justice system. Research by Phelps (2017) highlights that supervision conditions are frequently violated, leading to high rates of recidivism and incarceration, thus questioning the utility of these programs. Analysis of national supervision, crime, and carceral data since 1980 reveals that supervision has a minimal effect on future crime rates and does not serve as an effective replacement for incarceration. This is corroborated by findings from Klingele (2013), who argues that the current system of supervision fails to address the underlying causes of criminal behavior, thereby limiting its rehabilitative potential. Case studies from California and New York City provide evidence that reducing the scope of mass supervision can be achieved without an increase in crime. These jurisdictions have implemented sentencing reforms, case diversion programs, and changes in supervisory and legal system department policies, demonstrating that alternatives to traditional supervision can be both effective and safe. Clear and Frost (2014) discuss how such reforms have led to a decrease in the number of individuals under supervision while maintaining public safety, suggesting that extensive downsizing of supervision is feasible. Furthermore, the literature suggests that experimentation with the abolition of supervision could be a viable path forward. Advocates for abolition argue that the current system of supervision perpetuates cycles of poverty and incarceration, particularly among marginalized communities. Simon (2014) posits that the abolition of probation and parole could lead to a more equitable and just criminal justice system, focusing on restorative justice practices rather than punitive measures. In conclusion, the body of research reviewed indicates that the current system of mass supervision in the United States is in need of significant reform. The evidence suggests that reducing the scope of supervision, or even its abolition, could lead to a more effective and equitable criminal justice system. Actionable steps towards these goals include implementing sentencing reforms, expanding case diversion programs, and revising supervisory policies to focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. As the debate on the future of probation and parole continues, it is clear that the status quo is neither sustainable nor beneficial for the majority of those under supervision.", "References": [{"title": "Mass Probation: Toward a More Robust Theory of State Variation in Punishment", "authors": "Michelle S.
