{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race, ethnicity, and crime has long been a focal point of criminological research, with a predominant emphasis on the Black-White binary. However, the Latino/a/x population, now the largest racial minority in the United States, presents a critical yet underexplored dimension in the study of crime and criminal legal system involvement. This literature review seeks to bridge this gap by integrating Latina and Latino Critical Legal Theory (LatCrit) with criminological theory to provide a more nuanced understanding of Latino/a/x experiences within the criminal legal system. LatCrit, an offshoot of Critical Race Theory (CRT), offers a valuable lens through which to examine the racialization of Latino/a/xs and its implications for crime and legal system involvement. Racialization, as conceptualized by LatCrit, involves the process by which dominant societal actors construct Latino/a/xs as an innate, distinct, and inferior racial category, often associated with criminality. This process not only marginalizes Latino/a/xs across various domains but also influences their self-perception and identity, increasingly leading them to view themselves as non-White. The application of LatCrit to criminology reveals how systemic racism manifests in discrimination, cultural and linguistic devaluation, criminalization, and racial profiling, all of which contribute to the patterns of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement. Empirical studies have documented the disproportionate representation of Latino/a/xs in the criminal legal system, highlighting the role of racial profiling and biased policing practices. For instance, research indicates that Latino/a/x individuals are more likely to be stopped, searched, and arrested compared to their White counterparts, even when controlling for factors such as crime rates and socioeconomic status. This disparity is further exacerbated by the criminalization of immigration, which has led to the increased detention and deportation of Latino/a/x immigrants, often under the guise of national security. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic devaluation of Latino/a/xs within the criminal legal system poses significant barriers to justice. Language barriers, for example, can impede access to legal representation and fair treatment in court, while cultural stereotypes can influence judicial decision-making and sentencing outcomes. The integration of LatCrit with core criminological theories, such as social disorganization theory and strain theory, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the structural and systemic factors that contribute to Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement. Social disorganization theory, which posits that crime is a product of neighborhood-level factors such as poverty, residential mobility, and ethnic heterogeneity, can be expanded to consider the racialized experiences of Latino/a/x communities. Similarly, strain theory, which focuses on the role of societal pressures and blocked opportunities in driving criminal behavior, can be enriched by examining the unique stressors faced by Latino/a/x individuals, including discrimination and acculturation challenges. By centering race and racism in the study of crime and legal system involvement, this review seeks to advance criminological theory and practice. It calls for a more robust engagement with the racialization of Latino/a/xs and the attendant policies, institutions, and practices that perpetuate their marginalization. In doing so, it aims to equip the field of criminology with the theoretical tools necessary to address the complexities of the twenty-first-century racial landscape, which is increasingly shaped by the Latino/a/x experience.", "References": [{"title": "Latino/a Critical Race Theory, LatCrit Theory, and Critical Race Theory: A Comparative Analysis", "authors": "Richard Delgado, Jean Stefancic", "journal": "Harvard Latino Law Review", "year": "2001", "volumes": "4", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.283511"}, {"title": "Racial Profiling and Immigration Law Enforcement: Rounding Up of Usual Suspects in the Latino Community", "authors": "Kevin R.
