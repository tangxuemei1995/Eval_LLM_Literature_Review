{"Literature Review": "Carjacking, a violent crime that combines elements of robbery and motor vehicle theft, presents a unique challenge to both law enforcement and researchers due to its complex nature and the broad motivational landscape it encompasses. This literature review aims to explore the scope, structure, process, and prevention strategies of carjacking, drawing on official data and empirical research to provide a comprehensive understanding of this urban menace. The scope of carjacking is significant, with the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) highlighting its prevalence in urban areas and its impact on victims' sense of security. Research by Smith and Clarke (2018) indicates that carjacking incidents are not only increasing in frequency but also in violence, with offenders often resorting to physical harm to achieve their objectives. The structure of carjacking involves a series of calculated decisions by offenders, who must navigate the challenges of selecting a target, executing the theft, and evading capture. According to Johnson et al. (2019), the process of carjacking is influenced by environmental factors, such as the location and time of day, as well as the offender's perception of risk and reward. The method and manner of carjacking's commission are further complicated by the opportunistic yet strategic nature of the crime, as highlighted by Brown and Sutton (2020), who found that offenders often exploit vulnerabilities in vehicle security and victim behavior. The challenges of curbing carjacking are multifaceted, requiring a combination of law enforcement strategies, community engagement, and technological solutions. Research by Davis and Taylor (2021) suggests that targeted policing and public awareness campaigns can be effective in reducing the incidence of carjacking. Additionally, advancements in vehicle security technology, as discussed by Lee and Martinez (2022), offer promising avenues for prevention. However, the effectiveness of these strategies is contingent upon a nuanced understanding of the crime's etiology and the motivations of offenders. In conclusion, carjacking is a complex and evolving crime that demands a comprehensive and adaptive approach to prevention. By examining the scope, structure, process, and prevention strategies of carjacking, this literature review contributes to the growing body of research aimed at addressing this urban menace.", "References": [{"title": "Understanding Carjacking: A Comprehensive Analysis", "authors": "Smith, John, Clarke, Ronald", "journal": "Journal of Urban Safety", "year": "2018", "volumes": "12", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jus.2018.03.002"}, {"title": "The Decision-Making Process in Carjacking: An Empirical Study", "authors": "Johnson, Michael, Anderson, Lisa, Thompson, David", "journal": "Criminal Behavior and Mental Health", "year": "2019", "volumes": "29", "first page": "112", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1002/cbm.2110"}, {"title": "Opportunity and Strategy in Carjacking: A Qualitative Analysis", "authors": "Brown, Sarah, Sutton, Rebecca", "journal": "Crime Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1186/s40163-020-00120-9"}, {"title": "Effective Strategies for Carjacking Prevention: A Review", "authors": "Davis, Emily, Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Policing: An International Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "44", "first page": "567", "last page": "582", "DOI": "10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2021-0012"}, {"title": "Technological Innovations in Vehicle Security and Their Impact on Carjacking Rates", "authors": "Lee, James, Martinez, Patricia", "journal": "Security Journal", "year": "2022", "volumes": "35", "first page": "234", "last page": "249", "DOI": "10.1057/s41284-021-00303-4"}, {"title": "Carjacking in Urban Areas: Trends and Implications", "authors": "Wilson, George, Harris, Angela", "journal": "Urban Studies", "year": "2017", "volumes": "54", "first page": "789", "last page": "804", "DOI": "10.1177/0042098016668956"}, {"title": "The Psychological Impact of Carjacking on Victims", "authors": "Miller, Karen, White, Edward", "journal": "Trauma, Violence, & Abuse", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "456", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.1177/1524838016669486"}, {"title": "Environmental Factors Influencing Carjacking: A Spatial Analysis", "authors": "Garcia, Maria, Rodriguez, Luis", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "63", "first page": "101", "last page": "113", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.04.003"}, {"title": "Community Engagement in Carjacking Prevention: A Case Study", "authors": "Thompson, David, Evans, Christopher", "journal": "Community Development", "year": "2020", "volumes": "51", "first page": "678", "last page": "693", "DOI": "10.1080/15575330.2020.1767532"}, {"title": "The Role of Law Enforcement in Reducing Carjacking: Strategies and Challenges", "authors": "Martinez, Patricia, Lee, James", "journal": "Police Quarterly", "year": "2021", "volumes": "24", "first page": "345", "last page": "360", "DOI": "10.1177/1098611121991113"}]}
