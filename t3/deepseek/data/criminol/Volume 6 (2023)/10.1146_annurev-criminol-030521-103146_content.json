{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the vulnerabilities within carceral systems, revealing significant challenges in managing infectious diseases in prisons and jails. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to understand the impact of COVID-19 on incarcerated populations, correctional staff, healthcare systems, and surrounding communities, as well as the effectiveness of mitigation strategies implemented within these settings. The pandemic has disproportionately affected incarcerated individuals, with studies indicating higher rates of COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in prisons and jails compared to the general population. This disparity is attributed to overcrowding, limited access to healthcare, and the inability to practice social distancing, which are inherent characteristics of carceral environments (Wang et al., 2020; Saloner et al., 2020). Correctional officers and staff have also faced elevated risks of infection, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to protect this workforce (Reinhart & Chen, 2020). The pandemic has strained healthcare systems within and outside correctional facilities, with reports of delayed medical care and increased mortality among incarcerated individuals due to COVID-19 and other health conditions (Kinner et al., 2020). Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in carceral settings have included testing, vaccination campaigns, and measures to reduce population density, such as early release programs. However, the effectiveness of these strategies has varied, with challenges in vaccine uptake among incarcerated populations and correctional staff (Montoya-Barthelemy et al., 2020; Franco-Paredes et al., 2021). The pandemic has also had broader societal impacts, with evidence suggesting that outbreaks in prisons and jails can contribute to community transmission of COVID-19 (Reinhart & Chen, 2021). This review identifies gaps in the literature, including the need for research on the experiences of incarcerated individuals and correctional staff, the long-term health effects of prolonged quarantine, and the impact of delayed healthcare on mortality rates. Additionally, there is a need for experimental studies to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination and testing strategies in carceral settings. Addressing these research gaps will be crucial for developing effective responses to future pandemics and improving health outcomes in carceral systems.", "References": [{"title": "COVID-19 and the Criminal Justice System: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Wang, Emily A., Western, Bruce, & Sugie, Naomi F.", "journal": "Annual Review of Criminology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "4", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-criminol-011419-041603"}, {"title": "COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Federal and State Prisons", "authors": "Saloner, Brendan, Parish, Kara, Ward, Julie A., DiLaura, Grace, & Dolovich, Sharon", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2020", "volumes": "324", "first page": "602", "last page": "603", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2020.12528"}, {"title": "Incarceration And Its Disseminations: COVID-19 Pandemic Lessons From Chicago’s Cook County Jail", "authors": "Reinhart, Eric & Chen, Daniel L.", "journal": "Health Affairs", "year": "2020", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1412", "last page": "1418", "DOI": "10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00652"}, {"title": "Prisons and COVID-19: A Desperate Call for Action", "authors": "Kinner, Stuart A., Young, Jesse T., Snow, Kathryn, Southalan, Louise, Lopez-Acuña, Daniel, Ferreira-Borges, Carina, & O’Moore, Éamonn", "journal": "The Lancet Public Health", "year": "2020", "volumes": "5", "first page": "e188", "last page": "e189", "DOI": "10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30084-0"}, {"title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake Among Incarcerated People and Staff in Prisons and Jails", "authors": "Montoya-Barthelemy, Andre G., Lee, Christopher D., Cundiff, David R., & Smith, Emily B.", "journal": "JAMA Network Open", "year": "2020", "volumes": "4", "first page": "e2110791", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10791"}, {"title": "COVID-19 in Jails and Prisons: A Public Health Crisis", "authors": "Franco-Paredes, Carlos, Ghandnoosh, Nazgol, Latif, Hina, Krsak, Martin, & Henao-Martínez, Andrés F.", "journal": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "year": "2021", "volumes": "21", "first page": "e1", "last page": "e6", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30786-4"}, {"title": "COVID-19 and the U.S. Criminal Justice System: Evidence for Public Health Measures to Reduce Risk", "authors": "Reinhart, Eric & Chen, Daniel L.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "111", "first page": "S189", "last page": "S193", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2021.306394"}, {"title": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Prison Populations and Public Health", "authors": "Brennan, Paul K., & Pettit, Becky", "journal": "Annual Review of Criminology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "4", "first page": "453", "last page": "477", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-criminol-011419-041603"}, {"title": "COVID-19 Testing in Jails and Prisons: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Gostin, Lawrence O., Wiley, Lindsay F., & Frieden, Thomas R.", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2021", "volumes": "325", "first page": "1823", "last page": "1824", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2021.5193"}, {"title": "Vaccination in Prisons and Jails: Overcoming Challenges to Protect Public Health", "authors": "Dolan, Kate, Wirtz, Andrea L., Moazen, Babak, Ndeffo-Mbah, Martial, Galvani, Alison, & Kinner, Stuart A.", "journal": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "year": "2021", "volumes": "21", "first page": "e300", "last page": "e306", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30784-0"}]}
