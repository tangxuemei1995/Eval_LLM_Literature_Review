{"Literature Review": "The American criminal justice system is currently undergoing a period of intense scrutiny and radical challenge, with calls for ending mass incarceration, defunding the police, and dismantling systemic racism at the forefront of public discourse. This literature review situates these challenges within the broader social and economic arrangements that define the United States, exploring the structural underpinnings of its distinctive and problematic penal system. Drawing on a wide range of social science research, it examines the social structures, institutions, and processes that contribute to America's extraordinary reliance on penal control, as well as its high rates of homicide and social disorder. The review argues that the peculiar political economy of the United States—shaped by the legacies of slavery, racial segregation, and deindustrialization—plays a central role in generating the conditions that necessitate such a punitive approach to social control. The United States' political economy, characterized by a form of capitalism and democratic governance that has been rendered increasingly insecure and exclusionary, predisposes state authorities to adopt penal control as the preferred policy response to social disorganization and criminal violence. This approach has led to the creation of a penal state that is unparalleled in its scale and severity among developed nations. The literature review begins by examining the historical roots of the American penal system, tracing its development from the post-Civil War era through the civil rights movement and into the present day. It highlights the role of racialized social control in shaping the system, with particular attention to the ways in which slavery and segregation have influenced contemporary practices of policing and incarceration. The review then turns to the economic transformations of the late 20th century, exploring how deindustrialization and the rise of neoliberalism have exacerbated social inequalities and contributed to the growth of the penal state. It considers the impact of these changes on urban communities, where the combination of economic deprivation and aggressive policing has led to high rates of incarceration and police violence. The review also examines the role of the welfare state—or the lack thereof—in shaping the American approach to social control, arguing that the weak social safety net in the United States has made penal control a default response to social problems. Finally, the review considers the prospects for radical change in the American criminal justice system, assessing the potential impact of recent social movements and policy proposals. It concludes by emphasizing the need for a structural analysis that addresses the root causes of crime and punishment in the United States, calling for a reimagining of the political economy to create a more just and equitable society.", "References": [{"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform", "authors": "John Pfaff", "journal": "", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Punishment and Inequality in America", "authors": "Bruce Western", "journal": "", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America", "authors": "Naomi Murakawa", "journal": "", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America", "authors": "Elizabeth Hinton", "journal": "", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America", "authors": "Khalil Gibran Muhammad", "journal": "", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California", "authors": "Ruth Wilson Gilmore", "journal": "", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Are Prisons Obsolete?", "authors": "Angela Y.
