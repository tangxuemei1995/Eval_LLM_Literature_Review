{"Literature Review": "The study of immigration and crime has a rich history within the field of criminology, particularly through the lens of ethnographic research. Early twentieth-century scholars, primarily associated with the Chicago School, laid the groundwork for understanding the complex relationship between immigration and crime through detailed, qualitative studies of immigrant communities. These early ethnographies provided invaluable insights into the social dynamics, cultural conflicts, and economic challenges faced by immigrants, which were often linked to criminal behavior (Park, Burgess, & McKenzie, 1925). However, as criminology evolved, there was a noticeable shift towards quantitative methodologies, leading to what some scholars have described as a 'collective amnesia' regarding the contributions of early ethnographic work (Sampson, 2006). This shift has been critiqued for overlooking the nuanced, lived experiences of immigrants and the contextual factors that influence their interactions with the criminal justice system.\n\nRecent years have seen a resurgence of interest in ethnographic studies of immigration and crime, driven by the recognition of the limitations of quantitative approaches in capturing the complexities of immigrants' experiences. Contemporary research has focused on several key areas, including the policing of immigrant communities in the context of 'crimmigration'—the intersection of criminal law and immigration enforcement (Stumpf, 2006). Ethnographic studies have shed light on the ways in which immigration policies and practices contribute to the criminalization of immigrants, often leading to increased surveillance, detention, and deportation (Armenta, 2017). These studies highlight the disproportionate impact of crimmigration on marginalized communities and the erosion of trust between immigrant populations and law enforcement agencies.\n\nAnother significant area of contemporary ethnographic research is the lived experiences of individuals within deportation and detention regimes. Scholars have documented the harsh conditions and psychological toll of detention on immigrants, as well as the challenges they face in navigating the legal system (Golash-Boza, 2015). These studies provide a humanizing perspective on the often-dehumanizing processes of immigration enforcement, emphasizing the resilience and agency of detained individuals.\n\nThe integration experiences of Muslim immigrants, a highly marginalized but understudied population, have also been a focus of recent ethnographic research. Studies have explored the ways in which Muslim immigrants navigate the dual challenges of integration and discrimination, particularly in the post-9/11 era (Peek, 2011). These ethnographies reveal the complex interplay between religious identity, cultural practices, and societal perceptions, which can influence Muslims' experiences of crime and victimization.\n\nFinally, contemporary ethnographic research has examined immigrants' unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization. Studies have documented the various forms of exploitation and abuse faced by immigrants, including labor exploitation, human trafficking, and domestic violence (Menjívar & Salcido, 2002). These ethnographies underscore the importance of understanding the structural and systemic factors that contribute to immigrants' victimization, as well as the barriers they face in accessing justice and support services.\n\nIn conclusion, the revitalization of ethnographic studies of immigration and crime offers a valuable complement to quantitative approaches, providing deeper insights into the lived experiences of immigrants and the contextual factors that shape their interactions with the criminal justice system. By revisiting the methodological contributions of early ethnographies and synthesizing contemporary research, scholars can address the 'collective amnesia' and 'newness fetish' that have characterized much of contemporary criminology, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between immigration and crime.", "References": [{"title": "The City", "authors": "Robert E.
