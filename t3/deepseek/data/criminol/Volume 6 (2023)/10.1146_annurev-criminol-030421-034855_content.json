{"Literature Review": "The study of organizational crime, peace, and crisis prevention has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting the complex interplay between societal structures and individual behaviors. This literature review delves into the multifaceted nature of these themes, drawing upon a range of scholarly works to illuminate the challenges and opportunities in fostering freedom and preventing crime and war. The exploration begins with the foundational theories of crime and peace, moves through the contemporary issues of cybercrime and environmental crises, and concludes with reflections on the autobiographical approach to understanding these phenomena. The foundational theories of crime and peace have long been a subject of academic inquiry. Early works by scholars such as Sutherland (1949) introduced the concept of white-collar crime, highlighting the role of organizational structures in facilitating illegal activities. This perspective was expanded by Braithwaite (1989), who emphasized the importance of restorative justice in addressing corporate crime and fostering peace. These studies underscore the complexity of crime prevention, suggesting that traditional punitive measures may be insufficient in addressing the root causes of organizational crime. The advent of the digital age has introduced new challenges in the realm of crime and peace. Cybercrime, as explored by Wall (2007), represents a significant threat to global security, requiring innovative approaches to prevention and enforcement. The interconnected nature of cyberspace complicates traditional notions of jurisdiction and enforcement, necessitating a reevaluation of legal frameworks and international cooperation. Similarly, the environmental crisis poses a unique challenge to peace and security. Research by Homer-Dixon (1999) illustrates the potential for environmental degradation to exacerbate social tensions and lead to conflict. This body of work highlights the need for integrated approaches to crisis prevention, incorporating environmental sustainability into broader strategies for peace and security. Autobiographical approaches to the study of crime and peace offer valuable insights into the personal and professional journeys of researchers in this field. The reflective nature of autobiography allows for a deeper understanding of the motivations, challenges, and successes encountered in the pursuit of knowledge. This approach, as demonstrated by the works of Becker (1967) and Goffman (1961), provides a unique lens through which to examine the complexities of organizational crime and the quest for peace. In conclusion, the study of organizational crime, peace, and crisis prevention is a dynamic and evolving field, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to address the complex challenges of the modern world. The integration of foundational theories, contemporary issues, and autobiographical reflections offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing these critical issues. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential to remain open to new perspectives and methodologies, fostering a more inclusive and effective approach to crime prevention and peacebuilding.", "References": [{"title": "White Collar Crime", "authors": "Edwin H.
