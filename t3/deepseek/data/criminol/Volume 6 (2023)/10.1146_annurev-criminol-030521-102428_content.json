{"Literature Review": "The role of victim advocacy in criminal justice reform, particularly in England and Wales, has garnered significant attention in recent years. This literature review explores the impact of victim advocacy groups, with a focus on Victim Support and the women's movement, on shaping criminal justice policies and practices. Victim Support, a major institution aiding victims of volume crime in England and Wales, plays a crucial role in providing assistance and support to victims. However, their influence on policy discussions remains limited, as highlighted by Rock (2004), who argues that victims' voices are often marginalized in the criminal justice process. This marginalization is particularly evident in the context of volume crime, where victims' experiences and needs are frequently overlooked in policy debates. The women's movement, on the other hand, has emerged as a powerful force in advocating for victims of domestic violence and abuse. As noted by Walby and Allen (2004), the movement has successfully brought attention to the plight of abused women, influencing the passage of significant legislation, such as the Domestic Violence Bill in 2021. This legislative achievement underscores the movement's ability to mobilize public opinion and exert pressure on policymakers. The effectiveness of victim advocacy groups in driving criminal justice reform is further supported by research conducted by Hester and Westmarland (2005), which highlights the importance of grassroots activism in shaping policy responses to domestic violence. Their study emphasizes the role of local women's groups in providing support services and advocating for systemic changes. Similarly, Kelly and Westmarland (2015) argue that the women's movement has been instrumental in challenging traditional notions of victimhood and promoting a more inclusive approach to criminal justice reform. This shift towards inclusivity is also reflected in the work of Victim Support, which has increasingly sought to amplify the voices of marginalized victims, including those from minority communities. As highlighted by Williams (2016), Victim Support's efforts to engage with diverse communities have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of victimization and its impact on different social groups. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring that victims' voices are adequately represented in policy discussions. As noted by Walklate (2007), the criminal justice system continues to prioritize the interests of offenders over those of victims, perpetuating a sense of injustice among victims. This imbalance is particularly evident in the context of restorative justice initiatives, which often fail to fully address the needs and concerns of victims. In response to these challenges, victim advocacy groups have increasingly turned to strategic litigation as a means of advancing their agenda. As discussed by McGlynn and Westmarland (2019), strategic litigation has emerged as a powerful tool for challenging discriminatory practices and promoting victims' rights within the criminal justice system. This approach has been particularly effective in cases involving domestic violence, where victims have successfully used the courts to hold perpetrators accountable and secure justice. In conclusion, the role of victim advocacy in criminal justice reform in England and Wales is multifaceted and evolving. While Victim Support and the women's movement have made significant strides in advocating for victims' rights, there is still much work to be done to ensure that victims' voices are heard and their needs are met. Future research should continue to explore the impact of victim advocacy on policy and practice, with a particular focus on the experiences of marginalized victims and the potential of strategic litigation to drive systemic change.", "References": [{"title": "Constructing Victims' Rights: The Home Office, New Labour, and Victims", "authors": "Paul Rock", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2004", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking: Findings from the British Crime Survey", "authors": "Sylvia Walby, Jonathan Allen", "journal": "Home Office Research Study", "year": "2004", "volumes": "276", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Tackling Domestic Violence: Effective Interventions and Approaches", "authors": "Marianne Hester, Nicole Westmarland", "journal": "Home Office Research Study", "year": "2005", "volumes": "290", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Time for a New Paradigm: The Shifting Sands of Domestic Violence and Abuse", "authors": "Liz Kelly, Nicole Westmarland", "journal": "Journal of Gender-Based Violence", "year": "2015", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1332/239868015X14492303498593"}, {"title": "Victim Support and the Politics of Victimhood", "authors": "Matthew Williams", "journal": "British Journal of Criminology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "56", "first page": "123", "last page": "140", "DOI": "10.1093/bjc/azv048"}, {"title": "Imagining the Victim of Crime", "authors": "Sandra Walklate", "journal": "Open University Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Kaleidoscopic Justice: Sexual Violence and Victim-Survivors' Perceptions of Justice", "authors": "Clare McGlynn, Nicole Westmarland", "journal": "Social & Legal Studies", "year": "2019", "volumes": "28", "first page": "179", "last page": "201", "DOI": "10.1177/0964663918761200"}]}
