{"Literature Review": "The United States has witnessed a significant increase in incarceration rates over the past few decades, with women's rates of imprisonment and incarceration in jails growing at a faster pace than men's during the prison boom. Despite a recent modest decline in incarceration rates, the decrease has been less pronounced for women, leading to a historic high in the number of women in prisons and jails. This literature review explores the trends in women's incarceration, emphasizing the disparities faced by Black, Latina, and American Indian/Indigenous women, and contextualizes these trends within the broader socio-economic disadvantages experienced by women prior to incarceration and the inequalities exacerbated by their incarceration. The review also highlights the need for improved data collection and more research on women's imprisonment and jail trends, particularly concerning race and ethnicity, as well as the development of theoretical frameworks to better understand these issues. Research by The Sentencing Project (2020) indicates that the incarceration rate for women has increased by more than 700% since 1980, with women of color being disproportionately represented. This trend is attributed to changes in sentencing laws and policies, particularly those related to drug offenses, which have had a significant impact on women. Studies by Kruttschnitt (2010) and Bloom, Owen, and Covington (2003) have shown that women in the criminal justice system often have histories of victimization, substance abuse, and mental health issues, which are compounded by the lack of gender-responsive programming and services in prisons and jails. The economic and social disadvantages faced by women prior to incarceration, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education and healthcare, further exacerbate their vulnerability to incarceration. Research by Richie (2012) highlights the intersectionality of race, gender, and class in shaping the experiences of incarcerated women, particularly Black and Latina women, who face systemic barriers to reentry and reintegration into society. The consequences of women's incarceration extend beyond the individual to their families and communities, with studies by Arditti (2012) and Enos (2001) documenting the impact of maternal incarceration on children, including increased risk of foster care placement, behavioral problems, and intergenerational cycles of incarceration. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for improved data on women's imprisonment and jail trends, particularly regarding race and ethnicity, as well as more research and theoretical development to address the inequalities and consequences of women's incarceration.", "References": [{"title": "The Sentencing Project: Women and Girls in the Criminal Justice System", "authors": "The Sentencing Project", "journal": "", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Paradox of Women's Imprisonment", "authors": "Candace Kruttschnitt", "journal": "Daedalus", "year": "2010", "volumes": "139", "first page": "32", "last page": "42", "DOI": "10.1162/daed.2010.139.3.32"}, {"title": "Gender-Responsive Strategies: Research, Practice, and Guiding Principles for Women Offenders", "authors": "Barbara Bloom, Barbara Owen, Stephanie Covington", "journal": "", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America's Prison Nation", "authors": "Beth E.
