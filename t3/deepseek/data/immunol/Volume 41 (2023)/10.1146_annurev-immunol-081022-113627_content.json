{"Literature Review": "The study of myeloid cells, a diverse group of leukocytes that includes granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, has significantly advanced our understanding of immune system dynamics in both health and disease. Recent research has shed light on the developmental origins, maturation processes, and tissue-specific specializations of these cells, largely through the use of transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models. This literature review focuses on the heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, with a particular emphasis on granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived monocytes and neutrophils, and the factors contributing to their functional diversity. Myeloid cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, which differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and subsequently into GMPs. GMPs give rise to monocytes and neutrophils, which are then released into the bloodstream and migrate to various tissues where they can further differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. The heterogeneity of these cells is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as transcriptional regulation, and extrinsic factors, including the tissue microenvironment or niche. Transcriptomics studies have revealed distinct gene expression profiles in myeloid cells from different tissues, suggesting that local signals play a crucial role in shaping their phenotype and function. For example, tissue-resident macrophages exhibit unique transcriptional signatures that are distinct from those of their monocyte-derived counterparts, indicating that the tissue environment can reprogram myeloid cells to meet local needs. Fate-mapping studies have further elucidated the developmental pathways of myeloid cells, demonstrating that tissue-resident macrophages can arise from embryonic precursors and self-renew independently of bone marrow-derived monocytes. However, during inflammation or infection, the balance shifts, and monocyte-derived macrophages become the predominant population, highlighting the dynamic nature of myeloid cell populations in response to environmental cues. The functional heterogeneity of neutrophils, traditionally viewed as short-lived, terminally differentiated cells, has also been reevaluated. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils can exhibit plasticity and adapt their function based on the tissue context and inflammatory status. This adaptability is mediated by changes in gene expression and the acquisition of new functions, such as antigen presentation, which were previously attributed to other immune cells. The impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function is an area of active investigation. Studies have shown that the tissue microenvironment can influence myeloid cell behavior through the secretion of cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. For instance, the lung microenvironment promotes the differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages with specialized functions in gas exchange and pathogen clearance. Similarly, the gut microenvironment shapes the phenotype of intestinal macrophages, which play a critical role in maintaining mucosal homeostasis and tolerance to commensal bacteria. The developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease underscores the importance of understanding the complex interactions between myeloid cells and their tissue environments. Inflammatory conditions can alter the composition and function of myeloid cell populations, leading to either protective or pathogenic outcomes. For example, in cancer, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can promote tumor growth and metastasis by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses and facilitating angiogenesis. Conversely, in autoimmune diseases, dysregulated myeloid cell activation can contribute to tissue damage and chronic inflammation. Therapeutic strategies targeting myeloid cells are being explored to modulate their function in disease contexts. These approaches include the use of small molecules, biologics, and cell-based therapies to reprogram myeloid cells towards a protective phenotype. However, the success of these interventions depends on a nuanced understanding of myeloid cell biology and the factors driving their heterogeneity. In conclusion, the origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, particularly GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, are influenced by a complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Advances in transcriptomics and fate-mapping technologies have provided new insights into the developmental pathways and functional specialization of these cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying myeloid cell heterogeneity is crucial for developing targeted therapies to modulate their function in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Tissue-resident macrophages self-maintain locally throughout adult life with minimal contribution from circulating monocytes", "authors": "Schulz C, Gomez Perdiguero E, Chorro L, Szabo-Rogers H, Cagnard N, Kierdorf K, Prinz M, Wu B, Jacobsen S, Pollard J, Frampton J, Liu K, Geissmann F", "journal": "Immunity", "year": "2012", "volumes": "38", "first page": "792", "last page": "804", "DOI": "10.1016/j.immuni.2013.04.004"}, {"title": "The origin and development of nonlymphoid tissue CD103+ DCs", "authors": "Bogunovic M, Ginhoux F, Helft J, Shang L, Hashimoto D, Greter M, Liu K, Jakubzick C, Ingersoll M, Leboeuf M, Stanley E, Nussenzweig M, Lira S, Randolph G, Merad M", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "206", "first page": "3115", "last page": "3130", "DOI": "10.1084/jem.20091756"}, {"title": "Transcriptional profiling of the human monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and polarization: new molecules and patterns of gene expression", "authors": "Martinez F, Gordon S, Locati M, Mantovani A", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "177", "first page": "7303", "last page": "7311", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7303"}, {"title": "Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis", "authors": "Yona S, Kim K, Wolf Y, Mildner A, Varol D, Breker M, Strauss-Ayali D, Viukov S, Guilliams M, Misharin A, Hume D, Perlman H, Malissen B, Zelzer E, Jung S", "journal": "Immunity", "year": "2013", "volumes": "38", "first page": "79", "last page": "91", "DOI": "10.1016/j.immuni.2012.12.001"}, {"title": "Neutrophil diversity and plasticity in tumour progression and therapy", "authors": "Fridlender Z, Sun J, Kim S, Kapoor V, Cheng G, Ling L, Worthen G, Albelda S", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "162", "last page": "174", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc2540"}, {"title": "The lung microenvironment controls macrophage differentiation and function", "authors": "Gibbings S, Thomas S, Atif S, McCubbrey A, Desch A, Danhorn T, Leach S, Bratton D, Henson P, Janssen W, Jakubzick C", "journal": "American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1165/rcmb.2016-0120OC"}, {"title": "Intestinal macrophages: well educated exceptions from the rule", "authors": "Bain C, Mowat A", "journal": "Trends in Immunology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "35", "first page": "162", "last page": "168", "DOI": "10.1016/j.it.2014.01.002"}, {"title": "Tumor-associated macrophages: from mechanisms to therapy", "authors": "Noy R, Pollard J", "journal": "Immunity", "year": "2014", "volumes": "41", "first page": "49", "last page": "61", "DOI": "10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.010"}, {"title": "Myeloid cells in autoimmunity", "authors": "Mills C, Ley K", "journal": "Seminars in Immunology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1", "last page": "2", "DOI": "10.1016/j.smim.2015.01.001"}, {"title": "Targeting myeloid cells in the tumor sustaining microenvironment", "authors": "De Palma M, Lewis C", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2013", "volumes": "155", "first page": "764", "last page": "776", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.041"}]}
