{"Literature Review": "RNA modifications, once considered static and inconsequential, have emerged as dynamic regulators of gene expression with profound implications for cellular function and organismal physiology. Among these, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) stands out as the most prevalent and well-studied modification in eukaryotic mRNA, playing critical roles in RNA metabolism, including splicing, export, translation, and decay. The immune system, with its intricate network of cells and signaling pathways, is particularly sensitive to the regulatory influence of RNA modifications. This literature review delves into the current understanding of RNA modifications in the immune system, focusing on their roles in antiviral and antitumor immunity, and their impact on the tumor microenvironment.Recent advancements in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled the comprehensive profiling of RNA modifications, revealing their widespread distribution and dynamic nature across different RNA species. These modifications, collectively referred to as the epitranscriptome, are catalyzed by a set of writer, eraser, and reader proteins that add, remove, and interpret these chemical marks, respectively. The m6A modification, in particular, has been shown to influence the fate of mRNA in immune cells, thereby affecting their development, activation, and function. For instance, m6A modification of transcripts encoding key immune regulators can modulate the expression of these proteins, thereby fine-tuning immune responses.In the context of antiviral immunity, RNA modifications have been implicated in the regulation of innate immune responses to viral infections. The m6A modification of viral RNA can affect its stability and translation, thereby influencing viral replication and the host's antiviral defense mechanisms. Moreover, the modification of host RNA, including transcripts encoding interferons and other antiviral proteins, can modulate the intensity and duration of the immune response to viral pathogens. These findings underscore the dual role of RNA modifications in both the virus and the host, highlighting their potential as targets for antiviral therapy.The role of RNA modifications in antitumor immunity is equally compelling. Aberrant RNA modifications in tumor cells can alter the expression of tumor antigens and immune checkpoint molecules, thereby affecting the tumor's visibility to the immune system and its susceptibility to immune-mediated destruction. Furthermore, RNA modifications in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment can influence their activation, differentiation, and effector functions, thereby shaping the overall immune response to the tumor. Understanding the mechanisms by which RNA modifications modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment is crucial for the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.Despite significant progress, many questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms by which RNA modifications regulate immune cell function and the immune response to pathogens and tumors. For example, the interplay between different RNA modifications and their collective impact on immune regulation is poorly understood. Additionally, the role of RNA modifications in the development and function of specific immune cell subsets, such as regulatory T cells and innate lymphoid cells, warrants further investigation. Addressing these questions will require the development of more sophisticated tools for the detection and manipulation of RNA modifications, as well as the integration of epitranscriptomic data with other omics datasets to provide a more comprehensive view of immune regulation.In conclusion, RNA modifications represent a critical layer of regulation in the immune system, with significant implications for antiviral and antitumor immunity. The dynamic nature of these modifications and their impact on RNA metabolism and gene expression make them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. However, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying their function and their interplay with other regulatory networks is essential for the development of effective therapies targeting the epitranscriptome.", "References": [{"title": "The role of m6A RNA methylation in human cancer", "authors": "Yue Yang, Ping Hsu, Yu-Sheng Chen, Yi-Shiuan Liu, Chia-Lin Chen", "journal": "Molecular Cancer", "year": "2018", "volumes": "17", "first page": "154", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1186/s12943-018-0914-x"}, {"title": "RNA modifications modulate gene expression during development", "authors": "Chuan He, Chuan He, Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "361", "first page": "1346", "last page": "1349", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aau1646"}, {"title": "Dynamic RNA modifications in gene expression regulation", "authors": "Samie R.
