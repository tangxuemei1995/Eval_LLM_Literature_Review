{"Literature Review": "The interplay between T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in tumor immunity has garnered significant attention in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Both cell types play pivotal roles in the immune response against tumors, with T cells primarily recognizing tumor-specific antigens and NK cells providing a rapid response to stressed or transformed cells. Recent studies have highlighted the synergistic potential of engaging both T cells and NK cells in cancer immunotherapy, leveraging their complementary mechanisms of action to enhance therapeutic outcomes. This literature review explores the current understanding of T cell and NK cell interactions in tumor immunity, focusing on strategies to co-engage these cells for improved cancer immunotherapy. T cells and NK cells exhibit distinct yet complementary roles in tumor immunity. T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), are essential for recognizing and eliminating tumor cells through the recognition of tumor-specific antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In contrast, NK cells provide a first line of defense against tumors by recognizing and killing cells that have downregulated MHC class I molecules, a common immune evasion strategy employed by tumor cells. The importance of NK cells in tumor immunity has been further underscored by their role in recruiting dendritic cells (DCs) to the tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the induction of CD8+ T cell responses. This cross-talk between NK cells and DCs is mediated by the secretion of chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL5 and XCL1, which attract DCs to the tumor site and promote their maturation and antigen presentation capabilities. The reciprocal activation of T cells and NK cells within the tumor microenvironment is another critical aspect of their synergistic function. IL-2, a cytokine secreted by activated T cells, is a potent activator of NK cells, enhancing their cytotoxic activity and cytokine production. This mutual reinforcement creates a positive feedback loop that amplifies the anti-tumor immune response. Targeting immune evasion mechanisms that disrupt the function of T cells and NK cells represents a promising therapeutic strategy. One such mechanism involves the NKG2D receptor and its ligands, MICA and MICB, which are often downregulated or shed by tumor cells to evade NK cell-mediated killing. Therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring NKG2D ligand expression or blocking their shedding have shown potential in preclinical models, highlighting the importance of this pathway in tumor immunity. T cells and NK cells share several inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance their anti-tumor activity. The inhibitory receptor-ligand systems CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E play crucial roles in regulating the function of both cell types within the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of these inhibitory pathways has been shown to enhance T cell and NK cell-mediated tumor immunity in various cancer models. For example, antibodies targeting TIGIT or NKG2A have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies, leading to increased tumor infiltration and activation of both T cells and NK cells. In addition to receptor-ligand interactions, cytokines play a pivotal role in modulating the function of T cells and NK cells within tumors. Inhibitory cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10, can suppress the activity of both cell types, while activating cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-15, can enhance their anti-tumor functions. Emerging therapeutic strategies focus on modulating the cytokine milieu within the tumor microenvironment to promote T cell and NK cell activation. For instance, IL-15 agonists have shown potential in preclinical models by promoting the expansion and activation of both T cells and NK cells, leading to enhanced tumor control. The development of bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) constructs that simultaneously target T cells and NK cells represents another promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. Bispecific antibodies that engage both CD3 on T cells and a tumor-associated antigen can redirect T cell cytotoxicity towards tumor cells, while simultaneously engaging NK cells through Fc receptor binding. Similarly, CAR-NK cells, which are engineered to express a CAR targeting a tumor-specific antigen, have shown potential in preclinical and early clinical studies, offering a novel approach to harness the cytotoxic potential of NK cells in a targeted manner. In conclusion, the complementary roles of T cells and NK cells in tumor immunity provide a strong rationale for developing immunotherapies that co-engage both cell types. Targeting shared inhibitory and activating receptors, modulating the cytokine milieu, and developing bispecific antibodies and CAR constructs are promising strategies to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Future research should focus on optimizing these approaches and understanding the complex interactions between T cells and NK cells within the tumor microenvironment to maximize therapeutic efficacy.", "References": [{"title": "Natural killer cells and dendritic cells: rendezvous in abused tissues", "authors": "Laurent Brossay, Marco Colonna", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "2", "first page": "957", "last page": "964", "DOI": "10.1038/nri956"}, {"title": "NK cells and cancer immunosurveillance", "authors": "Eric Vivier, David H.
