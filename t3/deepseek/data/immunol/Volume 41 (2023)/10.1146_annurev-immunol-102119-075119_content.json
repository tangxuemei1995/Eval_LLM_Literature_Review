{"Literature Review": "The study of natural killer (NK) cells within the human uterine mucosa has evolved significantly since their initial identification in the nineteenth century. These cells, now known as uterine NK (uNK) cells, were definitively characterized in 1990, marking a pivotal moment in reproductive immunology. Unlike their peripheral counterparts (pNK cells), uNK cells exhibit reduced cytotoxicity, a feature that has intrigued researchers and led to a deeper exploration of their unique roles in pregnancy and uterine health (Moffett & Colucci, 2014). The interaction between uNK cells and placental extravillous trophoblast cells is of particular interest, as it is crucial for successful placental implantation and pregnancy maintenance. This interaction is mediated through a complex network of cytokines, chemokines, and cell surface receptors, highlighting the sophisticated communication between maternal immune cells and fetal-derived tissues (Hanna et al., 2006). Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have unveiled the heterogeneity of uNK cells, identifying three distinct subpopulations that differ in their gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. This diversity suggests a multifaceted role for uNK cells in regulating immune responses, tissue remodeling, and vascular adaptation during pregnancy (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). Beyond their role in pregnancy, uNK cells have been implicated in the defense against uterine infections, showcasing their ability to respond to pathogens while maintaining tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that uNK cells may possess memory-like properties, enabling them to mount more effective responses upon re-exposure to pathogens (Paust et al., 2010). The potential of uNK cells to mediate memory effects opens new avenues for research into their role in recurrent pregnancy loss and other reproductive disorders. Understanding the mechanisms underlying uNK cell function and regulation could lead to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving pregnancy outcomes. For instance, modulating uNK cell activity could enhance placental implantation in cases of infertility or prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (Robson et al., 2012). Furthermore, the study of uNK cells offers insights into the broader field of mucosal immunology, providing a model for understanding how immune cells adapt to the unique challenges of mucosal environments. As research continues to unravel the complexities of uNK cells, their potential to impact reproductive health and beyond becomes increasingly apparent. Future studies should focus on elucidating the molecular pathways that govern uNK cell development, function, and interaction with other cell types in the uterine microenvironment. Additionally, exploring the role of uNK cells in non-pregnant states could reveal their contributions to uterine health and disease, offering new perspectives on the prevention and treatment of gynecological conditions. In conclusion, uNK cells represent a fascinating and complex component of the uterine immune system, with critical roles in pregnancy, infection defense, and potentially, immune memory. As our understanding of these cells deepens, so too does the potential to harness their capabilities for therapeutic benefit, promising to improve outcomes for mothers and babies alike.", "References": [{"title": "Uterine NK cells and trophoblast HLA class I molecules", "authors": "Moffett, Ashley, Colucci, Francesco", "journal": "American Journal of Reproductive Immunology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "71", "first page": "430", "last page": "437", "DOI": "10.1111/aji.12216"}, {"title": "Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface", "authors": "Hanna, Jacob, Goldman-Wohl, Debra, Hamani, Yael, Avraham, Ido, Greenfield, Carol, Natanson-Yaron, Shali, Prus, Daphna, Cohen-Daniel, Liat, Arnon, Tal I., Manaster, Ilana, Gazit, Roi, Yutkin, Vladimir, Benharroch, Daniel, Porgador, Angel, Keshet, Eli, Yagel, Simcha, Mandelboim, Ofer", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2006", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1065", "last page": "1074", "DOI": "10.1038/nm1452"}, {"title": "Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal–fetal interface in humans", "authors": "Vento-Tormo, Roser, Efremova, Mirjana, Botting, Rachel A., Turco, Margherita Y., Vento-Tormo, Maria, Meyer, Kerstin B., Park, Jong-Eun, Stephenson, Emily, Polański, Krzysztof, Goncalves, Angela, Gardner, Lucy, Holmqvist, Staffan, Henriksson, Johan, Zou, Angela, Sharkey, Andrew M., Millar, Barbara, Innes, Barbara, Wood, Laura, Wilbrey-Clark, Anna, Payne, Rebecca P., Ivarsson, Martin A., Lisgo, Steven, Filby, Andrew, Rowitch, David H., Bulmer, Judith N., Wright, Gavin J., Stubbington, Michael J.T., Haniffa, Muzlifah, Moffett, Ashley, Teichmann, Sarah A.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "563", "first page": "347", "last page": "353", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-018-0698-6"}, {"title": "Natural killer cell memory", "authors": "Paust, Silke, von Andrian, Ulrich H.", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "11", "first page": "500", "last page": "508", "DOI": "10.1038/ni.1882"}, {"title": "Uterine natural killer cells initiate spiral artery remodeling in human pregnancy", "authors": "Robson, Annette, Harris, Lynda K., Innes, Barbara A., Lash, Gendie E., Aljunaidy, May M., Aplin, John D., Baker, Philip N., Robson, Stephen C., Bulmer, Judith N.", "journal": "The FASEB Journal", "year": "2012", "volumes": "26", "first page": "4876", "last page": "4885", "DOI": "10.1096/fj.12-210310"}]}
