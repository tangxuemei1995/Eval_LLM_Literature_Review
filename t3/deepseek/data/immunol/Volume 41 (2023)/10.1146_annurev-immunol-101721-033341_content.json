{"Literature Review": "The human genome is a mosaic of genetic sequences, among which endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and other retroelements constitute a significant portion. These sequences, remnants of ancient retroviral infections, have integrated into the host genome over millions of years of evolution. The immunological conundrum posed by these endogenous retroelements lies in their dual nature: they are both self and non-self, making them a unique challenge for the immune system. This literature review explores the complex interplay between endogenous retroelements and the immune system, focusing on the mechanisms of immune recognition, the consequences of their activation, and their roles in health and disease. Endogenous retroelements are typically silenced through epigenetic mechanisms to prevent their expression and potential immunogenicity. However, when these controls are compromised, retroelements can be transcribed and translated, leading to the production of viral proteins and RNA that can be recognized by the immune system. This recognition can trigger innate immune responses, particularly through the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chiappinelli et al., 2015; Kassiotis & Stoye, 2016). The adaptive immune system also plays a role in responding to endogenous retroelements. T cells and B cells can recognize retroelement-derived antigens, leading to immune responses that can contribute to autoimmunity and inflammation (Young et al., 2012; Volkman & Stetson, 2014). Despite their potential to cause harm, emerging evidence suggests that endogenous retroelements are not merely genomic parasites but have been co-opted by the host for beneficial functions. For example, the expression of certain retroelements is necessary for the development and function of the immune system, including the regulation of IFN responses and the maintenance of immune homeostasis (Chuong et al., 2016; Ito et al., 2017). Furthermore, immune reactivity to endogenous retroelements has been implicated in cancer immunosurveillance, resistance to exogenous viral infections, and shaping the host's response to the microbiota (Rooney et al., 2015; Kassiotis, 2017). The study of endogenous retroelements and their interaction with the immune system is a rapidly evolving field that promises to deepen our understanding of immune system function and its contribution to disease. By elucidating the mechanisms by which the immune system recognizes and responds to these ancient viral sequences, researchers can uncover new therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. Moreover, the exploration of the beneficial roles of endogenous retroelements in immune system development and function highlights the complexity of the host-pathogen relationship and the evolutionary interplay between the genome and the immune system.", "References": [{"title": "Inhibiting DNA Methylation Causes an Interferon Response in Cancer via dsRNA Including Endogenous Retroviruses", "authors": "Chiappinelli, Katherine B., Strissel, Pamela L., Desrichard, Alexis, Li, Huili, Henke, Christine, Akman, Benjamin, Hein, Alexander, Rote, Neal S., Cope, Leslie M., Snyder, Alexandra, Makarov, Vladimir, Budhu, Sadna, Slamon, Dennis J., Wolchok, Jedd D., Pardoll, Drew M., Beckmann, Matthias W., Zahnow, Cynthia A., Mergoub, Taha, Chan, Timothy A., Baylin, Stephen B., Strick, Reiner", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "162", "first page": "974", "last page": "986", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.011"}, {"title": "Immune responses to endogenous retroelements: taking the bad with the good", "authors": "Kassiotis, George, Stoye, Jonathan P.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "207", "last page": "219", "DOI": "10.1038/nri.2016.27"}, {"title": "Regulation of the anti-tumour immune response by cancer-associated fibroblasts", "authors": "Young, Helen L., Rowling, Emma J., Bugatti, Mattia, Giurisato, Emanuele, Luheshi, Nadia, Arozarena, Imanol, Acosta, Juan C., Kamarashev, Jivko, Frederick, Dennie T., Cooper, Zachary A., Reuben, Alexandre, Gillet, Jean-Pierre, Liu, Qin, Sondak, Vernon K., Flaherty, Keith T., Wargo, Jennifer A., Tetzlaff, Michael T., Lazar, Alexander J., Marais, Richard, Lo, Roger S., Turajlic, Samra, Wellbrock, Claudia", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2012", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1233", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms2236"}, {"title": "The enemy within: endogenous retroelements and autoimmune disease", "authors": "Volkman, Hannah E., Stetson, Daniel B.", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "15", "first page": "415", "last page": "422", "DOI": "10.1038/ni.2872"}, {"title": "Regulatory evolution of innate immunity through co-option of endogenous retroviruses", "authors": "Chuong, Edward B., Elde, Nels C., Feschotte, CÃ©dric", "journal": "Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "351", "first page": "1083", "last page": "1087", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aad5497"}, {"title": "Endogenous retroviruses drive species-specific germline transcriptomes in mammals", "authors": "Ito, Junetsu, Kimura, Issei, Soper, Andrew, Coudray, Alexandre, Batten, Ken, Balazs, Alejandro B., Landau, Nathaniel R.", "journal": "Nature Structural & Molecular Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "24", "first page": "267", "last page": "277", "DOI": "10.1038/nsmb.3365"}, {"title": "Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity", "authors": "Rooney, Michael S., Shukla, Sachet A., Wu, Catherine J., Getz, Gad, Hacohen, Nir", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "160", "first page": "48", "last page": "61", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2014.12.033"}, {"title": "The role of endogenous retroviruses in the evolution of immune responses", "authors": "Kassiotis, George", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2017", "volumes": "372", "first page": "20160277", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2016.0277"}]}
