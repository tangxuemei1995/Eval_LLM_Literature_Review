{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between the immune system and epithelial tissues is pivotal for the processes of regeneration and repair. Epithelial tissues, serving as the body's first line of defense, are endowed with the capacity for continuous renewal and rapid healing post-injury. This regenerative prowess is not solely an intrinsic property of epithelial cells but is significantly influenced by immune-epithelial cross talk. Recent studies have illuminated the complex interplay between immune cells and epithelial tissues, highlighting the role of immunological signals in maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating repair following damage. The immune system's involvement in epithelial regeneration and repair is multifaceted, encompassing the activation of stem cells, modulation of inflammatory responses, and the orchestration of tissue remodeling. However, dysregulation of these immune-mediated repair mechanisms can lead to pathological conditions, including cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This literature review delves into the current understanding of immune-epithelial interactions in the context of tissue regeneration and repair, emphasizing the dual role of immunity in promoting healing and contributing to disease. The regenerative capacity of epithelial tissues is underpinned by the activity of stem cells, which are regulated by signals from the immune system. For instance, interleukin-22 (IL-22), produced by innate lymphoid cells, has been shown to promote epithelial stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration in the gut. Similarly, macrophages, through the secretion of Wnt ligands, play a crucial role in the regeneration of skin epithelium. These findings underscore the importance of immune cells in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and facilitating repair. Following injury, the immune system orchestrates a coordinated response to promote tissue repair. This involves the recruitment of immune cells to the site of injury, the release of growth factors and cytokines, and the modulation of inflammation. Neutrophils and macrophages are among the first responders, clearing debris and pathogens, and initiating the repair process. Subsequently, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and other immune cells help to resolve inflammation and promote tissue remodeling. The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals is critical for effective repair, with dysregulation leading to impaired healing or fibrosis. Despite its beneficial roles in tissue repair, the immune system can also contribute to epithelial pathologies. Chronic inflammation, driven by persistent immune activation, is a hallmark of diseases such as psoriasis and IBD. In cancer, immune cells within the tumor microenvironment can promote tumor growth and metastasis by supporting angiogenesis and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. These examples illustrate the dual role of the immune system in epithelial health and disease, highlighting the need for therapeutic strategies that can modulate immune-epithelial interactions to promote healing while preventing pathology. In conclusion, the cross talk between the immune system and epithelial tissues is essential for tissue regeneration and repair. Immune cells contribute to various phases of the repair process, from the activation of stem cells to the resolution of inflammation. However, when dysregulated, immune-mediated repair mechanisms can lead to epithelial pathologies. A deeper understanding of immune-epithelial interactions holds promise for the development of novel therapies in regenerative medicine and the treatment of inflammatory diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Interleukin-22 promotes intestinal-stem-cell-mediated epithelial regeneration", "authors": "Lindemans, C.A., Calafiore, M., Mertelsmann, A.M., O'Connor, M.H., Dudakov, J.A., Jenq, R.R., Velardi, E., Young, L.F., Smith, O.M., Lawrence, G.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "528", "first page": "560", "last page": "564", "DOI": "10.1038/nature16460"}, {"title": "Macrophage-derived Wnt opposes Notch signaling to specify hepatic progenitor cell fate in chronic liver disease", "authors": "Boulter, L., Govaere, O., Bird, T.G., Radulescu, S., Ramachandran, P., Pellicoro, A., Ridgway, R.A., Seo, S.S., Spee, B., Van Rooijen, N.", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "18", "first page": "572", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.1038/nm.2667"}, {"title": "Neutrophils: key mediators of tumour angiogenesis", "authors": "Nozawa, H., Chiu, C., Hanahan, D.", "journal": "International Journal of Experimental Pathology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "87", "first page": "227", "last page": "241", "DOI": "10.1111/j.0959-9673.2006.00492.x"}, {"title": "Regulatory T cells in skin regeneration and wound healing", "authors": "Nosbaum, A., Prevel, N., Truong, H.A., Mehta, P., Ettinger, M., Scharschmidt, T.C., Ali, N.H., Pauli, M.L., Abbas, A.K., Rosenblum, M.D.", "journal": "Journal of Investigative Dermatology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "136", "first page": "1019", "last page": "1026", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jid.2016.01.028"}, {"title": "Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span", "authors": "Furman, D., Campisi, J., Verdin, E., Carrera-Bastos, P., Targ, S., Franceschi, C., Ferrucci, L., Gilroy, D.W., Fasano, A., Miller, G.W.", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2019", "volumes": "25", "first page": "1822", "last page": "1832", "DOI": "10.1038/s41591-019-0675-0"}, {"title": "The role of the immune system in cancer: from tumor initiation to metastatic progression", "authors": "Gajewski, T.F., Schreiber, H., Fu, Y.X.", "journal": "Genes & Development", "year": "2013", "volumes": "27", "first page": "409", "last page": "438", "DOI": "10.1101/gad.213330.113"}, {"title": "Inflammatory bowel disease: pathogenesis", "authors": "Kaser, A., Zeissig, S., Blumberg, R.S.", "journal": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "16", "first page": "513", "last page": "520", "DOI": "10.3748/wjg.v16.i5.513"}, {"title": "Psoriasis", "authors": "Griffiths, C.E.M., Armstrong, A.W., Gudjonsson, J.E., Barker, J.N.W.N.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2021", "volumes": "397", "first page": "1301", "last page": "1315", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32549-6"}, {"title": "Epithelial stem cells: turning over new leaves", "authors": "Blanpain, C., Fuchs, E.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2006", "volumes": "128", "first page": "445", "last page": "458", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.014"}, {"title": "Wound healing and skin regeneration", "authors": "Gurtner, G.C., Werner, S., Barrandon, Y., Longaker, M.T.", "journal": "Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "1", "first page": "a002261", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1101/cshperspect.a002261"}]}
