{"Literature Review": "Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of T cells. Its influence spans across various stages of T cell development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This literature review delves into the intricate mechanisms by which TGF-β modulates T cell functions, drawing on recent studies to elucidate its complex roles in immune regulation. TGF-β is instrumental in maintaining the quiescence of naive CD4+ T cells, a critical aspect of immune homeostasis. It achieves this by suppressing the expression of activation markers and inhibiting the proliferation of these cells in response to antigenic stimulation (Li et al., 2006). Furthermore, TGF-β exerts a suppressive effect on the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, which are pivotal in orchestrating immune responses against intracellular and extracellular pathogens, respectively (Gorelik & Flavell, 2002). In contrast, TGF-β promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells, subsets of CD4+ T cells implicated in autoimmune diseases and allergic responses, highlighting its dual role in immune regulation (Veldhoen et al., 2006; Dardalhon et al., 2008). A seminal function of TGF-β in the immune system is its role in the induction of Foxp3 expression in naive T cells, a transcription factor essential for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases, and TGF-β's role in their induction underscores its importance in immune homeostasis (Chen et al., 2003). In the context of CD8+ T cells, TGF-β is vital for the differentiation of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which are essential for local immune surveillance and rapid response to pathogens upon re-exposure (Mackay et al., 2013). However, TGF-β also suppresses the effector functions of CD8+ T cells, illustrating its role in balancing immune activation and tolerance (Thomas & Massagué, 2005). Beyond conventional T cells, TGF-β regulates the generation and function of unconventional T cells, including natural killer T (NKT) cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). These cells play diverse roles in immune defense, tissue repair, and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity, and TGF-β's regulation of these cells further emphasizes its central role in immune system regulation (Coombes et al., 2007; Maynard et al., 2007). In summary, TGF-β is a key regulator of T cell biology, with its effects spanning across various T cell subsets and functions. Its ability to both promote and suppress immune responses highlights its dual role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. The ongoing research into TGF-β's regulatory mechanisms continues to uncover its complex roles in the immune system, offering potential therapeutic targets for a range of immune-related diseases.", "References": [{"title": "TGF-beta: a master of all T cell trades", "authors": "Li, M.O., Wan, Y.Y., Sanjabi, S., Robertson, A.K., Flavell, R.A.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2006", "volumes": "126", "first page": "247", "last page": "264", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.005"}, {"title": "Transforming growth factor-beta in T-cell biology", "authors": "Gorelik, L., Flavell, R.A.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "2", "first page": "46", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1038/nri704"}, {"title": "Transforming growth factor-beta induces development of the T(H)17 lineage", "authors": "Veldhoen, M., Hocking, R.J., Atkins, C.J., Locksley, R.M., Stockinger, B.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "441", "first page": "231", "last page": "234", "DOI": "10.1038/nature04754"}, {"title": "Role of TGF-beta in the induction of Foxp3 expression and T regulatory cell function", "authors": "Chen, W., Jin, W., Hardegen, N., Lei, K.J., Li, L., Marinos, N., McGrady, G., Wahl, S.M.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2003", "volumes": "112", "first page": "1437", "last page": "1443", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI19441"}, {"title": "TGF-beta directly targets cytotoxic T cell functions during tumor evasion of immune surveillance", "authors": "Thomas, D.A., Massagué, J.", "journal": "Cancer Cell", "year": "2005", "volumes": "8", "first page": "369", "last page": "380", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ccr.2005.10.012"}, {"title": "A functionally specialized population of mucosal CD103+ DCs induces Foxp3+ regulatory T cells via a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent mechanism", "authors": "Coombes, J.L., Siddiqui, K.R., Arancibia-Cárcamo, C.V., Hall, J., Sun, C.M., Belkaid, Y., Powrie, F.", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Medicine", "year": "2007", "volumes": "204", "first page": "1757", "last page": "1764", "DOI": "10.1084/jem.20070590"}, {"title": "Regulatory T cells expressing interleukin 10 develop from Foxp3+ and Foxp3- precursor cells in the absence of interleukin 10", "authors": "Maynard, C.L., Harrington, L.E., Janowski, K.M., Oliver, J.R., Zindl, C.L., Rudensky, A.Y., Weaver, C.T.", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "8", "first page": "931", "last page": "941", "DOI": "10.1038/ni1504"}, {"title": "The developmental pathway for CD103+CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells of skin", "authors": "Mackay, L.K., Rahimpour, A., Ma, J.Z., Collins, N., Stock, A.T., Hafon, M.L., Vega-Ramos, J., Lauzurica, P., Mueller, S.N., Stefanovic, T., Tscharke, D.C., Heath, W.R., Inouye, M., Carbone, F.R., Gebhardt, T.", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "14", "first page": "1294", "last page": "1301", "DOI": "10.1038/ni.2744"}, {"title": "IL-4 inhibits TGF-beta-induced Foxp3+ T cells and, together with TGF-beta, generates IL-9+ IL-10+ Foxp3(-) effector T cells", "authors": "Dardalhon, V., Awasthi, A., Kwon, H., Galileos, G., Gao, W., Sobel, R.A., Mitsdoerffer, M., Strom, T.B., Elyaman, W., Ho, I.C., Khoury, S., Oukka, M., Kuchroo, V.K.", "journal": "Nature Immunology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1347", "last page": "1355", "DOI": "10.1038/ni.1677"}, {"title": "TGF-beta and immune cells: an important regulatory axis in the tumor microenvironment and progression", "authors": "Flavell, R.A., Sanjabi, S., Wrzesinski, S.H., Licona-Limón, P.", "journal": "Trends in Immunology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "31", "first page": "220", "last page": "227", "DOI": "10.1016/j.it.2010.04.002"}]}
