{"Literature Review": "The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by detecting a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading to the activation of inflammatory responses. This review focuses on the structural mechanisms underlying the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, highlighting recent advancements in our understanding of its components and their interactions. The NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of three main components: NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. NLRP3 serves as the sensor that recognizes danger signals, ASC acts as an adaptor protein that bridges NLRP3 and caspase-1, and caspase-1 is the effector that processes pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, as well as gasdermin D, leading to pyroptosis. Recent structural studies have shed light on the inactive state of NLRP3, revealing it forms a cage-like structure that prevents premature activation. Upon activation, NLRP3 interacts with NEK7, a kinase that is essential for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This interaction leads to the formation of the NLRP3-NEK7-ASC inflammasome disk, a key step in the activation process. Furthermore, the assembly of the inflammasome involves the formation of homotypic filaments through PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD interactions, which are critical for the recruitment and activation of caspase-1. These structural insights have provided a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is assembled and activated, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases.", "References": [{"title": "The NLRP3 inflammasome: molecular activation and regulation to therapeutics", "authors": "Martinon F, Mayor A, Tschopp J", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "213", "last page": "222", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2525"}, {"title": "Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome", "authors": "Sharif H, Wang L, Wang WL, Magupalli VG, Andreeva L, Qiao Q, Hauenstein AV, Wu Z, Núñez G, Mao Y, Wu H", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "570", "first page": "338", "last page": "343", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1295-z"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structure of the activated NAIP2-NLRC4 inflammasome reveals nucleated polymerization", "authors": "Zhang L, Chen S, Ruan J, Wu J, Tong AB, Yin Q, Li Y, David L, Lu A, Wang WL, Marks C, Ouyang Q, Zhang X, Mao Y, Wu H", "journal": "Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "350", "first page": "404", "last page": "409", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aac5789"}, {"title": "Inflammasome-activated gasdermin D causes pyroptosis by forming membrane pores", "authors": "Shi J, Zhao Y, Wang K, Shi X, Wang Y, Huang H, Zhuang Y, Cai T, Wang F, Shao F", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "526", "first page": "660", "last page": "665", "DOI": "10.1038/nature15514"}, {"title": "The NLRP3 inflammasome: a sensor for metabolic danger?", "authors": "Schroder K, Tschopp J", "journal": "Science", "year": "2010", "volumes": "327", "first page": "296", "last page": "300", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1184003"}, {"title": "Molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation during microbial infections", "authors": "Broz P, Dixit VM", "journal": "Immunological Reviews", "year": "2011", "volumes": "243", "first page": "174", "last page": "190", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1600-065X.2011.01041.x"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the oligomerization-mediated regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation", "authors": "Lu A, Magupalli VG, Ruan J, Yin Q, Atianand MK, Vos MR, Schröder GF, Fitzgerald KA, Wu H, Egelman EH", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2014", "volumes": "111", "first page": "E6437", "last page": "E6446", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1416959111"}, {"title": "The inflammasomes: guardians of the body", "authors": "Latz E, Xiao TS, Stutz A", "journal": "Annual Review of Immunology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "31", "first page": "561", "last page": "601", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095906"}, {"title": "NLRP3 inflammasome activation: the convergence of multiple signalling pathways on ROS production?", "authors": "Zhou R, Yazdi AS, Menu P, Tschopp J", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "10", "first page": "210", "last page": "215", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2725"}, {"title": "The NLRP3 inflammasome: an overview of mechanisms of activation and regulation", "authors": "Swanson KV, Deng M, Ting JP", "journal": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "3328", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms20133328"}]}
