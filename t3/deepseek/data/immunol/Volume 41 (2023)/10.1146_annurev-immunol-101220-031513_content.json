{"Literature Review": "The burgeoning field of immunometabolism has significantly advanced our understanding of the intricate relationship between immune responses and metabolic processes. This literature review delves into the evolution of systems immunology approaches to metabolism, highlighting key studies and technological advancements that have shaped this interdisciplinary domain. The integration of computational biology, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging has been pivotal in elucidating the complex physiological interplay between immunity and metabolism. Early research in immunometabolism primarily focused on bulk metabolic profiling and the expression analysis of metabolic regulators. These studies laid the groundwork for appreciating the nuanced regulation of immune responses by metabolic pathways (O'Neill et al., 2016). However, the physiological complexity of immunometabolic regulation in vivo necessitated a transition towards more sophisticated, systems-level approaches. Recent advancements in spatially resolved metabolic imaging have enabled researchers to visualize metabolic processes within the immune system with unprecedented detail. This technology has been instrumental in uncovering the spatial organization of metabolic activities in immune cells and their microenvironment (Zhang et al., 2019). Furthermore, the development of computational algorithms for multi-modal data integration has facilitated the synthesis of diverse datasets, offering a more comprehensive understanding of immunometabolic networks. These algorithms have been applied to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data, revealing novel insights into the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells during activation and differentiation (Artyomov et al., 2017). The application of systems immunology approaches has also shed light on the metabolic underpinnings of immune cell function and fate. For instance, studies leveraging transcriptomics and metabolomics have identified key metabolic pathways that regulate T cell differentiation and function (Pearce et al., 2013). Similarly, computational modeling of metabolic networks has provided insights into the metabolic flexibility of macrophages in response to different stimuli (O'Neill & Pearce, 2016). These findings underscore the importance of metabolic regulation in determining immune cell behavior and highlight the potential of targeting metabolic pathways for therapeutic intervention. In addition to advancing our fundamental understanding of immunometabolism, systems immunology approaches have also contributed to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. For example, the identification of metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer cells has led to the exploration of metabolic inhibitors as potential cancer immunotherapies (Ho et al., 2015). Moreover, the integration of metabolic imaging with computational modeling has facilitated the design of personalized metabolic interventions for autoimmune diseases (Wang et al., 2020). These examples illustrate the translational potential of systems immunology approaches in addressing complex immunological challenges. In conclusion, the field of immunometabolism has undergone a paradigm shift with the advent of systems immunology approaches. The integration of advanced technologies and computational methods has provided a more holistic understanding of the metabolic regulation of immune responses. As we continue to unravel the complexities of immunometabolism, it is imperative to leverage these systems-level approaches to uncover novel therapeutic targets and strategies. The future of immunometabolism research lies in the continued innovation and integration of technologies that can capture the dynamic interplay between metabolism and immunity with greater precision and depth.", "References": [{"title": "Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function", "authors": "Luke A.
