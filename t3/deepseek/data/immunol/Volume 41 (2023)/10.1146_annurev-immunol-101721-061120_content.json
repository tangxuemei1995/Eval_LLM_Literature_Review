{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to unprecedented global health challenges. A critical aspect of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves T cells, which play a pivotal role in controlling viral infections. This literature review focuses on the current understanding of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the impact of infection and vaccination, the role of T cells in disease severity, and the durability and variant resilience of T cell memory. Recent studies have demonstrated that both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination induce robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. These responses are characterized by their polyfunctionality and the recognition of multiple epitopes across the viral genome. Early and robust T cell responses have been associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes, suggesting that T cells contribute significantly to controlling the severity of the disease. This is supported by animal model data, which indicate that while antibodies are crucial for preventing infection, T cells are essential for reducing disease severity and controlling viral replication. The durability of T cell memory following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been a subject of extensive research. Studies have shown that T cell memory persists for at least six months post-vaccination, providing a sustained immune defense against the virus. This is particularly important in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, which have shown the ability to evade neutralizing antibody responses. However, most CD4 and CD8 T cell responses remain preserved against these variants, highlighting the resilience of T cell immunity. Despite the significant progress made in understanding T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, several knowledge gaps remain. These include the long-term durability of T cell memory beyond six months, the impact of T cell responses on transmission dynamics, and the potential for T cell-based vaccines to provide broad protection against emerging variants. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for developing more effective strategies to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics. In conclusion, T cells play a critical role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, contributing to disease control and severity reduction. The preservation of T cell responses against emerging variants underscores the importance of T cell immunity in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. Continued research into T cell responses will be essential for enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunity and informing the development of next-generation vaccines.", "References": [{"title": "Comprehensive mapping of immune perturbations associated with severe COVID-19", "authors": "Mathew, D., Giles, J.R., Baxter, A.E., Oldridge, D.A., Greenplate, A.R., Wu, J.E., Alanio, C., Kuri-Cervantes, L., Pampena, M.B., D'Andrea, K.", "journal": "Science Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "5", "first page": "eabd7114", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciimmunol.abd7114"}, {"title": "SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls", "authors": "Le Bert, N., Tan, A.T., Kunasegaran, K., Tham, C.Y.L., Hafezi, M., Chia, A., Chng, M.H.Y., Lin, M., Tan, N., Linster, M.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2020", "volumes": "584", "first page": "457", "last page": "462", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-020-2550-z"}, {"title": "Targets of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in humans with COVID-19 disease and unexposed individuals", "authors": "Grifoni, A., Weiskopf, D., Ramirez, S.I., Mateus, J., Dan, J.M., Moderbacher, C.R., Rawlings, S.A., Sutherland, A., Premkumar, L., Jadi, R.S.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "181", "first page": "1489", "last page": "1501.e15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.015"}, {"title": "Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19", "authors": "Sette, A., Crotty, S.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2021", "volumes": "184", "first page": "861", "last page": "880", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.007"}, {"title": "Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection", "authors": "Dan, J.M., Mateus, J., Kato, Y., Hastie, K.M., Yu, E.D., Faliti, C.E., Grifoni, A., Ramirez, S.I., Haupt, S., Frazier, A.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "371", "first page": "eabf4063", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abf4063"}, {"title": "SARS-CoV-2 variants, spike mutations and immune escape", "authors": "Harvey, W.T., Carabelli, A.M., Jackson, B., Gupta, R.K., Thomson, E.C., Harrison, E.M., Ludden, C., Reeve, R., Rambaut, A., Peacock, S.J.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "19", "first page": "409", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1038/s41579-021-00573-0"}, {"title": "CD8+ T cells contribute to survival in patients with COVID-19 and hematologic cancer", "authors": "Bange, E.M., Han, N.A., Wileyto, P., Kim, J.Y., Gouma, S., Robinson, J., Greenplate, A.R., Hwee, M.A., Porterfield, F., Owoyemi, O.", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2021", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1280", "last page": "1289", "DOI": "10.1038/s41591-021-01386-7"}, {"title": "Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19", "authors": "Sekine, T., Perez-Potti, A., Rivera-Ballesteros, O., Str√•lin, K., Gorin, J.B., Olsson, A., Llewellyn-Lacey, S., Kamal, H., Bogdanovic, G., Muschiol, S.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "183", "first page": "158", "last page": "168.e14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.017"}, {"title": "Persistence and decay of human antibody responses to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 patients", "authors": "Ibarrondo, F.J., Fulcher, J.A., Goodman-Meza, D., Elliott, J., Hofmann, C., Hausner, M.A., Ferbas, K.G., Tobin, N.H., Aldrovandi, G.M., Yang, O.O.", "journal": "Science Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "5", "first page": "eabe0367", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciimmunol.abe0367"}, {"title": "Memory T cell responses targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are preserved in COVID-19 convalescent patients for 10 months", "authors": "Wang, Z., Muecksch, F., Schaefer-Babajew, D., Finkin, S., Viant, C., Gaebler, C., Hoffmann, H.H., Barnes, C.O., Cipolla, M., Ramos, V.", "journal": "Science Immunology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "6", "first page": "eabf8897", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciimmunol.abf8897"}]}
