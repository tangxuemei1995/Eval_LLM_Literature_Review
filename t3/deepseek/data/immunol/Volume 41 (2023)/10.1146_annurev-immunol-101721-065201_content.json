{"Literature Review": "The study of immunity to infection has long been a cornerstone of both human and mouse immunology, with each model offering unique insights into the complex mechanisms of host defense. Despite the undeniable differences between mice and humans, the genetic underpinnings of immunity provide a common ground for reconciling findings from both species. This literature review explores the genetic perspective in reconciling mouse and human immunology, focusing on the study of inborn errors of immunity and genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases. The divergence in infectious phenotypes between humans and mice with similar genetic mutations has puzzled researchers for decades. Studies have shown that while mice serve as invaluable models for understanding the basic principles of immunity, the translation of these findings to human immunology requires careful consideration of species-specific differences (Casanova & Abel, 2004). The genetic approach, particularly the use of forward-genetics studies, has been instrumental in identifying key components of the immune system that are conserved across species. For instance, the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in innate immunity was first made in Drosophila and later confirmed in both mice and humans, highlighting the power of genetic studies in uncovering universal mechanisms of immunity (Janeway & Medzhitov, 2002). However, reverse-genetics studies, which involve the targeted disruption of specific genes to observe the resulting phenotype, have sometimes led to discrepancies between mouse and human immunology. These discrepancies underscore the importance of considering the genetic background and environmental factors that can influence the outcome of such studies (Mestas & Hughes, 2004). The study of inborn errors of immunity in humans has provided a wealth of information on the genetic basis of susceptibility to infectious diseases. Patients with mutations in genes critical for immune function often present with unique infectious phenotypes that can differ significantly from those observed in corresponding mouse models (Zhang et al., 2007). This divergence highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of how genetic mutations impact immunity in a species-specific manner. Recent advances in genetic technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and next-generation sequencing, have opened new avenues for directly comparing the immune responses of mice and humans at the genetic level. These technologies have facilitated the identification of novel genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in both species, providing a more comprehensive picture of the genetic architecture of immunity (Jinek et al., 2012). Furthermore, the integration of genetic data from mouse and human studies has led to the discovery of conserved pathways and mechanisms of immunity, as well as species-specific adaptations that have evolved in response to different pathogenic challenges. For example, the study of the interferon pathway has revealed both shared and unique aspects of antiviral immunity in mice and humans, offering insights into the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the immune system (Schneider et al., 2014). In conclusion, the genetic perspective offers a powerful framework for reconciling mouse and human immunology. By leveraging the strengths of both forward and reverse-genetics approaches, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of immunity to infection that are common and specific to these two species. The continued integration of genetic data from mouse and human studies will be essential for advancing our knowledge of inborn errors of immunity and genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases, ultimately leading to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "The human model: a genetic dissection of immunity to infection in natural conditions", "authors": "Jean-Laurent Casanova, Laurent Abel", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "4", "first page": "55", "last page": "66", "DOI": "10.1038/nri1264"}, {"title": "Innate immune recognition", "authors": "Charles Janeway, Ruslan Medzhitov", "journal": "Annual Review of Immunology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "20", "first page": "197", "last page": "216", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.immunol.20.083001.084359"}, {"title": "Of mice and not men: differences between mouse and human immunology", "authors": "Jessica Mestas, Christopher C.W.
