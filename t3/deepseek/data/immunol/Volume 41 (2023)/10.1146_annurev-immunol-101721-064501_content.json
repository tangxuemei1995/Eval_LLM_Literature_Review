{"Literature Review": "The aging process is accompanied by significant changes in the immune system, particularly within the T cell compartment. These changes are characterized by a reduction in the naive T cell pool and an accumulation of memory-like T cells, which exhibit a phenotype of terminal differentiation and senescence. This literature review explores the role of extremely differentiated T cell subsets in tissue deterioration during aging, focusing on their phenotypic and functional alterations, and their contribution to inflammaging. One of the most notable changes in the aging immune system is the involution of the thymus, which leads to a decreased output of naive T cells. This reduction in naive T cells is compounded by the accumulation of memory-like T cells, which have been shown to acquire a senescent phenotype characterized by the loss of costimulatory molecules and the acquisition of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (Pawelec et al., 2014). These senescent T cells are not only less effective in responding to new antigens but also contribute to chronic inflammation through the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Among the various subsets of age-associated T cells, extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer (NK) properties have been identified. These cells exhibit enhanced cytotoxic activity but are also implicated in tissue damage due to their ability to kill target cells in a non-specific manner (Chiu et al., 2013). Similarly, exhausted T cells, which are characterized by altered cytokine production and reduced proliferative capacity, accumulate with age and contribute to immune dysfunction (Wherry & Kurachi, 2015). Regulatory T cells (Tregs), traditionally known for their role in maintaining immune tolerance, also undergo changes during aging. Aged Tregs have been shown to acquire proinflammatory features, which may contribute to the breakdown of immune tolerance and the promotion of inflammaging (Lages et al., 2008). Importantly, these age-associated T cell subsets lose their lymph node homing capacity and preferentially migrate to nonlymphoid tissues. This altered migration pattern is thought to contribute to tissue deterioration and the development of age-related diseases (Franceschi et al., 2000). The accumulation of these T cell subsets in nonlymphoid tissues is associated with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the induction of local inflammation, which can lead to tissue damage and dysfunction (De Martinis et al., 2005). In conclusion, the aging process leads to significant remodeling of the T cell compartment, characterized by the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets. These cells contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging through their altered phenotype, function, and migration patterns. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes may provide insights into the development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of aging on the immune system and tissue health.", "References": [{"title": "Immunosenescence: role of cytomegalovirus", "authors": "Graham Pawelec, Anis Larbi, Ewa Derhovanessian", "journal": "Experimental Gerontology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1", "last page": "5", "DOI": "10.1016/j.exger.2013.11.010"}, {"title": "Cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties in aging", "authors": "Brian C.
