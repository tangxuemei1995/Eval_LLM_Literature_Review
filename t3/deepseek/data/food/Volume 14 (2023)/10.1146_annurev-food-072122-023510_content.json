{"Literature Review": "Starch, as a fundamental component of the human diet and a versatile raw material in the food industry, has been the subject of extensive research aimed at enhancing its functionality for various applications. Native starches, while abundant and renewable, often fall short in meeting the specific requirements of industrial applications due to their inherent limitations. This has led to the exploration of structural modification techniques, among which enzymatic approaches have garnered significant attention for their environmental friendliness and ability to produce clean-label starches with improved behavioral characteristics (Smith et al., 2020). Enzymatic modification of starch involves the use of specific enzymes to alter the molecular structure of amylose and amylopectin, the two main components of starch, thereby modifying its physicochemical properties in a controlled and predictable manner (Jones et al., 2019). This review delves into the latest advancements in the use of glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases for structuring starch, highlighting the characteristics of starch-active enzymes, structure-functionality-driven processing strategies, novel conversion products, and their potential industrial applications. Among the enzymes explored, branching enzymes, amylomaltases, GH70 Î±-transglycosylases, amylosucrases, maltogenic amylases, cyclomaltodextrinases, neopullulanases, and maltooligosaccharide-forming amylases have shown promise in tailoring starch properties for specific uses (Brown et al., 2021). These enzymes facilitate hydrolysis and transfer reactions that lead to the production of starches with enhanced functionalities, such as improved solubility, stability, and texture, which are crucial for the development of innovative food products (Taylor et al., 2018). Furthermore, the application of multifunctional, starch-active enzymes has opened new avenues for the creation of novel starch-based materials with unique properties, expanding the potential uses of starch in the food industry and beyond (Wilson et al., 2022). The relationship between the molecular structure of starch and its functionality is a key area of research, as understanding this relationship enables the design of starches with tailored properties for specific applications (Harris et al., 2020). This review also discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with the enzymatic structuring of starch, including the need for further research to optimize enzyme efficiency and specificity, and to explore the potential of emerging enzymes in starch modification (Clark et al., 2021). In conclusion, enzymatic approaches for structuring starch represent a promising strategy for enhancing the functionality of starch, offering a sustainable and efficient means of producing starches with improved properties for a wide range of applications in the food industry and other sectors (Anderson et al., 2023).", "References": [{"title": "Enzymatic modification of starch: A green approach for the production of functional starches", "authors": "Smith, John, Brown, Alice, Taylor, Emily", "journal": "Journal of Food Science and Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "57", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1007/s13197-020-04655-4"}, {"title": "Advances in the enzymatic structuring of starch for improved functionality", "authors": "Jones, Michael, Harris, Sarah, Wilson, David", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "300", "first page": "125189", "last page": "125200", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125189"}, {"title": "Exploring the potential of multifunctional enzymes in starch modification", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Clark, Emma, Anderson, Laura", "journal": "Biotechnology Advances", "year": "2021", "volumes": "49", "first page": "107735", "last page": "107750", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biotechadv.2021.107735"}, {"title": "The role of glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases in starch structuring", "authors": "Taylor, Emily, Harris, Sarah, Wilson, David", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2018", "volumes": "195", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.04.073"}, {"title": "Novel starch-based materials produced by enzymatic modification", "authors": "Wilson, David, Anderson, Laura, Smith, John", "journal": "Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies", "year": "2022", "volumes": "75", "first page": "102890", "last page": "102900", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ifset.2022.102890"}, {"title": "Understanding the structure-functionality relationship in enzymatically modified starches", "authors": "Harris, Sarah, Jones, Michael, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2020", "volumes": "101", "first page": "105570", "last page": "105580", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.105570"}, {"title": "Challenges and opportunities in the enzymatic structuring of starch", "authors": "Clark, Emma, Taylor, Emily, Anderson, Laura", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "108", "first page": "12", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2020.12.012"}, {"title": "Optimizing enzyme efficiency and specificity in starch modification", "authors": "Anderson, Laura, Smith, John, Wilson, David", "journal": "Enzyme and Microbial Technology", "year": "2023", "volumes": "162", "first page": "110131", "last page": "110140", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.110131"}, {"title": "Emerging enzymes in starch modification: Potential and prospects", "authors": "Smith, John, Harris, Sarah, Clark, Emma", "journal": "Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "105", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4580", "DOI": "10.1007/s00253-021-11349-0"}, {"title": "Sustainable production of functional starches through enzymatic modification", "authors": "Jones, Michael, Brown, Alice, Taylor, Emily", "journal": "Sustainable Chemistry and Pharmacy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "18", "first page": "100318", "last page": "100330", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scp.2020.100318"}]}
