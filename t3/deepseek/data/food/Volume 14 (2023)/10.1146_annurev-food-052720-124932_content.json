{"Literature Review": "Meat proteins undergo significant molecular changes during processing, which can affect their quality and nutritional value. These changes are primarily due to oxidative processes that can alter the structure and functionality of proteins. Oxidation of meat proteins can lead to the formation of carbonyl groups, loss of sulfhydryl groups, and cross-linking of proteins, which can impact the texture, flavor, and nutritional quality of meat (Lund et al., 2011). The extent of these changes depends on the processing methods used, such as cooking, curing, and storage conditions (Estevez, 2011). Cooking, for instance, can induce protein denaturation and aggregation, affecting the digestibility and bioavailability of amino acids (Santé-Lhoutellier et al., 2008). Curing and smoking can introduce additional oxidative stress, leading to the formation of potentially harmful compounds like nitrosamines (Honikel, 2008). The nutritional value of meat is also influenced by the bioavailability of its proteins. Processing can enhance or reduce the digestibility of meat proteins, affecting the absorption of essential amino acids (Bax et al., 2012). High intake of processed meats has been associated with increased health risks, including cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer (Rohrmann et al., 2013). These risks are partly attributed to the formation of harmful compounds during processing, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines (Cross et al., 2010). Preventive strategies to mitigate these risks include the use of antioxidants, modified atmosphere packaging, and the development of novel processing technologies that minimize oxidative damage (Falowo et al., 2014). Antioxidants, both natural and synthetic, can scavenge free radicals and reduce protein oxidation, thereby preserving the quality and nutritional value of meat (Lund et al., 2011). Modified atmosphere packaging can limit the exposure of meat to oxygen, slowing down oxidative processes (McMillin, 2008). Novel processing technologies, such as high-pressure processing and pulsed electric fields, offer promising alternatives to traditional methods by reducing the thermal and oxidative stress on meat proteins (Troy et al., 2016). In conclusion, understanding the molecular changes of meat proteins during processing is crucial for developing strategies to preserve their quality and nutritional value. Future research should focus on optimizing processing conditions and exploring innovative technologies to minimize the adverse effects of processing on meat proteins.", "References": [{"title": "Protein oxidation in meat and meat products: Challenges for antioxidative protection", "authors": "Marianne N.
