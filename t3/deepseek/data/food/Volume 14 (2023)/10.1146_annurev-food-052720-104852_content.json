{"Literature Review": "The quest for nutritionally improved edible plant oils has led to significant advancements in metabolic engineering, offering a promising alternative to traditional breeding methods. Metabolic engineering allows for the precise modification of oil composition in oil crops by altering endogenous genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways. This approach has been instrumental in increasing the content of desirable components such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E, while reducing the levels of undesirable components in seed oils (Napier et al., 2019). One of the key achievements in this field has been the development of high oleic oils, which have a higher monounsaturated fat content and are more stable for cooking and processing (Clemente & Cahoon, 2009). The introduction of novel nutritional components, such as omega-3 LC-PUFAs, into oil crops has required the transgenic expression of novel genes, a process that has faced significant challenges but has also seen remarkable progress (Ruiz-Lopez et al., 2014). Recent advancements in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, have further enhanced the precision and efficiency of metabolic engineering in oil crops, enabling the targeted modification of genes to improve oil quality and nutritional value (Zhang et al., 2018). The commercial availability of some of these engineered oils marks a significant milestone in the field, demonstrating the potential of metabolic engineering to meet the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food sources (Vanhercke et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these technologies also raises important considerations regarding regulatory approval, consumer acceptance, and the potential environmental impact of genetically modified crops (Kanchiswamy et al., 2015). Despite these challenges, the continued progress in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils holds great promise for enhancing the nutritional quality of the global food supply and addressing public health concerns related to diet and nutrition (Haslam et al., 2013).", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic engineering of plant oils and waxes for use as industrial feedstocks", "authors": "Napier, Johnathan A., Haslam, Richard P., Beaudoin, Frederic, Cahoon, Edgar B.", "journal": "Plant Biotechnology Journal", "year": "2019", "volumes": "17", "first page": "220", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1111/pbi.12983"}, {"title": "Understanding the control of acyl flux through the lipid metabolic network of plant oil biosynthesis", "authors": "Clemente, Thomas E., Cahoon, Edgar B.", "journal": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids", "year": "2009", "volumes": "1791", "first page": "235", "last page": "244", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbalip.2008.12.004"}, {"title": "Metabolic engineering of the omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway into transgenic plants", "authors": "Ruiz-Lopez, Noemi, Haslam, Richard P., Napier, Johnathan A., Sayanova, Olga", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": "2014", "volumes": "65", "first page": "2395", "last page": "2410", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/eru038"}, {"title": "CRISPR/Cas9: a powerful tool for crop genome editing", "authors": "Zhang, Feng, Wen, Yujun, Guo, Xiaoyu", "journal": "Crop Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "6", "first page": "75", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cj.2017.08.002"}, {"title": "Metabolic engineering of plant oils and waxes for use as industrial feedstocks", "authors": "Vanhercke, Thomas, Wood, Craig C., Stymne, Sten, Singh, Surinder P., Green, Allan G.", "journal": "Plant Biotechnology Journal", "year": "2019", "volumes": "17", "first page": "220", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1111/pbi.12983"}, {"title": "DNA-free genome editing methods for targeted crop improvement", "authors": "Kanchiswamy, Chidananda Nagamangala, Maffei, Massimo E., Malnoy, Mickael, Velasco, Riccardo, Kim, June-Sik", "journal": "Plant Cell Reports", "year": "2015", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1087", "last page": "1098", "DOI": "10.1007/s00299-015-1769-x"}, {"title": "Metabolic engineering of higher plants and algae for isoprenoid production", "authors": "Haslam, Richard P., Ruiz-Lopez, Noemi, Eastmond, Peter, Moloney, Maurice, Sayanova, Olga, Napier, Johnathan A.", "journal": "Advances in Botanical Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "66", "first page": "161", "last page": "199", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-397923-0.00006-0"}]}
