{"Literature Review": "Microgreens, the young seedlings of vegetables and herbs, have emerged as a significant focus of agricultural research due to their nutritional benefits, rapid growth cycle, and adaptability to various cultivation environments. Recent studies have highlighted their potential in addressing food security, enhancing dietary diversity, and contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. This literature review delves into the multifaceted aspects of microgreens, encompassing their nutritional profile, cultivation systems, and innovative applications, including space farming. The nutritional superiority of microgreens over their mature counterparts has been well-documented. Xiao et al. (2012) demonstrated that microgreens contain higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them a potent dietary supplement for combating micronutrient deficiencies. Their study underscored the variability in nutrient content across different species, suggesting the need for tailored cultivation strategies to maximize nutritional yield. The cultivation of microgreens has evolved from traditional soil-based methods to sophisticated hydroponic and aeroponic systems, which offer precise control over nutrient delivery and environmental conditions. Di Gioia et al. (2017) explored the impact of nutrient solution composition on the growth and nutritional quality of microgreens, revealing that optimized nutrient formulations can significantly enhance their phytonutrient content. This adaptability to controlled environments has paved the way for their integration into urban agriculture and vertical farming systems, addressing the challenges of land scarcity and urbanization. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in microgreen production systems has been a game-changer, enabling real-time monitoring and automation of cultivation processes. Benke and Tomkins (2017) discussed the potential of IoT in optimizing resource use, reducing labor costs, and improving crop consistency, thereby making microgreen production more efficient and scalable. This technological advancement is particularly relevant in the context of commercial farming, where consistency and quality are paramount. Space farming represents a novel frontier for microgreen cultivation, with implications for long-duration space missions. The sensory qualities of microgreens can enhance the palatability of space diets, while their cultivation can contribute to the psychological well-being of astronauts. Massa et al. (2017) investigated the feasibility of growing microgreens in microgravity, identifying challenges such as water distribution and root zone oxygenation. Their findings underscore the need for interdisciplinary research to develop cultivation systems that can operate effectively in the unique conditions of space. Despite the promising prospects of microgreens, several challenges remain. The lack of standardized cultivation protocols and the variability in nutritional content across species and growing conditions necessitate further research. Additionally, the economic viability of microgreen production, particularly in resource-limited settings, requires careful consideration. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for realizing the full potential of microgreens in enhancing food security, promoting sustainable agriculture, and supporting space exploration. In conclusion, microgreens offer a versatile and nutrient-dense food source that can be cultivated in a range of environments, from home gardens to space stations. The integration of advanced cultivation technologies and interdisciplinary research efforts will be key to overcoming the existing barriers and unlocking the myriad benefits of microgreens for human health and environmental sustainability.", "References": [{"title": "Assessment of Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations of Emerging Food Products: Edible Microgreens", "authors": "Zhenlei Xiao, Gene E.
