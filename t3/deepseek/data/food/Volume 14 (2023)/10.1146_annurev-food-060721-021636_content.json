{"Literature Review": "The stability of polyunsaturated lipids in food emulsions is a critical concern due to their susceptibility to oxidation, which can lead to the degradation of nutritional quality and the formation of harmful compounds. The oil-water interface in oil-in-water emulsions is a focal point for the initiation of lipid oxidation, making the strategic placement of antioxidants at this interface a promising approach to enhance oxidative stability. Phenolic antioxidants, known for their potent antioxidant activity, do not naturally accumulate at the oil-water interface, necessitating the development of innovative strategies to achieve their targeted localization. This literature review explores various strategies for positioning phenolic antioxidants at the oil-water interface in emulsions, including the lipophilization of phenolic acids, the functionalization of biopolymer emulsifiers, and the use of Pickering particles as antioxidant reservoirs. The lipophilization of phenolic acids involves modifying their chemical structure to impart amphiphilic properties, enabling their migration to the oil-water interface. Studies have demonstrated that lipophilized phenolic acids, or phenolipids, exhibit enhanced antioxidant activity in emulsions by effectively scavenging free radicals at the interface where lipid oxidation is initiated (Shahidi & Zhong, 2010). Another approach involves the functionalization of biopolymer emulsifiers, such as proteins and polysaccharides, through covalent or noncovalent interactions with phenolic compounds. This strategy not only stabilizes the emulsion but also positions the antioxidants at the interface, providing a dual function of emulsification and antioxidant protection. Research has shown that biopolymer-phenolic conjugates can significantly reduce lipid oxidation in emulsions by forming a protective barrier at the oil-water interface (Dickinson, 2012). Additionally, Pickering particles, which are solid particles that stabilize emulsions by adsorbing at the oil-water interface, have been explored as carriers for phenolic antioxidants. By loading Pickering particles with phenolic compounds, it is possible to create interfacial antioxidant reservoirs that continuously release antioxidants to counteract lipid oxidation. This approach has been shown to effectively enhance the oxidative stability of emulsions by maintaining a high concentration of antioxidants at the interface (Binks & Fletcher, 2001). Despite the promising results of these strategies, there are limitations and challenges that need to be addressed. The chemical modification of phenolic acids may alter their biological activity and safety, requiring thorough evaluation. The functionalization of biopolymer emulsifiers with phenolic compounds may affect their emulsifying properties and the sensory attributes of the final product. Moreover, the use of Pickering particles as antioxidant carriers may be limited by the availability of suitable particles and the potential impact on the texture of the emulsion. In conclusion, targeting the interfacial location of phenolic antioxidants in emulsions offers a promising approach to enhance the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated lipids. The development of innovative strategies, such as the lipophilization of phenolic acids, the functionalization of biopolymer emulsifiers, and the use of Pickering particles as antioxidant reservoirs, has shown potential in counteracting lipid oxidation. However, further research is needed to overcome the limitations and challenges associated with these approaches, paving the way for their successful application in food products.", "References": [{"title": "Lipid Oxidation: Challenges in Food Systems", "authors": "Fereidoon Shahidi, Ying Zhong", "journal": "Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society", "year": "2010", "volumes": "87", "first page": "905", "last page": "917", "DOI": "10.1007/s11746-010-1645-3"}, {"title": "Emulsion gels: The structuring of soft solids with protein-stabilized oil droplets", "authors": "Eric Dickinson", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2012", "volumes": "28", "first page": "224", "last page": "241", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.12.017"}, {"title": "Particles as surfactants—similarities and differences", "authors": "Bernard P.
