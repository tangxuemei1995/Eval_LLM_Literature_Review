{"Literature Review": "The intersection of genomics and metabolomics offers a promising avenue for enhancing the nutritional quality of crops, a critical step towards addressing the global challenge of hidden hunger. Hidden hunger, characterized by micronutrient deficiencies despite adequate caloric intake, affects billions worldwide, underscoring the need for innovative approaches to improve dietary nutrition. Traditional breeding efforts have predominantly focused on increasing yield, often at the expense of nutritional quality, leading to a decline in the phytonutrient content of many staple crops. This review explores how leveraging the natural variance within genebank collections through genome sequencing and metabolomics can uncover superior alleles related to nutritional quality, offering a complementary strategy to metabolic engineering for enhancing human health. The potential of this approach is underscored by initial successes in identifying beneficial alleles for nutritional traits in crops such as rice and tomato. For instance, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) coupled with metabolomic profiling have identified loci associated with enhanced levels of vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients, demonstrating the feasibility of mining genebank collections for nutritional improvement. Moreover, this approach benefits from the vast genetic diversity preserved in genebanks, which represents an untapped resource for breeding crops with improved nutritional profiles. However, the application of this strategy requires careful consideration to avoid the unintended introduction of antinutrients, compounds that can interfere with the absorption of essential nutrients. Thus, while the integration of genomics and metabolomics holds great promise for addressing hidden hunger, it necessitates a balanced approach that considers both the enhancement of beneficial nutrients and the mitigation of antinutrients. In conclusion, the exploration of metabolic signatures within genebank collections represents a novel and underexploited resource for improving human health through diet. By harnessing the power of natural variance and advanced analytical techniques, it is possible to reverse the nutritional declines associated with decades of yield-focused breeding, offering a sustainable solution to the global challenge of hidden hunger.", "References": [{"title": "Breeding for micronutrients in staple food crops from a human nutrition perspective", "authors": "Howarth Bouis, Ross Welch", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": "2010", "volumes": "61", "first page": "935", "last page": "944", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/erp448"}, {"title": "The potential of metabolomics for crop improvement", "authors": "Alisdair Fernie, Joost Keurentjes", "journal": "Current Opinion in Plant Biology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "14", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pbi.2010.11.004"}, {"title": "Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces", "authors": "Xuehui Huang, Xinghua Wei, Tao Sang, Qifa Zhao, Bin Han", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "42", "first page": "961", "last page": "967", "DOI": "10.1038/ng.695"}, {"title": "Metabolomics-assisted breeding: a viable option for crop improvement?", "authors": "Ricardo F.H.
