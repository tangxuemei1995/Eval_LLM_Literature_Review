{"Literature Review": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) surfaces represent a groundbreaking approach in the fight against bacterial contamination, particularly in the food industry. These surfaces are designed with nanopatterns that physically rupture bacterial cell walls, offering a biocide-free method to mitigate biofilm formation and bacterial proliferation. This literature review delves into the mechanisms behind MB surfaces, advancements in nanofabrication techniques, and their potential applications in food processing, packaging, and preparation environments. The mechanism of action of MB surfaces primarily involves the physical deformation and rupture of bacterial cell membranes upon contact with the nanopatterned surface. This process is influenced by the size, shape, and density of the nanopatterns, which must be precisely engineered to target bacterial cells without harming human cells or the structural integrity of the material itself. Recent studies have demonstrated that nanopillars with heights ranging from 100 to 500 nm and diameters of 50 to 200 nm are particularly effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (Ivanova et al., 2012; Pogodin et al., 2013). Nanofabrication technologies have evolved significantly, enabling the production of MB surfaces with high precision and scalability. Techniques such as nanoimprinting lithography, electron beam lithography, and self-assembly have been employed to create uniform and durable nanopatterns on various substrates, including metals, polymers, and ceramics (Hasan et al., 2013; Kelleher et al., 2016). These advancements have paved the way for the integration of MB surfaces into food-contact materials, offering a promising solution to reduce microbial contamination and extend the shelf life of food products. Despite their potential, the application of MB surfaces in the food industry faces several challenges. These include the need for rigorous testing to ensure food safety, the development of cost-effective manufacturing processes, and the assessment of long-term durability and performance under real-world conditions (Linklater et al., 2017; Elbourne et al., 2019). Additionally, there is a need for comprehensive studies to evaluate the impact of MB surfaces on the sensory and nutritional qualities of food products. In conclusion, MB surfaces hold great promise for enhancing food safety and quality through their unique mechano-bactericidal properties. Continued research and development efforts are essential to overcome existing challenges and facilitate the widespread adoption of MB technologies in the food industry. By leveraging the latest advancements in nanofabrication and materials science, it is possible to create innovative solutions that address the pressing issue of microbial contamination in food processing, packaging, and preparation environments.", "References": [{"title": "Bactericidal activity of black silicon", "authors": "Elena P.
