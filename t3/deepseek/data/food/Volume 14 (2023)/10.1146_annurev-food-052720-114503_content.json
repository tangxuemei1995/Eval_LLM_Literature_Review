{"Literature Review": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides (NDFOs) have garnered significant attention in the scientific community due to their prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological benefits. These oligosaccharides, which include galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), manno-oligosaccharides (MOS), chito-oligosaccharides (COS), and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), are not digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract but are fermented in the colon, where they exert beneficial effects on the host's health. Enzymatic production of NDFOs is particularly favored for its ability to produce oligosaccharides with predictable and controllable structures and compositions, making it a preferred method in the food industry (Gibson et al., 2017). The prebiotic effects of NDFOs are well-documented, with numerous studies highlighting their ability to selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial bacteria in the gut, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, while inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria (Roberfroid et al., 2010). This selective fermentation leads to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal health by lowering the pH of the gut, enhancing mineral absorption, and providing energy to colonocytes (Topping & Clifton, 2001). Moreover, NDFOs have been shown to modulate the immune system, enhance gut barrier function, and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Slavin, 2013). The technological characteristics of NDFOs, such as their solubility, stability, and ability to improve the texture and shelf-life of food products, have also been extensively studied. These properties make NDFOs valuable functional ingredients in a wide range of food applications, including dairy products, baked goods, beverages, and dietary supplements (Mussatto & Mancilha, 2007). For instance, GOS and XOS have been incorporated into infant formulas to mimic the prebiotic effects of HMOs, which are naturally present in human milk and play a critical role in the development of the infant gut microbiota (Bode, 2012). Similarly, MOS and COS have been used in animal feed to promote gut health and improve growth performance in livestock (Spring et al., 2000). Despite the numerous benefits of NDFOs, challenges remain in their large-scale production and application. These include the high cost of enzymes, the need for efficient purification processes, and the limited understanding of the structure-function relationships of different oligosaccharides (Sanz et al., 2005). Future research should focus on optimizing enzymatic production methods, exploring novel sources of enzymes, and conducting more in-depth studies on the health effects of NDFOs to fully realize their potential as functional food ingredients. In conclusion, NDFOs represent a promising class of prebiotics with significant potential to improve intestinal health and enhance the quality of food products. Their enzymatic production offers a sustainable and efficient approach to meet the growing demand for functional foods in the global market.", "References": [{"title": "Expert consensus document: The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of prebiotics", "authors": "Gibson Glenn R., Hutkins Robert, Sanders Mary Ellen, Prescott Susan L., Reimer Raylene A., Salminen Seppo J., Scott Karen, Stanton Catherine, Swanson Kelly S., Cani Patrice D.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "14", "first page": "491", "last page": "502", "DOI": "10.1038/nrgastro.2017.75"}, {"title": "Prebiotic effects: metabolic and health benefits", "authors": "Roberfroid Marcel, Gibson Glenn R., Hoyles Lesley, McCartney Anne L., Rastall Robert, Rowland Ian, Wolvers Danielle, Watzl Bernhard, Szajewska Hania, Stahl Bernd", "journal": "British Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2010", "volumes": "104", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S63", "DOI": "10.1017/S0007114510003363"}, {"title": "Short-chain fatty acids and human colonic function: roles of resistant starch and nonstarch polysaccharides", "authors": "Topping David L., Clifton Peter M.", "journal": "Physiological Reviews", "year": "2001", "volumes": "81", "first page": "1031", "last page": "1064", "DOI": "10.1152/physrev.2001.81.3.1031"}, {"title": "Fiber and prebiotics: mechanisms and health benefits", "authors": "Slavin Joanne L.", "journal": "Nutrients", "year": "2013", "volumes": "5", "first page": "1417", "last page": "1435", "DOI": "10.3390/nu5041417"}, {"title": "Non-digestible oligosaccharides: A review", "authors": "Mussatto Solange I., Mancilha Ismael M.", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2007", "volumes": "68", "first page": "587", "last page": "597", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2006.12.011"}, {"title": "Human milk oligosaccharides: every baby needs a sugar mama", "authors": "Bode Lars", "journal": "Glycobiology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1147", "last page": "1162", "DOI": "10.1093/glycob/cws074"}, {"title": "The role of mannan-oligosaccharides in animal nutrition", "authors": "Spring Peter, Wenk Caspar, Dawson Karl A., Newman Kevin E.", "journal": "Feedinfo News Service", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides derived from natural sources", "authors": "Sanz Maria L., Gibson Glenn R., Rastall Robert A.", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "16", "first page": "5", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2004.09.003"}]}
