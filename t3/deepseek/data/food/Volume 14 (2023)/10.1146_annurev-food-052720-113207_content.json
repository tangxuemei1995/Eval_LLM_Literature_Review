{"Literature Review": "Microbubbles, characterized by their small diameters typically ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers, have emerged as a novel and promising technology in the food industry. Their unique physical properties, including high specific surface area and enhanced gas dissolution capabilities, offer a wide range of applications from cleaning and disinfection to the modification of food properties and support for living organisms in controlled environments. This literature review explores the generation techniques, mechanisms of action, and diverse applications of microbubbles in food technology, highlighting their potential to contribute to sustainability, food safety, and food security.The generation of microbubbles is a critical step in harnessing their benefits. Techniques such as hydrodynamic cavitation, ultrasonic cavitation, and pressurized dissolution have been developed to produce microbubbles efficiently. Hydrodynamic cavitation, for instance, involves the creation of microbubbles through the passage of liquid at high velocity through a constriction, leading to pressure variations that induce bubble formation (Gogate & Pandit, 2005). Ultrasonic cavitation, on the other hand, utilizes high-frequency sound waves to generate microbubbles, offering precise control over bubble size and distribution (Mason et al., 2011). Pressurized dissolution methods involve saturating a liquid with gas under high pressure, followed by a rapid pressure reduction to form microbubbles (Terasaka et al., 2011). These techniques have been optimized to produce microbubbles with specific characteristics tailored to various applications in the food industry.Microbubbles have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing cleaning and disinfection processes within food production lines. Their high specific surface area promotes the generation of reactive chemical species, such as hydroxyl radicals, which are effective in inactivating microorganisms and degrading organic contaminants (Agarwal et al., 2012). Furthermore, the physical action of microbubbles collapsing near surfaces generates microjets and shock waves that can dislodge biofilms and particulate matter, enhancing the efficacy of cleaning agents (Jyoti & Pandit, 2004). This dual mechanism of chemical and physical action makes microbubbles an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cleaning and disinfection methods, reducing the need for harsh chemicals and minimizing water usage.In addition to their cleaning applications, microbubbles have been explored for their ability to modify the functional and mechanical properties of food materials. The incorporation of microbubbles into food products can alter texture, stability, and sensory attributes, offering opportunities for the development of novel foods with enhanced consumer appeal. For example, the use of microbubbles in dairy products has been shown to improve foam stability and texture, leading to products with a creamier mouthfeel (Dickinson, 2010). Similarly, the application of microbubbles in bakery products can enhance dough rheology and final product volume, contributing to improved product quality (Campbell et al., 2008). These modifications are achieved through the controlled introduction of microbubbles, which act as nucleation sites for gas expansion during processing, thereby influencing the microstructure and physical properties of the food matrix.Microbubbles also play a crucial role in supporting the growth of living organisms in hydroponics and bioreactors, contributing to food security by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural production systems. In hydroponic systems, microbubbles can increase the dissolution of oxygen in nutrient solutions, promoting root health and plant growth (Takahashi et al., 2003). Similarly, in bioreactors, microbubbles can enhance the mass transfer of gases, improving the growth conditions for microorganisms used in the production of food ingredients and additives (Chisti, 2007). The ability of microbubbles to enhance gas-liquid mass transfer and provide a controlled environment for biological processes underscores their potential to support sustainable food production practices.In conclusion, microbubbles offer a versatile and environmentally friendly technology with diverse applications in the food industry. From enhancing cleaning and disinfection processes to modifying food properties and supporting agricultural production, microbubbles have the potential to contribute significantly to sustainability, food safety, and food security. The continued development and optimization of microbubble generation techniques, combined with a deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action, will be key to unlocking their full potential in food technology. As the food industry seeks innovative solutions to meet the challenges of the 21st century, microbubbles stand out as a promising tool for advancing food production and processing in a sustainable and efficient manner.", "References": [{"title": "Hydrodynamic cavitation for sonochemical effects", "authors": "Gogate, Parag R., Pandit, Aniruddha B.", "journal": "Ultrasonics Sonochemistry", "year": "2005", "volumes": "12", "first page": "21", "last page": "27", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2004.03.007"}, {"title": "Applications of ultrasound in food technology: Processing, preservation and extraction", "authors": "Mason, Timothy J., Paniwnyk, Larysa, Lorimer, J.
