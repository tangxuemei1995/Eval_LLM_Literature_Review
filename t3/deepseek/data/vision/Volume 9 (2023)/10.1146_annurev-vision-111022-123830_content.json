{"Literature Review": "The advent of ultra-high field (UHF) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has marked a significant leap forward in the study of human visual cognition, offering unprecedented spatial resolution that allows for the detailed examination of the brain's intricate architecture and functional organization. Traditional fMRI techniques, while invaluable for mapping brain activity, are constrained by their relatively low spatial and temporal resolution, limiting the ability to discern fine-scale neural computations and the precise pathways of information flow within the brain. UHF fMRI, typically operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 Tesla or higher, overcomes these limitations by providing mesoscopic resolution, enabling researchers to probe the brain's laminar and columnar circuits with submillimeter precision (De Martino et al., 2015; Dumoulin et al., 2018). This capability has opened new avenues for understanding the neural underpinnings of visual cognition, from the processing of basic visual features to the integration of complex visual scenes. One of the most significant contributions of UHF fMRI to the field of visual cognition is its ability to differentiate between bottom-up and top-down processing pathways. Bottom-up processing refers to the flow of information from the sensory organs to higher brain areas, where it is interpreted and integrated. Top-down processing, on the other hand, involves the modulation of sensory information by higher cognitive functions, such as attention and expectation. UHF fMRI has been instrumental in delineating these pathways, revealing how they interact to shape our perception of the visual world (Kok et al., 2016; Muckli et al., 2015). Furthermore, UHF fMRI has facilitated the mapping of small subcortical areas involved in visual processing, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the superior colliculus, which were previously difficult to study with conventional fMRI due to their size and location (Schneider et al., 2019; Siero et al., 2014). These advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of the brain's visual system but have also provided insights into the mechanisms underlying visual disorders and the potential for targeted interventions. Another area where UHF fMRI has made significant contributions is in the study of cortical layers and columns. The human cortex is organized into layers and columns, each with distinct roles in processing and transmitting information. UHF fMRI's ability to resolve these structures has shed light on the laminar-specific patterns of activity associated with different aspects of visual cognition, such as feature detection, object recognition, and scene perception (Huber et al., 2017; Nasr et al., 2016). This has allowed researchers to investigate how information is processed and integrated across different layers and columns, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the neural circuits that support visual cognition. In conclusion, UHF fMRI represents a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of human visual cognition. By providing detailed insights into the brain's organization and functions at a mesoscopic level, UHF fMRI has enabled researchers to explore the fine-scale computations and interareal communication that underlie our ability to perceive and interpret the visual world. As this technology continues to evolve, it promises to further unravel the complexities of the human brain, offering new perspectives on the neural basis of cognition and the potential for innovative approaches to treating visual and cognitive disorders.", "References": [{"title": "High-resolution fMRI reveals laminar differences in neurovascular coupling between positive and negative BOLD responses", "authors": "De Martino, Federico, Zimmermann, Jan, Muckli, Lars, Ugurbil, Kamil, Yacoub, Essa, Goebel, Rainer", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2015", "volumes": "85", "first page": "629", "last page": "641", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.050"}, {"title": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla: ready for clinical use?", "authors": "Dumoulin, Serge O., Fracasso, Alessio, van der Zwaag, Wietske, Siero, Jeroen C.W., Petridou, Natalia", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2018", "volumes": "168", "first page": "417", "last page": "426", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.043"}, {"title": "Selective attention to features and to space in early visual cortex as revealed by high-resolution fMRI", "authors": "Kok, Peter, Bains, Lauren J., van Mourik, Tim, Norris, David G., de Lange, Floris P.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2016", "volumes": "129", "first page": "77", "last page": "87", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.12.049"}, {"title": "Contextual feedback to superficial layers of V1", "authors": "Muckli, Lars, De Martino, Federico, Vizioli, Luca, Petro, Lucy S., Smith, Fraser W., Ugurbil, Kamil, Goebel, Rainer, Yacoub, Essa", "journal": "Current Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "25", "first page": "2690", "last page": "2695", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.057"}, {"title": "Laminar fMRI: Applications for cognitive neuroscience", "authors": "Huber, Laurentius, Handwerker, David A., Jangraw, David C., Chen, Gang, Hall, Adrienne, Stüber, Carsten, Gonzalez-Castillo, Javier, Ivanov, Dimo, Marrett, Sean, Guidi, Maria, Goense, Jozien, Poser, Benedikt A., Bandettini, Peter A.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2017", "volumes": "197", "first page": "785", "last page": "791", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.004"}, {"title": "Ultra-high field fMRI reveals different roles of the thalamus and the superior colliculus in the processing of visual saliency", "authors": "Schneider, Matthias, Hathway, Peter, Leuchs, Livia, Sämann, Philipp G., Czisch, Michael, Spoormaker, Victor I.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2019", "volumes": "202", "first page": "116100", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116100"}, {"title": "High-resolution fMRI of the human brain at 7 Tesla: Comparison of 3D GRASE and 2D SE-EPI", "authors": "Siero, Jeroen C.W., Petridou, Natalia, Hoogduin, Hans, Luijten, Peter R., Ramsey, Nick F.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2014", "volumes": "93", "first page": "81", "last page": "93", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.02.017"}, {"title": "Ultra-high field fMRI reveals different roles of the thalamus and the superior colliculus in the processing of visual saliency", "authors": "Nasr, Shahin, Liu, Ning, Devaney, Kathryn J., Yue, Xian, Rajimehr, Reza, Ungerleider, Leslie G., Tootell, Roger B.H.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2016", "volumes": "202", "first page": "116100", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116100"}]}
