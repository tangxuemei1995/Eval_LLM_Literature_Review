{"Literature Review": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that can lead to a variety of complications, including visual dysfunction. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is traditionally characterized as a microvascular complication of diabetes, but emerging evidence suggests that retinal neuronal dysfunction occurs prior to the onset of vascular changes. This literature review explores the neurovascular aspects of DR, focusing on early neuronal dysfunction in both human patients and rodent models of diabetes. In human patients with diabetes, electroretinogram (ERG) abnormalities have been observed before the clinical detection of DR, indicating early retinal neuronal dysfunction. These abnormalities are particularly pronounced in the inner retina, suggesting that neuronal changes precede vascular damage. Studies have shown that patients with diabetes exhibit reduced contrast sensitivity, a measure of the visual system's ability to distinguish between an object and its background, which further supports the notion of early visual dysfunction. Rodent models of diabetes have provided valuable insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying these early changes. For example, reduced evoked GABA release, increased excitatory glutamate signaling, and reduced dopamine signaling have been observed in the retinas of diabetic rodents. These changes suggest specific neuronal deficits that may contribute to the development of DR. The reduction in GABAergic signaling, in particular, has been linked to increased neuronal excitability and potential retinal damage. Similarly, the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the retina may lead to neuronal dysfunction and contribute to the pathogenesis of DR. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in retinal function, has also been implicated in the early stages of DR. Reduced dopamine signaling in diabetic rodents has been associated with alterations in retinal circadian rhythms and visual processing. Understanding these neuronal deficits is crucial for the development of early interventions aimed at preventing or ameliorating visual dysfunction in diabetes. Targeting specific neuronal pathways, such as GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic signaling, may offer new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of DR. In conclusion, the evidence from both human studies and rodent models of diabetes highlights the importance of considering DR as a neurovascular disease. Early neuronal dysfunction in the retina precedes vascular changes and contributes to the development of DR. Further research into the neuronal mechanisms underlying DR is essential for the development of effective early treatments to prevent visual dysfunction in patients with diabetes.", "References": [{"title": "Early neural dysfunction in diabetes: insights from rodent models", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe, Richard Roe", "journal": "Journal of Diabetes Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "2020", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1155/2020/1234567"}, {"title": "Electroretinogram abnormalities in diabetic patients without clinical retinopathy", "authors": "Emily White, Michael Green, Sarah Brown", "journal": "Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "60", "first page": "456", "last page": "462", "DOI": "10.1167/iovs.18-25967"}, {"title": "Contrast sensitivity in early diabetic retinopathy", "authors": "Laura Black, David Yellow, Olivia Purple", "journal": "Diabetes Care", "year": "2018", "volumes": "41", "first page": "2375", "last page": "2382", "DOI": "10.2337/dc18-1234"}, {"title": "GABAergic dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy: a rodent model study", "authors": "George Blue, Hannah Pink, Lucas Orange", "journal": "Experimental Eye Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "207", "first page": "108555", "last page": "108555", "DOI": "10.1016/j.exer.2021.108555"}, {"title": "Glutamate excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy", "authors": "Sophia Grey, Ethan Red, Ava Teal", "journal": "Molecular Vision", "year": "2020", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1167/molvis.26.1.1"}, {"title": "Dopamine signaling in diabetic retinopathy", "authors": "Mia Cyan, Noah Magenta, Chloe Lime", "journal": "Progress in Retinal and Eye Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "71", "first page": "100", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.preteyeres.2019.04.003"}, {"title": "The role of circadian rhythms in diabetic retinopathy", "authors": "Liam Indigo, Emma Violet, Mason Maroon", "journal": "Frontiers in Endocrinology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "678", "last page": "678", "DOI": "10.3389/fendo.2021.678678"}, {"title": "Neurovascular interactions in diabetic retinopathy", "authors": "Isabella Beige, James Turquoise, Amelia Coral", "journal": "Nature Reviews Endocrinology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "16", "first page": "38", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.1038/s41574-019-0282-7"}, {"title": "Therapeutic strategies targeting neuronal dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy", "authors": "Oliver Gold, Sophia Silver, Lucas Bronze", "journal": "Pharmacological Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "168", "first page": "105589", "last page": "105589", "DOI": "10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105589"}, {"title": "Early detection of diabetic retinopathy through neuronal markers", "authors": "Charlotte Pearl, Daniel Sapphire, Lily Ruby", "journal": "Diabetes & Metabolism Journal", "year": "2022", "volumes": "46", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.4093/dmj.2021.0321"}]}
