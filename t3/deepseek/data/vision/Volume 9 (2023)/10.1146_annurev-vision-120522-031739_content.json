{"Literature Review": "The advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has marked a significant milestone in the field of computer vision, with these algorithms achieving unprecedented success in tasks such as object classification and segmentation. This success has sparked a debate within the scientific community regarding the adequacy of DNNs as behavioral models of human visual perception, particularly in the context of core object recognition. This literature review aims to explore the evidence surrounding this debate, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between statistical tools and computational models, and understanding model quality as a multidimensional concept that requires clarity about modeling goals. The review synthesizes findings from a wide range of psychophysical and computational studies to argue that while DNNs are invaluable scientific tools, they currently fall short of being adequate computational models of human core object recognition behavior. Additionally, this review seeks to dispel prevalent myths surrounding the use of DNNs in vision science. The exploration begins with an examination of the foundational principles of DNNs and their application in computer vision, highlighting their strengths and limitations in mimicking human visual perception. Studies by LeCun et al. (2015) and Krizhevsky et al. (2012) have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of DNNs in image recognition tasks, yet these achievements do not necessarily translate to an understanding of human visual processing. The review then delves into the psychophysical evidence comparing human and DNN performance in core object recognition tasks. Research by Rajalingham et al. (2018) and Yamins et al. (2014) provides critical insights into the similarities and differences between human and DNN visual processing, suggesting that while DNNs can approximate certain aspects of human vision, they lack the robustness and flexibility of the human visual system. Furthermore, the review addresses the conceptual distinction between using DNNs as statistical tools versus computational models of human vision. As argued by Kriegeskorte (2015), the utility of DNNs in vision science depends on the specific goals of the modeling effort, whether it be to achieve high performance on specific tasks or to gain insights into the mechanisms of human perception. The review also tackles common misconceptions about DNNs, such as the belief that they can fully replicate human visual perception or that their success in computer vision tasks validates them as models of human vision. Studies by Lake et al. (2015) and Marcus (2018) challenge these notions, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting the capabilities of DNNs. In conclusion, while DNNs represent a powerful tool in the study of vision and have contributed significantly to our understanding of visual processing, they are not yet adequate models of human core object recognition behavior. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated models that can better capture the complexity and adaptability of the human visual system.", "References": [{"title": "Deep learning", "authors": "Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "521", "first page": "436", "last page": "444", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14539"}, {"title": "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks", "authors": "Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E.
