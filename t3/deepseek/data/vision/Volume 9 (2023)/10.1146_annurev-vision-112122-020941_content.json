{"Literature Review": "The efficient coding hypothesis posits that the brain optimizes its neural representations by discarding environmental regularities, thereby allocating more resources to variable properties. This hypothesis, rooted in the work of Barlow (1961), suggests that sensory systems are adapted to the statistical structure of the environment, minimizing redundancy in neural signals. Recent studies have expanded on this idea, demonstrating how efficient coding principles apply across different sensory modalities and species (Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001). However, the hypothesis primarily addresses the encoding of static environmental features, leaving questions about the prioritization of dynamic, behaviorally relevant information.\n\nPredictive coding offers a complementary perspective, emphasizing the brain's ability to anticipate future events based on current and past sensory inputs. This paradigm, influenced by the work of Rao and Ballard (1999), suggests that the brain continuously generates and updates predictions about the environment, minimizing prediction errors to guide behavior. Predictive coding has been supported by a wealth of empirical evidence, including studies showing that neural responses are modulated by expectations and that prediction errors are encoded in specific brain regions (Summerfield & de Lange, 2014).\n\nThe integration of efficient and predictive coding paradigms is a burgeoning area of research. One approach to this integration is the information bottleneck method, which seeks to balance the compression of sensory information with the retention of predictive features (Tishby, Pereira, & Bialek, 1999). This method has been applied to neural coding, suggesting that the brain selectively encodes information that is both efficient and predictive (Zhao, Park, & Pillow, 2019). Such findings underscore the potential synergy between the two paradigms, highlighting how they may act on distinct components of the visual input to optimize neural representations.\n\nFurther research has explored how these paradigms interact in the context of visual perception. For instance, studies have shown that efficient coding principles can explain the organization of receptive fields in the visual cortex, while predictive coding accounts for the modulation of these responses by contextual information (Berkes, Orbán, Lengyel, & Fiser, 2011). This dual perspective provides a more comprehensive understanding of visual processing, illustrating how the brain balances the need for efficient information representation with the ability to predict and respond to environmental changes.\n\nNormative approaches to integrating efficient and predictive coding have also been proposed. These approaches often involve computational models that simulate neural responses under different coding strategies, allowing researchers to test hypotheses about how the brain might achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and prediction (Karklin & Simoncelli, 2011). Such models have been instrumental in identifying potential neural mechanisms underlying the integration of these paradigms, offering insights into the functional architecture of sensory systems.\n\nIn conclusion, the efficient coding and predictive coding paradigms offer complementary insights into the neural representation of sensory information. While efficient coding focuses on the optimization of information representation, predictive coding emphasizes the anticipation of future events. The integration of these paradigms, facilitated by approaches such as the information bottleneck method, provides a more holistic understanding of neural coding. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between these paradigms, particularly in the context of dynamic and behaviorally relevant sensory inputs, to further elucidate the principles governing neural information processing.", "References": [{"title": "Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages", "authors": "Barlow, H.
