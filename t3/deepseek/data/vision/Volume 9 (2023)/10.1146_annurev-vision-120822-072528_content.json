{"Literature Review": "The study of visual fixations and eye movements has been a cornerstone in understanding human visual attention and cognitive processes. Recent advancements in predicting where we look have been significantly influenced by the development of probabilistic models and the application of information theory. These models offer a unified approach to fixation prediction, enabling the comparison of different models across various settings, such as static and video saliency, as well as scanpath prediction (Itti & Koch, 2001). The ability to consistently measure how well models predict eye movements is crucial for evaluating the contribution of different mechanisms. This has led to the development of a large variety of saliency maps and scanpath models, which can be translated into a unifying framework for model comparison (Borji, Sihite, & Itti, 2013).\n\nOne of the key challenges in fixation prediction is the selection of the most informative examples for model comparison. This is where the universal scale of information gain comes into play, offering a powerful tool for the inspection of candidate mechanisms and experimental design (Kümmerer, Wallis, & Bethge, 2016). Information theory has been instrumental in this regard, providing a quantitative measure of the information content in visual stimuli and how it influences eye movements (Bruce & Tsotsos, 2009). This approach has facilitated a deeper understanding of the continual decision-making process that determines where we look, by quantifying the contribution of different factors to fixation prediction.\n\nThe development of benchmarking standards has also played a significant role in advancing the field of fixation prediction. These standards allow for the consistent evaluation of models across different datasets and experimental conditions, ensuring that comparisons are fair and meaningful (Judd, Ehinger, Durand, & Torralba, 2009). Transfer learning has emerged as another important tool, enabling the application of models trained on one dataset to predict fixations on another, thereby increasing the generalizability of fixation prediction models (Zhang, Tong, Marks, Shan, & Cottrell, 2008).\n\nTaxonomy development has further contributed to the field by providing a structured way to categorize and compare different models and approaches to fixation prediction. This has helped in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various models, guiding future research directions (Tatler, Hayhoe, Land, & Ballard, 2011). The integration of these tools and approaches into a unifying framework has significantly advanced our understanding of visual fixations and eye movements, offering insights into both unconscious and conscious visual and cognitive processes.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of predicting visual fixations has seen remarkable progress due to the development of probabilistic models, the application of information theory, and the establishment of benchmarking standards. These advancements have facilitated a unified approach to model comparison, enabling a deeper understanding of the factors that influence where we look. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of transfer learning and taxonomy development will further enhance our ability to predict visual fixations, offering new insights into human visual attention and cognitive processes.", "References": [{"title": "Computational modelling of visual attention", "authors": "Laurent Itti, Christof Koch", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2001", "volumes": "2", "first page": "194", "last page": "203", "DOI": "10.1038/35058500"}, {"title": "Quantitative analysis of human-model agreement in visual saliency modeling: A comparative study", "authors": "Ali Borji, Dicky N.
