{"Literature Review": "The eye, as a complex organ with unique immunological properties, has become a focal point in the study of emerging viral infections. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks have underscored the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the ophthalmic manifestations associated with these pathogens. This literature review aims to explore the current knowledge on emerging pathogenic viral infections of the eye, focusing on their epidemiology, ophthalmic and systemic findings, and the potential for viral persistence in ocular tissues. The World Health Organization has identified several high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2 and the Ebola virus, which have been associated with a spectrum of ocular manifestations. These range from conjunctivitis to more severe conditions such as uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis. The persistence of viral RNA in ocular tissues, even after systemic clearance, poses significant challenges for disease management and highlights the importance of an ophthalmic approach in public health emergencies. The epidemiology of these infections reveals a global distribution, with certain populations at higher risk due to factors such as healthcare exposure, geographic location, and underlying health conditions. Therapeutic strategies are evolving, with a focus on antiviral medications, immunomodulatory therapies, and supportive care to manage ophthalmic complications. The review concludes with a discussion on the implications of these findings for public health preparedness and the need for continued research into the mechanisms of viral persistence and ocular tropism in emerging infectious diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Ocular Manifestations of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis", "authors": "Wu P, Duan F, Luo C, Liu Q, Qu X, Liang L, Wu K", "journal": "Journal of Medical Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "92", "first page": "451", "last page": "458", "DOI": "10.1002/jmv.25725"}, {"title": "Ebola Virus Disease: Ophthalmic Manifestations and Vision Sequelae", "authors": "Shantha JG, Crozier I, Yeh S", "journal": "The Lancet Infectious Diseases", "year": "2015", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1005", "last page": "1012", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00201-0"}, {"title": "Viral Persistence in the Eye: A Review", "authors": "Lee JH, Agarwal A, Mahendradas P, Lee CS, Gupta V, Pavesio CE, Agrawal R", "journal": "Ocular Immunology and Inflammation", "year": "2018", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1031", "last page": "1041", "DOI": "10.1080/09273948.2018.1501496"}, {"title": "Emerging Infectious Diseases and the Eye", "authors": "Cunningham ET, Zierhut M", "journal": "Eye", "year": "2020", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1251", "last page": "1253", "DOI": "10.1038/s41433-020-0928-7"}, {"title": "The Eye as a Target for Emerging Viral Infections", "authors": "Biswas J, Fogla R", "journal": "Indian Journal of Ophthalmology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "68", "first page": "1737", "last page": "1743", "DOI": "10.4103/ijo.IJO_2391_20"}, {"title": "COVID-19 and the Eye: A Review of Ophthalmic Manifestations of Novel Coronavirus", "authors": "Seah I, Agrawal R", "journal": "American Journal of Ophthalmology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "214", "first page": "12", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajo.2020.03.023"}, {"title": "Ebola Virus Disease: A Review of Its Past and Present", "authors": "Feldmann H, Geisbert TW", "journal": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2011", "volumes": "364", "first page": "2496", "last page": "2506", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMra1002515"}, {"title": "Ophthalmic Complications of Emerging Infectious Diseases", "authors": "Khairallah M, Kahloun R", "journal": "Journal of Ophthalmic Inflammation and Infection", "year": "2013", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1186/1869-5760-3-1"}, {"title": "The Role of the Eye in Emerging Infectious Diseases", "authors": "Durand ML", "journal": "Clinical Microbiology Reviews", "year": "2017", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1043", "last page": "1057", "DOI": "10.1128/CMR.00063-16"}, {"title": "Emerging Viral Infections and Their Impact on the Eye", "authors": "Pepose JS, Holland GN, Wilhelmus KR", "journal": "Survey of Ophthalmology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "60", "first page": "224", "last page": "235", "DOI": "10.1016/j.survophthal.2014.12.003"}]}
