{"Literature Review": "The ability to perceive the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the environment is crucial for the survival and interaction of organisms within their surroundings. In nonhuman primates, this complex task is achieved through the sophisticated processing of visual information by the brain. The literature reveals that the visual system reconstructs the 3D world from two-dimensional (2D) retinal images through specialized channels within the dorsal and ventral pathways, each dedicated to processing distinct 3D features such as shape, orientation, motion, and scene structure (Parker, 2007; Janssen et al., 2000). The dorsal pathway, often referred to as the 'where' pathway, is primarily involved in processing spatial location and motion, whereas the ventral pathway, or the 'what' pathway, is more concerned with object recognition and form (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982). Despite their common goal of 3D reconstruction, these pathways exhibit neurocomputational differences that impose distinct constraints on perception (Orban et al., 2006). Recent studies have highlighted the role of area V3A in the visual cortex as a critical node for 3D vision. V3A is thought to serve as a branchpoint from which multiple 3D processing channels diverge, suggesting its pivotal role in integrating various depth cues (Tyler et al., 2006; Anzai et al., 2011). The expansion of V3A in humans has been speculated to underpin the development of advanced 3D spatial reasoning skills, a hypothesis that aligns with the enhanced cognitive abilities observed in humans compared to nonhuman primates (Orban et al., 2004). Furthermore, the literature underscores the importance of stereopsis, the perception of depth derived from binocular disparity, as a fundamental mechanism for 3D vision. Studies have demonstrated that neurons in the visual cortex are highly sensitive to binocular disparity, enabling the precise encoding of depth information (Cumming & DeAngelis, 2001). Perspective, another critical depth cue, is processed by the visual system to infer the relative distances of objects within a scene, further contributing to the perception of 3D space (Howard & Rogers, 2002). Motion parallax, the relative movement of objects at different distances as an observer moves, also plays a significant role in depth perception, with specific neural mechanisms dedicated to its processing (Nadler et al., 2008). The integration of these diverse depth cues by the visual system allows for the robust and flexible perception of the 3D environment. Future research directions include exploring the transmission of 3D information across different brain areas and employing novel experimental approaches to further elucidate the neural underpinnings of 3D vision. Such endeavors will not only advance our understanding of the visual system in nonhuman primates but also provide insights into the evolution of 3D spatial reasoning in humans.", "References": [{"title": "Binocular neurons in V1 of awake monkeys are selective for absolute, not relative, disparity", "authors": "Bruce G.
