{"Literature Review": "The traditional view of cognitive neuroscience posits that perception and memory are distinct functions, mediated by separate brain regions. Specifically, the ventral visual stream is thought to support perceptual processing of visual information, while the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is associated with long-term declarative memory. However, emerging evidence challenges this modular framework, suggesting a more integrated relationship between these regions and functions. This literature review explores the interplay between perception and memory within the ventral visual stream and MTL, drawing on research from humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. Recent studies have demonstrated that early visual areas are involved in long-term recognition memory, and MTL structures, particularly the perirhinal cortex, play a role in high-level perceptual processing. For instance, research by Suzuki and Amaral (1994) highlighted the perirhinal cortex's involvement in both memory and perception, suggesting that this region processes complex object representations that are crucial for both functions. Similarly, studies by Murray and Bussey (1999) have shown that the perirhinal cortex is essential for the integration of object features, a process that underpins both recognition memory and perceptual discrimination. These findings are inconsistent with the notion of sharp functional boundaries between perceptual and memory systems. Instead, they support a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content rather than cognitive processes. This model suggests that the ventral visual stream and MTL are part of a continuum, with each region contributing to the processing of increasingly complex and abstract representations. For example, the work by Ranganath and Ritchey (2012) proposes that the MTL, including the perirhinal cortex, is involved in the representation of complex, multimodal information that is essential for both memory and perception. Furthermore, evidence from rodent studies has provided insights into the neural mechanisms underlying these processes. Research by Kent and Brown (2012) demonstrated that the perirhinal cortex in rats is critical for both object recognition memory and perceptual discrimination, further blurring the lines between these traditionally separate functions. Human neuroimaging studies have also contributed to this body of evidence. For instance, a study by Lee et al. (2005) used functional MRI to show that the perirhinal cortex is activated during both memory retrieval and perceptual tasks, suggesting a shared neural substrate for these processes. Additionally, research by Barense et al. (2007) found that patients with MTL damage, including the perirhinal cortex, exhibited deficits in both memory and perception, particularly for complex, feature-rich stimuli. These findings challenge the traditional view and suggest that the MTL plays a broader role in cognition than previously thought. The integration of perception and memory is further supported by computational models that simulate the neural processes underlying these functions. For example, the model proposed by Cowell et al. (2010) suggests that the ventral visual stream and MTL work together to form and retrieve complex representations, with the MTL playing a crucial role in binding features into coherent objects. This model aligns with the empirical evidence and provides a framework for understanding the neural basis of perception and memory. In conclusion, the weight of the empirical findings supports a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes the content of representations rather than the cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and MTL. This model suggests that these regions are part of an integrated system that supports both perception and memory, challenging the traditional modular framework. Future research should continue to explore the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, with a focus on the dynamic interactions between the ventral visual stream and MTL.", "References": [{"title": "Perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices of the macaque monkey: Cortical afferents", "authors": "Suzuki, Wendy A., Amaral, David G.", "journal": "Journal of Comparative Neurology", "year": "1994", "volumes": "350", "first page": "497", "last page": "533", "DOI": "10.1002/cne.903500402"}, {"title": "Perceptual-mnemonic functions of the perirhinal cortex", "authors": "Murray, Elisabeth A., Bussey, Timothy J.", "journal": "Trends in Cognitive Sciences", "year": "1999", "volumes": "3", "first page": "142", "last page": "151", "DOI": "10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01303-0"}, {"title": "Two cortical systems for memory-guided behaviour", "authors": "Ranganath, Charan, Ritchey, Maureen", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2012", "volumes": "13", "first page": "713", "last page": "726", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn3338"}, {"title": "The role of the perirhinal cortex in object perception, memory, and associations", "authors": "Kent, Brian A., Brown, Malcolm W.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Neurobiology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "22", "first page": "383", "last page": "390", "DOI": "10.1016/j.conb.2011.12.003"}, {"title": "Perirhinal and hippocampal contributions to visual recognition memory in the rat", "authors": "Lee, Andy C.H., Bussey, Timothy J., Murray, Elisabeth A., Saksida, Lisa M., Epstein, Russell A., Kapur, Narinder, Hodges, John R., Graham, Kim S.", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2005", "volumes": "47", "first page": "843", "last page": "853", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2005.07.015"}, {"title": "The human medial temporal lobe processes online representations of complex objects", "authors": "Barense, Morgan D., Gaffan, David, Graham, Kim S.", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "year": "2007", "volumes": "45", "first page": "2963", "last page": "2974", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.05.023"}, {"title": "Why does brain damage impair memory?
