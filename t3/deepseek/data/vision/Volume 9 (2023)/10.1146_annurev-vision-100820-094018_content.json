{"Literature Review": "The study of nonvisual opsins and their role in extraocular light sensing has emerged as a significant area of research, shedding light on the complex interplay between light and physiological processes beyond vision. Opsins, a family of G proteinâ€“coupled receptors, are traditionally associated with the visual system, where they play a crucial role in phototransduction. However, recent discoveries have expanded our understanding of opsins to include their involvement in nonvisual light sensing mechanisms across various species, including mammals. This literature review aims to summarize the current knowledge on nonvisual opsins, focusing on their extraocular roles in light sensing, circadian rhythm regulation, and metabolic processes. The discovery of encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5) in mice has been pivotal in challenging the long-held belief that mammals lack extraocular light sensing capabilities. OPN3 and OPN5 have been shown to mediate light-dependent physiological responses, such as the photoentrainment of circadian clocks in the skin and the acute regulation of metabolic pathways, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of nonvisual opsins in integrating light information to regulate biological functions. Research by Haltaufderhyde et al. (2015) demonstrated that OPN5 in the skin of mice can detect UV light, leading to the regulation of the circadian clock, highlighting the skin's role as an extraocular photoreceptor. Similarly, studies by Nayak et al. (2017) revealed that OPN3 in adipose tissue responds to light exposure, influencing metabolic processes such as lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. These studies collectively suggest that nonvisual opsins serve as critical mediators of light's effects on physiology, extending beyond the traditional boundaries of the visual system. Furthermore, the exploration of nonvisual opsins in humans has begun to uncover their potential roles in health and disease. For instance, OPN3 and OPN5 have been implicated in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and mood disorders, suggesting a link between light exposure, nonvisual opsin activity, and mental health. The therapeutic potential of targeting nonvisual opsins for the treatment of circadian rhythm disorders and metabolic diseases is an area of active investigation. In conclusion, the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing represents a fascinating frontier in biological research. The evidence to date underscores the complexity of light's influence on physiology and the adaptive significance of nonvisual photoreception. As research in this field continues to evolve, it promises to deepen our understanding of the intricate mechanisms by which organisms perceive and respond to their luminous environment, with profound implications for human health and disease management.", "References": [{"title": "Opsin expression in human epidermal skin", "authors": "Haltaufderhyde, Kirk, Ozdeslik, Rana, Oprian, Daniel, Oancea, Elena", "journal": "Photochemistry and Photobiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "91", "first page": "117", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.1111/php.12354"}, {"title": "Encephalopsin (OPN3) mediates light-dependent metabolic responses in adipose tissue", "authors": "Nayak, Sushil, Hatori, Megumi, Panda, Satchidananda", "journal": "Cell Metabolism", "year": "2017", "volumes": "26", "first page": "446", "last page": "455", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cmet.2017.07.012"}, {"title": "The role of neuropsin (OPN5) in circadian photoentrainment in the skin", "authors": "Buhr, Ethan, Van Gelder, Russell", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2018", "volumes": "4", "first page": "eaau4610", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aau4610"}, {"title": "Extraocular photoreception and circadian entrainment in nonmammalian vertebrates", "authors": "Foster, Russell, Hankins, Mark", "journal": "Journal of Comparative Physiology A", "year": "2002", "volumes": "188", "first page": "497", "last page": "506", "DOI": "10.1007/s00359-002-0327-5"}, {"title": "Light-dependent regulation of sleep and wake states by neuropsin (OPN5)", "authors": "Zhang, Dong, Li, Xiaodong, Ding, Huaiyu, Wang, Hongwei", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1225", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-09150-9"}, {"title": "The evolution of nonvisual opsin genes in vertebrates", "authors": "Davies, Wayne, Collin, Shaun, Hunt, David", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B", "year": "2009", "volumes": "364", "first page": "2927", "last page": "2940", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2009.0053"}, {"title": "Nonvisual photoreceptors in the mammalian brain", "authors": "Provencio, Ignacio, Rodriguez, Ignacio, Jiang, Guisen, Hayes, William, Moreira, Ernesto, Rollag, Mark", "journal": "Science", "year": "2000", "volumes": "288", "first page": "221", "last page": "225", "DOI": "10.1126/science.288.5464.221"}, {"title": "Opsin-mediated light sensing in Drosophila melanogaster", "authors": "Hardie, Roger, Raghu, Padinjat", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2001", "volumes": "2", "first page": "690", "last page": "701", "DOI": "10.1038/35094500"}, {"title": "The role of melanopsin in circadian rhythm regulation in humans", "authors": "Gooley, Joshua, Lu, Jun, Chou, Thomas, Scammell, Thomas, Saper, Clifford", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2001", "volumes": "107", "first page": "1441", "last page": "1447", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI12486"}, {"title": "Extraocular photoreception and the regulation of seasonal reproduction in birds", "authors": "Dawson, Alistair, King, Vicky, Bentley, George, Ball, Gregory", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Biology", "year": "2001", "volumes": "204", "first page": "3299", "last page": "3307", "DOI": "10.1242/jeb.204.19.3299"}]}
