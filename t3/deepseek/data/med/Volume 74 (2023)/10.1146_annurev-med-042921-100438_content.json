{"Literature Review": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) represents a significant yet often overlooked cause of secondary hypertension, with a prevalence that may exceed 10% among hypertensive patients (Funder et al., 2016). This condition is characterized by the autonomous overproduction of aldosterone, leading to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. The detrimental effects of PA on the heart and kidneys are well-documented, with studies showing a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in affected individuals (Monticone et al., 2018). Despite its prevalence and associated risks, PA remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, highlighting the need for improved screening and management strategies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a cornerstone in the treatment of PA, particularly for patients who are not candidates for surgical intervention. Steroidal MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have been shown to effectively lower blood pressure, reduce aldosterone levels, and mitigate the risk of target organ damage (Williams et al., 2017). However, their use is often limited by side effects, including gynecomastia, hyperkalemia, and menstrual irregularities, which can lead to poor adherence and underprescription. Recent advancements in pharmacotherapy have introduced nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone, which offer a more favorable side effect profile and have demonstrated efficacy in reducing adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease (Bakris et al., 2020). While the blood pressureâ€“lowering effects of nonsteroidal MRAs in PA remain to be fully elucidated, their potential role in reducing target organ damage warrants further investigation. The pathogenesis of PA involves the dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to excessive aldosterone production and subsequent mineralocorticoid receptor activation. This activation contributes to inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress, which are key mediators of cardiovascular and renal injury (Rossi et al., 2019). MRAs exert their protective effects by blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor, thereby attenuating these deleterious processes. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated the benefits of MRAs in improving left ventricular mass, reducing proteinuria, and slowing the progression of CKD in patients with PA (Pitt et al., 2011). Despite these benefits, the underutilization of MRAs in clinical practice underscores the need for increased awareness and education among healthcare providers. The management of PA also involves addressing the underlying cause, with adrenalectomy being the treatment of choice for patients with unilateral disease. However, many patients with PA have bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or are not surgical candidates, necessitating lifelong medical therapy with MRAs (Mulatero et al., 2013). The choice of MRA should be individualized based on patient characteristics, side effect profile, and comorbidities. In conclusion, PA is a common and treatable cause of secondary hypertension that is associated with significant cardiovascular and renal morbidity. MRAs play a critical role in the management of PA, with both steroidal and nonsteroidal agents offering benefits in reducing target organ damage. Future research should focus on optimizing the use of MRAs in PA, including the development of novel agents with improved efficacy and tolerability, to improve outcomes for this high-risk population.", "References": [{"title": "The Management of Primary Aldosteronism: Case Detection, Diagnosis, and Treatment: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline", "authors": "Funder, John W., Carey, Robert M., Mantero, Franco, Murad, M.
