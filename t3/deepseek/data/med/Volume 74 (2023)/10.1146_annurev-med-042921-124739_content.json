{"Literature Review": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant challenge in the management of transplant recipients, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. The virus is particularly problematic in the context of solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, where immunosuppression is a necessary component of post-transplant care. The prevention and management of CMV infection in these populations have evolved over the years, with the introduction of novel antiviral therapies such as letermovir (LTV) offering new hope for improved outcomes. This literature review focuses on the role of LTV in the prophylaxis and treatment of CMV in transplant recipients, highlighting its unique mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profile. CMV infection in transplant recipients can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic viremia to severe end-organ disease. The risk of CMV reactivation or primary infection is influenced by several factors, including the CMV serostatus of the donor and recipient, the type of transplant, and the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy. Traditional strategies for CMV prevention have included universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy, each with its own set of challenges and limitations. The introduction of LTV, a novel antiviral agent that inhibits the CMV terminase complex, represents a significant advancement in the field. LTV's unique mechanism of action disrupts viral DNA synthesis and packaging, offering a new therapeutic target that is distinct from those of existing CMV antivirals. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of LTV in preventing CMV infection in adult CMV-seropositive HCT recipients, leading to its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Beyond its approved use, there is growing interest in the off-label application of LTV for CMV prophylaxis and treatment in other transplant populations, including SOT recipients. The safety profile of LTV is particularly noteworthy, as it lacks many of the toxicities associated with traditional CMV antivirals, such as myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, LTV has shown a low propensity for the development of resistance, a common issue with other CMV therapies. Despite these advantages, challenges remain in optimizing the use of LTV in transplant recipients. These include determining the optimal duration of prophylaxis, managing drug-drug interactions, and addressing the cost of therapy. Future research directions include exploring the efficacy of LTV in pediatric transplant recipients, investigating its role in combination therapy, and developing strategies to mitigate the risk of late-onset CMV disease. In conclusion, LTV represents a significant addition to the armamentarium against CMV in transplant recipients, offering a novel mechanism of action, favorable safety profile, and potential for broad application. As clinical experience with LTV continues to grow, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in the prevention and management of CMV infection in this vulnerable population.", "References": [{"title": "Letermovir for Cytomegalovirus Prophylaxis in Hematopoietic-Cell Transplantation", "authors": "Francisco M.
