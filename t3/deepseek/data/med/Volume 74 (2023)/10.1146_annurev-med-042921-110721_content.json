{"Literature Review": "The advent of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) has marked a paradigm shift in the diagnosis and understanding of undiagnosed rare and ultrarare Mendelian diseases. These technologies, underpinned by next-generation sequencing (NGS), have not only facilitated the identification of novel disease genes but have also significantly impacted patient care by enabling precise diagnoses, informing medical management, and guiding reproductive risk assessments (Bamshad et al., 2011). Despite these advancements, a substantial proportion of patients with suspected genetic disorders remain undiagnosed, highlighting the limitations of current NGS methodologies (Yang et al., 2013).\n\nOne of the critical challenges in the field is the resolution of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which are frequently encountered in ES and GS. The interpretation of these variants requires a comprehensive understanding of the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of diseases, as well as access to large, diverse genomic databases (Richards et al., 2015). Moreover, the integration of functional studies and family segregation analyses is essential for elucidating the pathogenicity of VUS, thereby improving diagnostic yield (Rehm et al., 2013).\n\nThe emergence of long-read sequencing technologies offers promise for resolving some of the limitations associated with short-read ES and GS. These technologies are capable of detecting structural variants and complex genomic rearrangements that are often missed by short-read sequencing, potentially leading to diagnoses in previously undiagnosed cases (Eid et al., 2009). However, the high cost and the need for further validation of long-read sequencing in clinical diagnostics remain significant barriers to its widespread adoption (Logsdon et al., 2020).\n\nEquity in access to NGS-based testing is another pressing issue. Disparities in healthcare resources and genetic counseling services can limit the availability of these advanced diagnostic tools for certain populations, exacerbating health inequities (Manolio et al., 2013). Addressing these disparities requires concerted efforts to improve access to genetic testing and counseling, particularly in underserved communities.\n\nEthical considerations also play a crucial role in the application of ES and GS in undiagnosed diseases. Issues such as informed consent, privacy, and the potential for incidental findings necessitate careful deliberation and the development of robust ethical guidelines (Green et al., 2013). Furthermore, the urgent need for therapeutic interventions for patients with ultrarare disorders underscores the importance of translational research and the development of targeted therapies (Boycott et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, while ES and GS have revolutionized the diagnostic landscape for undiagnosed rare and ultrarare Mendelian diseases, several challenges remain. Continued advancements in sequencing technologies, along with efforts to address ethical concerns and improve equity in access, are essential for realizing the full potential of these powerful diagnostic tools. The future of undiagnosed disease resolution is promising, with ongoing research and technological innovations paving the way for improved patient outcomes (Chong et al., 2015).", "References":
