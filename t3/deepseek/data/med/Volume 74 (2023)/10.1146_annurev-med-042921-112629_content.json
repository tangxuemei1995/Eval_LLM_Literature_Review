{"Literature Review": "Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of genomics, offering a novel approach to quantify inherited risk for complex diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). By aggregating the effects of numerous genetic variants, each contributing a small effect size, PGS provide a comprehensive measure of an individual's genetic predisposition to CAD. Recent advancements in genetic association studies and the development of sophisticated statistical algorithms have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of PGS, enabling the identification of individuals at high genetic risk for CAD from birth (Khera et al., 2018). This represents a paradigm shift in preventive medicine, as it allows for the early identification of at-risk individuals who may not be identified through traditional risk factors or family history alone. The utility of PGS in CAD risk prediction has been underscored by studies demonstrating that individuals in the top percentile of PGS distribution have up to three times the normal risk of developing CAD (Inouye et al., 2018). This heightened risk, attributable solely to genetic variation, highlights the potential of PGS to complement existing risk assessment tools and inform personalized prevention strategies. Evidence suggests that individuals identified with increased genetic risk can significantly reduce their risk of CAD through adherence to a healthy lifestyle and the use of cholesterol-lowering therapies (Nataraajan et al., 2017). These interventions have been shown to mitigate the genetic risk, underscoring the importance of integrating PGS into clinical practice to guide preventive measures. However, the enthusiasm for PGS is tempered by challenges related to their equitable performance across diverse ancestries. Studies have shown that PGS developed primarily in populations of European ancestry may not perform as well in other populations, potentially exacerbating health disparities (Martin et al., 2019). Addressing this issue requires the inclusion of diverse populations in genetic studies and the development of ancestry-specific PGS. Furthermore, the integration of PGS into clinical practice necessitates careful consideration of ethical, legal, and social implications, as well as the development of guidelines for their use in risk assessment and management (Torkamani et al., 2018). Randomized controlled trials are also needed to confirm the clinical utility of PGS in reducing CAD risk and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PGS-guided interventions. In conclusion, PGS represent a promising tool for the early identification of individuals at high genetic risk for CAD, offering the potential to revolutionize preventive medicine. However, realizing this potential requires ongoing research to address the challenges related to the equitable performance of PGS across diverse populations, the integration of PGS into clinical practice, and the confirmation of their clinical utility through randomized trials.", "References": [{"title": "Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations", "authors": "Amit V.
