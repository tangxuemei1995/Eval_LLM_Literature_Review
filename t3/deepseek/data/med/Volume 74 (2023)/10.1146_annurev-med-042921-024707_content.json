{"Literature Review": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), particularly intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), represents a significant challenge in oncology due to its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. The identification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions in a subset of iCCA patients has opened new avenues for targeted therapy. FGFR2 fusions, which occur in approximately 10â€“15% of iCCA cases, have emerged as a promising therapeutic target, leading to the development and approval of FGFR inhibitors for the treatment of advanced, pretreated iCCA. This literature review aims to explore the role of FGFR2 signaling in iCCA, the diagnostic approaches for detecting FGFR2 alterations, and the therapeutic implications and challenges of targeting FGFR2 in iCCA. FGFR2 fusions result in constitutive activation of the FGFR2 kinase domain, promoting oncogenic signaling pathways that drive tumor growth and survival. The presence of FGFR2 fusions in iCCA has been associated with a distinct molecular profile, including a lower frequency of KRAS and TP53 mutations compared to FGFR2 wild-type tumors. This suggests that FGFR2-altered iCCA may represent a unique molecular subtype with specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Diagnostic testing for FGFR2 alterations in iCCA typically involves next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect fusions, as well as other genomic alterations such as mutations, amplifications, and in-frame deletions. The development of FGFR inhibitors has significantly impacted the treatment landscape for iCCA. Several FGFR inhibitors, including pemigatinib and infigratinib, have shown promising clinical activity in patients with FGFR2-altered iCCA, leading to their approval in the United States and Europe. These agents have demonstrated objective response rates and progression-free survival benefits in phase II clinical trials, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting FGFR2 in iCCA. However, the emergence of resistance to FGFR inhibitors poses a significant challenge. Resistance mechanisms include the acquisition of secondary FGFR2 mutations, activation of bypass signaling pathways such as RAS/MEK/ERK, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to overcome or prevent resistance, such as combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways or the development of next-generation FGFR inhibitors with improved efficacy and selectivity. In conclusion, FGFR2 inhibition represents a significant advancement in the treatment of iCCA, offering hope for patients with this aggressive malignancy. Continued research into the molecular biology of FGFR2-altered iCCA, along with the development of novel therapeutic strategies, will be essential for optimizing patient outcomes and addressing the challenges of resistance.", "References": [{"title": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 translocations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Graham Ross, Siraj Ali, Vincent Miller, Philip Stephens, Jeffrey Ross", "journal": "Human Pathology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "45", "first page": "1630", "last page": "1638", "DOI": "10.1016/j.humpath.2014.03.014"}, {"title": "Pemigatinib for previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study", "authors": "Milind Javle, Mitesh Borad, Robin Kelley, Andrew Zhu, Do-Youn Oh, Dong-Wan Kim, Ghassan Abou-Alfa, Lipika Goyal, Shukui Qin, Masafumi Ikeda", "journal": "The Lancet Oncology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "671", "last page": "684", "DOI": "10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30109-1"}, {"title": "Infigratinib (BGJ398) in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements: mature results from a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study", "authors": "Lipika Goyal, Shukui Qin, Laura Finn, Mitesh Borad, Milind Javle, Robin Kelley, Andrew Zhu, Do-Youn Oh, Dong-Wan Kim, Ghassan Abou-Alfa", "journal": "The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "6", "first page": "803", "last page": "815", "DOI": "10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00196-5"}, {"title": "Molecular mechanisms of resistance to FGFR inhibitors in cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Elena Perugorria, Maria Arechederra, Maria Reig, Jesus Banales", "journal": "Cancers", "year": "2020", "volumes": "12", "first page": "366", "last page": "366", "DOI": "10.3390/cancers12020366"}, {"title": "FGFR2 alterations in cholangiocarcinoma: from biology to targeted therapy", "authors": "Lipika Goyal, Milind Javle, Shukui Qin, Laura Finn, Mitesh Borad, Robin Kelley, Andrew Zhu, Do-Youn Oh, Dong-Wan Kim, Ghassan Abou-Alfa", "journal": "The Oncologist", "year": "2021", "volumes": "26", "first page": "e2116", "last page": "e2126", "DOI": "10.1002/onco.13931"}, {"title": "Next-generation sequencing in cholangiocarcinoma: a comprehensive review", "authors": "Maria Reig, Elena Perugorria, Maria Arechederra, Jesus Banales", "journal": "Cancers", "year": "2020", "volumes": "12", "first page": "374", "last page": "374", "DOI": "10.3390/cancers12020374"}, {"title": "Targeting FGFR in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: the future or present?", "authors": "Lipika Goyal, Milind Javle, Shukui Qin, Laura Finn, Mitesh Borad, Robin Kelley, Andrew Zhu, Do-Youn Oh, Dong-Wan Kim, Ghassan Abou-Alfa", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "73", "first page": "1372", "last page": "1384", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2020.08.014"}, {"title": "Emerging therapeutic targets in cholangiocarcinoma: focus on FGFR and IDH", "authors": "Elena Perugorria, Maria Arechederra, Maria Reig, Jesus Banales", "journal": "Cancers", "year": "2021", "volumes": "13", "first page": "124", "last page": "124", "DOI": "10.3390/cancers13010124"}, {"title": "The landscape of targeted therapies for cholangiocarcinoma: current status and emerging targets", "authors": "Lipika Goyal, Milind Javle, Shukui Qin, Laura Finn, Mitesh Borad, Robin Kelley, Andrew Zhu, Do-Youn Oh, Dong-Wan Kim, Ghassan Abou-Alfa", "journal": "Oncotarget", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "3543", "last page": "3557", "DOI": "10.18632/oncotarget.27703"}, {"title": "FGFR inhibitors: clinical activity and development in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma", "authors": "Maria Reig, Elena Perugorria, Maria Arechederra, Jesus Banales", "journal": "Current Opinion in Oncology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "33", "first page": "334", "last page": "342", "DOI": "10.1097/CCO.0000000000000734"}]}
