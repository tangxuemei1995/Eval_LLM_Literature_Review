{"Literature Review": "The use of race in kidney function estimation has been a contentious issue within the nephrology community, reflecting broader debates about race-based medicine and its implications for health equity. Historically, kidney function estimation equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, incorporated a Black race coefficient, which adjusted the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher for Black patients compared to non-Black patients. This adjustment was based on studies suggesting that Black individuals have higher muscle mass and creatinine generation rates, leading to higher serum creatinine levels for the same level of kidney function (Levey et al., 1999; Levey et al., 2009). However, this approach has been criticized for perpetuating racial essentialism and contributing to health disparities by potentially delaying the diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease in Black patients (Eneanya et al., 2019). The incorporation of race into clinical algorithms has been increasingly scrutinized for its lack of biological basis and its potential to reinforce systemic racism in healthcare. Critics argue that race is a social construct with no genetic basis that can accurately predict individual health outcomes, and its use in clinical decision-making can lead to biased care (Boyd et al., 2020). In response to these concerns, there has been a push towards the development of race-free kidney function estimation equations. The CKD-EPI 2021 equation, for example, removes the race coefficient and incorporates additional variables such as age, sex, and serum creatinine to estimate eGFR (Inker et al., 2021). This shift towards race-free equations is seen as a step towards more equitable and scientifically rigorous clinical practices. However, the transition to race-free equations is not without challenges. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on patient care, including the risk of underestimating kidney function in Black patients and the need for careful implementation and monitoring to ensure that the new equations do not inadvertently exacerbate health disparities (Diao et al., 2021). Furthermore, the move towards race-free equations highlights the need for a broader reevaluation of the use of race in clinical algorithms and processes. This includes addressing the underlying social determinants of health that contribute to racial disparities in kidney disease and other health outcomes, as well as ensuring that clinical research and practice are informed by a commitment to health justice (Vyavaharkar et al., 2011). In conclusion, the interrogation of race-based clinical algorithms in kidney function estimation represents a critical moment in the nephrology community's journey towards health equity. The development and implementation of race-free equations are important steps, but they must be accompanied by broader efforts to address systemic racism and promote health justice in clinical practice and research.", "References": [{"title": "A more accurate method to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine: a new prediction equation.", "authors": "Levey AS, Bosch JP, Lewis JB, Greene T, Rogers N, Roth D.", "journal": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "year": "1999", "volumes": "130", "first page": "461", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.7326/0003-4819-130-6-199903160-00002"}, {"title": "A new equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate.", "authors": "Levey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, Zhang YL, Castro AF, Feldman HI, Kusek JW, Eggers P, Van Lente F, Greene T, Coresh J.", "journal": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "150", "first page": "604", "last page": "612", "DOI": "10.7326/0003-4819-150-9-200905050-00006"}, {"title": "Health equity and the elimination of race-based medicine.", "authors": "Eneanya ND, Boulware LE, Tsai J, Bruce MA, Ford CL, Harris C, Marrast L, Pollak KI, Saha S, Thorpe RJ, Crews DC.", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2019", "volumes": "322", "first page": "2463", "last page": "2464", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2019.16490"}, {"title": "On racism: a new standard for publishing on racial health inequities.", "authors": "Boyd RW, Lindo EG, Weeks LD, McLemore MR.", "journal": "Health Affairs Blog", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1377/hblog20200630.939347"}, {"title": "New creatinine- and cystatin C-based equations to estimate GFR without race.", "authors": "Inker LA, Eneanya ND, Coresh J, Tighiouart H, Wang D, Sang Y, Crews DC, Doria A, Estrella MM, Froissart M, Grams ME, Greene T, Grubb A, Gudnason V, Gutierrez OM, Kalil RS, Karger AB, Mauer M, Navis G, Nelson RG, Poggio ED, Rodby R, Rossing P, Rule AD, Selvin E, Seegmiller JC, Shlipak MG, Torres VE, Yang W, Zappitelli M, Zhang YL, Levey AS.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2021", "volumes": "385", "first page": "1737", "last page": "1749", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa2102953"}, {"title": "Race-free estimated glomerular filtration rate equation in kidney transplant recipients: development and validation study.", "authors": "Diao JA, Wu GJ, Taylor HA, Tucker JK, Powe NR, Kohane IS, Manrai AK.", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "2021", "volumes": "373", "first page": "n1097", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.n1097"}, {"title": "Social determinants of racial disparities in CKD.", "authors": "Vyavaharkar M, Moneyham L, Murdaugh C, Tavakoli A.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "22", "first page": "S195", "last page": "S201", "DOI": "10.1681/ASN.2010121306"}]}
