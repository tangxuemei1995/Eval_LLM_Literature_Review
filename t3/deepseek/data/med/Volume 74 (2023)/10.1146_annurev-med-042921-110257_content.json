{"Literature Review": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought to light numerous complications associated with the virus, among which thrombotic events have emerged as significant contributors to morbidity and mortality. Early in the pandemic, clinicians observed an increased incidence of both venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19, prompting a surge in research aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying effective therapeutic strategies. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic interventions for thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients. The association between COVID-19 and thrombotic complications was first noted in observational studies, which reported a high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as arterial thromboses such as stroke and myocardial infarction in hospitalized patients (Klok et al., 2020). These findings were corroborated by subsequent studies, highlighting the critical need for effective thromboprophylaxis and treatment strategies in this patient population. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated thrombosis is multifactorial, involving endothelial injury, hypercoagulability, and stasis of blood flow, collectively referred to as Virchow's triad. Endothelial injury is thought to result from direct viral invasion and the subsequent inflammatory response, leading to the activation of the coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation (Varga et al., 2020). Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients is characterized by elevated levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor, among other markers of coagulation activation (Tang et al., 2020). Stasis of blood flow may be exacerbated by immobilization and the use of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. Given the high risk of thrombotic events, anticoagulation therapy has been a cornerstone of management for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Initial guidance was largely based on expert opinion and observational data, which suggested a potential benefit of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation in reducing thrombotic events and possibly mortality (Paranjpe et al., 2020). However, the optimal dosing and duration of anticoagulation remained uncertain, leading to the initiation of several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to address these questions. The results of these RCTs have significantly advanced our understanding of the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19. The ATTACC, ACTIV-4a, and REMAP-CAP trials collectively demonstrated that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin reduces the need for organ support and improves survival in noncritically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (REMAP-CAP Investigators et al., 2021). Conversely, in critically ill patients, therapeutic anticoagulation did not confer a survival benefit and was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These findings have informed clinical practice guidelines, recommending therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for noncritically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and prophylactic doses for critically ill patients. In addition to anticoagulation, the role of antiplatelet therapy in COVID-19 has been explored, though evidence remains limited. The RECOVERY trial investigated the use of aspirin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and found a modest reduction in mortality and thrombotic events, suggesting a potential benefit in certain patient populations (RECOVERY Collaborative Group, 2021). However, further research is needed to clarify the role of antiplatelet agents in the management of COVID-19-associated thrombosis. In conclusion, thrombotic complications represent a significant challenge in the management of COVID-19, with a complex pathophysiology that involves endothelial injury, hypercoagulability, and stasis. The results of recent RCTs have provided valuable insights into the role of anticoagulation, demonstrating a clear benefit of therapeutic-dose heparin in noncritically ill hospitalized patients. As the pandemic continues to evolve, ongoing research will be essential to refine therapeutic strategies and improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis.", "References": [{"title": "Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19", "authors": "Klok, F.A., Kruip, M.J.H.A., van der Meer, N.J.M., Arbous, M.S., Gommers, D.A.M.P.J., Kant, K.M., Kaptein, F.H.J., van Paassen, J., Stals, M.A.M., Huisman, M.V.", "journal": "Thrombosis Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "191", "first page": "145", "last page": "147", "DOI": "10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013"}, {"title": "Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19", "authors": "Varga, Z., Flammer, A.J., Steiger, P., Haberecker, M., Andermatt, R., Zinkernagel, A.S., Mehra, M.R., Schuepbach, R.A., Ruschitzka, F., Moch, H.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2020", "volumes": "395", "first page": "1417", "last page": "1418", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30937-5"}, {"title": "Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia", "authors": "Tang, N., Li, D., Wang, X., Sun, Z.", "journal": "Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "18", "first page": "844", "last page": "847", "DOI": "10.1111/jth.14768"}, {"title": "Association of treatment dose anticoagulation with in-hospital survival among hospitalized patients with COVID-19", "authors": "Paranjpe, I., Fuster, V., Lala, A., Russak, A.J., Glicksberg, B.S., Levin, M.A., Charney, A.W., Narula, J., Fayad, Z.A., Bagiella, E.", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "75", "first page": "2450", "last page": "2459", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.001"}, {"title": "Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin in noncritically ill patients with Covid-19", "authors": "REMAP-CAP Investigators, ACTIV-4a Investigators, ATTACC Investigators", "journal": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2021", "volumes": "385", "first page": "790", "last page": "802", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa2105911"}, {"title": "Aspirin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial", "authors": "RECOVERY Collaborative Group", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2021", "volumes": "397", "first page": "1637", "last page": "1645", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00633-8"}]}
