{"Literature Review": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) have emerged as a significant therapeutic class, not only for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) but also for their profound kidney protective effects. Initially developed to lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated benefits beyond glycemic control, particularly in improving kidney outcomes across a spectrum of patient populations. This literature review delves into the mechanisms underlying the kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, their impact on various kidney-related outcomes, and their safety profile, supported by evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are believed to be mediated through multiple mechanisms, including hemodynamic changes, metabolic effects, anti-inflammatory actions, and antifibrotic properties. Hemodynamically, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure by promoting natriuresis and lowering blood pressure, which in turn decreases the risk of kidney damage. Metabolically, these agents improve glycemic control and reduce oxidative stress, contributing to kidney protection. Additionally, their anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects help in mitigating the progression of kidney disease. Clinical trials have consistently shown that SGLT2 inhibitors improve kidney outcomes in patients with T2D, including reductions in albuminuria, slower progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and decreased risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Notably, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors extend to patients without diabetes, as evidenced by dedicated kidney outcome trials. These trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD, irrespective of diabetes status. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with a decreased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), a finding supported by both clinical trials and real-world data. The safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is generally favorable, with most adverse effects being mild to moderate in severity. However, attention should be paid to the risk of genital mycotic infections and, less commonly, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors represent a significant advancement in the management of kidney disease, offering benefits that extend beyond their glucose-lowering effects. Their ability to improve kidney outcomes across diverse patient populations, coupled with a favorable safety profile, underscores their importance in the therapeutic arsenal against kidney disease.", "References": [{"title": "Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy", "authors": "Vlado Perkovic, Meg J.
