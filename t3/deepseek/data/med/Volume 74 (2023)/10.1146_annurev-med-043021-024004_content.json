{"Literature Review": "The integration of medical technologies into clinical practice has revolutionized healthcare delivery, offering unprecedented opportunities for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. However, the emergence of racial and ethnic biases within these technologies, particularly in pulmonary medicine, poses significant challenges to equitable healthcare. This literature review explores the origins of such biases, focusing on pulse oximetry, pulmonary function testing, and predictive healthcare algorithms, and discusses the implications for health disparities.Pulse oximetry, a non-invasive method to measure oxygen saturation, has been identified as a technology with inherent racial and ethnic biases. Studies have shown that pulse oximeters tend to overestimate oxygen saturation in patients with darker skin pigmentation, leading to potential underdiagnosis of hypoxemia in these populations. This discrepancy is attributed to the technology's reliance on light absorption, which can be affected by skin pigmentation. The foundational studies that developed pulse oximetry calibration curves predominantly included lighter-skinned individuals, resulting in a technology that is less accurate for darker-skinned patients (Sjoding et al., 2020).Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is another area where racial and ethnic biases have been documented. PFTs are essential for diagnosing and managing respiratory diseases, but the interpretation of test results often relies on race-specific reference equations. These equations, derived from population studies, may not accurately reflect the physiological differences across racial and ethnic groups, leading to misclassification of disease severity. The use of race as a biological variable in PFT algorithms has been criticized for perpetuating health disparities by normalizing lower lung function in certain racial groups (Braun et al., 2013).Predictive healthcare algorithms, designed to forecast patient outcomes and guide clinical decision-making, have also been scrutinized for racial and ethnic biases. These algorithms often incorporate variables that are proxies for race or socioeconomic status, inadvertently encoding biases into their predictions. For example, algorithms used to allocate healthcare resources have been found to systematically disadvantage Black patients by underestimating their healthcare needs. This bias arises from the use of healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs, which fails to account for the systemic barriers to accessing care faced by marginalized populations (Obermeyer et al., 2019).The origins of racial and ethnic biases in pulmonary technologies can be traced to several factors. First, the design and development of medical technologies often fail to consider the full spectrum of human diversity, leading to devices and algorithms that perform optimally only for certain populations. Second, the data used to train and validate these technologies are frequently unrepresentative, with minority groups being underrepresented in clinical trials and research studies. Third, the conflation of biological with social determinants of health in medical algorithms perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces health disparities.Addressing these biases requires a multifaceted approach. Enhancing the diversity of participants in clinical research and technology development is crucial to ensure that medical technologies are effective across all populations. Regulatory standards for the evaluation of medical devices and algorithms must be updated to include assessments of racial and ethnic bias. Additionally, there is a need for greater transparency in the development and validation of predictive healthcare algorithms, including the disclosure of the variables used and their potential impact on health disparities.In conclusion, racial and ethnic biases in pulmonary technologies are a significant concern that undermines the goal of equitable healthcare. By understanding the origins of these biases and implementing safeguards to mitigate their impact, the medical community can take a crucial step towards eliminating health disparities and ensuring that all patients benefit from advances in medical technology.", "References": [{"title": "Racial Bias in Pulse Oximetry Measurement", "authors": "Michael W.
