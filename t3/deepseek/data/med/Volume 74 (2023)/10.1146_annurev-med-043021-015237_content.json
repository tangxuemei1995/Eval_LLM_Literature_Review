{"Literature Review": "The global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been a monumental effort in combating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, leading to significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. However, the administration of these vaccines to billions of individuals has also unveiled rare adverse events, including SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). VITT is a rare but serious immunologic complication associated primarily with adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines, such as those developed by AstraZeneca-Oxford and Johnson & Johnson. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on VITT, focusing on its incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. VITT was first identified in early 2021, with initial reports describing a syndrome characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, often in unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinuses and splanchnic veins, occurring 5 to 30 days post-vaccination. The incidence of VITT is estimated to be between 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 vaccine recipients, making it a rare but significant complication. The pathophysiology of VITT is thought to involve an immune response to the adenovirus vector, leading to the production of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), which in turn activates platelets and induces a prothrombotic state. This mechanism shares similarities with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but VITT occurs in the absence of heparin exposure. Diagnosis of VITT is based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, and the detection of anti-PF4 antibodies. Imaging studies are crucial for identifying thrombotic events. Treatment strategies for VITT have evolved with increased clinical experience. Initial observations suggested that heparin could exacerbate the condition, leading to recommendations for alternative anticoagulants such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or non-heparin anticoagulants. Immunomodulatory therapies, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids, have also been employed to mitigate the immune response. The rapid dissemination of information on VITT through social media and scientific publications has facilitated early recognition and management of this condition. Ongoing research and surveillance are essential to further understand VITT, optimize treatment protocols, and ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccination programs. In conclusion, VITT represents a rare but serious complication of adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. Awareness of its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management is crucial for healthcare providers to promptly diagnose and treat affected individuals, thereby minimizing adverse outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination", "authors": "Marie Scully, David Singh, Roopen Arya", "journal": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2021", "volumes": "384", "first page": "2124", "last page": "2130", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa2104882"}, {"title": "Pathologic Antibodies to Platelet Factor 4 after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination", "authors": "Andreas Greinacher, Thomas Thiele, Theodore E.
