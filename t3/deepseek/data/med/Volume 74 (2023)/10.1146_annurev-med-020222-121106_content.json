{"Literature Review": "The field of adult transgender medicine has seen significant advancements and challenges in recent years. Transgender individuals often encounter substantial barriers to accessing healthcare, including a lack of knowledgeable providers, discrimination, and significant gaps in research. These barriers contribute to disparities in health outcomes for transgender populations. Research has predominantly focused on mental health issues, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and substance abuse within these communities. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and surgery, in aligning an individual's physical characteristics with their gender identity, thereby improving quality of life. The Endocrine Society's 2017 treatment guidelines represent a pivotal moment in the standardization of care for transgender individuals, yet there remains a pressing need for further research to address the existing gaps in knowledge and to inform future revisions of these guidelines. Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) has been shown to offer significant benefits, including improvements in psychological well-being and quality of life, which may outweigh the risks associated with exogenous hormone use. Studies have demonstrated that GAHT can lead to positive changes in body satisfaction and reduce gender dysphoria, thereby enhancing overall mental health. However, the long-term effects of hormone therapy, particularly concerning cardiovascular health and cancer risk, remain areas of concern and require further investigation. The revision of the Endocrine Society's guidelines in 2017 was a response to the evolving understanding of transgender health needs and aimed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the care of transgender individuals. These guidelines emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to care, involving endocrinologists, mental health professionals, and surgeons, to address the complex needs of transgender patients. Despite these advancements, there is a consensus among researchers and clinicians that more longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the long-term outcomes of gender-affirming treatments and to identify best practices for care. The field of transgender medicine is rapidly evolving, and ongoing research is essential to ensure that transgender individuals receive the highest standard of care. Future studies should aim to address the gaps in knowledge regarding the long-term effects of hormone therapy, the impact of gender-affirming surgeries on quality of life, and the development of comprehensive care models that address the unique needs of transgender populations. By closing these research gaps, healthcare providers can better support the health and well-being of transgender individuals, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and quality of life for this underserved population.", "References": [{"title": "Endocrine Treatment of Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline", "authors": "Wylie C.
