{"Literature Review": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that significantly impacts the quality of life and longevity of affected individuals. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to the malfunction or absence of the CFTR protein. This protein is crucial for the regulation of chloride and sodium transport across epithelial membranes, and its dysfunction results in the production of thick, sticky mucus in various organs, particularly the lungs and pancreas. Traditional management strategies for CF have primarily focused on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications through a combination of physiotherapy, nutritional support, and medications targeting specific organ systems. However, the landscape of CF treatment has been revolutionized by the development of CFTR modulator therapies, which directly address the underlying genetic defect. CFTR modulators are small molecules that improve the function of the defective CFTR protein. They are classified into different categories based on their mechanism of action: potentiators, which enhance the activity of CFTR proteins at the cell surface; correctors, which facilitate the proper folding and trafficking of CFTR proteins to the cell membrane; and amplifiers, which increase the amount of CFTR protein available for correction. The introduction of CFTR modulators has marked a paradigm shift in CF care, offering the potential for disease modification rather than just symptom management. Ivacaftor, the first CFTR potentiator approved by the FDA, has shown remarkable efficacy in patients with specific gating mutations, leading to significant improvements in lung function, nutritional status, and quality of life. Subsequent developments have seen the approval of combination therapies, such as lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor, which target a broader range of CFTR mutations, including the most common F508del mutation. These therapies have demonstrated substantial benefits in clinical trials, including reduced pulmonary exacerbations, improved lung function, and better overall health outcomes. The latest advancement in CFTR modulator therapy is the triple combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, which has shown unprecedented efficacy in patients with at least one F508del mutation, the most prevalent CF-causing mutation. This therapy has been associated with dramatic improvements in lung function, sweat chloride levels, and patient-reported outcomes, heralding a new era in CF treatment. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the widespread adoption and accessibility of CFTR modulators, including high costs, variable insurance coverage, and the need for long-term safety and efficacy data. Moreover, not all CF patients are eligible for current modulator therapies, particularly those with rare or non-responsive mutations, highlighting the need for continued research and development in this field. The impact of CFTR modulators extends beyond clinical outcomes, offering hope and a new perspective on life for individuals with CF and their families. As research progresses, the potential for personalized medicine in CF, tailored to the specific genetic mutations of each patient, becomes increasingly tangible, promising further improvements in the management and prognosis of this complex disease.", "References": [{"title": "Cystic fibrosis: a review of associated phenotypes, use of molecular diagnostic approaches, genetic characteristics, progress, and dilemmas", "authors": "Cutting, Garry R.", "journal": "Journal of Pediatrics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "173", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.04.066"}, {"title": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) opens the defective channel gate of mutant CFTR in a phosphorylation-dependent but ATP-independent manner", "authors": "Jih, Kang-Yang, Hwang, Tzyh-Chang", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "287", "first page": "36639", "last page": "36649", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M112.393637"}, {"title": "Lumacaftor–Ivacaftor in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for Phe508del CFTR", "authors": "Wainwright, Claire E., Elborn, J.
