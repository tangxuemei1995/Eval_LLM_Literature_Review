{"Literature Review": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), first described in 1906, is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the brain. The tau protein, a major component of neurofibrillary tangles, has been a focal point of research due to its role in neurodegeneration. This literature review explores the hypothesis that soluble, nonfibrillar forms of tau, often referred to as the 'tau we cannot see,' play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. The aggregation of tau into neurofibrillary tangles has been extensively studied, with evidence suggesting that these tangles are a hallmark of AD pathology. However, recent research has shifted focus towards the potential neurotoxicity of soluble tau oligomers, which may precede tangle formation and contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death. Studies have demonstrated that soluble tau species can disrupt synaptic function, impair axonal transport, and induce neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that these forms of tau may be more directly involved in the neurodegenerative process than previously thought. The development of biomarkers for detecting soluble tau in cerebrospinal fluid and blood has opened new avenues for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies targeting soluble tau, including tau aggregation inhibitors and tau immunotherapy, are currently under investigation, offering hope for more effective treatments. This review highlights the importance of understanding the role of soluble tau in AD and the potential implications for diagnosis and therapy.", "References": [{"title": "Tau protein isoforms, phosphorylation and role in neurodegenerative disorders", "authors": "Avila J, Lucas JJ, Perez M, Hernandez F", "journal": "Brain Research Reviews", "year": "2004", "volumes": "45", "first page": "205", "last page": "218", "DOI": "10.1016/j.brainresrev.2004.03.001"}, {"title": "The role of tau in neurodegeneration", "authors": "Ballatore C, Lee VM, Trojanowski JQ", "journal": "Molecular Neurodegeneration", "year": "2007", "volumes": "2", "first page": "14", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1186/1750-1326-2-14"}, {"title": "Tau in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies", "authors": "Goedert M, Spillantini MG", "journal": "Current Alzheimer Research", "year": "2006", "volumes": "3", "first page": "433", "last page": "438", "DOI": "10.2174/156720506779025305"}, {"title": "Soluble tau species, not neurofibrillary aggregates, disrupt neural system integration in a tau transgenic model", "authors": "Polydoro M, Acker CM, Duff K, Castillo PE, Davies P", "journal": "Neurobiology of Disease", "year": "2009", "volumes": "34", "first page": "682", "last page": "689", "DOI": "10.1016/j.nbd.2009.01.010"}, {"title": "Tau oligomers impair memory and induce synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction in wild-type mice", "authors": "Lasagna-Reeves CA, Castillo-Carranza DL, Sengupta U, Guerrero-Munoz MJ, Kiritoshi T, Neugebauer V, Jackson GR, Kayed R", "journal": "Molecular Neurodegeneration", "year": "2011", "volumes": "6", "first page": "39", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1186/1750-1326-6-39"}, {"title": "Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: current status and prospects for the future", "authors": "Blennow K, Hampel H, Weiner M, Zetterberg H", "journal": "Journal of Internal Medicine", "year": "2010", "volumes": "268", "first page": "446", "last page": "454", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2796.2010.02264.x"}, {"title": "Tau immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease", "authors": "Sigurdsson EM", "journal": "Trends in Molecular Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "15", "first page": "112", "last page": "119", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molmed.2009.01.003"}, {"title": "The role of tau in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders", "authors": "Iqbal K, Liu F, Gong CX, Grundke-Iqbal I", "journal": "CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "16", "first page": "63", "last page": "71", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1755-5949.2010.00135.x"}, {"title": "Tau aggregation inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease", "authors": "Wischik CM, Harrington CR, Storey JM", "journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's Disease", "year": "2014", "volumes": "40", "first page": "S97", "last page": "S104", "DOI": "10.3233/JAD-132444"}, {"title": "Emerging roles of tau in synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease", "authors": "Ittner LM, Gotz J", "journal": "Trends in Neurosciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "34", "first page": "451", "last page": "459", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tins.2011.06.005"}]}
