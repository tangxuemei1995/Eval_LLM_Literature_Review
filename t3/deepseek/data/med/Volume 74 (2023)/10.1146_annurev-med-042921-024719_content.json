{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in the treatment of relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies, offering hope where traditional therapies have failed. Despite the initial success and high overall response rates, the challenge of relapse post CAR T cell therapy remains a significant hurdle. One of the primary mechanisms of relapse is the loss of the target antigen, particularly CD19, which has been extensively documented in the literature (Maude et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015). The phenomenon of CD19 loss not only underscores the adaptability of cancer cells but also highlights the need for innovative strategies to counteract this evasion mechanism.\n\nThe mechanism behind CD19 loss and the identification of patients at higher risk for this occurrence are areas of active research. Studies have suggested that genetic alterations, such as mutations or deletions in the CD19 gene, may contribute to antigen loss (Sotillo et al., 2015). Additionally, the tumor microenvironment and the selective pressure exerted by CAR T cell therapy itself may play roles in the emergence of CD19-negative clones (Ruella et al., 2016). Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or overcome antigen loss.\n\nTo address the challenge of antigen loss, researchers have turned to the development of multispecific CAR T cells, which target more than one antigen simultaneously. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of bispecific CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD20 or CD19 and CD22 to effectively kill CD19-negative tumor cells (Zah et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2018). These findings have paved the way for clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of multispecific CAR T cells in patients with B cell malignancies.\n\nPhase I clinical trials of CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CAR T cells have shown promising results, with evidence of efficacy, manageable safety profiles, and a reduced incidence of CD19-negative relapse (Turtle et al., 2017; Fry et al., 2018). These early studies suggest that multispecific CAR T cells can indeed deprive lymphomas of the ability to escape therapy via antigen loss. However, several questions remain unanswered, including the selection of the most effective target antigens, the optimal design of CAR constructs, and the potential for these therapies to induce long-term remissions.\n\nThe selection of target antigens is a critical consideration in the design of multispecific CAR T cells. Antigens must be chosen based on their expression patterns, the likelihood of antigen loss, and the potential for on-target, off-tumor effects. The development of trispecific CAR T cells, which target three antigens simultaneously, represents an evolution of this strategy and may offer additional benefits in terms of preventing antigen escape (Guedan et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising approach to overcoming the challenge of antigen loss in the treatment of B cell malignancies. While early clinical trials have shown encouraging results, further research is needed to optimize the design of these therapies, understand their mechanisms of action, and determine their long-term efficacy. As the field of CAR T cell therapy continues to evolve, the development of multispecific CARs may play a pivotal role in improving outcomes for patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas.", "References": [{"title": "Chimeric antigen receptor T cells for sustained remissions in leukemia", "authors": "Maude, Shannon L., Frey, Noelle, Shaw, Pamela A., Aplenc, Richard, Barrett, David M., Bunin, Nancy J., Chew, Anne, Gonzalez, Vanessa E., Zheng, Zhaohui, Lacey, Simon F., Mahnke, Yolanda D., Melenhorst, J.
