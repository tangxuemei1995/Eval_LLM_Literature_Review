{"Literature Review": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). This mutation results in the polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin, causing red blood cells to adopt a sickle shape, which leads to vaso-occlusive crises, hemolytic anemia, and multi-organ damage. Traditional treatments have focused on symptom management and prevention of complications, but recent advances in gene therapy offer the potential for a curative approach. This literature review explores the diverse strategies employed in the gene therapy of SCD, focusing on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, gene addition, and gene editing technologies. Allogeneic HSC transplantation has been the only curative treatment for SCD, but its application is limited by the availability of matched donors and the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Autologous HSC transplantation, where a patient's own HSCs are genetically modified and then reinfused, circumvents these limitations. Lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition has emerged as a promising strategy, where a functional β-globin gene or an anti-sickling variant is introduced into HSCs. Clinical trials have demonstrated significant clinical improvements in patients treated with this approach, with sustained production of therapeutic hemoglobin and reduction in SCD-related complications. Gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, offer a more precise method for correcting the SCD mutation or reactivating fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression, which can ameliorate the disease phenotype. These approaches are still in the developmental stage but hold great promise for the future of SCD treatment. The transition of gene therapy from concept to clinical reality for SCD represents a significant milestone in the field of genetic medicine, offering hope for a definitive cure for this debilitating disease.", "References": [{"title": "Gene Therapy in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease", "authors": "Matthew H.
