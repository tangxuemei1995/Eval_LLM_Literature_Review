{"Literature Review": "Emotion regulation within the context of intimate relationships has garnered significant attention in psychological research, particularly as it pertains to the developmental trajectory across adulthood. This literature review synthesizes current findings and theoretical perspectives on couples' emotion regulation, emphasizing its dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, and bivalent qualities. The exploration begins with an overview of key concepts and measurement approaches, followed by a discussion on the socioemotional turn in adult development, and concludes with a life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples. Emotion regulation, defined as the processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions, is particularly salient in the context of intimate relationships. These relationships serve as a primary context for emotional experiences and regulation, with implications for relationship quality, individual well-being, and health across the lifespan. The measurement of emotion regulation in couples has evolved from predominantly self-report measures to include performance-based assessments, offering a more nuanced understanding of these processes. Self-report measures, while valuable for capturing subjective experiences, are complemented by performance-based measures that assess emotion regulation in real-time interactions, providing insights into the dynamic and coregulatory aspects of couples' emotion regulation. The socioemotional turn in our understanding of adult development, as articulated by socioemotional selectivity theory, posits that as individuals age, they prioritize emotionally meaningful goals and relationships. This shift has profound implications for emotion regulation in couples, suggesting that older adults may employ more effective emotion regulation strategies that enhance relationship satisfaction and well-being. A life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples reveals distinct patterns and challenges across different stages of adulthood. In infancy and adolescence, emotion regulation is largely influenced by attachment relationships and the development of self-regulation capacities. Young adulthood is characterized by the formation of intimate relationships and the negotiation of emotional interdependence. Midlife couples often face the dual challenges of managing work and family responsibilities, which can strain emotion regulation capacities. In late life, couples may experience a shift towards more positive emotional experiences and effective emotion regulation strategies, reflecting the principles of socioemotional selectivity theory. The idea that emotion regulation shifts from 'me to us' across adulthood underscores the increasing importance of dyadic emotion regulation processes in later life. This shift reflects a move from individual-focused to relationship-focused emotion regulation strategies, which may contribute to the maintenance of relationship quality and individual well-being in older adulthood. The implications of these findings for relationship outcomes, well-being, and health are profound, suggesting that interventions aimed at enhancing couples' emotion regulation capacities could have significant benefits across the lifespan. Future research directions include the exploration of cultural and individual differences in couples' emotion regulation, the development of interventions to enhance emotion regulation in couples, and the longitudinal investigation of emotion regulation processes across the lifespan. In conclusion, emotion regulation in couples is a critical area of research with significant implications for understanding adult development, relationship quality, and well-being across the lifespan. The dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, and bivalent nature of couples' emotion regulation underscores the complexity of these processes and the need for a nuanced understanding of how they evolve across different stages of adulthood.", "References": [{"title": "Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences", "authors": "James J.
