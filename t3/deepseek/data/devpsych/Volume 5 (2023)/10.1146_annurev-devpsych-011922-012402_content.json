{"Literature Review": "Poverty has long been recognized as a significant risk factor for adverse mental health outcomes across the lifespan. Recent advances in neuroimaging have begun to elucidate the mechanisms through which poverty may influence brain development, thereby increasing vulnerability to psychopathology. This literature review explores the current state of research on poverty, brain development, and mental health, highlighting progress, challenges, and potential paths forward. A growing body of evidence suggests that poverty is associated with alterations in brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in stress regulation, executive function, and emotion processing. For example, studies have consistently found that children from low-income families exhibit reduced gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, areas critical for cognitive and emotional regulation (Noble et al., 2015; Luby et al., 2013). These neurobiological changes are thought to mediate the relationship between poverty and increased risk for mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (McLaughlin et al., 2014; Hanson et al., 2013). Despite these advances, the field faces several methodological challenges that raise questions about the validity and generalizability of current findings. One major issue is the reliability of neuroimaging measures, which can be influenced by factors such as scanner variability, motion artifacts, and differences in data processing pipelines (Poldrack et al., 2017). Additionally, the effect sizes of poverty-related brain changes are often small, and there is considerable interindividual heterogeneity in how poverty affects brain development (Duncan et al., 2017). These challenges underscore the need for more robust and replicable research designs. To address these issues, researchers have proposed a multipronged approach that includes changes to data acquisition and analysis pipelines, as well as the adoption of open science practices. For instance, the use of large, diverse samples and advanced statistical techniques can help to mitigate the effects of heterogeneity and improve the reliability of findings (Casey et al., 2018). Furthermore, replication testing and the sharing of data and code can enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research (Munafò et al., 2017). Another promising direction is the integration of neuroimaging findings with intervention research. By examining how changes in the environment, such as poverty alleviation programs, impact brain development and mental health, researchers can gain a better understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships (Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014). For example, a recent study found that participation in a poverty reduction intervention was associated with improvements in brain function and reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression in children (Brody et al., 2019). These findings highlight the potential for neuroscience-informed interventions to mitigate the effects of poverty on mental health. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the impact of poverty on brain development and mental health, there are still many challenges to be addressed. By adopting more rigorous research practices and integrating neuroimaging findings with intervention research, the field can move closer to developing effective strategies for improving the well-being of children in poverty. Ultimately, this research has the potential to inform policy changes that address the root causes of poverty and its associated mental health disparities.", "References": [{"title": "Family income, parental education and brain structure in children and adolescents", "authors": "Kimberly G.
