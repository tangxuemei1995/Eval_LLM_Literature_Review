{"Literature Review": "The understanding of third-party helping interactions in infancy is a burgeoning area of research within developmental psychology, shedding light on the early emergence of social cognition. This literature review synthesizes current findings and theoretical perspectives on how infants perceive and interpret helping actions, focusing on the cognitive mechanisms that may underlie this understanding. The mature concept of helping, as understood by adults, involves recognizing helping as a second-order, goal-directed action aimed at increasing the utility of another agent (the Helpee) by either reducing the cost or increasing the reward of the Helpee's own goal-directed action (Warneken & Tomasello, 2006). However, the pathway through which infants come to grasp this complex concept remains unclear. Recent studies have begun to explore the cognitive prerequisites for understanding helping actions in infancy, proposing simpler alternatives that may serve as foundational steps toward the mature concept. One such alternative is the notion of helping as enabling, which requires infants to attribute second-order goals but does not necessitate a utility calculus (Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007). This perspective suggests that infants may recognize helping actions as those that enable another agent to achieve their goals, without necessarily understanding the utility implications of such actions. Another alternative is the concept of helping as joint action, which involves evaluating the efficiency of actions without requiring second-order goal attribution (Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005). This view posits that infants may perceive helping actions as collaborative efforts aimed at achieving a common goal, focusing on the efficiency of the interaction rather than the underlying goals of the individuals involved. Empirical evidence supports both of these simpler alternatives, indicating that infants are capable of recognizing and responding to helping actions in their environment. For instance, Hamlin et al. (2007) demonstrated that infants as young as six months old prefer individuals who help others over those who hinder, suggesting an early sensitivity to helping behaviors. Similarly, studies by Warneken and Tomasello (2006) have shown that toddlers engage in spontaneous helping behaviors, indicating an understanding of the goals and needs of others. However, the developmental pathway from these simpler understandings to the mature concept of helping remains an open question. Some researchers propose that the transition involves the gradual integration of second-order goal attribution and utility calculus, facilitated by social interactions and cognitive development (Sommerville, Woodward, & Needham, 2005). Others suggest that cultural and environmental factors play a significant role in shaping infants' understanding of helping actions (Callaghan et al., 2011). Despite these advances, several questions remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear how infants differentiate between helping and other types of social interactions, such as sharing or comforting. Additionally, the role of emotional cues in infants' interpretation of helping actions warrants further investigation (Vaish, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2009). Future research should also explore the neural mechanisms underlying infants' understanding of helping, as well as the impact of individual differences in temperament and cognitive abilities on this understanding (Grossmann, 2013). In conclusion, the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves various cognitive and social processes. While significant progress has been made in understanding the early foundations of this ability, further research is needed to elucidate the developmental trajectory and the factors that influence infants' interpretation of helping actions. By addressing these open questions, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of social cognition and the mechanisms that drive the development of prosocial behaviors.", "References": [{"title": "Altruistic Helping in Human Infants and Young Chimpanzees", "authors": "Felix Warneken, Michael Tomasello", "journal": "Science", "year": "2006", "volumes": "311", "first page": "1301", "last page": "1303", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1121448"}, {"title": "Social Evaluation by Preverbal Infants", "authors": "J.
