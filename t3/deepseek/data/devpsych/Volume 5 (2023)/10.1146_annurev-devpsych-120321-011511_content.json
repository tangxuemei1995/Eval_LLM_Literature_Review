{"Literature Review": "Adolescence represents a critical period of development characterized by significant biological, psychological, and social changes. This phase of life is marked by the onset of puberty, which triggers a cascade of hormonal changes that influence brain development and behavior. Concurrently, adolescents navigate increasingly complex social environments, which can have profound implications for their mental health and well-being. The neuroecosocial perspective offers a comprehensive framework for understanding adolescent development by integrating insights from neuroscience, ecology, and social sciences. This literature review explores the interplay between biological maturation, social roles, and the broader societal and cultural contexts in shaping adolescent mental health and brain development. Recent advances in developmental cognitive neuroscience have illuminated the dynamic interactions between the developing brain and its social environment. Studies have shown that the adolescent brain exhibits heightened plasticity, making it particularly sensitive to environmental influences. This plasticity underlies the capacity for learning and adaptation but also renders adolescents vulnerable to adverse experiences. For instance, exposure to socioeconomic inequality has been linked to alterations in brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in stress regulation and executive functioning. These neurobiological changes may contribute to the increased risk of mental health problems observed among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds. Urbanicity, or the experience of living in a city, represents another significant social determinant of adolescent mental health. Research indicates that urban environments can both positively and negatively impact adolescent development. On one hand, cities offer access to educational and cultural resources that can enrich adolescents' lives. On the other hand, urban living is associated with higher levels of stress, pollution, and social isolation, which can adversely affect mental health. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that urban upbringing is associated with differences in brain activity related to stress and emotion regulation, suggesting that the urban environment may shape the neural substrates of mental health. The climate crisis represents an emerging threat to adolescent mental health, with growing concerns about eco-anxiety and its impact on young people's well-being. Eco-anxiety, or chronic fear of environmental doom, has been linked to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among adolescents. The neuroecosocial perspective highlights the importance of considering the ecological context in understanding adolescent mental health. For example, exposure to natural environments has been shown to have restorative effects on the brain, reducing stress and promoting mental well-being. Conversely, the loss of natural habitats and the increasing frequency of climate-related disasters may exacerbate eco-anxiety and its associated mental health problems. Youth-led methods offer a promising approach to addressing the complex challenges faced by adolescents in today's rapidly changing world. By involving young people in research and decision-making processes, these methods empower adolescents to take an active role in shaping their environments and futures. Participatory research has demonstrated the value of youth perspectives in identifying key issues and developing innovative solutions to promote mental health and well-being. Furthermore, youth-led initiatives can foster a sense of agency and resilience, which are critical for navigating the uncertainties of adolescence and the broader societal challenges of the 21st century. In conclusion, the neuroecosocial perspective provides a valuable framework for understanding the multifaceted influences on adolescent development. By integrating insights from neuroscience, ecology, and social sciences, this approach offers a holistic view of the factors shaping adolescent mental health and brain development. Addressing the social determinants of adolescent mental health, including socioeconomic inequality, urbanicity, and the climate crisis, requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers the complex interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors. Youth-led methods represent a promising avenue for empowering adolescents to navigate these challenges and promote their own well-being. As we continue to grapple with rising rates of mental health problems among adolescents, it is imperative that we adopt a neuroecosocial perspective to inform research, policy, and practice in this critical area.", "References": [{"title": "The Teenage Brain: Sensitivity to Social Evaluation", "authors": "Laurence Steinberg", "journal": "Current Directions in Psychological Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "23", "first page": "121", "last page": "127", "DOI": "10.1177/0963721414529148"}, {"title": "Socioeconomic Status and the Brain: Mechanistic Insights from Human and Animal Research", "authors": "Martha J.
