{"Literature Review": "Cognitive control, a cornerstone of human cognition, encompasses the processes necessary for the orchestration of goal-directed thoughts and actions. Its significance spans various life outcomes, including health, wealth, and social capital, making its development a focal point of research. Traditionally, cognitive control has been viewed as a competence or ability, with its development attributed to predetermined maturational sequences. However, this perspective is increasingly challenged by evidence suggesting that cognitive control allocation is a dynamic and rational process, influenced by costâ€“benefit analyses from early in development. This literature review explores the evolution of our understanding of cognitive control development in childhood, emphasizing the shift from a maturational to a rational account and its implications for intervention design and future research. The traditional view of cognitive control development posits that it unfolds along a fixed maturational trajectory, primarily driven by the maturation of the prefrontal cortex. This perspective is supported by studies showing age-related improvements in tasks requiring inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, which are often attributed to the gradual maturation of neural circuits underlying these functions (Diamond, 2013). However, this view has been critiqued for its inability to account for the variability in cognitive control performance across different contexts and its limited explanatory power in understanding individual differences in developmental trajectories. In contrast, the rational account of cognitive control development suggests that cognitive control allocation is a highly adaptive process, shaped by the continuous evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with engaging control. This perspective is grounded in the Expected Value of Control (EVC) theory, which posits that the allocation of cognitive control is optimized to maximize expected outcomes, taking into account the costs of control engagement (Shenhav, Botvinick, & Cohen, 2013). Evidence supporting this view comes from studies demonstrating that even young children adjust their level of cognitive control engagement based on the expected value of control, suggesting that the principles of rational decision-making apply to cognitive control allocation from early in development (Chevalier, 2015). The shift towards a rational account of cognitive control development has profound implications for how we design interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control. Traditional interventions often focus on training specific cognitive control abilities, with the assumption that improvements will generalize across contexts. However, the rational account suggests that interventions should also consider the motivational and contextual factors that influence the allocation of cognitive control. For example, interventions that increase the perceived value of engaging cognitive control or reduce the perceived costs of control engagement may be more effective in promoting the development of cognitive control (Munakata et al., 2012). Moreover, the rational account opens new avenues for scientific inquiry into the development of cognitive control. Future research could explore how children learn to evaluate the costs and benefits of engaging cognitive control, how these evaluations are influenced by social and environmental factors, and how individual differences in the sensitivity to costs and benefits contribute to variability in cognitive control development (Garon, Bryson, & Smith, 2008). Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal studies that track the development of rational cognitive control allocation over time and its impact on life outcomes. In conclusion, the rational account of cognitive control development represents a significant shift in our understanding of how cognitive control develops in childhood. By emphasizing the dynamic and adaptive nature of cognitive control allocation, this perspective offers new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive control development and has important implications for the design of interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control. As we continue to explore the ramifications of this shift, it is clear that the rational account will play a central role in shaping future research on cognitive control development.", "References": [{"title": "Executive functions", "authors": "Adele Diamond", "journal": "Annual Review of Psychology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "64", "first page": "135", "last page": "168", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750"}, {"title": "The expected value of control: an integrative theory of anterior cingulate cortex function", "authors": "Amitai Shenhav, Matthew M.
