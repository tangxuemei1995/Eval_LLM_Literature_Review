{"Literature Review": "Prenatal substance exposure has been a significant area of research due to its profound implications on neurobiological and behavioral outcomes from infancy through young adulthood. This literature review aims to synthesize findings from previous studies, highlighting the impact of prenatal substance exposure on developmental outcomes, the methodological challenges in this field, and the need for a more comprehensive developmental framework that considers the lived experiences of affected children and families. Prenatal exposure to substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs has been associated with a range of adverse outcomes. For instance, prenatal alcohol exposure is linked to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), characterized by cognitive deficits, behavioral problems, and physical abnormalities (May et al., 2018). Similarly, prenatal tobacco exposure has been associated with low birth weight, preterm birth, and increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Dietz et al., 2010). Illicit drug exposure, including opioids and cocaine, has been linked to neurodevelopmental delays, attention deficits, and increased susceptibility to substance use disorders in later life (Lester & Lagasse, 2010). Despite these findings, the field faces several conceptual and methodological challenges. One major issue is the common occurrence of polysubstance exposure, where pregnant individuals use multiple substances simultaneously. This complicates the identification of specific substance effects and necessitates more sophisticated models to understand coexposure or polyexposure effects (Bandstra et al., 2010). Additionally, many studies have not adequately accounted for confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, maternal mental health, and postnatal environment, which can also significantly impact developmental outcomes (Lester et al., 2009). Another critical gap in the literature is the lack of developmental frameworks that incorporate the lived experiences of children and families affected by prenatal substance exposure. Most studies have focused on biological and medical outcomes, often neglecting the psychosocial and environmental contexts that shape child development (Hanson et al., 2011). Future research should adopt a more holistic approach, integrating biological, psychological, and social perspectives to better understand the complex interplay of factors influencing developmental outcomes. Moreover, longitudinal studies are essential to track the long-term effects of prenatal substance exposure into adulthood. While some studies have followed children into adolescence, there is a paucity of research extending into young adulthood, a critical period for the emergence of mental health disorders and substance use problems (Richardson et al., 2013). Longitudinal designs can help identify critical periods of vulnerability and resilience, informing targeted interventions. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the effects of prenatal substance exposure, there is a pressing need for more comprehensive and integrative research approaches. Addressing the methodological and conceptual limitations discussed in this review will be crucial for advancing the field and improving outcomes for affected individuals and their families.", "References": [{"title": "Prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in 4 US Communities", "authors": "Philip A.
