{"Literature Review": "The development of racial understanding in children is a multifaceted process influenced by cognitive mechanisms and socialization practices within specific cultural and societal contexts. This literature review synthesizes research on sociocognitive approaches and socialization perspectives to elucidate how children in the United States learn about race and develop racial attitudes. Sociocognitive approaches focus on the cognitive processes involved in children's understanding of race, including categorization, stereotype formation, and the development of racial attitudes. Research by Hirschfeld (2008) demonstrates that children as young as three years old begin to categorize people by race, indicating an early awareness of racial differences. Bigler and Liben (2007) further argue that children's cognitive development stages significantly influence their ability to understand and process racial information, with older children showing more nuanced understandings of race and its social implications. Socialization perspectives, on the other hand, emphasize the role of socialization agents—such as parents, teachers, and media—in transmitting messages about race to children. Hughes et al. (2006) highlight the importance of ethnic-racial socialization in shaping children's racial identities and attitudes, noting that explicit discussions about race can promote positive racial attitudes and reduce prejudice. Similarly, Pahlke, Bigler, and Suizzo (2012) found that children who receive messages emphasizing racial equality and diversity are more likely to develop egalitarian racial attitudes. The context of structural and interpersonal racism in the United States serves as a critical backdrop for children's racial learning. Studies by Quintana (1998) and Tatum (1997) illustrate how societal norms and racial hierarchies influence children's perceptions of race and their own racial identity. Moreover, research by Umaña-Taylor et al. (2014) underscores the impact of racial discrimination on children's psychological well-being and racial identity development, highlighting the need for supportive socialization practices that counteract negative racial messages. The integration of sociocognitive and socialization perspectives offers a comprehensive understanding of children's racial learning, emphasizing the interplay between individual cognitive processes and broader social influences. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms through which children learn about race and the ways in which socialization practices can promote positive racial attitudes and identities in the context of ongoing racial inequality.", "References": [{"title": "Children's developing conceptions of race", "authors": "Lawrence A.
