{"Literature Review": "The critical importance of the parent–infant relationship in the early stages of a child's life cannot be overstated. Research has consistently shown that responsive, nurturing parenting is foundational for the development of secure attachments and self-regulatory capabilities in infants and young children (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). However, when parents face personal, social, or economic challenges, their ability to provide such care can be significantly compromised. This literature review focuses on socioemotional interventions aimed at enhancing parental responsiveness, thereby supporting the development of secure attachments and self-regulation in children. We will discuss three interventions with strong evidence of effectiveness, their mechanisms, and outcomes, as well as the challenges in their dissemination. The first intervention, the Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting (VIPP), has been shown to significantly improve parental sensitivity and infant attachment security (Juffer, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2008). VIPP utilizes video feedback to help parents become more aware of their infants' signals and respond more appropriately. The second intervention, the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) program, targets specific caregiving behaviors that are associated with the development of secure attachments and self-regulation in children (Dozier, Lindhiem, & Ackerman, 2005). ABC focuses on enhancing parental sensitivity, reducing frightening behaviors, and increasing nurturing touch. The third intervention, the Circle of Security (COS), is a group-based program that aims to improve parental understanding of children's attachment needs and enhance their ability to respond sensitively to these needs (Powell, Cooper, Hoffman, & Marvin, 2014). COS has been effective in improving attachment security and reducing behavioral problems in children. Despite the strong evidence supporting these interventions, challenges remain in their dissemination and implementation in community settings. Barriers include the need for specialized training for practitioners, the cost of implementation, and the difficulty in engaging and retaining families in the programs (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). Future research should focus on strategies to overcome these barriers, ensuring that effective interventions can reach the families who need them most. In conclusion, socioemotional interventions targeting the parent–infant relationship have shown promising results in enhancing parental responsiveness and supporting the development of secure attachments and self-regulation in children. However, efforts must be made to address the challenges in disseminating these interventions to ensure their widespread availability and impact.", "References": [{"title": "Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation", "authors": "Mary D.
