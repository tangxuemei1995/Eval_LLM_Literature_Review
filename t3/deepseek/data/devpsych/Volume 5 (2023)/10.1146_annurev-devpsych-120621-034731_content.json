{"Literature Review": "The acquisition and application of norms by children is a fundamental aspect of human social-cognitive development, reflecting the intricate interplay between individual learning and societal expectations. Recent interdisciplinary research has shed new light on how young children not only acquire norms but also actively enforce them, suggesting that the roots of human norm psychology are deeply embedded in early childhood. This literature review explores the developmental trajectory of norm acquisition and enforcement in children, highlighting the significance of these processes for understanding human cooperation and social cohesion. Children's ability to acquire norms is evident from a very young age, with studies showing that toddlers can distinguish between conventional and moral norms. Schmidt et al. (2016) demonstrated that children as young as three years old are capable of understanding and applying social norms, even in novel situations. This early competence suggests that norm acquisition is not merely a product of explicit teaching but also involves intuitive processes that guide children's social interactions. Moreover, the enforcement of norms by children, even as bystanders, underscores the proactive role they play in maintaining social order. Rakoczy et al. (2008) found that children actively correct others' behavior when it deviates from established norms, indicating a sophisticated understanding of normativity and its importance for group functioning. This behavior is not limited to situations where the child is directly affected, highlighting a universal aspect of human norm psychology that transcends individual interests. The development of norm psychology in children is also influenced by cultural and social factors. Studies have shown that children's understanding and application of norms vary across cultures, reflecting the diverse ways in which societies organize social life. House et al. (2013) compared children from different cultural backgrounds and found significant variations in their norm enforcement behaviors, suggesting that cultural norms shape the development of norm psychology from an early age. Furthermore, the role of language in norm acquisition cannot be overstated. Language not only facilitates the transmission of norms but also enables children to articulate and negotiate normative expectations. Tomasello (2018) argues that language is a crucial tool for the development of norm psychology, as it allows children to engage in collective intentionality and shared understandings of social norms. The evolutionary significance of norm psychology in children is another area of interest. The ability to acquire and enforce norms is considered a key factor in the emergence and maintenance of human cooperation. Henrich (2016) posits that norm psychology evolved as a mechanism to promote cooperation among individuals, thereby enhancing group survival and success. This perspective is supported by evidence showing that children's norm enforcement behaviors are linked to prosocial tendencies and a preference for cooperative interactions. In conclusion, the study of children's acquisition and application of norms offers valuable insights into the foundations of human sociality. By examining the developmental origins of norm psychology, researchers can better understand the mechanisms underlying human cooperation and the maintenance of social order. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between individual development and cultural influences, as well as the evolutionary roots of norm psychology, to fully grasp the complexity of human social behavior.", "References": [{"title": "Young children enforce social norms selectively depending on the violator's group affiliation", "authors": "Marco F.
