{"Literature Review": "The exploration of early biomarkers and behavioral precursors of autism has significantly advanced our understanding of the condition, paving the way for interventions that could potentially alter the developmental trajectory of infants at risk for autism. This literature review synthesizes findings from neuroscience and clinical research to examine how insights into infant brain and behavioral development can inform the design of effective autism interventions for infants aged 12 months and younger. Recent studies have identified several behavioral precursors of autism, including reduced social attention, atypical sensory processing, and delayed motor development, which are associated with distinct neural correlates (Jones & Klin, 2013; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2013). These findings underscore the importance of early detection and intervention, as the infant brain exhibits a high degree of plasticity, offering a critical window for therapeutic intervention (Dawson et al., 2012). Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of infant autism interventions have demonstrated promising results, with some interventions leading to improvements in social communication skills and reductions in autism symptoms (Rogers et al., 2014; Green et al., 2017). However, the variability in intervention outcomes highlights the need for individualized approaches that consider the unique neurodevelopmental profiles of each infant. Contemporary developmental social neuroscience theories of autism, such as the social motivation hypothesis and the predictive coding framework, provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying autism and can inform the development of targeted intervention strategies (Chevallier et al., 2012; Pellicano & Burr, 2012). These theories emphasize the importance of enhancing infant-environment fit by creating supportive and responsive social environments that promote positive developmental outcomes. Incorporating brain-based measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), into intervention research can help identify neural markers of treatment response and inform the customization of interventions to meet the specific needs of each infant (Jeste et al., 2015; Wolff et al., 2017). Furthermore, ethical considerations, including the potential for overdiagnosis and the impact of early intervention on family dynamics, must be carefully addressed to ensure that infant autism interventions are implemented in a manner that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks (Fletcher-Watson & Happé, 2019). Future research should focus on integrating multidisciplinary perspectives, leveraging advances in technology, and conducting longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of early interventions on brain and behavioral development in autism. By adopting a developmental social neuroscience perspective, researchers and clinicians can work together to design and implement interventions that not only improve child outcomes but also enhance the well-being of families affected by autism.", "References": [{"title": "Attention to eyes is present but in decline in 2–6-month-old infants later diagnosed with autism", "authors": "Jones Warren, Klin Ami", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "504", "first page": "427", "last page": "431", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12715"}, {"title": "Behavioral manifestations of autism in the first year of life", "authors": "Zwaigenbaum Lonnie, Bryson Susan, Rogers Sally, Roberts Wendy, Brian Jessica, Szatmari Peter", "journal": "International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience", "year": "2013", "volumes": "23", "first page": "143", "last page": "152", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.05.001"}, {"title": "Early behavioral intervention is associated with normalized brain activity in young children with autism", "authors": "Dawson Geraldine, Jones Emily J.H., Merkle Kristen, Venema Kaitlin, Lowy Rachel, Faja Susan, Kamara Dana", "journal": "Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "51", "first page": "1150", "last page": "1159", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jaac.2012.08.018"}, {"title": "Intervention for infants at risk for developing autism: A case series", "authors": "Rogers Sally J., Vismara Laurie, Wagner A.
