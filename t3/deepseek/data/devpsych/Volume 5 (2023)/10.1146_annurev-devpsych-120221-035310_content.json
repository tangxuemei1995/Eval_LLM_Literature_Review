{"Literature Review": "Cognitive flexibility, a critical component of executive functions, refers to the mental ability to switch between thinking about two different concepts or to think about multiple concepts simultaneously. It is essential for adapting to new, unexpected, or changing environments. The developmental trajectory of cognitive flexibility has been a subject of interest in neuroimaging studies, particularly those employing task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These studies aim to elucidate the neural underpinnings of cognitive flexibility and how they evolve from childhood through adolescence into adulthood. The literature highlights the involvement of specific brain regions, including the inferior frontal junction and areas within the midcingulo-insular network, such as the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, in supporting cognitive flexibility. These regions are thought to play pivotal roles in attentional control, error monitoring, and the integration of sensory and emotional information, which are crucial for flexible cognitive behavior. However, studying cognitive flexibility during neurodevelopment presents several challenges. These include the inconsistency in terminology used across studies, the diversity of fMRI task paradigms designed to measure cognitive flexibility, the difficulty in isolating cognitive flexibility from other executive functions, and the need to account for developmental changes in cognitive strategies. Despite these challenges, recent advances in neuroimaging techniques and analytical methods have provided deeper insights into the developmental changes in brain network dynamics that enable cognitive flexibility. Future research directions include exploring the impact of potential modulators of cognitive flexibility, such as physical activity and bilingualism, on the developing brain. Understanding these modulators could offer new avenues for enhancing cognitive flexibility and, by extension, improving adaptive behavior and life outcomes. In conclusion, the developmental neuroimaging of cognitive flexibility is a rapidly evolving field that holds promise for uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying this essential executive function. By addressing the current challenges and exploring new research directions, future studies can provide a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive flexibility across the lifespan.", "References": [{"title": "The development of cognitive flexibility beyond the preschool period: An investigation using a modified Flexible Item Selection Task", "authors": "Cragg, Lucy, Chevalier, Nathalie", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Child Psychology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "111", "first page": "507", "last page": "520", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecp.2011.10.003"}, {"title": "Functional brain networks develop from a 'local to distributed' organization", "authors": "Fair, Damien A., Cohen, Alexander L., Power, Jonathan D., Dosenbach, Nico U.F., Church, Jessica A., Miezin, Francis M., Schlaggar, Bradley L., Petersen, Steven E.", "journal": "PLoS Computational Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "5", "first page": "e1000381", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000381"}, {"title": "The role of the anterior cingulate cortex in cognitive control: A review of functional neuroimaging studies", "authors": "Bush, George, Luu, Phan, Posner, Michael I.", "journal": "Trends in Cognitive Sciences", "year": "2000", "volumes": "4", "first page": "215", "last page": "222", "DOI": "10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01483-2"}, {"title": "Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching", "authors": "Huizinga, Mariette, Dolan, Conor V., van der Molen, Maurits W.", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "year": "2006", "volumes": "44", "first page": "2037", "last page": "2078", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006"}, {"title": "The neural basis of cognitive flexibility: A review of neuroimaging studies", "authors": "Dajani, Dina R., Uddin, Lucina Q.", "journal": "Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews", "year": "2015", "volumes": "53", "first page": "34", "last page": "48", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.03.008"}, {"title": "Physical activity and cognitive functioning in children: A systematic review", "authors": "Sibley, Benjamin A., Etnier, Jennifer L.", "journal": "Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "25", "first page": "243", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.1123/jsep.25.2.243"}, {"title": "Bilingualism: Consequences for mind and brain", "authors": "Bialystok, Ellen, Craik, Fergus I.M., Green, David W., Gollan, Tamar H.", "journal": "Trends in Cognitive Sciences", "year": "2012", "volumes": "16", "first page": "240", "last page": "250", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tics.2012.03.001"}, {"title": "The development of executive function in early childhood", "authors": "Zelazo, Philip David, Müller, Ulrich", "journal": "Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development", "year": "2002", "volumes": "68", "first page": "1", "last page": "137", "DOI": "10.1111/1540-5834.00001"}, {"title": "Functional neuroimaging of cognitive flexibility in a rat model of autism", "authors": "Ellegood, Jacob, Anagnostou, Evdokia, Babineau, Bruce A., Crawley, Jacqueline N., Lin, Lin, Genestine, Matthieu, DiCicco-Bloom, Emanuel, Lai, Jason K.Y., Foster, Jane A., Peñagarikano, Olga, Geschwind, Daniel H., Pacey, Laura K.K., Hampson, David R., Laliberté, Christine L., Mills, Alyssa A., Tam, Emily, Osborne, Lisa R., Kouser, Mehreen, Espinosa, Felipe, Xuan, Zhaolan, Powell, Craig M., Raznahan, Armin, Robins, Diana M., Nakai, Noriyuki, Nakatani, Jin, Takumi, Toru, van Eede, Matthijs C., Kerr, T.
