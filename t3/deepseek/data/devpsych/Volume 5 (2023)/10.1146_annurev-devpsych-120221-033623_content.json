{"Literature Review": "Life-course epidemiology and causal inference represent two pivotal yet often divergent approaches in understanding the determinants of health across the lifespan. Life-course epidemiology focuses on the long-term effects of physical and social exposures during gestation, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, and later adult life on health and disease risk (Kuh et al., 2003). This field has developed sophisticated models to capture the complexity of these exposures and their timing, duration, and accumulation over time. However, the adoption of robust causal inference methods, including quasi-experimental designs, has been slower in life-course epidemiology compared to other fields. This hesitance partly stems from the tension between study designs that enhance causal claims and exposure operationalizations that align with life-course theories (Glymour et al., 2014).\n\nCausal inference in life-course epidemiology faces unique challenges, primarily due to the complexity of life-course exposures and the long latency periods between exposure and outcome. Traditional observational studies, while rich in detail, often struggle to establish causality due to unmeasured confounding and reverse causation (Hernán & Robins, 2020). Quasi-experimental methods, such as instrumental variable analysis, regression discontinuity designs, and difference-in-differences, offer promising avenues for strengthening causal inference in life-course epidemiology. These methods leverage natural experiments or policy changes to mimic randomization, thereby reducing confounding bias (Bor et al., 2014).\n\nDespite their potential, quasi-experimental methods have limitations when applied to life-course epidemiology. For instance, instrumental variable analysis requires a valid instrument that is strongly associated with the exposure but not directly with the outcome, a condition that is often difficult to meet in life-course studies (Davies et al., 2018). Moreover, these methods may not fully capture the complexity of life-course exposures, such as the timing and duration of exposures, which are central to life-course theories (Ben-Shlomo & Kuh, 2002).\n\nTo bridge the gap between life-course epidemiology and causal inference, several solutions have been proposed. Redefined estimands that focus on public health impact rather than purely causal effects can align the goals of both fields (VanderWeele, 2015). Marginal structural models and structural nested models offer frameworks for estimating causal effects in the presence of time-varying confounders, which are common in life-course studies (Robins et al., 2000). Longitudinal instrumental variables approaches can address the challenge of time-varying exposures and confounders, providing a more nuanced understanding of causal pathways over the life course (Swanson et al., 2018).\n\nLeveraging new data linkages, such as detailed residential histories, can enhance the measurement of life-course exposures and their spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby improving causal inference (Pearce et al., 2016). Triangulation across methods, including the use of multiple quasi-experimental designs and traditional observational studies, can provide more robust evidence by corroborating findings across different approaches (Lawlor et al., 2016). Adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference, which recognizes the strengths and limitations of different methods, can facilitate a more integrated and comprehensive understanding of life-course health determinants (Munafò & Davey Smith, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, bridging the divide between life-course epidemiology and causal inference requires innovative approaches that respect the complexity of life-course exposures while enhancing the robustness of causal claims. By redefining estimands, employing advanced statistical models, leveraging new data sources, and adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference, researchers can better understand the long-term effects of exposures across the life course and inform effective public health interventions.", "References": [{"title": "A life course approach to chronic disease epidemiology: conceptual models, empirical challenges and interdisciplinary perspectives", "authors": "Diana Kuh, Yoav Ben-Shlomo, John Lynch, Johan Hallqvist, Chris Power", "journal": "International Journal of Epidemiology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "32", "first page": "285", "last page": "293", "DOI": "10.1093/ije/dyh070"}, {"title": "Causal diagrams for epidemiologic research", "authors": "Miguel A.
