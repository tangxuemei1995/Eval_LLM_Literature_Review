{"Literature Review": "The intersection of immune cell metabolism and immuno-oncology represents a burgeoning field of research that seeks to understand and manipulate the metabolic pathways within immune cells to enhance cancer immunotherapy. The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is a well-documented phenomenon that not only supports their rapid proliferation but also contributes to the creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This environment is characterized by nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and the accumulation of metabolic by-products, which collectively inhibit the function of antitumor immune cells while promoting the differentiation and activity of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (DeBerardinis et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2015). Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of metabolic checkpoints in immune evasion and tumor progression. These checkpoints include the upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which depletes tryptophan and generates immunosuppressive kynurenine metabolites, and the overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which engages with PD-1 on T cells to inhibit their activation and function (Munn et al., 2005; Pardoll, 2012). Targeting these metabolic checkpoints offers a promising strategy to not only inhibit tumor growth but also to enhance antitumor immune responses. For instance, inhibitors of IDO and PD-L1 have shown efficacy in preclinical models and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (Spranger et al., 2014; Long et al., 2016). Moreover, the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells themselves, particularly T cells, has emerged as a key determinant of their antitumor efficacy. Activated T cells undergo a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, a process known as the Warburg effect, to meet their increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands (Wang et al., 2011). However, the TME can impair this metabolic switch, leading to T cell exhaustion and dysfunction. Strategies to enhance T cell metabolism, such as the use of metabolic agonists or the genetic engineering of T cells to overexpress metabolic enzymes, have shown promise in preclinical models and are being explored as potential therapeutic approaches (Sukumar et al., 2013; Ho et al., 2015). In addition to T cells, the metabolism of other immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, is also influenced by the TME and can be targeted to enhance antitumor immunity. For example, the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) towards an M1-like phenotype, which is associated with antitumor activity, can be promoted by modulating their metabolic pathways (Rodriguez-Prados et al., 2010). Similarly, the activation and function of dendritic cells can be enhanced by targeting their metabolic checkpoints, such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Amiel et al., 2012). In conclusion, the targeting of immune cell metabolism represents a novel and promising approach to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. By understanding and manipulating the metabolic pathways within immune cells and the TME, it may be possible to overcome the current limitations of immunotherapy and achieve more durable and effective antitumor responses.", "References": [{"title": "Beyond aerobic glycolysis: transformed cells can engage in glutamine metabolism that exceeds the requirement for protein and nucleotide synthesis", "authors": "Ralph J.
