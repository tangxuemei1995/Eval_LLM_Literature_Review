{"Literature Review": "The study of cancer evolution has been significantly advanced by the development of lineage tracing technologies, which allow researchers to track the lineage and fate of individual cancer cells over time. Traditional static lineage tracing methods, such as fluorescent protein tagging and Cre-loxP recombination, have provided foundational insights into tumor development and progression. However, these methods often lack the resolution and scalability needed to fully capture the complex dynamics of tumor evolution (Kester and van Oudenaarden, 2018). Recent advancements in single-cell lineage tracing have introduced more dynamic and high-resolution approaches, including CRISPR-based cell barcoding and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), enabling the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies with unprecedented detail (McKenna and Gagnon, 2019). CRISPR-based cell barcoding, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool for in vivo lineage tracing. By introducing heritable genetic barcodes into cells, researchers can track the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cancer cells within a tumor and across metastatic sites (Spanjaard and Junker, 2017). This method has been successfully applied to various cancer models, revealing insights into subclonal dynamics, tumor heterogeneity, and the origins of metastasis (Bhang et al., 2015). Single-cell RNA sequencing complements these approaches by providing a transcriptomic snapshot of individual cells, allowing for the identification of distinct cell states and the mapping of lineage relationships based on gene expression profiles (Trapnell, 2015). Together, these technologies have enabled the profiling of tumor plasticity, the identification of cancer stem cells, and the tracking of metastatic spread in vivo (Lawson et al., 2018). Despite these advancements, challenges remain in integrating lineage tracing data with other omics datasets, improving the efficiency and scalability of barcoding techniques, and applying these methods to human cancers. Emerging technologies, such as in situ sequencing and multi-omics single-cell analysis, hold promise for addressing these challenges and building comprehensive roadmaps of cancer evolution (Moor et al., 2020). As lineage tracing technologies continue to evolve, they will play a crucial role in unraveling the complexities of tumor biology and informing the development of targeted cancer therapies.", "References": [{"title": "Single-Cell Transcriptomics to Explore the Immune System in Health and Disease", "authors": "Kester Lennart, van Oudenaarden Alexander", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "358", "first page": "58", "last page": "63", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aan6828"}, {"title": "Recording Development with Single Cell Dynamic Lineage Tracing", "authors": "McKenna Aaron, Gagnon James A.", "journal": "Development", "year": "2019", "volumes": "146", "first page": "dev169730", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1242/dev.169730"}, {"title": "Single-Cell Sequencing: New Insights into Cancer Evolution", "authors": "Spanjaard Bastiaan, Junker Jan Philipp", "journal": "Trends in Cancer", "year": "2017", "volumes": "3", "first page": "472", "last page": "484", "DOI": "10.1016/j.trecan.2017.05.003"}, {"title": "Studying Clonal Dynamics in Response to Cancer Therapy Using High-Throughput Cell Lineage Tracing", "authors": "Bhang Hyo-eun C., Ruddy David A., Krishnamurthy Radhakrishna, Kim Joonil, Alcazer Vincent, Parker Joel S., Iafrate A.
