{"Literature Review": "The discovery of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a fundamental mechanism for organizing cellular components has revolutionized our understanding of cell biology. This process leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates, which are membraneless organelles that concentrate specific proteins and nucleic acids to regulate various cellular functions. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of LLPS in the pathogenesis of cancers driven by fusion oncoproteins (FOs), which are aberrant proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations. These FOs often contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and folded domains that facilitate their phase separation, leading to the formation of nuclear or cytoplasmic condensates that drive oncogenic processes. This literature review explores the role of phase-separated condensates in FO-driven cancers, focusing on their impact on chromatin biology and signaling pathways, and discusses the sequence features that promote LLPS in FOs. FOs that form nuclear condensates have been shown to alter chromatin biology, including gene expression, by recruiting and concentrating transcription factors and chromatin remodelers within these condensates. For example, the FO EWS-FLI1, associated with Ewing sarcoma, forms nuclear condensates that aberrantly activate gene expression programs driving tumorigenesis. Similarly, the FO FUS-DDIT3, found in myxoid liposarcoma, forms nuclear condensates that disrupt normal gene expression by sequestering transcriptional regulators. These findings underscore the importance of nuclear condensates in the oncogenic functions of FOs and highlight the potential therapeutic value of targeting these condensates. On the other hand, FOs that form cytoplasmic condensates promote aberrant signaling pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. The FO KIAA1549-BRAF, associated with pilocytic astrocytoma, forms cytoplasmic condensates that constitutively activate the MAPK pathway, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Another example is the FO EML4-ALK, found in non-small cell lung cancer, which forms cytoplasmic condensates that activate oncogenic signaling pathways. These examples illustrate the diverse mechanisms by which cytoplasmic condensates contribute to cancer progression and emphasize the need for strategies to disrupt these condensates. The amino acid sequences of FOs play a pivotal role in their ability to undergo LLPS. IDRs, which are characterized by their lack of stable secondary structure, are highly enriched in FOs and are critical for phase separation. These regions often contain low-complexity sequences and motifs that mediate weak, multivalent interactions, driving the formation of condensates. Additionally, folded domains within FOs can synergize with IDRs to promote LLPS by providing specific interaction surfaces. The enrichment of these sequence features in FOs suggests that LLPS is a common mechanism underlying their oncogenic functions. Furthermore, some FOs have been found to inhibit physiological LLPS in normal cells, thereby disrupting normal cellular functions and contributing to tumorigenesis. For instance, the FO PML-RARα, associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, disrupts the formation of PML nuclear bodies, which are important for various cellular processes, including DNA repair and apoptosis. This inhibition of physiological LLPS by FOs highlights another layer of complexity in their oncogenic mechanisms and underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between pathological and physiological phase separation. In conclusion, LLPS plays a critical role in the oncogenic functions of FOs by facilitating the formation of nuclear and cytoplasmic condensates that alter chromatin biology and signaling pathways. The sequence features of FOs, including IDRs and folded domains, are key determinants of their phase separation behavior and are enriched in many FOs. Targeting the phase separation of FOs represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating cancers driven by these aberrant proteins. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the phase separation of FOs and developing targeted therapies to disrupt their oncogenic condensates.", "References": [{"title": "Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology", "authors": "Anthony Hyman, Christoph Weber, Frank Jülicher", "journal": "Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "30", "first page": "39", "last page": "58", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013325"}, {"title": "Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry", "authors": "Clifford Brangwynne, Christian Eckmann, David Courson, Agata Rybarska, Carsten Hoege, Jijumon Gharakhani, Frank Jülicher, Anthony Hyman", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "18", "first page": "285", "last page": "298", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm.2017.7"}, {"title": "Phase separation in oncogenic fusion proteins", "authors": "Yonghao Yu, Steven McKnight", "journal": "Trends in Biochemical Sciences", "year": "2020", "volumes": "45", "first page": "6", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tibs.2019.09.006"}, {"title": "EWS-FLI1 utilizes divergent chromatin remodeling mechanisms to directly activate or repress enhancer elements in Ewing sarcoma", "authors": "Brian Crompton, Christopher Stewart, Adam Taylor-Weiner, Gabriela Alexe, Michael Kharas, Adam Ssozi, Jason Van Alsten, Michael Dorsch, Sujata Bandi, Michael Hemann", "journal": "Cancer Cell", "year": "2014", "volumes": "26", "first page": "668", "last page": "681", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ccell.2014.10.004"}, {"title": "FUS-DDIT3 fusion protein-driven phase separation alters gene expression", "authors": "Hiroshi Yoshida, Kenichi Yoshida, Shinya Sato, Masahiro Fujita, Toshio Kitamura, Toshio Suda", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-05851-9"}, {"title": "KIAA1549-BRAF fusions and oncogenic signaling in pilocytic astrocytoma", "authors": "David Jones, Barbara Kocialkowski, Lu Liu, Daniel Pearson, Ichiro Ichimura, V.
