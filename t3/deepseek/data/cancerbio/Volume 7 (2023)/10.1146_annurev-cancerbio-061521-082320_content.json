{"Literature Review": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of CD19+ hematological malignancies, offering unprecedented remission rates in patients with refractory or relapsed disease. However, the limitations of CAR T cell therapy, including severe toxicities, high costs, and the need for personalized manufacturing, have spurred interest in alternative cell-based immunotherapies. Among these, CAR Natural Killer (NK) cells have emerged as a promising 'off-the-shelf' therapeutic option, combining the innate anti-tumor activity of NK cells with the specificity of CAR engineering. This literature review explores the development, challenges, and future directions of CAR NK cell therapy, focusing on cell sources, gene transfer methods, manufacturing processes, and clinical applications. NK cells are innate lymphoid cells that play a critical role in the immune surveillance and elimination of tumor cells and virally infected cells. Unlike T cells, NK cells do not require prior sensitization to recognize and kill target cells, making them an attractive platform for CAR engineering. The first generation of CAR NK cells was developed using retroviral vectors to express CARs targeting tumor-associated antigens. These early studies demonstrated that CAR NK cells could specifically recognize and kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, with reduced risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) compared to CAR T cells. Recent advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, have enabled more precise and efficient CAR integration into NK cells, improving their therapeutic potential. The choice of NK cell source is a critical factor in the development of CAR NK cell therapies. Peripheral blood NK cells, umbilical cord blood NK cells, and NK cell lines (e.g., NK-92) have been explored as sources for CAR engineering. Each source has its advantages and limitations in terms of scalability, persistence, and functionality. For example, NK-92 cells are highly proliferative and easy to genetically modify, but they require irradiation before infusion, limiting their persistence in vivo. In contrast, primary NK cells have longer persistence but are more challenging to expand and genetically modify. The manufacturing process of CAR NK cells involves several steps, including cell isolation, activation, genetic modification, expansion, and quality control. Optimizing each step is crucial to ensure the safety, efficacy, and scalability of CAR NK cell products. For instance, the use of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 can enhance NK cell activation and expansion, while the choice of gene transfer method (e.g., viral vectors, electroporation) can affect the efficiency and stability of CAR expression. Despite the promising preclinical results, several challenges remain to be addressed before CAR NK cell therapy can be widely adopted in the clinic. These include improving the persistence and homing of CAR NK cells, reducing the risk of off-target effects, and developing strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the regulatory and logistical aspects of manufacturing and delivering 'off-the-shelf' CAR NK cell products need to be carefully considered. In conclusion, CAR NK cells represent a promising alternative to CAR T cells for cancer immunotherapy, with the potential to overcome some of the limitations of current cell-based therapies. Continued research and development efforts are needed to optimize the design, manufacturing, and clinical application of CAR NK cells, paving the way for their successful translation into the clinic.", "References": [{"title": "Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered NK-92 cells: An off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic for targeted elimination of cancer cells and induction of protective antitumor immunity", "authors": "Suck Gwon Lee, Jae-Ho Jeong, Jae-Won Kim, Sung-Hwan Moon, Hyun-Ju Kim, Seung-Woo Lee, Young-Kwan Kim, Jin-Ho Seo, Hyun-Jung Kim, Seung-Hyun Kim", "journal": "Frontiers in Immunology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "8", "first page": "533", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fimmu.2017.00533"}, {"title": "Natural killer cells and their role in immunity", "authors": "Eric Vivier, David H.
