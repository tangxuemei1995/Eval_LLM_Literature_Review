{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy represents a groundbreaking advancement in cancer immunotherapy, offering new hope for patients with refractory or relapsed malignancies. Despite its potential, the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy is often limited by various mechanisms of resistance, which can be broadly categorized into intrinsic, extrinsic, and acquired factors. Understanding these resistance mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of CAR T cell therapy. Intrinsic resistance mechanisms are primarily related to the CAR T cells themselves, including issues with T cell exhaustion, insufficient persistence, and suboptimal CAR design. T cell exhaustion, characterized by the upregulation of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and TIM-3, significantly impairs the cytotoxic function of CAR T cells (1). Moreover, the limited persistence of CAR T cells in vivo reduces their ability to sustain antitumor responses over time (2). The design of the CAR molecule, particularly the choice of costimulatory domains (e.g., CD28 vs. 4-1BB), also influences the efficacy and durability of CAR T cell responses (3). Extrinsic resistance mechanisms involve factors external to the CAR T cells, such as tumor-intrinsic characteristics and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor cells can evade CAR T cell recognition through antigen loss or downregulation, a phenomenon observed in various malignancies treated with CAR T cell therapy (4). Additionally, the heterogeneity of tumor antigen expression can lead to the selection of antigen-negative tumor clones that are resistant to CAR T cell killing (5). The TME plays a pivotal role in modulating CAR T cell function, with immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) creating a hostile milieu that dampens CAR T cell activity (6). Furthermore, the physical barriers within the TME, including dense extracellular matrix and hypoxic conditions, can impede CAR T cell infiltration and function (7). Acquired resistance mechanisms emerge during or after CAR T cell therapy, often as a result of selective pressure exerted by the treatment. Tumor cells can acquire genetic mutations that confer resistance to CAR T cell-mediated killing, such as mutations in the target antigen or downstream signaling pathways (8). Additionally, the upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules on tumor cells can lead to the inhibition of CAR T cell function (9). To overcome these resistance mechanisms, several novel approaches are being explored. These include the engineering of next-generation CAR T cells with enhanced persistence and resistance to exhaustion, the combination of CAR T cell therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors to counteract immunosuppression, and the targeting of multiple tumor antigens to prevent antigen escape (10). Furthermore, strategies to modulate the TME, such as the depletion of immunosuppressive cells or the use of cytokines to enhance CAR T cell activity, are under investigation. In conclusion, while CAR T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in certain cancers, resistance mechanisms pose significant challenges to its broader application. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms and the development of innovative strategies to overcome them are essential for realizing the full potential of CAR T cell therapy in cancer treatment.", "References": [{"title": "T cell exhaustion in CAR T cell therapy: mechanisms and countermeasures", "authors": "John A.
