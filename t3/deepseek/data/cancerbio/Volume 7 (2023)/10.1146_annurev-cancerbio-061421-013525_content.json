{"Literature Review": "The estrogen receptor (ER) Î± plays a pivotal role in the majority of breast cancers, making it a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Over the years, endocrine therapies targeting ER have become a cornerstone in the treatment of ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer, significantly improving patient outcomes. These therapies include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen, and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), like fulvestrant, which have been instrumental in managing the disease. However, despite their efficacy, resistance to these standard-of-care (SOC) therapies remains a significant challenge, often due to the reengagement of ER signaling pathways. This has spurred a renewed interest in the development of next-generation ER-targeted therapies, aiming to overcome resistance mechanisms and provide further benefits to patients. Recent studies have highlighted the continued dependence of tumors on ER signaling even after exposure to SOC agents, underscoring the potential of optimized ER-targeted therapies. For instance, the development of novel SERDs with improved pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability represents a promising avenue for overcoming resistance to existing therapies. Additionally, the exploration of combination therapies that target ER alongside other signaling pathways has shown potential in enhancing therapeutic efficacy and overcoming resistance. The ongoing clinical trials investigating these next-generation ER-targeted therapies are a testament to the hypothesis that there remains an opportunity to bring meaningful benefits to patients through fully optimized ER-targeted interventions. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of novel therapeutic strategies with a deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms will be crucial in advancing the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer", "authors": "Rachel Schiff, C.
