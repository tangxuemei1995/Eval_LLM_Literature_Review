{"Literature Review": "The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment landscape for various cancers, with T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy emerging as a promising strategy. This approach leverages the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells by targeting tumor-specific neoantigens. Neoantigens, which arise from somatic mutations, are highly specific to cancer cells and can be classified into private and public categories. Private neoantigens are unique to individual patients, necessitating personalized therapeutic approaches. In contrast, public neoantigens are shared among patients and often result from recurrent mutations in oncogenic drivers or viral oncoproteins, making them attractive targets for off-the-shelf therapies. This literature review focuses on the targeting of public neoantigens, particularly mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and epitopes derived from oncogenic viruses, using TCR-engineered T cells, and discusses the challenges and strategies for enhancing the efficacy of these therapies, especially in solid tumors. The identification and targeting of public neoantigens have been facilitated by advances in genomics and bioinformatics, enabling the prediction and validation of immunogenic epitopes. Studies have demonstrated that TCR-engineered T cells can effectively target and eliminate tumor cells expressing these neoantigens. For instance, TCRs specific for mutant KRAS have shown potent antitumor activity in preclinical models, highlighting the potential of this approach in treating cancers with KRAS mutations, which are notoriously difficult to target with conventional therapies. Similarly, TCRs targeting mutant p53, a common mutation in various cancers, have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies, offering a promising avenue for treating p53-mutant tumors. Additionally, TCR-based therapies targeting epitopes derived from oncogenic viruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have shown clinical benefit in virus-associated cancers. Despite these advances, several challenges remain in the development of TCR-based therapies for solid tumors. These include the identification of highly immunogenic neoantigens, the optimization of TCR affinity and specificity to minimize off-target effects, and the overcoming of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Strategies to address these challenges include the use of high-throughput screening to identify optimal TCRs, the engineering of T cells to enhance their persistence and function, and the combination of TCR-based therapies with other immunomodulatory agents. Furthermore, the development of universal TCRs that can recognize a broad range of neoantigens and the use of gene editing technologies to enhance the safety and efficacy of TCR-engineered T cells are areas of active research. In conclusion, TCR-based cellular therapy targeting public neoantigens holds great promise for the treatment of various cancers. Continued research and innovation in this field are essential to overcome the existing challenges and to realize the full potential of this therapeutic approach. The integration of TCR-based therapies with other treatment modalities and the development of strategies to enhance their efficacy in solid tumors will be critical for improving patient outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "T cell receptor therapy targeting mutant KRAS in patients with solid tumors", "authors": "Steven A.
