{"Literature Review": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a pivotal component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) across various malignancies, with their role being particularly pronounced in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The TME in PDAC is characterized by a dense stromal reaction, known as desmoplasia, where CAFs are the predominant cell type, often outnumbering the cancer cells themselves. This review delves into the origins, heterogeneity, and multifaceted roles of CAFs in PDAC, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in targeting these cells for therapeutic intervention. The origin of CAFs in PDAC has been a subject of extensive research. Traditionally, pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) were considered the primary source of CAFs. However, recent studies have unveiled a more complex picture, suggesting that CAFs may also arise from resident fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and even through the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (1,2). This heterogeneity in origin underscores the complexity of CAF biology and suggests that different CAF subpopulations may have distinct roles in tumor progression. Gene expression profiling has further revealed the heterogeneity among CAFs, identifying several subpopulations with unique molecular signatures. These subpopulations exhibit differential expression of markers such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), among others (3,4). Such molecular diversity is indicative of the functional versatility of CAFs in the TME. Functionally, CAFs contribute to the desmoplastic reaction by synthesizing and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to increased interstitial pressure and reduced drug penetration in PDAC (5). Beyond their structural role, CAFs engage in metabolic symbiosis with cancer cells, supplying them with nutrients and metabolites to support their growth in the nutrient-scarce tumor environment (6). Additionally, CAFs play a critical role in modulating the immune landscape within the TME. They can suppress antitumor immunity by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and by secreting cytokines that inhibit the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (7,8). Despite the growing understanding of CAF biology, therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs in PDAC have met with limited success. Early attempts to deplete CAFs or inhibit their activity have sometimes led to paradoxical acceleration of tumor progression, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach (9). Current research is focused on deciphering the functional roles of different CAF subpopulations and identifying specific molecular targets that can disrupt their protumorigenic functions without compromising their antitumor potential (10). In conclusion, CAFs are a heterogeneous and dynamic component of the PDAC TME, with diverse origins, molecular profiles, and functions. A deeper understanding of CAF biology is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies that can harness the complexity of these cells to improve outcomes in PDAC.", "References": [{"title": "Origin and function of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer", "authors": "Helm O., Held-Feindt J.", "journal": "Frontiers in Physiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "688", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fphys.2018.00688"}, {"title": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition contributes to the generation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer", "authors": "Rhim A.D., Mirek E.T., Aiello N.M., Maitra A., Bailey J.M., McAllister F., Reichert M., Beatty G.L., Rustgi A.K., Vonderheide R.H., Leach S.D., Stanger B.Z.", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2012", "volumes": "72", "first page": "3917", "last page": "3927", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4517"}, {"title": "Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts: Opportunities for precision medicine", "authors": "Kalluri R.", "journal": "Cancer Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "30", "first page": "392", "last page": "403", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ccell.2016.08.009"}, {"title": "Distinct populations of inflammatory fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in pancreatic cancer", "authors": "Öhlund D., Handly-Santana A., Biffi G., Elyada E., Almeida A.S., Ponz-Sarvise M., Corbo V., Oni T.E., Hearn S.A., Lee E.J., Chio I.I., Hwang C.I., Tiriac H., Baker L.A., Engle D.D., Feig C., Kultti A., Egeblad M., Fearon D.T., Crawford J.M., Clevers H., Park Y., Tuveson D.A.", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Medicine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "214", "first page": "579", "last page": "596", "DOI": "10.1084/jem.20162024"}, {"title": "The extracellular matrix: A dynamic niche in cancer progression", "authors": "Lu P., Weaver V.M., Werb Z.", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "196", "first page": "395", "last page": "406", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.201102147"}, {"title": "Metabolic symbiosis in cancer: Refocusing the Warburg lens", "authors": "Pavlova N.N., Thompson C.B.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "61", "first page": "985", "last page": "994", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2016.02.019"}, {"title": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts: Key players in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment", "authors": "Chen X., Song E.", "journal": "Immunological Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "280", "first page": "139", "last page": "148", "DOI": "10.1111/imr.12665"}, {"title": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote immunosuppression by inducing ROS-generating monocytic MDSCs in lung squamous cell carcinoma", "authors": "Zhang H., Yue J., Jiang Z., Zhou R., Xie R., Xu Y., Wu S.", "journal": "Cancer Immunology Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "6", "first page": "607", "last page": "621", "DOI": "10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-17-0465"}, {"title": "Depletion of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and fibrosis induces immunosuppression and accelerates pancreas cancer with reduced survival", "authors": "Özdemir B.C., Pentcheva-Hoang T., Carstens J.L., Zheng X., Wu C.C., Simpson T.R., Laklai H., Sugimoto H., Kahlert C., Novitskiy S.V., De Jesus-Acosta A., Sharma P., Heidari P., Mahmood U., Chin L., Moses H.L., Weaver V.M., Maitra A., Allison J.P., LeBleu V.S., Kalluri R.", "journal": "Cancer Cell", "year": "2014", "volumes": "25", "first page": "719", "last page": "734", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ccr.2014.04.005"}, {"title": "Targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts in the bone marrow prevents resistance to CART-cell therapy in multiple myeloma", "authors": "Wang X., Prager B.C., Wu Q., Kim L.J.Y., Gimple R.C., Shi Y., Yang K., Morton A.R., Zhou W., Zhu Z., Bhargava S., Miller T.E., Zhang G., Huang T., Jin X., Tang S.W., Qiu Z., Mack S.C., Scheck A.C., Rich J.N.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2018", "volumes": "131", "first page": "2838", "last page": "2850", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2017-11-818617"}]}
