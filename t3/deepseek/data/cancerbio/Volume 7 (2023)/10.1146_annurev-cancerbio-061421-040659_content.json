{"Literature Review": "The advent of organoid technology has marked a significant milestone in cancer research, offering a 3D culture system that closely mimics the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of tumors. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as a powerful tool for personalized medicine, enabling the prediction of patient responses to therapy in vitro. This capability is crucial for guiding clinical decision-making and tailoring treatment strategies to individual patients (Sato et al., 2011; Clevers, 2016). However, the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), poses a challenge for organoid models. The TIME is a dynamic ecosystem comprising various immune cell types that interact with tumor cells, influencing tumor progression and response to therapy. To address this, researchers have developed organoid coculture systems that incorporate immune cells, aiming to recapitulate the TIME's complexity and study its impact on tumor biology and immunotherapy responses (Dijkstra et al., 2018; Neal et al., 2018).\n\nSeveral methods have been developed to integrate immune cells into organoid cultures, each differing in the source of immune cells, the types of immune cells maintained, and their specific applications. For instance, autologous immune cells derived from the same patient as the organoids can be used to preserve the patient-specific immune context, providing insights into personalized immunotherapy responses (Pasquier et al., 2019). Alternatively, allogeneic immune cells from healthy donors or cell lines offer a more standardized approach for studying general immune-tumor interactions (Cattaneo et al., 2020). The choice of immune cell types is also critical, with models incorporating T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, among others, to explore different aspects of the immune response (Broutier et al., 2017; Jacob et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond immune cells, the incorporation of nonimmune cell types into organoid cultures has further enhanced the models' ability to mimic the TME. Stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, play essential roles in tumor progression and drug resistance, and their inclusion in organoid cocultures has provided valuable insights into these processes (Boj et al., 2015; Sachs et al., 2018). Additionally, the use of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and biomaterials in organoid cultures has improved the physiological relevance of these models, better recapitulating the mechanical and biochemical properties of the TME (Gjorevski et al., 2016; Cruz-Acuña et al., 2017).\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain in fully capturing the complexity of the TIME in organoid models. The dynamic interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and the ECM are difficult to replicate in vitro, and the long-term maintenance of immune cells in coculture systems is often problematic. Moreover, the scalability and reproducibility of these models need improvement to facilitate their widespread use in drug screening and immunotherapy development (Vlachogiannis et al., 2018; Drost & Clevers, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of immune cells into organoid models represents a significant step forward in cancer research, offering a more comprehensive tool for studying the TIME and its implications for tumor biology and immunotherapy. By organizing the various coculture methods into a coherent framework, researchers can better select the appropriate system for their experimental needs, paving the way for more effective and
