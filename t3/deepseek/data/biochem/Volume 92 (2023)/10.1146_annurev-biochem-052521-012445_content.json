{"Literature Review": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical and highly regulated step in gene expression, involving the cleavage of pre-mRNA and the addition of a poly(A) tail. This process is essential for the stability, export, and translation of mRNA. The machinery responsible for this processing includes a complex of proteins that recognize specific sequences in the pre-mRNA, cleave it at the appropriate site, and add the poly(A) tail. In humans, the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) plays a central role in this process, while in yeast, the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor (CPF) performs a similar function. These complexes coordinate the enzymatic activities required for cleavage and polyadenylation, ensuring the precise processing of the mRNA 3′ end. Recent structural studies and biochemical reconstitution experiments have provided new insights into the mechanisms of mRNA 3′-end processing, revealing the intricate interactions between the processing machinery and the pre-mRNA. These studies have highlighted the importance of the cleavage site selection, which can significantly influence the fate of the mRNA. The length of the poly(A) tail is also tightly regulated, with each transcript receiving a similar tail length upon nuclear export. This regulation is crucial for the proper function of the mRNA in the cytoplasm. Despite these advances, many questions remain regarding the regulation of mRNA 3′-end processing and its impact on gene expression. Future research in this field will likely focus on understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control cleavage site selection and poly(A) tail length, as well as the role of mRNA 3′-end processing in the broader context of gene expression regulation.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms and regulation of alternative polyadenylation", "authors": "Tian Bin, Manley James L.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2017", "volumes": "65", "first page": "29", "last page": "43", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2016.11.014"}, {"title": "The polyadenylation factor CPSF-73 is involved in histone pre-mRNA processing", "authors": "Dominski Zbigniew, Marzluff William F.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2007", "volumes": "129", "first page": "37", "last page": "48", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.012"}, {"title": "Structural basis of mRNA cap modification by SARS-CoV-2", "authors": "Viswanathan Thiruselvam, Misra Ananya, Kim Seung Joong, et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "3737", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-021-23925-1"}, {"title": "The C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II couples mRNA processing to transcription", "authors": "Proudfoot Nick J., Furger Andre, Dye Michael J.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2002", "volumes": "416", "first page": "414", "last page": "419", "DOI": "10.1038/416414a"}, {"title": "Poly(A) tail length control is caused by termination of processive synthesis", "authors": "Eckmann Christian R., Rammelt Christian, Wahle Elmar.", "journal": "The EMBO Journal", "year": "2011", "volumes": "30", "first page": "4754", "last page": "4765", "DOI": "10.1038/emboj.2011.385"}, {"title": "CPSF30 and Wdr33 directly bind to AAUAAA in mammalian mRNA 3′ processing", "authors": "Chan Simon L., Huppertz Irina, Yao Chengguo, et al.", "journal": "Genes & Development", "year": "2014", "volumes": "28", "first page": "2370", "last page": "2380", "DOI": "10.1101/gad.250993.114"}, {"title": "The yeast Rat1 exonuclease promotes transcription termination by RNA polymerase II", "authors": "Kim Moonkyung, Krogan Nevan J., Vasiljeva Lidia, et al.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2004", "volumes": "432", "first page": "517", "last page": "522", "DOI": "10.1038/nature03041"}, {"title": "Structural insights into the assembly and polyA signal recognition mechanism of the human CPSF complex", "authors": "Clerici Marcello, Faini Marco, Aebersold Ruedi, et al.", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2017", "volumes": "6", "first page": "e33111", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.33111"}, {"title": "Regulation of alternative polyadenylation by U1 snRNPs and SRp20", "authors": "Kaida Daisuke, Berg Michael G., Younis Ihab, et al.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "38", "first page": "218", "last page": "229", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2010.02.027"}, {"title": "The role of the poly(A) tail in mRNA stability and translation", "authors": "Kuhn Ute, Wahle Elmar.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2004", "volumes": "108", "first page": "501", "last page": "512", "DOI": "10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-5"}]}
