{"Literature Review": "The study of mRNA modifications has significantly advanced our understanding of gene expression regulation, revealing a complex layer of control beyond the DNA sequence. This literature review focuses on the proteins involved in the modification of mRNA, specifically the writers, readers, and erasers of these marks, with an emphasis on N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal mRNA modification. The discovery of enzymes responsible for adding and removing m6A has been pivotal in understanding the dynamics of mRNA modifications. Methyltransferases, such as METTL3 and METTL14, have been identified as key writers that catalyze the addition of m6A to mRNA, playing crucial roles in various biological processes and diseases (Wang et al., 2014). Conversely, demethylases like FTO and ALKBH5 have been characterized as erasers that remove m6A marks, thereby influencing mRNA stability and translation (Jia et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013). The identification and characterization of these enzymes have provided insights into the reversible nature of mRNA modifications and their regulatory functions. Reader proteins, which recognize and bind to m6A-modified mRNA, have also been extensively studied. Proteins such as YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDC1 have been shown to mediate the effects of m6A on mRNA metabolism, including splicing, export, stability, and translation (Wang et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017). These studies have highlighted the diverse roles of m6A reader proteins in gene expression regulation. Despite these advances, many questions remain regarding the specificity, regulation, and functional consequences of mRNA modifications. Future research directions include elucidating the mechanisms by which modification enzymes are regulated, understanding the interplay between different mRNA modifications, and exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting the epitranscriptome in disease. The continued development of tools for detecting and manipulating mRNA modifications will be crucial for addressing these questions and furthering our understanding of the epitranscriptome.", "References": [{"title": "N6-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency", "authors": "Wang, X., Lu, Z., Gomez, A., Hon, G.C., Yue, Y., Han, D., Fu, Y., Parisien, M., Dai, Q., Jia, G., Ren, B., Pan, T., He, C.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2014", "volumes": "159", "first page": "1388", "last page": "1399", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.044"}, {"title": "N6-methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO", "authors": "Jia, G., Fu, Y., Zhao, X., Dai, Q., Zheng, G., Yang, Y., Yi, C., Lindahl, T., Pan, T., Yang, Y.G., He, C.", "journal": "Nature Chemical Biology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "7", "first page": "885", "last page": "887", "DOI": "10.1038/nchembio.687"}, {"title": "ALKBH5 is a mammalian RNA demethylase that impacts RNA metabolism and mouse fertility", "authors": "Zheng, G., Dahl, J.A., Niu, Y., Fedorcsak, P., Huang, C.M., Li, C.J., Vågbø, C.B., Shi, Y., Wang, W.L., Song, S.H., Lu, Z., Bosmans, R.P., Dai, Q., Hao, Y.J., Yang, X., Zhao, W.M., Tong, W.M., Wang, X.J., Bogdan, F., Furu, K., Fu, Y., Jia, G., Zhao, X., Liu, J., Krokan, H.E., Klungland, A., Yang, Y.G., He, C.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2013", "volumes": "49", "first page": "18", "last page": "29", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2012.10.015"}, {"title": "N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability", "authors": "Wang, X., Zhao, B.S., Roundtree, I.A., Lu, Z., Han, D., Ma, H., Weng, X., Chen, K., Shi, H., He, C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "519", "first page": "482", "last page": "485", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14299"}, {"title": "YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N6-methyladenosine-modified RNA", "authors": "Shi, H., Wang, X., Lu, Z., Zhao, B.S., Ma, H., Hsu, P.J., Liu, C., He, C.", "journal": "Cell Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "27", "first page": "315", "last page": "328", "DOI": "10.1038/cr.2017.15"}]}
