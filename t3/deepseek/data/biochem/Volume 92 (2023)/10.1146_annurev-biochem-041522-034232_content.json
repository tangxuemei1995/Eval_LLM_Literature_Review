{"Literature Review": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) represents a critical cellular mechanism that ensures the rapid removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes, thereby maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis. This process, first identified through the preferential repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in transcribed regions of mammalian genomes, has been observed across a wide range of organisms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans (Hanawalt & Spivak, 2008). The universality of TCR underscores its fundamental role in DNA repair and cellular survival. TCR is characterized by the faster repair of the transcribed strand compared to the nontranscribed strand within actively transcribed genes, a phenomenon that involves a complex interplay between RNA polymerase stalled at DNA damage sites and nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins (Mellon et al., 1987). In E. coli, the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd plays a pivotal role in TCR by recognizing stalled RNA polymerase and recruiting NER machinery to the site of damage (Selby & Sancar, 1993). Similarly, in humans, the Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein is essential for TCR, with mutations in the CSB gene leading to severe neurological disorders and increased sensitivity to UV light (Troelstra et al., 1992). Despite the conservation of TCR across species, Drosophila presents an intriguing exception, exhibiting TCR without an obvious homolog of the TCR translocase found in other organisms (Marteijn et al., 2014). This suggests that alternative mechanisms may facilitate TCR in certain contexts. The molecular mechanisms underlying TCR have been elucidated through a combination of genome-wide next-generation sequencing, cryo–electron microscopy, and single-molecule analysis, revealing the dynamic interactions between RNA polymerase, TCR factors, and NER proteins (Kisker et al., 2013). These studies have highlighted the role of TCR in not only DNA repair but also in the regulation of gene expression and the circadian clock, linking TCR to broader cellular processes (Sancar et al., 2015). The in vitro reconstitution of TCR in E. coli with purified proteins has provided valuable insights into the sequence of events that lead to the preferential repair of the transcribed strand, offering a model for understanding TCR in more complex organisms (Manelyte et al., 2009). Furthermore, the investigation of TCR has implications for understanding the molecular basis of diseases associated with defective DNA repair, such as Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum, and for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting DNA repair pathways (Cleaver et al., 2009). In summary, TCR is a sophisticated cellular mechanism that integrates transcription and DNA repair to protect the genome from damage, with ongoing research continuing to uncover its complexities and connections to human health.", "References": [{"title": "Transcription-coupled DNA repair: two decades of progress and surprises", "authors": "Philip C.
