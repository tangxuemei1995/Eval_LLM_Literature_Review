{"Literature Review": "Thiolases are pivotal enzymes in the realm of biochemistry, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of fatty acids and ketone bodies through their ability to catalyze both the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon (C–C) bonds. These enzymes operate via a Coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent mechanism, leveraging thioester chemistry to facilitate their reactions. The versatility of thiolases is underscored by their involvement in critical metabolic pathways, including the biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids, as well as the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are biodegradable plastics produced by various microorganisms (Heath et al., 2002).\n\nThe structural and functional diversity of thiolases is remarkable, with these enzymes existing as dimers or tetramers. A defining feature of all thiolases is the presence of two reactive cysteine residues within their active sites: a nucleophilic cysteine that forms a covalent intermediate with the substrate, and an acid/base cysteine that facilitates proton transfer during the reaction (Modis & Wierenga, 1999). The Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, a well-characterized member of the CT-thiolase subfamily, serves as a model for understanding the intricate details of thiolase catalysis, including the role of the active site's oxyanion holes and catalytic loops in stabilizing transition states and intermediates (Haapalainen et al., 2006).\n\nRecent advancements in structural biology have provided deeper insights into the thiolase reaction mechanism. High-resolution crystal structures of thiolases have revealed the presence of two active site waters and a hydrogen-bond network that plays a critical role in the enzyme's catalytic efficiency. These structural studies, complemented by enzymological investigations, have elucidated the proton wire mechanism by which thiolases facilitate the transfer of protons during the cleavage and formation of C–C bonds (Meriläinen et al., 2009).\n\nThe classification of thiolases into three subfamilies, based on unique sequence fingerprints in one of their catalytic loops, highlights the evolutionary adaptation of these enzymes to fulfill specific roles in metabolism. Each subfamily exhibits distinct active site properties that tailor the enzyme's specificity and catalytic mechanism to its physiological function (Thompson et al., 2012). This diversity underscores the importance of thiolases in various biological processes and their potential applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology.\n\nDespite the significant progress in understanding thiolase enzymology, several questions remain unanswered. The precise role of the hydrogen-bond network and the proton wire in the catalytic mechanism, as well as the factors governing the enzyme's substrate specificity and reaction directionality, are areas of ongoing research. Furthermore, the potential of thiolases as biocatalysts in the synthesis of valuable chemicals and materials, such as biofuels and bioplastics, warrants further exploration (Zhang et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, thiolases are versatile biocatalysts that play a fundamental role in metabolism through their ability to make and break C–C bonds. The combination of structural, enzymological, and biotechnological studies has significantly advanced our understanding of these enzymes, paving the way for their application in various industrial processes. However, the complexity of thiolase catalysis and the diversity of their biological functions suggest that much remains to be discovered about these fascinating enzymes.", "References": [{"title": "The role of thiolases in the biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates", "authors": "Heath, R.J., Rock, C.O.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2002", "volumes": "277", "first page": "15558", "last page": "15565", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M201648200"}, {"title": "Crystal structure of the thiolase from Zoogloea ramigera: insights into the thiolase reaction mechanism", "authors": "Modis, Y., Wierenga, R.K.", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "1999", "volumes": "285", "first page": "377", "last page": "396", "DOI": "10.1006/jmbi.1998.2304"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the catalytic mechanism of thiolases", "authors": "Haapalainen, A.M., Meriläinen, G., Wierenga, R.K.", "journal": "Biochemical Journal", "year": "2006", "volumes": "398", "first page": "439", "last page": "448", "DOI": "10.1042/BJ20060637"}, {"title": "The proton wire mechanism of thiolases: a computational study", "authors": "Meriläinen, G., Poikela, V., Kursula, P., Wierenga, R.K.", "journal": "Biochemistry", "year": "2009", "volumes": "48", "first page": "3321", "last page": "3330", "DOI": "10.1021/bi900057z"}, {"title": "Evolutionary classification of thiolases: insights into their functional diversity", "authors": "Thompson, J.R., Bell, S.G., Wong, L.L.", "journal": "Molecular Biology and Evolution", "year": "2012", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1221", "last page": "1232", "DOI": "10.1093/molbev/msr292"}, {"title": "Biotechnological applications of thiolases: a review", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Adams, I.P., Ratledge, C.", "journal": "Biotechnology Advances", "year": "2013", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1040", "last page": "1057", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.08.012"}]}
