{"Literature Review": "The study of mRNA regulation through RNA modifications has emerged as a pivotal area of research in molecular biology, shedding light on the complex mechanisms that govern gene expression. RNA modifications, often referred to as the 'epitranscriptome', play a crucial role in the regulation of RNA metabolism and posttranscriptional processes. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of mRNA modifications, their impact on the mRNA life cycle, and the challenges that lie ahead in this field. Recent advancements have identified several RNA modifications, including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and pseudouridine (Ψ), each contributing uniquely to the regulation of mRNA stability, translation, and decay. The m6A modification, in particular, has been extensively studied and is known to influence mRNA splicing, export, translation efficiency, and stability. Research by Dominissini et al. (2012) and Meyer et al. (2012) has been instrumental in mapping m6A sites across the transcriptome, revealing its widespread presence and functional significance. Similarly, the role of m5C in mRNA has been explored, with studies indicating its involvement in the regulation of mRNA export and translation. The discovery of RNA modification enzymes, such as METTL3/METTL14 for m6A addition and NSUN2 for m5C, has further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying these modifications. Despite these advancements, the field faces challenges in understanding the dynamic regulation of RNA modifications and their context-dependent effects. The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools has facilitated the identification and analysis of RNA modifications, yet the functional consequences of many modifications remain poorly understood. Moreover, the interplay between different RNA modifications and their collective impact on mRNA fate is an area of active investigation. Future research directions include the exploration of novel RNA modifications, the development of more precise mapping techniques, and the integration of epitranscriptomic data with other omics datasets to gain a holistic view of gene regulation. As the field continues to evolve, it holds the promise of uncovering new layers of complexity in mRNA regulation and offering insights into the molecular basis of diseases associated with dysregulated RNA modifications.", "References": [{"title": "Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq", "authors": "Dominissini, Dan, Moshitch-Moshkovitz, Sharon, Schwartz, Schraga, Salmon-Divon, Mali, Ungar, Lior, Osenberg, Sivan, Cesarkas, Karen, Jacob-Hirsch, Jasmine, Amariglio, Ninette, Kupiec, Martin, Sorek, Rotem, Rechavi, Gideon", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2012", "volumes": "485", "first page": "201", "last page": "206", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11112"}, {"title": "Comprehensive analysis of mRNA methylation reveals enrichment in 3' UTRs and near stop codons", "authors": "Meyer, Kate D, Saletore, Yogesh, Zumbo, Paul, Elemento, Olivier, Mason, Christopher E, Jaffrey, Samie R", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2012", "volumes": "149", "first page": "1635", "last page": "1646", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.003"}, {"title": "The dynamic N1-methyladenosine methylome in eukaryotic messenger RNA", "authors": "Li, Xing, Xiong, Xushen, Wang, Kun, Wang, Lei, Shu, Xiaoguang, Ma, Shenglin, Yi, Chengqi", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "530", "first page": "441", "last page": "446", "DOI": "10.1038/nature16998"}, {"title": "5-methylcytosine promotes mRNA export — NSUN2 as the methyltransferase and ALYREF as an m5C reader", "authors": "Yang, Xiaoyu, Yang, Ying, Sun, Bao-Fa, Chen, Yu-Sheng, Xu, Jia-Wei, Lai, Wei-Yi, Li, Ang, Wang, Xiu-Jie, Bhattarai, Deepak Prasad, Xiao, Wen, Sun, Hui-Ying, Zhu, Qingsong, Ma, Hong-Liang, Adhikari, Samir, Sun, Meng, Hao, Ya-Juan, Zhang, Bo, Huang, Chun-Min, Huang, Niu, Jiang, Gui-Bin, Zhao, Yong-Liang, Wang, Heng-Liang, Sun, Ying-Pu, Yang, Yun-Gui", "journal": "Cell Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "27", "first page": "606", "last page": "625", "DOI": "10.1038/cr.2017.55"}, {"title": "Pseudouridine profiling reveals regulated mRNA pseudouridylation in yeast and human cells", "authors": "Carlile, Thomas M, Rojas-Duran, Maria F, Zinshteyn, Boris, Shin, Hakyung, Bartoli, Kristen M, Gilbert, Wendy V", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2014", "volumes": "515", "first page": "143", "last page": "146", "DOI": "10.1038/nature13802"}, {"title": "The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 promotes translation in human cancer cells", "authors": "Lin, Shuibin, Choe, Junho, Du, Peng, Triboulet, Robinson, Gregory, Richard I", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "62", "first page": "335", "last page": "345", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2016.03.021"}, {"title": "NSUN2-mediated m5C methylation and METTL3/METTL14-mediated m6A methylation cooperatively enhance p21 translation", "authors": "Yang, Ying, Wang, Lei, Han, Xu, Yang, Wei-Lin, Zhang, Min, Ma, Hong-Liang, Sun, Bao-Fa, Li, Ang, Xia, Jing, Chen, Jian, Yang, Yun-Gui", "journal": "Journal of Cellular Biochemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "118", "first page": "2587", "last page": "2598", "DOI": "10.1002/jcb.25957"}, {"title": "High-resolution N6-methyladenosine (m6A) map using photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A sequencing", "authors": "Linder, Bastian, Grozhik, Anya V, Olarerin-George, Anthony O, Meydan, Cem, Mason, Christopher E, Jaffrey, Samie R", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "year": "2015", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1587", "last page": "1590", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201410647"}, {"title": "The role of m6A RNA methylation in human cancer", "authors": "Chen, Xian-Yang, Zhang, Jing, Zhu, Jian-Song", "journal": "Molecular Cancer", "year": "2019", "volumes": "18", "first page": "103", "last page": "103", "DOI": "10.1186/s12943-019-1033-z"}, {"title": "Epitranscriptomic m6A regulation of axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system", "authors": "Weng, Yi-Lin, Wang, Xue, An, Ruifeng, Cassin, Joshua, Vissers, Caroline, Liu, Yijing, Liu, Yan, Xu, Tian, Wang, Xiaolu, Wong, Sunny Z H, Joseph, Jeremiah, Dore, Louis C, Dong, Qiang, Zheng, Wei, Jin, Peng, Wu, Hao, Shen, Bin, Zhuang, Xiaoxi, He, Chuan, Liu, Kang", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2018", "volumes": "97", "first page": "313", "last page": "325.e6", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.036"}]}
