{"Literature Review": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation poses a significant threat to genomic integrity by inducing bulky DNA lesions, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs). These lesions can obstruct the progression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), leading to transcription arrest and, if not properly repaired, to cell death or mutagenesis. To counteract these deleterious effects, cells have evolved sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms, among which nucleotide excision repair (NER) plays a pivotal role. NER is subdivided into two distinct pathways: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). While GG-NER operates throughout the genome to detect and repair lesions, TC-NER specifically targets lesions that impede transcription, ensuring the rapid resumption of RNA synthesis and the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity. The recognition of DNA lesions by these pathways differs fundamentally; GG-NER relies on the XPC-RAD23B-CETN2 complex for initial damage detection, whereas TC-NER is initiated by the stalling of RNAPII at the lesion site. This stalling event recruits key TC-NER factors, including Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA, and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA), which facilitate the recruitment of the core NER machinery to the damage site. The involvement of CSB and CSA in TC-NER underscores the pathway's critical role in preventing the pathological consequences of transcription-blocking lesions, as mutations in these genes are associated with Cockayne syndrome (CS), a severe disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities, premature aging, and hypersensitivity to UV light. Protein ubiquitylation has emerged as a crucial regulatory mechanism in TC-NER, modulating the stability and activity of key repair factors. For instance, the ubiquitin ligase activity of CSA is essential for the degradation of CSB and the subsequent recruitment of UVSSA, highlighting the intricate regulatory networks that govern TC-NER. UV irradiation not only induces DNA damage but also elicits a complex transcriptional response aimed at mitigating the effects of genotoxic stress. This response involves the activation of signaling cascades, such as the p53 pathway, which orchestrates the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The interplay between DNA repair and the transcriptional response to UV-induced damage is crucial for cell survival and the prevention of carcinogenesis. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and CS, two diseases linked to defects in NER, further illustrate the importance of this interplay. XP patients, who harbor mutations in GG-NER factors, exhibit a heightened risk of skin cancer due to the accumulation of UV-induced DNA damage. In contrast, CS patients, with mutations in TC-NER factors, display severe developmental and neurological abnormalities, reflecting the critical role of TC-NER in maintaining transcriptional integrity. In conclusion, the study of TC-NER and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that safeguard genomic stability and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways in the treatment of DNA repair-deficient diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of DNA damage recognition in mammalian nucleotide excision repair", "authors": "Jan H.J.
