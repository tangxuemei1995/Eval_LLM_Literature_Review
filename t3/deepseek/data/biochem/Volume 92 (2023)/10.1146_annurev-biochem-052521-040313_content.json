{"Literature Review": "The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of various tissues in metazoans. A distinctive feature of this pathway is its intricate relationship with cholesterol, a sterol lipid that is essential for the biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception of HH ligands. This literature review explores the multifaceted roles of cholesterol in HH signaling, highlighting its significance in the pathway's evolution and function. Cholesterol's involvement in HH signaling begins with the covalent attachment of a cholesterol molecule to HH ligands during their biogenesis. This modification is crucial for the proper processing and secretion of HH proteins. Studies have shown that the cholesterol moiety acts as a molecular baton, facilitating the transfer of HH ligands from producing cells to target cells through the action of specific transfer proteins (Porter et al., 1996). This process ensures the precise spatial and temporal distribution of HH signals, which is essential for the regulation of tissue development and patterning. Once secreted, the cholesterol-modified HH ligands must traverse the extracellular space to reach their target cells. The dispersal of HH ligands is tightly regulated by their interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and lipoproteins, which serve as carriers that modulate the range and concentration of HH signaling (Bellaiche et al., 1998). Cholesterol plays a critical role in this process by influencing the lipid composition of these carriers, thereby affecting the stability and mobility of HH ligands. Upon reaching the target cells, HH ligands bind to the Patched (PTCH) receptor, a transmembrane protein that acts as a negative regulator of the pathway. The binding of HH ligands to PTCH relieves its inhibitory effect on Smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor-like protein that transduces the HH signal across the plasma membrane. Cholesterol is directly involved in this signaling circuit, as it is required for the proper localization and activation of SMO (Huang et al., 2016). Furthermore, recent studies have identified a cholesterol transporter and sensor complex that regulates the transmission of HH signals from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, underscoring the central role of cholesterol in HH signal transduction (Kinnebrew et al., 2019). The repeated use of cholesterol in HH signaling suggests that the pathway may have evolved by coopting ancient systems that regulate the abundance or organization of sterol-like lipids in membranes. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that many components of the HH pathway, including PTCH and SMO, share structural and functional similarities with proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis (Ingham et al., 2011). The integration of cholesterol into the HH signaling pathway likely provided a selective advantage by enabling the precise control of developmental processes in response to changes in lipid metabolism. In conclusion, cholesterol is an indispensable component of the HH signaling pathway, playing critical roles in ligand biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception. The repeated use of cholesterol in these processes highlights the evolutionary significance of this sterol lipid in the development and maintenance of metazoan tissues. Future research should aim to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between cholesterol and HH signaling, as this knowledge could have important implications for understanding and treating diseases associated with dysregulated HH signaling, such as cancer and developmental disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Cholesterol modification of hedgehog signaling proteins in animal development", "authors": "Porter, J.A., Young, K.E., Beachy, P.A.", "journal": "Science", "year": "1996", "volumes": "274", "first page": "255", "last page": "259", "DOI": "10.1126/science.274.5285.255"}, {"title": "Hedgehog movement is regulated through tout velu-dependent synthesis of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan", "authors": "Bellaiche, Y., The, I., Perrimon, N.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "1998", "volumes": "1", "first page": "7", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80003-4"}, {"title": "Cellular cholesterol directly activates Smoothened in Hedgehog signaling", "authors": "Huang, P., Nedelcu, D., Watanabe, M., Jao, C., Kim, Y., Liu, J., Salic, A.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "166", "first page": "1176", "last page": "1187.e14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.003"}, {"title": "Cholesterol accessibility at the ciliary membrane controls hedgehog signaling", "authors": "Kinnebrew, M., Iverson, E.J., Patel, B.B., Pusapati, G.V., Kong, J.H., Johnson, K.A., Luchetti, G., Eckert, K.M., McDonald, J.G., Covey, D.F.", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2019", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e50051", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.50051"}, {"title": "Mechanisms and functions of Hedgehog signalling across the metazoa", "authors": "Ingham, P.W., Nakano, Y., Seger, C.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "12", "first page": "393", "last page": "406", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg2984"}]}
