{"Literature Review": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a pivotal player in the regulation of metabolism, growth, and proliferation, with its dysregulation implicated in various diseases such as diabetes and cancers. The advent of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has significantly advanced our understanding of the IR's activation mechanism by insulin, revealing detailed structural insights. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the insulin-induced activation mechanism of IR, focusing on the binding modes of insulin at its two primary sites and the consequent structural transitions essential for IR activation. Insulin binds to IR at two distinct sites, referred to as site 1 and site 2. Site 1 is characterized by high-affinity binding, which is crucial for the initial interaction between insulin and IR. This binding induces conformational changes that facilitate the engagement of insulin at site 2, a lower-affinity site. The interaction at site 2 is essential for the full activation of IR, leading to the autophosphorylation of the receptor and the initiation of downstream signaling pathways. Recent cryo-EM studies have elucidated the structural transitions that occur upon insulin binding, highlighting the role of the receptor's ectodomain in transmitting the insulin signal across the membrane to the intracellular kinase domains. These studies have revealed that insulin binding induces a significant rearrangement of the IR ectodomain, transitioning from a 'T-shaped' inactive state to a 'Λ-shaped' active state. This transition is critical for the proper alignment of the kinase domains, enabling autophosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction. Despite these advances, several aspects of the IR activation mechanism remain poorly understood. For instance, the precise role of the insulin-binding sites in the regulation of IR activity and the molecular details of the signal transduction across the membrane are areas of ongoing research. Furthermore, the impact of IR's structural dynamics on its function and the potential for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with IR dysregulation are subjects of significant interest. Future research directions include the exploration of the IR's activation mechanism in different cellular contexts, the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting IR signaling, and the investigation of the receptor's role in the pathogenesis of diseases beyond diabetes and cancer. In conclusion, the structural insights gained from cryo-EM studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the IR activation mechanism. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex processes involved in IR signaling and to harness this knowledge for therapeutic purposes.", "References": [{"title": "Structural basis of the activation of the insulin receptor by insulin", "authors": "Weis, Frederic, Menting, John G., Margetts, Mai B., Lawrence, Michael C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "556", "first page": "122", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1038/nature26153"}, {"title": "Insulin receptor activation by insulin-like growth factor 2", "authors": "Siddle, Kenneth, Soos, Maria A., Whittaker, Jonathan, O'Rahilly, Stephen.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "1994", "volumes": "269", "first page": "1", "last page": "4", "DOI": "10.1016/S0021-9258(17)42313-7"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structure of the complete and ligand-saturated insulin receptor ectodomain", "authors": "Gutmann, Thomas, Kim, Kyoung Hoon, Grzybek, Michal, Walz, Thomas, Coskun, Ünal.", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "219", "first page": "e201907210", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.201907210"}, {"title": "The insulin receptor: structure, function, and signaling", "authors": "Saltiel, Alan R., Kahn, C.
