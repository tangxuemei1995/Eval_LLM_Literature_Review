{"Literature Review": "The concept of invisible labor, particularly in the context of interpreting, has garnered increasing attention within academic discourse. This literature review delves into the multifaceted dimensions of interpreters' work, emphasizing its often overlooked and undervalued nature within global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Drawing on a range of scholarly sources, we explore the ethical dilemmas faced by interpreters, the professional ideologies that contribute to their invisibility, and the broader implications for anthropology and other disciplines. Interpreters play a crucial role in facilitating communication across linguistic and cultural divides, yet their labor is frequently rendered invisible by prevailing language ideologies and organizational practices. These ideologies perpetuate the notion that language transmission is a straightforward, effortless process, thereby undermining the complex skills and emotional labor involved in interpreting (Baker, 2006; Inghilleri, 2012). This invisibility is further compounded by the global capitalist framework, which often prioritizes efficiency and cost-effectiveness over the recognition and fair compensation of interpreters' work (Tymoczko, 2007). The ethical tensions inherent in interpreting mirror those encountered in anthropology, particularly the conflict between maintaining professional neutrality and engaging in intentional advocacy. Interpreters are often caught between the need to remain impartial and the desire to advocate for the individuals or communities they serve, a dilemma that challenges conventional notions of professional ethics (Angelelli, 2004; Wadensjö, 1998). This tension is exacerbated in humanitarian contexts, where interpreters must navigate complex power dynamics and ethical quandaries while often working under precarious conditions (Rafael, 2007; Footitt and Kelly, 2012). The study of interpreters' labor offers valuable insights into the contradictions of global capitalism and the ethical challenges faced by professionals in cross-cultural settings. By examining the experiences of interpreters, anthropologists and other scholars can critically assess their own professional practices and the broader socio-economic structures that shape their work (Cronin, 2006; Pöchhacker, 2004). This review calls for a more reflexive approach to the ethics of interpreting and a greater recognition of the invisible labor that sustains global communication and understanding.", "References": [{"title": "Translation and Conflict: A Narrative Account", "authors": "Mona Baker", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Interpreting Justice: Ethics, Politics and Language", "authors": "Moira Inghilleri", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Enlarging Translation, Empowering Translators", "authors": "Maria Tymoczko", "journal": "St. Jerome Publishing", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Medical Interpreting and Cross-cultural Communication", "authors": "Claudia V.
