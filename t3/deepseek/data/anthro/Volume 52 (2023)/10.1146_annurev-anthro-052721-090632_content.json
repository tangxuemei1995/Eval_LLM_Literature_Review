{"Literature Review": "The concept of 'normal' in human biology and behavior has been a subject of extensive debate and analysis within anthropology and related disciplines. This literature review explores the multifaceted meanings of 'normal', focusing on its descriptive (statistical) and evaluative (normative) dimensions, and how these interpretations influence our understanding of human biology and biological variation. The discussion is framed within the proposed biological normalcy framework, which seeks to elucidate the interplay between statistical norms and normative judgments in shaping perceptions of human biology. The term 'normal' is often used interchangeably with 'healthy' in biomedical contexts, yet this conflation is fraught with cultural and historical biases. As Lock and Nguyen (2010) argue, the biomedical model of health is deeply embedded in Western cultural norms, which may not be universally applicable or relevant. This critique is echoed by Martin (1994), who highlights how biomedical definitions of normalcy often exclude or pathologize non-Western or non-normative bodies and behaviors. The statistical interpretation of normal, typically associated with the bell curve or normal distribution, is another area of contention. Gould (1996) critiques the misuse of statistical norms to justify social and biological hierarchies, emphasizing that variation is a fundamental aspect of human biology. This perspective is supported by Marks (2002), who argues that human genetic diversity defies simplistic categorizations of normal and abnormal. The evaluative dimension of normal, which involves judgments about what is desirable or acceptable, is equally complex. Foucault (1978) explores how norms are socially constructed and enforced, shaping individual and collective behaviors. This analysis is extended by Butler (1990), who examines how normative views of gender and sexuality are performatively constituted and policed. The biological normalcy framework proposed in this review integrates these insights, emphasizing the dynamic and context-dependent nature of normalcy. Several examples illustrate the framework's applicability. For instance, the work of Fausto-Sterling (2000) on intersex conditions challenges binary notions of sex and normalcy, highlighting the diversity of human biology. Similarly, the research of Roberts (2011) on racial disparities in health care underscores how normative judgments about race and biology can perpetuate inequality. The framework also sheds light on the implications of normalcy for human population biology. As Livingstone (1958) demonstrates, the concept of race as a biological category is a social construct with no scientific basis, yet it continues to influence research and policy. This critique is further developed by Gravlee (2009), who examines how racialized norms shape health outcomes and access to care. In conclusion, the biological normalcy framework offers a nuanced understanding of how statistical and normative meanings of normal intersect and influence our perceptions of human biology. By challenging entrenched biases and assumptions, this framework contributes to a more inclusive and equitable approach to the study of human biological variation.", "References": [{"title": "An Anthropology of Biomedicine", "authors": "Margaret Lock, Vinh-Kim Nguyen", "journal": "Wiley-Blackwell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/9781444324846"}, {"title": "Flexible Bodies: Tracking Immunity in American Culture from the Days of Polio to the Age of AIDS", "authors": "Emily Martin", "journal": "Beacon Press", "year": "1994", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Mismeasure of Man", "authors": "Stephen Jay Gould", "journal": "W.W.
