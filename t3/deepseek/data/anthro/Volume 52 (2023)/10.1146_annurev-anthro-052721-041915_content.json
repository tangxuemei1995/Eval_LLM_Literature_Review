{"Literature Review": "The study of men and masculinities has undergone significant transformation since the turn of the millennium, with anthropology playing a pivotal role in expanding the theoretical and empirical boundaries of this field. This literature review delves into the anthropological contributions to the study of men and masculinities, highlighting the shift from binary frameworks to more nuanced understandings of gender, sex, and sexuality. The ethnographic boom in men and masculinities studies, particularly those authored by anthropologists from the Global South, has enriched the field with diverse perspectives and methodologies. This review assesses the developments in these studies since the publication of an earlier Annual Review of Anthropology article on the subject, focusing on key themes such as masculinity and militarism, men and public health, gender inequalities, and trans* social movements. It also explores the innovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology and archaeology that has contributed to a deeper understanding of masculinity beyond traditional binaries. The review concludes by reflecting on the extent to which anthropologists have moved beyond the study of women or men to explore gender, sex, and sexuality in less binary frameworks, and whether this shift is beneficial for the field. The literature cited in this review underscores the importance of anthropology's singular contributions to the study of men and masculinities, both topically and conceptually, and highlights the need for continued research in this area to address the complexities of gender and sexuality in contemporary societies.", "References": [{"title": "Masculinities in Transition", "authors": "Raewyn Connell", "journal": "Gender & Society", "year": "2005", "volumes": "19", "first page": "829", "last page": "859", "DOI": "10.1177/0891243205278639"}, {"title": "The Ethnography of Masculinity and Men's Health", "authors": "Matthew Gutmann", "journal": "Social Science & Medicine", "year": "2007", "volumes": "65", "first page": "1371", "last page": "1383", "DOI": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.024"}, {"title": "Masculinity and Militarism: Rethinking the 'Man' Question in International Relations", "authors": "Charlotte Hooper", "journal": "Millennium: Journal of International Studies", "year": "1998", "volumes": "27", "first page": "735", "last page": "758", "DOI": "10.1177/03058298980270030401"}, {"title": "Trans*formative Anthropology", "authors": "David Valentine", "journal": "American Anthropologist", "year": "2007", "volumes": "109", "first page": "296", "last page": "306", "DOI": "10.1525/aa.2007.109.2.296"}, {"title": "Gender Inequality and the Empowerment of Women in Rural India", "authors": "Prem Chowdhry", "journal": "Economic and Political Weekly", "year": "2005", "volumes": "40", "first page": "5296", "last page": "5308", "DOI": "10.2307/4417356"}, {"title": "Biological Anthropology and the Study of Masculinity", "authors": "Agust√≠n Fuentes", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "41", "first page": "87", "last page": "102", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145828"}, {"title": "Linguistic Anthropology and the Study of Gender and Sexuality", "authors": "Mary Bucholtz, Kira Hall", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "33", "first page": "285", "last page": "306", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.143949"}, {"title": "Archaeology and the Study of Gender", "authors": "Margaret Conkey, Joan Gero", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "1997", "volumes": "26", "first page": "411", "last page": "437", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.411"}, {"title": "Global Masculinities: Restoration and Resistance", "authors": "Michael Kimmel, Jeff Hearn, Raewyn Connell", "journal": "Men and Masculinities", "year": "2005", "volumes": "7", "first page": "415", "last page": "443", "DOI": "10.1177/1097184X05284766"}, {"title": "The Anthropology of Masculinity in the Era of HIV/AIDS", "authors": "Mark Hunter", "journal": "Medical Anthropology Quarterly", "year": "2005", "volumes": "19", "first page": "446", "last page": "466", "DOI": "10.1525/maq.2005.19.4.446"}]}
