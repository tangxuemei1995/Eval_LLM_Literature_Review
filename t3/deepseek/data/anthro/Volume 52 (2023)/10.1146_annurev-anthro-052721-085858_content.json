{"Literature Review": "Human adaptation to extreme environments has been a subject of extensive research, revealing the remarkable resilience and flexibility of human physiology and culture. This literature review synthesizes findings from studies on human responses to extreme heat, cold, and high altitude, while also considering the emerging challenges posed by climate change and structural inequality. The ability of humans to inhabit and thrive in extreme environments is a testament to our species' adaptability. Research has shown that physiological adaptations, such as changes in metabolism and thermoregulation, play a crucial role in enabling humans to survive in harsh conditions (Hanna & Brown, 1983). For instance, indigenous populations living in the Arctic have developed unique metabolic adaptations that allow them to maintain body temperature in freezing conditions (Leonard et al., 2005). Similarly, populations residing in high-altitude regions exhibit enhanced oxygen utilization efficiency, a critical adaptation for survival in low-oxygen environments (Beall, 2006). The process of acclimatization, where individuals gradually adapt to new environmental conditions, has been extensively documented. Studies have shown that both short-term and long-term acclimatization can significantly improve physical performance and reduce the risk of environmental stress-related illnesses (Ward et al., 2000). However, the capacity for adaptation is not limitless, and extreme environments can pose significant health risks. Recent research has highlighted the impact of climate change on exacerbating environmental extremes, thereby increasing the vulnerability of human populations (McMichael, 2013). Rising global temperatures have led to more frequent and severe heatwaves, challenging human thermoregulatory systems and increasing the incidence of heat-related illnesses (Kovats & Hajat, 2008). Similarly, the melting of polar ice caps and rising sea levels threaten the livelihoods of indigenous communities in the Arctic, forcing them to adapt to rapidly changing conditions (Ford et al., 2014). Structural inequality further compounds the challenges posed by extreme environments. Marginalized populations often have limited access to resources and infrastructure, making them more susceptible to environmental stressors (Cutter et al., 2003). For example, low-income communities in urban areas are disproportionately affected by heatwaves due to the urban heat island effect and inadequate access to cooling facilities (Harlan et al., 2006). Addressing these intersecting challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates insights from anthropology, public health, and environmental science. Future research should focus on developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and structural inequality on human health and well-being. This includes exploring innovative solutions for sustainable living in extreme environments, as well as policies that promote equity and resilience. By understanding the complex interplay between human biology, culture, and the environment, we can better prepare for the challenges of a rapidly changing world.", "References": [{"title": "Human adaptability to Arctic zones", "authors": "Hanna, Joel M., Brown, Daniel E.", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "1983", "volumes": "12", "first page": "69", "last page": "90", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.an.12.100183.000441"}, {"title": "Metabolic adaptation in indigenous Siberian populations", "authors": "Leonard, William R., Sorensen, Mark V., Galloway, Victoria A., Spencer, Gary J., Mosher, M.J., Osipova, Ludmila, Spitsyn, Victor A.", "journal": "American Journal of Human Biology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "17", "first page": "155", "last page": "165", "DOI": "10.1002/ajhb.20106"}, {"title": "Andean, Tibetan, and Ethiopian patterns of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia", "authors": "Beall, Cynthia M.", "journal": "Integrative and Comparative Biology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "46", "first page": "18", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1093/icb/icj004"}, {"title": "Acclimatization to heat and altitude", "authors": "Ward, Michael P., Milledge, James S., West, John B.", "journal": "High Altitude Medicine & Biology", "year": "2000", "volumes": "1", "first page": "117", "last page": "129", "DOI": "10.1089/15270290050074205"}, {"title": "Climate change and human health: risks and responses", "authors": "McMichael, Anthony J.", "journal": "World Health Organization", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Heat stress and public health: a critical review", "authors": "Kovats, R.
