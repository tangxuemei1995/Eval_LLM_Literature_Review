{"Literature Review": "The study of security regimes has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with anthropologists playing a crucial role in challenging and expanding traditional notions of security. This literature review explores the contributions of anthropology to the understanding of security regimes, emphasizing the importance of a transnational feminist lens in uncovering the multifaceted and often invisible dimensions of security practices. Security regimes, as conceptualized in this review, encompass a broad range of practices, discourses, and technologies that operate across various scales, from the intimate spaces of home and family to the global arenas of imperial and transnational power. The review begins by examining the theoretical foundations of security studies in anthropology, highlighting the shift from state-centric models to more nuanced understandings that incorporate gender, race, and empire. It then delves into the methodological innovations that have emerged from this field, particularly the use of ethnographic methods to explore the everyday experiences of security. Finally, the review addresses the ethical challenges faced by researchers in this area, particularly those related to the intersectional identities of the researchers themselves. The literature review draws on a diverse range of sources, including seminal works in political anthropology, critical security studies, and transnational feminism, to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on security regimes. The review concludes by identifying key areas for future research, including the need for more studies that explore the intersections of security, gender, and race in non-Western contexts, and the development of new methodologies that can capture the complex and dynamic nature of security regimes in the contemporary world.", "References": [{"title": "The Anthropology of Security: Perspectives from the Frontline", "authors": "Mark Maguire, Catarina Frois, Nils Zurawski", "journal": "Political and Legal Anthropology Review", "year": "2014", "volumes": "37", "first page": "1", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1111/plar.12053"}, {"title": "Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977–1978", "authors": "Michel Foucault", "journal": "Palgrave Macmillan", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1057/9780230245075"}, {"title": "Feminist Security Studies: A Narrative Approach", "authors": "Annick T.R.
