{"Literature Review": "The intersection of linguistic anthropology and the study of images presents a fertile ground for exploring the semiotic complexities of human communication. Historically, linguistic anthropology has primarily focused on language as its central object of study, often sidelining images. However, recent scholarship has begun to challenge this oversight, recognizing the integral role images play in discourse and social interaction. This literature review aims to chart the evolution of a linguistic anthropology of images, highlighting key theoretical advancements and their implications for understanding the semiotic interplay between language and image. The critique of structuralist approaches to language within linguistic anthropology has paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of images. Structuralism's reductionist view of language as a system of signs has been challenged by linguistic anthropologists who emphasize the performative, contextual, and perspectival dimensions of communication. This shift has introduced an analytic vocabulary that is equally applicable to the study of images, including concepts such as entextualization, performativity, perspective, and enregisterment. Entextualization, the process by which discourse is extracted from its original context and made into a text, has been instrumental in understanding how images circulate and acquire meaning across different contexts. Performativity, the capacity of signs to enact social realities, offers insights into the power of images to shape identities and social relations. Perspective, the situatedness of meaning-making, highlights the role of viewpoint in interpreting images. Enregisterment, the process by which linguistic forms become associated with particular social identities or contexts, provides a framework for analyzing how images come to signify specific cultural meanings. These concepts have been applied to the study of prototypic images, such as photographs, advertisements, and emojis, demonstrating their utility in analyzing the semiotic complexity of images. For instance, the entextualization of photographs in social media platforms illustrates how images are recontextualized and acquire new meanings. The performativity of advertisements reveals how images can construct consumer identities and desires. The perspective of emoji users sheds light on the cultural variability of image interpretation. The enregisterment of corporate logos exemplifies how images can become emblematic of brand identities. These studies underscore the inseparability of language and image in human communication, challenging any hard distinction between the two. The linguistic anthropology of images thus emerges as a field that not only enriches our understanding of images but also expands the horizons of linguistic anthropology itself. By embracing an open-ended horizon of objects and modes of inquiry, linguistic anthropology can continue to explore the semiotic richness of human communication, bridging the gap between language and image. This review concludes by envisioning a linguistic anthropology of…, a field characterized by its inclusivity and adaptability, capable of addressing the diverse semiotic landscapes of the contemporary world.", "References": [{"title": "Entextualization and the End of Discourse", "authors": "Richard Bauman, Charles L.
