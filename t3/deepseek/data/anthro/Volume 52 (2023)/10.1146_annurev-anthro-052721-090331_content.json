{"Literature Review": "Water is a fundamental element that bridges the environment, culture, and human biology, necessitating an integrative approach to fully understand its impacts. This literature review explores the advancements in understanding human water needs, thirst, and hydration strategies from a biocultural perspective, alongside a critical examination of water insecurity (WI) experiences and the coping mechanisms employed to mitigate its effects. The intersection of these factors and their influence on human biology is analyzed through the embodiment framework, highlighting the physiological and psychological outcomes of deviations from water needs and heightened WI. The review also considers the implications of lifestyle changes and climate change on water needs, WI, coping and hydration strategies, and their embodiment. Human water needs are intricately linked to physiological processes, with thirst serving as a primary mechanism for regulating water intake. Research by Popkin et al. (2010) underscores the importance of adequate hydration for maintaining health, emphasizing that even mild dehydration can impair cognitive function and physical performance. The biocultural perspective further reveals how cultural practices and environmental conditions shape hydration strategies, as demonstrated by studies in diverse populations (Wutich & Ragsdale, 2008). Water insecurity, defined as the lack of reliable access to sufficient, safe water, poses significant challenges to human health and well-being. The embodiment framework provides a lens through which the biological consequences of WI can be understood, illustrating how chronic water scarcity and poor water quality are internalized by the body, leading to a range of adverse health outcomes. Work by Jepson et al. (2017) highlights the psychological stress associated with WI, which can exacerbate mental health issues and contribute to a cycle of poverty and ill health. Coping strategies to mitigate WI, such as water storage and conservation practices, are critical for survival but can also have unintended health consequences. For instance, stored water may become contaminated, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases (Ercumen et al., 2017). The intersection of WI and coping strategies with human biology is evident in the areas of cellular damage, dehydration, nutrition, stress, mental health, cognitive impairment, aging-related effects, cardiometabolic health, and kidney function. Studies have shown that dehydration can lead to cellular damage and impair kidney function, while chronic stress from WI can accelerate aging and increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (Stookey et al., 2012; Rosinger et al., 2020). Furthermore, the nutritional impacts of WI, such as reduced food intake due to water scarcity, can exacerbate malnutrition and its associated health risks (Young et al., 2019). The role of climate change and lifestyle changes in exacerbating WI and altering water needs cannot be overlooked. Climate change is expected to intensify water scarcity in many regions, further challenging human biology and health (Gleick, 2014). Lifestyle changes, including increased urbanization and dietary shifts, also influence water consumption patterns and needs, necessitating adaptive strategies to ensure water security and health (Vörösmarty et al., 2010). In conclusion, an integrative approach that considers the environmental, cultural, and biological dimensions of water is essential for understanding its impact on human biology. The embodiment framework offers valuable insights into the complex interplay between water needs, WI, coping strategies, and health outcomes. Addressing the challenges posed by WI and ensuring access to safe, sufficient water are critical for promoting human health and well-being in the face of global environmental changes.", "References": [{"title": "Water, hydration, and health", "authors": "Barry M.
