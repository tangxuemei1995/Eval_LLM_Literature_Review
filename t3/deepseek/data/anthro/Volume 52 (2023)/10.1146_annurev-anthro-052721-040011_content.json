{"Literature Review": "Critical University Studies (CUS) represents an interdisciplinary field that critically examines the structures, practices, and ideologies of higher education, particularly in relation to their historical and contemporary entanglements with national and global institutions, political movements, and social inequalities. This literature review synthesizes key contributions to CUS, focusing on its origins, theoretical underpinnings, and its implications for disciplines such as anthropology, with a particular emphasis on decolonization, abolition, and Black studies. The origins of CUS can be traced back to the critical examination of the American university's foundations in the slave trade, racial science, and projects of Native American ethnic cleansing. Scholars such as Wilder (2013) have meticulously documented how the financial and intellectual capital of early American universities was directly tied to the economies of slavery and colonialism, laying bare the racialized and imperial underpinnings of higher education. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding the persistent structures of inequality within universities today. Building on this historical critique, CUS scholars have adopted abolitionist and decolonial stances to challenge the university's role in perpetuating state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. Moten and Harney (2013) argue that the university is complicit in the reproduction of social hierarchies and the marginalization of Black and Indigenous peoples, calling for a radical reimagining of higher education that centers on abolition and decolonization. This call has resonated with scholars across disciplines, leading to a growing body of work that seeks to dismantle the structures of Western/white superiority that underpin the university. In the field of anthropology, CUS has prompted a critical reevaluation of the discipline's complicity in colonial and imperial projects. Simpson (2014) highlights how anthropology has historically served as a tool of empire, producing knowledge that legitimizes the domination of non-Western peoples. She advocates for an antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology that challenges the discipline's institutionalization within the university and its alignment with state interests. This critique is echoed by other scholars who call for the decolonization of anthropology, both in terms of its theoretical frameworks and its institutional practices. The emerging field of abolitionist anthropology represents a significant intervention in this regard, drawing on the principles of CUS to advocate for the dismantling of carceral and settler logics within the discipline and the university more broadly. Abolitionist anthropology seeks to create spaces for alternative forms of knowledge production that are rooted in the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities. This includes a commitment to participatory research methods, the centering of Black and Indigenous voices, and the development of pedagogical practices that challenge the reproduction of social inequalities. The implications of CUS for higher education are profound, calling for a radical transformation of the university as an institution. This includes not only the decolonization of curricula and research practices but also the reimagining of the university's role in society. Scholars such as Tuck and Yang (2012) argue that decolonization must go beyond symbolic gestures to address the material and structural inequalities that sustain the university's complicity in colonial and imperial projects. This requires a commitment to redistributive justice, the recognition of Indigenous sovereignty, and the creation of spaces for alternative epistemologies and ontologies. In conclusion, Critical University Studies offers a powerful framework for interrogating the structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions, political movements, and social inequalities. By drawing on the insights of abolitionist and decolonial scholarship, CUS challenges the university to confront its historical and contemporary complicity in the reproduction of social hierarchies and to imagine new possibilities for higher education that are rooted in justice, equity, and liberation.", "References": [{"title": "Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled History of America's Universities", "authors": "Craig Steven Wilder", "journal": "Bloomsbury Press", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study", "authors": "Fred Moten, Stefano Harney", "journal": "Minor Compositions", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across the Borders of Settler States", "authors": "Audra Simpson", "journal": "Duke University Press", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Decolonization is not a metaphor", "authors": "Eve Tuck, K.
