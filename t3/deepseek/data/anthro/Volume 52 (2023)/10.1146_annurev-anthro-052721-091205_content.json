{"Literature Review": "The intersection of social movements, power, and mediated visibility has become a focal point for anthropological and ethnographic research, particularly in the context of the 21st century's rapidly evolving media landscape. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to explore how visual media serves as a battleground for social movements, states, and corporations, each vying for control over narratives and visibility in the digital age. The production, circulation, and consumption of media are not merely technical processes but are deeply embedded in the fabric of social organization and political economy, offering insights into alternative visions for political futures. Social movements have increasingly leveraged visual media to challenge hegemonic power structures, employing strategies of visibility to mobilize support, articulate grievances, and envision alternative social orders. Studies have shown that the strategic use of visual media by social movements can disrupt dominant narratives, creating spaces for counter-hegemonic discourse (Castells, 2012; Juris, 2008). However, the mediated visibility of social movements is not without its challenges. The same platforms that amplify their messages can also be co-opted by states and corporations to surveil, suppress, or commodify dissent (Andrejevic, 2007; Fuchs, 2014). The role of states in shaping mediated visibility is complex, as they oscillate between facilitating and restricting access to media platforms. On one hand, states may support media initiatives that align with national interests or public diplomacy goals. On the other hand, they may impose censorship or surveillance to control the narrative and suppress opposition (Couldry & Hepp, 2017; Morozov, 2011). Corporations, particularly tech giants, play a pivotal role in the mediated visibility of social movements. Through algorithms and content moderation policies, these corporations influence what content is seen and by whom, often prioritizing profit over public interest (Gillespie, 2018; Zuboff, 2019). This corporate control over visibility raises questions about the democratization of media and the potential for tech platforms to serve as public spheres. The anthropological study of media, by examining these dynamics, offers critical insights into the power relations that shape our media environment. Ethnographic research has highlighted the agency of media producers and consumers in navigating these power structures, revealing the creative strategies employed to contest or circumvent control (Postill, 2018; Turner, 2010). Furthermore, the study of media production, circulation, and consumption provides a lens through which to understand broader social and cultural transformations, including the rise of networked social movements and the globalization of media cultures (Appadurai, 1996; Bennett & Segerberg, 2012). In conclusion, the anthropological and ethnographic study of media, social movements, and hegemonic power offers a rich framework for understanding the complexities of mediated visibility in the 21st century. By bringing together these fields, scholars can develop a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by our current media environment, contributing to a more robust understanding of our political, social, and cultural futures.", "References": [{"title": "Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age", "authors": "Manuel Castells", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Performing Politics: Image, Embodiment, and Affective Solidarity during Anti-Corporate Globalization Protests", "authors": "Jeffrey S.
