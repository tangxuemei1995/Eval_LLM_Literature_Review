{"Literature Review": "The discourse on decolonizing museums has gained significant momentum over the past few decades, reflecting a broader societal push towards acknowledging and rectifying historical injustices. This literature review explores the evolution of museum decolonization, with a particular focus on the care of Native North American heritage, and situates these efforts within a global context. The review begins by examining the theoretical underpinnings and practical initiatives that have shaped the decolonization movement in museums, followed by an analysis of the challenges and opportunities in representing Native American cultures, and concludes with a discussion on the role of tribal museums in advancing decolonization and indigenization efforts. The 1990s marked a pivotal moment in the critique of ethnographic museums, with scholars and activists calling for a reevaluation of the ways in which Indigenous cultures were represented and managed within these institutions. This period saw the emergence of a critical literature that questioned the ethics of collecting and displaying Indigenous artifacts, often acquired under colonial conditions (Smith, 1999). The passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990 represented a significant legislative step towards addressing some of these concerns, mandating the return of human remains and sacred objects to Native American tribes (Fine-Dare, 2002). However, the implementation of NAGPRA has been fraught with challenges, highlighting the complexities of decolonizing museum practices (Colwell-Chanthaphonh, 2009). In the realm of representation, scholars have critiqued the ways in which Native American cultures have been portrayed in museum exhibits, often through a colonial lens that perpetuates stereotypes and erases Indigenous agency (Lonetree, 2012). Efforts to involve Native American communities in the curation and interpretation of their own heritage have emerged as a key strategy for challenging these narratives, fostering more equitable and collaborative relationships between museums and Indigenous peoples (Phillips, 2011). The rise of tribal museums represents a significant development in the decolonization of museum practices, offering spaces where Native American communities can control the representation and care of their cultural heritage (Isaac, 2007). These institutions not only challenge the authority of traditional museums but also contribute to the broader project of indigenizing museum practices, integrating Indigenous knowledge systems and values into the museum context (Lonetree & Cobb, 2008). The literature on museum decolonization also highlights the importance of international perspectives, drawing parallels between the experiences of Native North American communities and Indigenous peoples in other parts of the world (Harrison, 2013). Comparative studies have revealed common challenges and strategies in the decolonization of museums, underscoring the global nature of this movement (Peers & Brown, 2003). As the field continues to evolve, there is a growing recognition of the need for paradigm shifts in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums, moving towards more inclusive and equitable practices that respect Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination (Simpson, 2014). In conclusion, the literature on decolonizing museums reflects a dynamic and ongoing process of critical reflection and transformation. By examining the trajectory of decolonization efforts, particularly in relation to Native North American heritage, this review underscores the importance of collaborative approaches, the role of tribal museums, and the need for a global perspective in advancing the decolonization and indigenization of museum practices.", "References": [{"title": "Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples", "authors": "Linda Tuhiwai Smith", "journal": "Zed Books", "year": "1999", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Grave Injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA", "authors": "Kathleen S.
