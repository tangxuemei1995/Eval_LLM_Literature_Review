{"Literature Review": "The study of algorithms within social science has increasingly become a focal point of interdisciplinary research, bridging the gap between computational sciences and social theories. The concept of 'algorithmic ecologies' offers a novel framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of algorithms in society. This literature review synthesizes existing research across five modalities of algorithmic ecologies: imaginaries, infrastructures, interfaces, identities, and investments and interests, as outlined in the abstract. The exploration begins with the notion of social imaginaries, where algorithms are not merely technical entities but are deeply embedded in the cultural and social fabric. Studies have shown how algorithms shape and are shaped by societal expectations and norms, creating a reciprocal relationship between technology and society (Gillespie, 2014). This reciprocal relationship is further complicated by the infrastructural dimension of algorithms, which highlights the physical and organizational structures that support algorithmic operations. Research by Star and Ruhleder (1996) emphasizes the importance of understanding infrastructure as a relational concept, which becomes visible upon breakdown, thus offering insights into the often invisible workings of algorithms. The interface modality brings attention to the points of interaction between users and algorithms, where the design and functionality of interfaces can significantly influence user behavior and perceptions. As Bucher (2012) argues, interfaces act as a critical site for the negotiation of power and control in algorithmic systems. Moving to the identities modality, the literature reveals how algorithms contribute to the construction and reinforcement of social identities. Cheney-Lippold (2011) discusses how algorithmic categorization and profiling can lead to the reification of social categories, impacting individuals' self-perception and societal roles. Lastly, the investments and interests modality examines the economic and political dimensions of algorithms, where the development and deployment of algorithms are driven by specific agendas and power dynamics. Zuboff's (2019) work on surveillance capitalism illustrates how algorithms are instrumental in the commodification of personal data, highlighting the intertwined nature of technology, economy, and power. Together, these modalities offer a comprehensive framework for studying algorithms as part of broader ecologies, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches that consider the technical, social, and ethical dimensions of algorithms in society.", "References": [{"title": "The Relevance of Algorithms", "authors": "Tarleton Gillespie", "journal": "Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Materiality, and Society", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "167", "last page": "194", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262525374.003.0009"}, {"title": "Steps Toward an Ecology of Infrastructure: Design and Access for Large Information Spaces", "authors": "Susan Leigh Star, Karen Ruhleder", "journal": "Information Systems Research", "year": "1996", "volumes": "7", "first page": "111", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1287/isre.7.1.111"}, {"title": "Want to be on the top?
