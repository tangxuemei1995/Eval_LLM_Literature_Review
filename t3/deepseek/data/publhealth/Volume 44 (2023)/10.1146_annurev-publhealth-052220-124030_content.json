{"Literature Review": "The burden of cancer globally is significantly influenced by modifiable risk factors, which, if controlled, could potentially reduce the incidence of cancer. The concept of the population attributable fraction (PAF) is crucial in understanding the proportion of cancer cases that could be prevented by eliminating or reducing exposure to these risk factors. This literature review explores the associations between various modifiable risk factors and cancer, highlighting both successful interventions and areas where prevention efforts remain suboptimal. Tobacco smoking is the most well-established modifiable risk factor for cancer, responsible for a significant proportion of lung cancer cases worldwide. Studies have shown that smoking cessation can lead to a substantial reduction in the risk of developing lung cancer, with the benefits increasing the longer a person remains smoke-free (Doll et al., 2004). Occupational exposures to carcinogens, such as asbestos and benzene, have also been linked to increased cancer risk. Despite regulations aimed at reducing exposure, certain industries still pose significant risks to workers (Rushton et al., 2012). Infections, particularly those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori, are another modifiable risk factor for cancer. Vaccination against HPV has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of cervical and other HPV-related cancers (Schiller et al., 2012). Air pollution, both outdoor and indoor, has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for lung cancer. Efforts to reduce air pollution, such as the implementation of stricter emission standards, have the potential to decrease the cancer burden attributable to this factor (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013). Alcohol consumption is a well-documented risk factor for several types of cancer, including liver, breast, and esophageal cancer. Public health campaigns aimed at reducing alcohol consumption could have a significant impact on cancer prevention (Bagnardi et al., 2015). Diet and obesity are complex risk factors that influence cancer risk through multiple mechanisms. The consumption of processed and red meats has been linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer, while obesity is associated with a higher risk of several cancers, including breast and endometrial cancer (World Cancer Research Fund, 2018). Despite the clear evidence linking these modifiable risk factors to cancer, prevention efforts face numerous challenges, including economic, social, and political barriers. The success of cancer prevention strategies depends on a multifaceted approach that includes public health interventions, policy changes, and individual behavior modifications. Continued research is essential to better understand the avoidable causes of cancer and to develop more effective prevention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors", "authors": "Richard Doll, Richard Peto, Jillian Boreham, Isabelle Sutherland", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "2004", "volumes": "328", "first page": "1519", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.38142.554479.AE"}, {"title": "Occupational cancer in Britain.
