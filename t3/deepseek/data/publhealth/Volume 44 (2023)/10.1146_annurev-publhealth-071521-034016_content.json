{"Literature Review": "Mass incarceration in the United States represents a significant public health crisis, deeply intertwined with historical injustices and systemic inequalities. The roots of mass incarceration can be traced back to the enslavement of African Americans and the genocide and displacement of Indigenous peoples, laying the groundwork for a system that disproportionately affects these communities today (Alexander, 2010). This system is perpetuated by a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors, including labor exploitation, racial discrimination, and the criminalization of immigration and behavioral health issues (Western & Pettit, 2010).\n\nThe health implications of mass incarceration are profound, with prisons serving as sites where chronic, communicable, and behavioral health conditions are both created and exacerbated. Incarcerated individuals face significantly higher rates of infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis compared to the general population (Binswanger et al., 2009). Mental health disorders and substance use disorders are also prevalent among this population, often worsened by the conditions of confinement and the lack of adequate healthcare services (Fazel & Seewald, 2012).\n\nAddressing the public health crises within prisons requires a multifaceted approach that includes improving healthcare access and quality, implementing harm reduction strategies, and addressing the social determinants of health that contribute to incarceration (Wang et al., 2013). Decarceral solutions, such as reducing the prison population through sentencing reform, increasing the use of alternatives to incarceration, and investing in community-based health and social services, are critical to mitigating the health impacts of mass incarceration (Cloud et al., 2014).\n\nPublic health scholars, practitioners, and activists play a crucial role in advocating for policies and interventions that promote the health and dignity of incarcerated individuals. This includes conducting research to better understand the health needs of this population, developing and evaluating interventions to address these needs, and advocating for systemic changes that reduce reliance on incarceration (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, mass incarceration is a significant driver of health inequalities in the United States, with deep historical roots and far-reaching health implications. Addressing this crisis requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving healthcare within prisons, implementing decarceral strategies, and addressing the underlying social determinants of health. Public health professionals have a critical role to play in this effort, through research, advocacy, and the development of interventions that promote the health and well-being of incarcerated individuals (Wildeman & Wang, 2017).", "References": [{"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Incarceration & social inequality", "authors": "Bruce Western, Becky Pettit", "journal": "Daedalus", "year": "2010", "volumes": "139", "first page": "8", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1162/daed.2010.139.3.8"}, {"title": "Infectious disease and the criminal justice system", "authors": "Ingrid A.
