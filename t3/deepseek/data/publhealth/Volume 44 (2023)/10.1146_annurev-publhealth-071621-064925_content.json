{"Literature Review": "Environmental Justice (EJ) has emerged as a critical framework for understanding and addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities. This literature review explores the evolution of EJ, its coalitional strategies, its engagement with formal institutions, and the scientific findings it has influenced, concluding with future directions for the field.\\n\\nEJ originated in the 1980s as a response to the siting of hazardous waste facilities in predominantly African American communities in the United States. Early studies, such as the United Church of Christ's 1987 report, empirically demonstrated the correlation between race and the location of toxic waste sites, laying the groundwork for the EJ movement (United Church of Christ, 1987). This movement has since expanded to address a wide range of environmental injustices, including air and water pollution, climate change, and access to green spaces, affecting various marginalized groups globally.\\n\\nA key characteristic of EJ activism is its coalitional and 'inside-outside' orientation. EJ activists have formed alliances with a diverse array of stakeholders, including labor unions, indigenous groups, and environmental organizations, to amplify their impact. These coalitions leverage the strengths of each partner, combining grassroots mobilization with policy advocacy to effect change. However, as Pellow (2016) notes, these alliances must navigate the tension between radical activism and engagement with formal institutions, a challenge that has shaped the movement's strategies and outcomes.\\n\\nThe engagement of EJ activists with formal institutions, particularly the courts and regulatory agencies, has been a critical avenue for advancing environmental justice claims. Legal strategies have sought to enforce existing environmental laws and challenge discriminatory practices, with mixed success. Cole and Foster (2001) highlight the limitations of the legal system in addressing systemic environmental injustices, pointing to the need for broader structural reforms. Regulatory agencies, on the other hand, have increasingly incorporated EJ principles into their decision-making processes, though critics argue that these efforts often fall short of addressing the root causes of environmental inequality.\\n\\nScientific research has been profoundly influenced by EJ, with studies increasingly focusing on the environmental determinants of health disparities. Research has documented the disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities to environmental hazards and the resulting health impacts, such as higher rates of asthma, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Morello-Frosch and Lopez (2006) emphasize the importance of integrating EJ perspectives into environmental health research to better understand and address these disparities.\\n\\nLooking to the future, the EJ movement faces several challenges and opportunities. The changing nature of EJ coalitions, including the growing involvement of youth and international actors, presents new possibilities for activism. However, fragmentation within the EJ movement and with other fields, such as climate justice and public health, poses a risk to its coherence and effectiveness. Additionally, there is a need for deeper engagement with the historical roots of environmental injustice, including colonialism and capitalism, to inform more transformative solutions. Finally, the infusion of the EJ lens into broader policy and research agendas offers a pathway for addressing environmental inequalities at a systemic level.\\n\\nIn conclusion, EJ has made significant strides in highlighting and addressing environmental injustices, but much work remains to be done. By continuing to build coalitions, engage with formal institutions, influence scientific research, and explore new directions, the EJ movement can contribute to a more just and sustainable future.", "References": [{"title": "Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States: A National Report on the Racial and Socio-Economic Characteristics of Communities with Hazardous Waste Sites", "authors": "United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice", "journal": "", "year": "1987", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Environmental Justice and the Politics of Difference", "authors": "David Naguib Pellow", "journal": "Annual Review of Sociology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "42", "first page": "221", "last page": "240", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074230"}, {"title": "From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement", "authors": "Luke W.
