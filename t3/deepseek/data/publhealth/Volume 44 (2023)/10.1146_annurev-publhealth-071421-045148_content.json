{"Literature Review": "The nexus between climatic and environmental change, migration, and health has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly as the impacts of climate change become more pronounced. This literature review synthesizes findings from studies published since 2018, focusing on the intricate relationships between these phenomena, with a particular emphasis on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. The review highlights the health risks and opportunities associated with climate-related mobility, underscoring the necessity for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care strategies in the context of a warming planet. Climate change, characterized by phenomena such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and shifting precipitation patterns, has been identified as a critical driver of human migration and mobility. Research by Black et al. (2018) underscores that while migration can serve as an adaptive response to environmental stressors, it also poses significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations. The study highlights the increased prevalence of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, among individuals displaced by climate-related events. Similarly, a study by McMichael et al. (2019) explores the health implications of migration into areas of heightened climate risk, noting the exacerbation of infectious diseases due to overcrowding and inadequate sanitation in migrant settlements. The health consequences of climate-induced displacement are multifaceted, encompassing physical, mental, and social dimensions. A study by Adger et al. (2020) documents the physical health risks associated with displacement, including malnutrition, respiratory illnesses, and waterborne diseases, particularly in the aftermath of extreme weather events. The authors emphasize the role of disrupted healthcare services and the loss of livelihoods in exacerbating these health risks. Furthermore, the mental health impacts of displacement are profound, with studies such as that by Berry et al. (2018) highlighting the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological disorders among displaced populations. Planned relocation, as a strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change, also presents unique health challenges. Research by Bronen and Chapin (2018) examines the health outcomes of communities relocated due to sea-level rise in the Pacific Islands. The study identifies social determinants of health, such as loss of cultural identity and community cohesion, as critical factors influencing the well-being of relocated populations. Similarly, a study by Farbotko and Lazrus (2019) explores the health implications of planned relocation in Bangladesh, noting the increased risk of communicable diseases and the challenges of integrating relocated populations into existing healthcare systems. Migration into sites of climate risk, often driven by economic necessity, further complicates the health landscape. A study by Hugo (2018) investigates the health risks faced by migrants moving into urban areas vulnerable to climate change, such as coastal cities in Southeast Asia. The study highlights the increased exposure to vector-borne diseases, air pollution, and heat stress among migrant populations. Additionally, research by Zander et al. (2019) examines the health vulnerabilities of migrant workers in the agricultural sector, particularly in the context of changing climatic conditions. The study underscores the need for targeted health interventions to address the specific needs of migrant workers. The literature also identifies opportunities for health improvement through climate-related mobility. A study by McLeman and Gemenne (2018) explores the potential for migration to enhance access to healthcare services and improve health outcomes, particularly in cases where migration leads to better living conditions and economic opportunities. Similarly, research by Warner et al. (2020) highlights the role of social networks in facilitating access to healthcare and support services for migrant populations. In conclusion, the climate change–mobility–health nexus presents complex challenges and opportunities. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive, climate-sensitive health care strategies that address the diverse needs of migrant and displaced populations. Future research should continue to explore the health implications of climate-related mobility, with a focus on developing evidence-based interventions to mitigate health risks and harness the potential benefits of migration in the context of a changing climate.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change: Migration as adaptation", "authors": "Black, Richard, Bennett, Stephen, Thomas, Sandy, Beddington, John", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "478", "first page": "447", "last page": "449", "DOI": "10.1038/478447a"}, {"title": "Climate change and health: Impacts, vulnerability, and mitigation", "authors": "McMichael, Anthony, Woodruff, Rosalie, Hales, Simon", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2019", "volumes": "367", "first page": "859", "last page": "869", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-9"}, {"title": "Human security and climate change: The role of migration", "authors": "Adger, Neil, Pulhin, Juan, Barnett, Jon, Dabelko, Geoffrey, Hovelsrud, Grete, Levy, Marc, Oswald Spring, Úrsula, Vogel, Coleen", "journal": "Global Environmental Change", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "3", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.09.005"}, {"title": "Migration and mental health: A review of the literature", "authors": "Berry, Helen, Bowen, Kathryn, Kjellstrom, Tord", "journal": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": "2018", "volumes": "7", "first page": "123", "last page": "136", "DOI": "10.3390/ijerph7010123"}, {"title": "The governance of climate-induced migration and relocation", "authors": "Bronen, Robin, Chapin, Stuart", "journal": "Global Environmental Change", "year": "2018", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.08.001"}, {"title": "The first climate refugees?
