{"Literature Review": "Nutrition plays a pivotal role in health outcomes across the lifespan, influencing pregnancy outcomes, childhood development, healthy aging, and the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Despite its significance, assessing dietary intake accurately remains a formidable challenge in population sciences research due to the complexity of the US and global food supplies, the shift in eating patterns towards meals consumed away from home, and the myriad combinations of food ingredients. These complexities not only complicate dietary assessment but also the establishment of clear links between diet and health, posing challenges for both research and public health policy and practice. Most studies in nutritional epidemiology rely on self-report instruments, which are susceptible to both random and systematic measurement errors, further complicating the accurate assessment of dietary intake. To address these challenges, scientific advancements have focused on the development of nutritional biomarkers. These biomarkers serve as objective measures of dietary intake and can be used either as stand-alone nutritional exposures or to calibrate self-reported dietary data using specialized statistical techniques such as regression calibration. Nutritional biomarkers offer a promising avenue for reducing measurement error and enhancing the accuracy of dietary assessment in population sciences research. The application of these biomarkers, alongside traditional dietary assessment methods, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between diet and health, thereby informing more effective public health interventions and policies. Despite the potential of nutritional biomarkers, their application in population sciences research is still evolving, and further research is needed to fully realize their potential in enhancing the capacity for food and nutrient intake assessment.", "References": [{"title": "Nutritional biomarkers in the study of aging", "authors": "Simone A.
