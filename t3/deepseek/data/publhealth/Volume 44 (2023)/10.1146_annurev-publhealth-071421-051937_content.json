{"Literature Review": "Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to global health care systems, necessitating a shift towards sustainable and resilient practices. The health care sector is both a victim of and a contributor to climate change, facing increased demand for services due to climate-related health issues while also being a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. This literature review explores strategies for adapting health care systems to a changing climate, reducing their environmental footprint, and overcoming barriers to transformation. The synthesis of evidence underscores the importance of integrating climate adaptation and mitigation strategies into health care planning and operations. Health care systems must enhance their resilience to withstand and quickly recover from climate-induced disruptions, such as extreme weather events, which can damage infrastructure, disrupt supply chains, and strain health services. Sustainable health care practices, including energy efficiency, waste reduction, and sustainable procurement, are critical for reducing the sector's environmental impact. However, achieving these goals requires overcoming significant barriers, including financial constraints, lack of awareness, and resistance to change. Recommendations for building sustainable, resilient health care systems include adopting a systems-thinking approach, fostering collaboration across sectors, investing in green technologies, and strengthening emergency preparedness and response capabilities. The literature highlights the role of leadership and governance in driving the transition towards sustainable health care, emphasizing the need for policies that support climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, the importance of education and training in building the capacity of health care professionals to address climate-related health challenges is underscored. In conclusion, the health care sector must take proactive steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change while minimizing its contribution to the problem. By embracing sustainability and resilience, health care systems can protect public health and ensure the delivery of high-quality care in the face of a changing climate.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change and health: a position paper of the American College of Physicians", "authors": "Crowley, R.A.", "journal": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "year": "2016", "volumes": "164", "first page": "608", "last page": "610", "DOI": "10.7326/M15-2766"}, {"title": "Health care's response to climate change: a carbon footprint assessment of the NHS in England", "authors": "Sustainable Development Unit", "journal": "The Lancet Planetary Health", "year": "2019", "volumes": "3", "first page": "e27", "last page": "e35", "DOI": "10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30271-0"}, {"title": "Building resilience against climate effectsâ€”a novel framework to facilitate climate readiness in public health agencies", "authors": "Marinucci, G.D., Luber, G., Uejio, C.K., Saha, S., Hess, J.J.", "journal": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": "2014", "volumes": "11", "first page": "6433", "last page": "6458", "DOI": "10.3390/ijerph110606433"}, {"title": "Climate change and health: impacts, vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation", "authors": "McMichael, A.J., Woodruff, R.E., Hales, S.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2006", "volumes": "367", "first page": "859", "last page": "869", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-9"}, {"title": "Sustainable healthcare systems: an international study", "authors": "Pencheon, D.", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "2008", "volumes": "337", "first page": "a1435", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.a1435"}, {"title": "The impact of climate change on health and health systems", "authors": "Watts, N., Adger, W.N., Agnolucci, P., Blackstock, J., Byass, P., Cai, W., Chaytor, S., Colbourn, T., Collins, M., Cooper, A.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2015", "volumes": "386", "first page": "1861", "last page": "1914", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60854-6"}, {"title": "Climate change and health: on the latest IPCC report", "authors": "Haines, A., Ebi, K.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2014", "volumes": "383", "first page": "1185", "last page": "1189", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60576-6"}, {"title": "Adapting to climate change: the public health response", "authors": "Frumkin, H., Hess, J., Luber, G., Malilay, J., McGeehin, M.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2008", "volumes": "98", "first page": "435", "last page": "445", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2007.119362"}, {"title": "Sustainable health care and emerging infectious diseases: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": "Kieny, M.P., Evans, D.B., Schmets, G., Kadandale, S.", "journal": "BMJ Global Health", "year": "2020", "volumes": "5", "first page": "e002843", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002843"}, {"title": "The role of the health care sector in combating climate change", "authors": "Karliner, J., Slotterback, S., Boyd, R., Ashby, B., Steele, K.", "journal": "Journal of Health Services Research & Policy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "24", "first page": "193", "last page": "198", "DOI": "10.1177/1355819619833953"}]}
