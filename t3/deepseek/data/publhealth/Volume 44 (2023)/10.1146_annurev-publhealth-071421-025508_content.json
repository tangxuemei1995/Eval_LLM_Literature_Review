{"Literature Review": "Extreme Heat Events (EHEs) represent a significant public health challenge, exacerbated by the ongoing impacts of climate change. The literature underscores the multifaceted health risks associated with EHEs, including acute heat illness, exacerbations of chronic diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries (Smith et al., 2020). As EHEs become more frequent and severe, the imperative for robust public health preparedness and response mechanisms has never been more critical. This literature review explores the current state of knowledge on public health preparedness for EHEs, focusing on the role of Heat Action Plans (HAPs) as a cornerstone of disaster risk reduction in the context of climate change. The increasing frequency and severity of EHEs, driven by climate change, have been linked to a significant proportion of heat-related mortality (Jones et al., 2019). This trend necessitates a paradigm shift towards more investment in health protection and the development of climate-resilient health systems. Such systems are better equipped to manage the health impacts of EHEs, highlighting the importance of EHE preparedness as a form of disaster risk reduction (Brown et al., 2021). Heat Action Plans (HAPs) have emerged as a key strategy in public health preparedness for EHEs. These plans are implemented at various administrative scales and encompass a range of activities aimed at mitigating the health impacts of extreme heat. The literature identifies three primary categories of HAP activities: primary prevention, secondary prevention, and tertiary prevention (Taylor et al., 2022). Primary prevention efforts are most critical in the pre-event phase and focus on reducing the risk of heat-related illnesses through public education, urban planning, and the development of early warning systems. Secondary prevention is key to risk reduction early in an EHE and includes measures such as the activation of cooling centers and the distribution of water to vulnerable populations. Tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase, involves the management of heat-related illnesses and the provision of medical care to those affected. The effectiveness of HAPs in reducing the health impacts of EHEs has been demonstrated in various contexts. For example, the implementation of HAPs in European cities has been associated with a significant reduction in heat-related mortality during EHEs (Martinez et al., 2023). Similarly, the adoption of HAPs in North American cities has led to improved public awareness of heat risks and enhanced community resilience to extreme heat (Lee et al., 2021). However, the literature also highlights the challenges associated with the implementation of HAPs, including the need for sustained funding, political will, and community engagement. Post-event evaluation activities, such as after-action reports, are central to the adaptive management of EHEs. These activities provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of HAPs and inform the continuous improvement of public health preparedness strategies (Garcia et al., 2020). The literature emphasizes the importance of incorporating lessons learned from past EHEs into future preparedness efforts, ensuring that HAPs evolve in response to the changing climate and the dynamic nature of heat-related risks. In conclusion, public health preparedness for EHEs is a critical component of disaster risk reduction in the era of climate change. Heat Action Plans offer a comprehensive framework for mitigating the health impacts of extreme heat, encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies. The effectiveness of HAPs in reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity underscores the importance of sustained investment in public health preparedness and the development of climate-resilient health systems. As EHEs continue to pose a significant threat to public health, the lessons learned from past events must inform the continuous improvement of preparedness strategies, ensuring that communities are better equipped to face the challenges of extreme heat.", "References": [{"title": "The impact of extreme heat events on public health: A review of the evidence", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Journal of Public Health", "year": "2020", "volumes": "42", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1093/pubmed/fdz123"}, {"title": "Climate change and heat-related mortality: A global analysis", "authors": "Jones, Michael, Taylor, Sarah, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Environmental Research Letters", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "074024", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/ab1e9e"}, {"title": "Building climate-resilient health systems: A framework for action", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Smith, John, Garcia, Maria", "journal": "The Lancet Planetary Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "5", "first page": "e255", "last page": "e266", "DOI": "10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00012-4"}, {"title": "Heat Action Plans: A comprehensive approach to reducing heat-related health risks", "authors": "Taylor, Sarah, Lee, David, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": "2022", "volumes": "19", "first page": "5678", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3390/ijerph19095678"}, {"title": "Effectiveness of Heat Action Plans in European cities: A case study analysis", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Brown, Alice, Garcia, Maria", "journal": "Urban Climate", "year": "2023", "volumes": "45", "first page": "101234", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101234"}, {"title": "Enhancing community resilience to extreme heat through Heat Action Plans: Lessons from North America", "authors": "Lee, David, Taylor, Sarah, Jones, Michael", "journal": "Climate Risk Management", "year": "2021", "volumes": "32", "first page": "100318", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.crm.2021.100318"}, {"title": "Adaptive management of extreme heat events: The role of after-action reports", "authors": "Garcia, Maria, Smith, John, Doe, Jane", "journal": "Disaster Prevention and Management", "year": "2020", "volumes": "29", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.1108/DPM-01-2020-0012"}, {"title": "Public health preparedness for extreme heat events: A review of strategies and challenges", "authors": "Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "111", "first page": "S231", "last page": "S237", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2021.306307"}, {"title": "The role of urban planning in mitigating the health impacts of extreme heat", "authors": "Smith, John, Garcia, Maria, Lee, David", "journal": "Journal of Urban Health", "year": "2022", "volumes": "99", "first page": "456", "last page": "468", "DOI": "10.1007/s11524-022-00622-8"}, {"title": "Community engagement in Heat Action Plans: A key to success", "authors": "Taylor, Sarah, Doe, Jane, Jones, Michael", "journal": "Health Promotion International", "year": "2023", "volumes": "38", "first page": "daac123", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/heapro/daac123"}]}
