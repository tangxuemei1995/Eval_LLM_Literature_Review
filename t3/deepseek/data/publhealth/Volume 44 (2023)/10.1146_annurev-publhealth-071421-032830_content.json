{"Literature Review": "The United States public health workforce has faced significant challenges over the past two decades, exacerbated by the Great Recession of 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic. This literature review synthesizes evidence on the ongoing challenges and future directions for the US public health workforce, focusing on enumeration, recruitment, retention, workforce development, and training. The public health workforce is critical for protecting the public's health and responding to emergencies, yet it has been under considerable strain. Between the Great Recession and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US state and local governmental public health workforce lost 40,000 jobs, with tens of thousands more leaving during the pandemic. This review highlights the persistent challenges in the field and the importance of addressing these issues to rebuild the workforce effectively. One of the primary challenges in the public health workforce is the lack of a standardized method for enumeration and definition. The field struggles to accurately count and define the governmental public health workforce, which complicates efforts to assess workforce needs and plan for future demands. This issue has been highlighted in several studies, emphasizing the need for a unified approach to workforce enumeration to better understand and address workforce gaps. Recruitment and retention of public health workers have also been significant challenges. The public health sector competes with other industries for talent, often at a disadvantage due to lower salaries and limited career advancement opportunities. Studies have shown that the public health workforce is aging, with a significant portion nearing retirement, further exacerbating the recruitment and retention challenges. Workforce development and training are critical components of addressing these challenges. The public health field requires a workforce that is not only sufficient in numbers but also skilled in a wide range of competencies to respond to public health emergencies and protect the public's health. However, studies have identified gaps in training and professional development opportunities, which hinder the workforce's ability to adapt to emerging public health challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of a robust public health workforce and the need for significant investments in workforce development. Temporary federal investments are being made to replenish the workforce, but sustainable solutions are needed to address the underlying challenges. This includes not only increasing funding but also implementing strategies to improve recruitment, retention, and training. In conclusion, the US public health workforce faces ongoing challenges that have been exacerbated by recent crises. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving workforce enumeration, enhancing recruitment and retention strategies, and investing in workforce development and training. By learning from past challenges and implementing targeted interventions, it is possible to rebuild the public health workforce and ensure it is equipped to protect the public's health and respond to future emergencies.", "References": [{"title": "The Public Health Workforce: Enumeration 2000", "authors": "Kristine M.
