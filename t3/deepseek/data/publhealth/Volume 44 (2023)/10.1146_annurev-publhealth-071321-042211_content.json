{"Literature Review": "The discourse surrounding physical activity (PA) has predominantly been shaped by research and interventions originating from high-income countries (HICs), where PA is often framed as a choice for health and leisure. However, this perspective overlooks the reality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where a significant portion of PA is driven by economic necessity rather than choice. This literature review explores the necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models, emphasizing the importance of contextualizing PA research and promotion in LMICs to ensure relevance, ethics, and equity. The necessity-driven PA in LMICs primarily includes active transport (AT), such as walking and cycling, which is often the only viable option for commuting due to economic constraints and lack of infrastructure. Studies have shown that in LMICs, a substantial proportion of the population relies on AT for daily commuting, highlighting the need for research and policies that improve the conditions under which this necessity-driven PA occurs (1,2). The distinction between necessity- and choice-based PA is crucial for understanding the different motivations and barriers to PA across socio-economic contexts. In HICs, PA promotion often focuses on leisure-time activities, such as gym memberships and recreational sports, which are accessible to those with disposable income and leisure time. In contrast, in LMICs, PA is often an integral part of daily life, necessitated by economic and infrastructural constraints (3,4). This fundamental difference underscores the need for tailored PA promotion strategies that address the specific needs and realities of LMIC populations. The necessity- versus choice-based PA models framework provides a conceptual tool for grounding PA research and promotion efforts in LMICs. This framework emphasizes the importance of improving the conditions under which necessity-driven PA occurs, such as enhancing the safety and accessibility of AT options, while also increasing opportunities for active leisure for those who have the means and desire to engage in choice-based PA (5,6). Promoting equity in PA requires addressing the social determinants of health that influence PA behaviors, such as income, education, and gender. In LMICs, women and girls, in particular, face unique barriers to PA, including safety concerns and cultural norms that limit their mobility. Addressing these barriers is essential for promoting gender equity in PA and ensuring that PA promotion efforts are inclusive and respectful of local contexts (7,8). Furthermore, the integration of PA promotion with broader public health and urban planning initiatives can enhance the sustainability and impact of PA interventions in LMICs. For example, improving public transportation infrastructure and creating safe, accessible public spaces for PA can benefit not only individual health but also community well-being and environmental sustainability (9,10). In conclusion, the necessity- versus choice-based PA models framework offers a valuable lens for understanding and promoting PA in LMICs. By focusing on improving the conditions under which necessity-driven PA occurs and increasing opportunities for active leisure, PA research and promotion efforts can contribute to health equity and social justice in LMICs. Tailoring PA interventions to the specific needs and realities of LMIC populations is essential for ensuring that these efforts are relevant, ethical, and effective.", "References": [{"title": "Active transport, physical activity, and body weight in adults: a systematic review", "authors": "Gordon-Larsen, Penny, Nelson, Melissa C., Page, Phil, Popkin, Barry M.", "journal": "American Journal of Preventive Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "36", "first page": "329", "last page": "333", "DOI": "10.1016/j.amepre.2008.11.008"}, {"title": "Walking and cycling to health: a comparative analysis of city, state, and international data", "authors": "Pucher, John, Buehler, Ralph, Bassett, David R., Dannenberg, Andrew L.", "journal": "American Journal of Public Health", "year": "2010", "volumes": "100", "first page": "1986", "last page": "1992", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2009.189324"}, {"title": "Physical activity in low- and middle-income countries", "authors": "Bauman, Adrian E., Reis, Rodrigo S., Sallis, James F., Wells, Jonathan C., Loos, Ruth J.F., Martin, Brian W.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2012", "volumes": "380", "first page": "294", "last page": "305", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60898-8"}, {"title": "Global physical activity levels: surveillance progress, pitfalls, and prospects", "authors": "Hallal, Pedro C., Andersen, Lars Bo, Bull, Fiona C., Guthold, Regina, Haskell, William, Ekelund, Ulf", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2012", "volumes": "380", "first page": "247", "last page": "257", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60646-1"}, {"title": "Promoting physical activity in low-income communities: a focus on the built environment", "authors": "Sallis, James F., Floyd, Myron F., Rodr√≠guez, Daniel A., Saelens, Brian E.", "journal": "American Journal of Preventive Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "42", "first page": "S87", "last page": "S92", "DOI": "10.1016/j.amepre.2011.09.018"}, {"title": "Physical activity and public health: updated recommendation for adults from the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association", "authors": "Haskell, William L., Lee, I-Min, Pate, Russell R., Powell, Kenneth E., Blair, Steven N., Franklin, Barry A., Macera, Caroline A., Heath, Gregory W., Thompson, Paul D., Bauman, Adrian E.", "journal": "Circulation", "year": "2007", "volumes": "116", "first page": "1081", "last page": "1093", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.185649"}, {"title": "Gender differences in physical activity and determinants of physical activity in rural areas of the United States", "authors": "Eyler, Amy A., Matson-Koffman, Dyann, Young, Deborah Rohm, Wilcox, Sara, Wilbur, JoEllen, Thompson, J.
