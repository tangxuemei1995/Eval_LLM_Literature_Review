{"Literature Review": "The relationship between housing quality and health outcomes has been extensively documented in the literature, with a consensus that substandard housing conditions contribute significantly to health disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has underscored the importance of housing quality in its guidelines, emphasizing interventions that mitigate exposure to extreme temperatures, injuries, and other environmental hazards (World Health Organization, 2018). The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical role of adequate ventilation in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, thereby reinforcing the need for stringent housing standards (Morawska & Milton, 2020). Despite the availability of robust evidence supporting the health benefits of high-quality housing, the implementation and monitoring of housing standards remain inconsistent globally, exacerbating health inequalities among vulnerable populations (Thomson et al., 2013). Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and low-income individuals are disproportionately affected by poor housing conditions, which compound existing social and economic disadvantages (Krieger & Higgins, 2002). Community-based initiatives aimed at improving housing quality have shown promise in mitigating these disparities, particularly for children and older adults, who are more susceptible to housing-related illnesses (Howden-Chapman et al., 2007). The health and well-being of residents in public and subsidized housing have garnered renewed attention from policymakers and researchers, given the higher prevalence of avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries in these populations (Bonnefoy, 2007). Enhancing the quality of both new and existing housing, along with neighborhood improvements, offers multiple co-benefits, including reductions in carbon emissions and improvements in overall community health (Wilkinson et al., 2009). The integration of health considerations into housing policy and practice is essential for addressing the root causes of health inequalities and promoting equitable health outcomes (Marmot et al., 2010). In conclusion, the evidence underscores the critical importance of housing quality as a determinant of health and well-being, with significant implications for public health policy and practice. Addressing housing-related health disparities requires a multifaceted approach that includes the enforcement of housing standards, targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, and the promotion of sustainable housing practices.", "References": [{"title": "WHO Housing and health guidelines", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "World Health Organization", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19", "authors": "Lidia Morawska, Donald K.
