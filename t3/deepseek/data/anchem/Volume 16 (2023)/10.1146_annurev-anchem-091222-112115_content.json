{"Literature Review": "The determination of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in water samples presents significant challenges in environmental analytical chemistry, necessitating robust validation strategies to ensure the reliability and accuracy of analytical methods. This literature review focuses on the application of gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), including high-resolution MS, for the analysis of OMPs, with an emphasis on emerging contaminants and pesticides. The review critically examines current research practices, identifies key issues and analytical challenges, and proposes a framework for method validation and data reporting tailored to environmental analytical chemistry. The lack of specific guidelines for environmental analytical chemistry and the minimal regulation of OMPs in waters significantly impact method development, validation requirements, and application to samples. This underscores the need for standardized validation strategies that can be universally applied across different laboratories and studies. The review begins by discussing the importance of method validation in environmental analytical chemistry, highlighting the need for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity in the determination of OMPs. It then explores the application of GC-MS and LC-MS techniques, including high-resolution MS, for the wide-scope screening of OMPs in water samples. The review identifies key challenges in the analysis of OMPs, including matrix effects, the presence of co-eluting compounds, and the need for sensitive and selective detection methods. It also discusses the importance of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures in ensuring the reliability of analytical results. The review concludes by proposing a framework for method validation and data reporting in environmental analytical chemistry, emphasizing the need for standardized procedures, the use of reference materials, and the importance of inter-laboratory comparisons. This framework is intended to serve as a starting point for further discussion among specialists in environmental analytical chemistry, with the aim of improving the reliability and comparability of analytical results across different studies and laboratories.", "References": [{"title": "Challenges in the determination of emerging contaminants in aquatic environments", "authors": "Maria Farré, Damià Barceló", "journal": "TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2013", "volumes": "43", "first page": "37", "last page": "51", "DOI": "10.1016/j.trac.2012.12.010"}, {"title": "High-resolution mass spectrometry for the analysis of emerging contaminants in the environment", "authors": "Julian L.
