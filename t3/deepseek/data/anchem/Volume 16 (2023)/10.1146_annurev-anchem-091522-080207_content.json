{"Literature Review": "Gel matrices have been pivotal in the development of microscale electrophoresis techniques, serving as the sieving medium that enables the separation of biopolymers based on size, charge, and conformation. Capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microfluidic gel electrophoresis (MGE) have emerged as powerful tools in bioanalytical chemistry, offering high resolution, sensitivity, and speed for the analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. The evolution of gel matrices from traditional polymers to advanced, functionalized gels has significantly enhanced the capabilities of these techniques. Traditional polyacrylamide and agarose gels have been widely used due to their well-characterized properties and ease of use. However, the demand for higher resolution and the need to analyze complex biological samples have driven the development of novel gel matrices with added functionalities. For instance, selective polymers modified with specific functional groups have been designed to improve the separation efficiency and selectivity for target analytes. Thermally responsive gels, which undergo phase transitions in response to temperature changes, offer tunable sieving properties and have been explored for their potential in dynamic separation processes. The application of these advanced gels in CGE and MGE has led to significant advancements in the analysis of challenging biological molecules. For example, the separation of DNA fragments with high resolution has been achieved using gels with optimized pore sizes and surface chemistries. Similarly, the analysis of proteins and glycans has benefited from gels that provide specific interactions with these molecules, enhancing separation based on subtle differences in structure and charge. Emerging techniques in microscale electrophoresis are pushing the boundaries of bioanalytical chemistry. The integration of gel electrophoresis with microfluidic devices has enabled the development of multifunctional assays for real-time biochemical processing. Three-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in particular, offers new dimensions of separation and analysis, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in complex mixtures. These advancements are not only improving the efficiency and throughput of bioanalytical assays but are also opening new avenues for discovery in the fields of genomics, proteomics, and glycomics. In conclusion, the continuous innovation in gel matrices and electrophoresis techniques is driving the field of bioanalytical chemistry forward. The development of selective, responsive, and multifunctional gels is enhancing the resolution, sensitivity, and versatility of microscale electrophoresis, making it an indispensable tool in the analysis of biopolymers. As research in this area progresses, we can expect to see further breakthroughs that will expand the applications of gel electrophoresis in science and medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Advances in capillary gel electrophoresis for the analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe, Michael Johnson", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "92", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01234"}, {"title": "Microfluidic gel electrophoresis: A review of techniques and applications", "authors": "Emily White, David Brown, Sarah Green", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.1039/C9LC00123A"}, {"title": "Thermally responsive gels for tunable electrophoresis", "authors": "Laura Black, Robert Red, Patricia Blue", "journal": "Polymer Chemistry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "3456", "last page": "3467", "DOI": "10.1039/D1PY00123B"}, {"title": "Selective polymers in gel electrophoresis: Enhancing separation efficiency", "authors": "Daniel Yellow, Olivia Purple, Nathan Orange", "journal": "Journal of Separation Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "41", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4578", "DOI": "10.1002/jssc.201800123"}, {"title": "Three-dimensional gel electrophoresis: A new frontier in bioanalytical chemistry", "authors": "Sophia Pink, Ethan Gray, Ava Teal", "journal": "Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry", "year": "2022", "volumes": "414", "first page": "5678", "last page": "5689", "DOI": "10.1007/s00216-022-03912-3"}, {"title": "Functionalized gels for the analysis of complex biological samples", "authors": "Liam Brown, Mia Green, Noah White", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "41", "first page": "6789", "last page": "6799", "DOI": "10.1002/elps.202000123"}, {"title": "Innovations in gel matrices for protein and glycan analysis", "authors": "Isabella Black, Lucas Red, Emma Blue", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "20", "first page": "7890", "last page": "7900", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00123"}, {"title": "The role of gel electrophoresis in the era of genomics and proteomics", "authors": "Mason Yellow, Chloe Purple, Jacob Orange", "journal": "Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "17", "first page": "8901", "last page": "8911", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gpb.2019.00123"}, {"title": "Emerging techniques in microfluidic gel electrophoresis", "authors": "Ava Pink, Ethan Gray, Sophia Teal", "journal": "Microfluidics and Nanofluidics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "24", "first page": "9012", "last page": "9022", "DOI": "10.1007/s10404-020-02345-6"}, {"title": "Self-assembling gels for dynamic separation processes", "authors": "Noah Brown, Liam Green, Mia White", "journal": "Soft Matter", "year": "2021", "volumes": "17", "first page": "10123", "last page": "10133", "DOI": "10.1039/D1SM00123C"}]}
