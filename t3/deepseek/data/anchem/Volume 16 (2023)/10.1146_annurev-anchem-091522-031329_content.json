{"Literature Review": "The advent of next-generation ion mobility (IM) technology has significantly enhanced the analytical capabilities in the field of biomolecular research. This literature review focuses on the integration of high-resolution and multidimensional IM with mass spectrometry (MS) for the analysis of complex biomolecules, including glycans, lipids, peptides, and proteins. The synergy between IM and MS has opened new avenues for molecular identification and structural elucidation, offering unprecedented depth in biomolecular analyses. Recent advancements in IM technology have been driven by innovative instrument designs and the strategic application of electric fields, which have collectively improved the resolution and sensitivity of IM-MS analyses. These developments have been particularly impactful in the fields of glycomics, lipidomics, peptidomics, and proteomics, where the complexity and diversity of biomolecules present significant analytical challenges. High-resolution IM has enabled the separation of isomeric and isobaric species that were previously indistinguishable, providing deeper insights into the structural diversity of biomolecules. Multidimensional IM approaches, which combine multiple separation dimensions, have further enhanced the analytical power by increasing the peak capacity and selectivity of the analyses. This has been instrumental in the characterization of complex biological samples, where the simultaneous analysis of multiple analytes is often required. The application of next-generation IM technology to challenging biomolecular systems has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, the use of high-resolution IM-MS has facilitated the detailed analysis of glycan structures, revealing subtle differences in glycosylation patterns that are critical for understanding their biological functions. Similarly, in lipidomics, IM-MS has enabled the identification and quantification of lipid species with high specificity, contributing to a better understanding of lipid metabolism and signaling pathways. In peptidomics and proteomics, the combination of IM with MS has improved the identification of peptides and proteins, including post-translational modifications, by providing additional separation and structural information. The current strengths of next-generation IM technology lie in its ability to provide rapid, sensitive, and high-resolution analyses of complex biomolecules. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as the need for standardized protocols and the development of more robust data analysis tools. Future perspectives include the integration of IM with other analytical techniques, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, to further enhance the depth of biomolecular analyses. Additionally, the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in data analysis holds promise for the automated interpretation of complex IM-MS datasets. In conclusion, next-generation IM technology has significantly advanced the field of biomolecular research, offering new opportunities for the detailed analysis of complex biological systems. The continued innovation in IM instrumentation and methodologies is expected to further expand its applications and impact in the life sciences.", "References": [{"title": "High-resolution ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry for isomeric separation of prostanoids after Girard's reagent T derivatization", "authors": "May, J.
