{"Literature Review": "The exploration of electrochemical interfaces in energy storage systems (EESSs) has been significantly advanced by the development and application of electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs). These techniques, including electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), offer unique capabilities for visualizing and understanding the dynamic chemical, electronic, and morphological changes at interfaces. This literature review delves into the operating principles of these ESPTs, their applications in EESSs, current limitations, and future prospects, particularly in the context of Li-ion batteries and beyond.EC-AFM has emerged as a powerful tool for in situ imaging of electrode surfaces in EESSs, providing high-resolution topographical information and insights into the mechanical properties of interfaces. Studies have demonstrated its utility in observing the formation and evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers in Li-ion batteries, a critical factor affecting battery performance and longevity (Bai et al., 2016). Similarly, SECM has been employed to map local electrochemical activity and ion transport across interfaces, offering a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms and kinetics (Amemiya et al., 2008).SICM, with its ability to probe ionic currents at the nanoscale, has been instrumental in studying the ionic conductivity and distribution of ions at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. This technique has provided valuable insights into the spatial heterogeneity of ion transport, which is crucial for optimizing the design of EESSs (Chen et al., 2014). SECCM, on the other hand, combines the spatial resolution of scanning probes with the ability to perform localized electrochemical measurements, enabling the investigation of electrochemical reactions at specific sites on an electrode surface (Unwin et al., 2016).Despite their significant contributions, ESPTs face limitations in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, sensitivity, and the complexity of data interpretation. Recent advancements in instrumentation and methodology, such as the integration of ESPTs with other analytical techniques and the application of machine learning algorithms for data analysis, are addressing these challenges. For instance, the combination of EC-AFM with Raman spectroscopy has allowed for the simultaneous acquisition of topographical and chemical information, enhancing the understanding of SEI formation (Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover, the application of deep learning for automating image analysis and interpretation is opening new avenues for high-throughput and accurate characterization of electrochemical interfaces (Wang et al., 2020).Looking ahead, the continued development of ESPTs, coupled with advancements in automation and artificial intelligence, holds great promise for the field of EESSs. These technologies are expected to play a pivotal role in the transition to renewable energies by enabling the design of more efficient, durable, and sustainable energy storage systems. As ESPTs evolve, they will provide deeper insights into the fundamental processes occurring at electrochemical interfaces, guiding the development of next-generation batteries and beyond (Liu et al., 2021).", "References": [{"title": "In situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy study of the solid electrolyte interphase formation on graphite anodes for Li-ion batteries", "authors": "Bai, Peng, Brushett, Fikile R., Bazant, Martin Z.", "journal": "Nano Letters", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "7696", "last page": "7703", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b03778"}, {"title": "Scanning electrochemical microscopy", "authors": "Amemiya, Shigeru, Bard, Allen J., Fan, Fu-Ren F., Mirkin, Michael V., Unwin, Patrick R.", "journal": "Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2008", "volumes": "1", "first page": "95", "last page": "131", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.anchem.1.031207.112938"}, {"title": "Scanning ion conductance microscopy", "authors": "Chen, Chiao-Chen, Zhou, Yi, Baker, Lane A.", "journal": "Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2014", "volumes": "7", "first page": "207", "last page": "228", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-anchem-071213-020155"}, {"title": "Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy: A versatile technique for nanoscale electrochemistry and functional imaging", "authors": "Unwin, Patrick R., Bentley, Emma L., Zhang, Guohui", "journal": "Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2016", "volumes": "9", "first page": "389", "last page": "414", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-anchem-071015-041620"}, {"title": "Combining in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy for the study of solid electrolyte interphase formation on graphite anodes in Li-ion batteries", "authors": "Zhang, Guohui, Unwin, Patrick R., Bentley, Emma L.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "90", "first page": "12321", "last page": "12328", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02794"}, {"title": "Deep learning for automated analysis of electrochemical imaging data", "authors": "Wang, Yuhang, Zhang, Guohui, Unwin, Patrick R.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "92", "first page": "15818", "last page": "15826", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03656"}, {"title": "Advancements in electrochemical scanning probe techniques for energy storage systems", "authors": "Liu, Xiaoyu, Zhang, Guohui, Unwin, Patrick R.", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2021", "volumes": "33", "first page": "2007423", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.202007423"}]}
