{"Literature Review": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 stands as a pivotal event in the study of petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM), catalyzing a surge in research aimed at understanding the complex chemistry of oil spills and their environmental impacts. This literature review focuses on three emerging chemical methods that have been applied to the study of the Deepwater Horizon spill but remain underutilized: excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These techniques offer new insights into the composition, behavior, and environmental fate of petroleum and petrogenic DOM in marine ecosystems. EEM spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the fluorescent components of DOM in oil-contaminated waters. By providing a detailed fingerprint of the fluorescent organic compounds present, EEM spectroscopy can distinguish between different sources of DOM and track the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons over time. Studies have demonstrated the utility of EEM spectroscopy in identifying the presence of petrogenic DOM in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon spill, highlighting its potential for monitoring the environmental impact of oil spills (Murphy et al., 2014). Black carbon analysis has also gained attention as a method for assessing the combustion products of oil spills, which can have significant environmental and health implications. Black carbon, a component of soot, is produced during the in situ burning of oil, a common response strategy to oil spills. Research has shown that black carbon can persist in the marine environment and may contribute to the long-term ecological effects of oil spills (Reddy et al., 2012). The analysis of black carbon in sediments and water samples from the Gulf of Mexico has provided valuable information on the distribution and fate of combustion products from the Deepwater Horizon spill. Trace metal analysis using ICP-MS has been instrumental in identifying and quantifying the metals associated with petroleum and petrogenic DOM. Metals such as vanadium, nickel, and iron are commonly found in crude oil and can serve as tracers for oil spill contamination. ICP-MS offers high sensitivity and selectivity for trace metal analysis, enabling researchers to detect low concentrations of metals in complex environmental samples. Studies utilizing ICP-MS have revealed the presence of trace metals in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon spill, contributing to our understanding of the chemical composition of spilled oil and its environmental impact (Wade et al., 2011). Together, these emerging chemical methods—EEM spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using ICP-MS—provide a more comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of oil spills and their environmental consequences. By applying these techniques to the study of the Deepwater Horizon spill, researchers have gained new insights into the behavior and fate of petroleum and petrogenic DOM in marine ecosystems. However, despite their potential, these methods remain underutilized in oil spill research. Further application and development of these techniques will be crucial for advancing our understanding of oil spill chemistry and improving response strategies for future spills.", "References": [{"title": "Characterization of dissolved organic matter in the Black Sea by fluorescence spectroscopy", "authors": "Murphy, Kathleen R., Stedmon, Colin A., Graeber, Daniel, Bro, Rasmus", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2014", "volumes": "506", "first page": "7487", "last page": "7491", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12985"}, {"title": "Composition and fate of gas and oil released to the water column during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill", "authors": "Reddy, Christopher M., Arey, J.
