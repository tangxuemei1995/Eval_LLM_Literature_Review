{"Literature Review": "Direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have revolutionized the field of tissue analysis, offering unparalleled speed, chemical specificity, and analytical sensitivity. These advancements have paved the way for significant breakthroughs in clinical diagnostics, particularly in the characterization of diseases and the identification of new diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. This literature review delves into the recent developments and applications of direct MS technologies in health-related research, with a focus on their potential to accelerate clinical research and disease diagnosis, including oncological and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as microbial infections. The review primarily concentrates on the application of direct MS technologies for tissue analysis, encompassing MS imaging technologies for mapping spatial distributions of molecules in situ and handheld devices for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis. The integration of direct MS technologies into clinical workflows has the potential to guide treatment decisions by enabling the detection of clinically actionable molecular profiles from tissues and cells. MS imaging, a cornerstone of direct MS technologies, has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing the spatial distribution of molecules within tissue sections. This technique has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and in the discovery of biomarkers for various conditions. For instance, MS imaging has been applied to study the molecular landscape of cancer tissues, revealing insights into tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, MS imaging has facilitated the identification of molecular signatures associated with disease progression, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Ambient ionization techniques, another facet of direct MS technologies, have enabled the analysis of tissues in their native state, without the need for extensive sample preparation. These techniques have been particularly useful in the rapid identification of microbial infections, allowing for timely and targeted treatment strategies. The development of handheld MS-based devices represents a significant leap forward in the application of direct MS technologies for tissue analysis. These devices offer the promise of rapid, on-site analysis of tissues, with potential applications in surgical settings for real-time tissue characterization and margin assessment. The portability and ease of use of handheld MS devices could democratize access to advanced diagnostic tools, particularly in resource-limited settings. In conclusion, direct MS technologies hold immense promise for transforming tissue analysis in clinical research and diagnostics. By enabling the rapid and sensitive detection of molecular profiles from tissues, these technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to disease diagnosis and treatment. As research in this field continues to evolve, it is anticipated that direct MS technologies will play an increasingly central role in advancing personalized medicine and improving patient outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Mass spectrometry imaging in cancer research: future perspectives", "authors": "Richard R.
