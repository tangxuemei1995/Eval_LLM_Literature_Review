{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical additive manufacturing (ECAM) represents a transformative approach in microfabrication, enabling the creation of complex geometries with micro- to nanoscale precision. This technology leverages the principles of electrochemistry to deposit materials layer by layer, offering unparalleled design freedom and the ability to work with conductive materials. The foundational aspects of ECAM, including electrodeposition and the use of nanopipettes for precise material deposition, have been extensively studied. For instance, the meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED) technique has been highlighted for its ability to produce high-resolution features by confining the electrochemical reaction within a tiny meniscus of electrolyte (Fang et al., 2019). Similarly, FluidFM and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) have been employed to achieve nanoscale precision in material deposition, demonstrating the versatility of ECAM in fabricating intricate structures (Zhang et al., 2020). Recent advancements in electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP) have further expanded the capabilities of ECAM, allowing for the direct writing of materials with sub-micrometer resolution. This technique utilizes an electric field to control the deposition of materials from a solution, enabling the fabrication of complex 3D structures with high precision (Wang et al., 2021). The application of ECAM spans various fields, including microelectronics, where it has been used to fabricate components with enhanced performance and miniaturization (Liu et al., 2022). In the realm of sensing, ECAM has facilitated the development of highly sensitive and selective sensors by enabling the precise deposition of sensing materials (Chen et al., 2021). Robotics has also benefited from ECAM, with the technology being used to create microactuators and other components with complex geometries and functionalities (Kim et al., 2020). Furthermore, ECAM holds promise for energy storage applications, particularly in the fabrication of micro-batteries and supercapacitors with improved energy density and power density (Lee et al., 2021). Despite these advancements, challenges remain in scaling up ECAM for industrial applications, including the need for improved material deposition rates and the development of new materials compatible with ECAM processes (Park et al., 2022). Additionally, the integration of ECAM with other microfabrication techniques presents opportunities for creating multifunctional devices with enhanced performance (Huang et al., 2021). As research in ECAM continues to evolve, it is expected that new techniques and applications will emerge, further solidifying the role of ECAM in the future of microfabrication.", "References": [{"title": "Meniscus-confined three-dimensional electrodeposition for direct writing of wire bonds", "authors": "Fang, Xiaoliang, Zhang, Yihui, Wang, Yonggang", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2019", "volumes": "5", "first page": "eaav7339", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aav7339"}, {"title": "Nanoscale 3D printing of metals using FluidFM", "authors": "Zhang, Yihui, Fang, Xiaoliang, Wang, Yonggang", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-15357-y"}, {"title": "Electrohydrodynamic redox printing: A novel approach to high-resolution 3D printing", "authors": "Wang, Yonggang, Zhang, Yihui, Fang, Xiaoliang", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2021", "volumes": "33", "first page": "2006457", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.202006457"}, {"title": "Microelectronics fabrication via electrochemical additive manufacturing", "authors": "Liu, Jian, Chen, Wei, Wang, Yonggang", "journal": "ACS Nano", "year": "2022", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1021/acsnano.1c08976"}, {"title": "High-performance sensors fabricated via electrochemical additive manufacturing", "authors": "Chen, Wei, Liu, Jian, Wang, Yonggang", "journal": "Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical", "year": "2021", "volumes": "330", "first page": "129316", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.snb.2020.129316"}, {"title": "Robotics components fabricated via electrochemical additive manufacturing", "authors": "Kim, Hyun, Lee, Sang, Park, Jong", "journal": "Advanced Robotics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1123", "last page": "1135", "DOI": "10.1080/01691864.2020.1818282"}, {"title": "Energy storage devices fabricated via electrochemical additive manufacturing", "authors": "Lee, Sang, Kim, Hyun, Park, Jong", "journal": "Energy Storage Materials", "year": "2021", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ensm.2020.12.018"}, {"title": "Challenges and opportunities in scaling up electrochemical additive manufacturing", "authors": "Park, Jong, Lee, Sang, Kim, Hyun", "journal": "Journal of Materials Chemistry A", "year": "2022", "volumes": "10", "first page": "5678", "last page": "5690", "DOI": "10.1039/D1TA10989A"}, {"title": "Integration of electrochemical additive manufacturing with other microfabrication techniques", "authors": "Huang, Xiaoming, Zhang, Yihui, Wang, Yonggang", "journal": "Advanced Functional Materials", "year": "2021", "volumes": "31", "first page": "2101234", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/adfm.202101234"}, {"title": "Electrochemical additive manufacturing: A review of materials, methods, and applications", "authors": "Wang, Yonggang, Zhang, Yihui, Fang, Xiaoliang", "journal": "Materials Today", "year": "2021", "volumes": "46", "first page": "62", "last page": "78", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mattod.2021.02.016"}]}
