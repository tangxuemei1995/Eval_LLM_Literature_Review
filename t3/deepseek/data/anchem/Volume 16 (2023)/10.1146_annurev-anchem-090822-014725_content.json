{"Literature Review": "The advent of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) technology has revolutionized the field of biosensing, offering unprecedented precision, efficiency, and versatility in detecting a wide range of biomolecules. This literature review delves into the technical developments and application prospects of CRISPR-based biosensing strategies, focusing on their core biochemical properties, advancements in sensitivity and quantification, multiplex assays, one-pot assays, advanced sensors, and the challenges and opportunities in commercial applications. The CRISPR-Cas system, originally discovered as a bacterial immune defense mechanism, has been repurposed for biosensing due to its programmability, high specificity, and efficiency. These properties have facilitated the development of novel biosensing strategies for detecting nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules with remarkable accuracy and speed. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of optimizing reaction conditions, such as temperature and buffer composition, to enhance the performance of CRISPR-based assays. For instance, the use of thermostable Cas enzymes has enabled the development of assays that can operate at a wide range of temperatures, thereby expanding their applicability in diverse environments. Moreover, the programmability of CRISPR systems allows for the design of highly specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) that can target virtually any sequence of interest, enabling the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences with single-nucleotide resolution. This specificity is crucial for applications in pathogen detection, genetic screening, and molecular diagnostics. In addition to nucleic acid detection, CRISPR-based biosensors have been adapted for the detection of proteins and small molecules through the integration of aptamers or other recognition elements. These advancements have opened new avenues for the development of multiplex assays, where multiple targets can be detected simultaneously in a single reaction. The development of one-pot assays, which combine all necessary components in a single tube, has further simplified the workflow and reduced the risk of contamination, making CRISPR-based biosensing more accessible and user-friendly. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the commercial application of CRISPR detection technology. These include the need for improved sensitivity and quantification capabilities, the development of robust and scalable manufacturing processes, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks to ensure the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-based biosensors. However, the rapid pace of innovation in this field suggests that these challenges can be overcome, paving the way for the widespread adoption of CRISPR-based biosensing in various sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. In conclusion, CRISPR-based biosensing strategies represent a promising technology with the potential to transform the field of molecular diagnostics. By leveraging the unique properties of the CRISPR-Cas system, researchers have developed a wide range of biosensors that offer high specificity, efficiency, and versatility. Continued advancements in this field are expected to address the current limitations and unlock new opportunities for the application of CRISPR-based biosensing in diverse fields.", "References": [{"title": "CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity", "authors": "Janice S.
