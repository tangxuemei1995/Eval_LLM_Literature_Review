{"Literature Review": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of digital histopathology, offering a novel contrast mechanism that captures spatially resolved molecular vibrational spectra. This technology enables a comprehensive analysis of the chemical makeup and heterogeneity of biological tissues, presenting a significant advancement over traditional histopathological methods that rely on human examination of stained tissue morphologies. The integration of IR spectroscopic imaging with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is poised to revolutionize the practice of histopathology by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and objectivity. This literature review explores the instrumentation, data processing methods, and workflows in pathology associated with IR spectroscopic imaging, and proposes guidelines to standardize its application in histopathology. The development of IR imaging instrumentation tailored for histopathology has been a focal point of recent research. Advances in this area have led to the creation of systems capable of high-resolution, high-throughput imaging, essential for the detailed analysis required in histopathological studies. These systems leverage the unique chemical signatures of tissues, enabling the identification of disease markers at a molecular level. The performance of IR spectroscopic imaging systems has been extensively analyzed, with studies highlighting their potential to complement or even replace traditional staining methods in certain applications. The integration of AI, particularly ML and DL, into IR spectroscopic imaging data processing has opened new avenues for automated tissue analysis. ML algorithms have been developed to classify tissue types, identify pathological features, and predict disease outcomes based on IR spectral data. DL, with its ability to learn complex patterns from large datasets, has shown particular promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of these analyses. The application of these AI techniques to IR spectroscopic imaging data has the potential to significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise in histopathology, making diagnostic processes more objective and reproducible. Workflows in pathology incorporating IR spectroscopic imaging can be categorized based on the complexity of methods and the analytical performance required. These categories range from simple, rapid screening applications to complex, detailed analyses for research or diagnostic purposes. The development of standardized workflows is crucial for the widespread adoption of IR spectroscopic imaging in histopathology, ensuring consistency and reliability across different laboratories and studies. To address the diversity of approaches in this emerging field, a set of guidelines termed experimental and analytical specifications for spectroscopic imaging in histopathology has been proposed. These guidelines aim to standardize the application of IR spectroscopic imaging, covering aspects such as sample preparation, data acquisition, and analysis methods. By adhering to these specifications, researchers and clinicians can ensure that their work is reproducible, comparable, and of high quality, facilitating the integration of IR spectroscopic imaging into routine histopathological practice. In conclusion, IR spectroscopic imaging represents a transformative technology in digital histopathology, offering a novel approach to tissue analysis that complements traditional methods. The integration of AI techniques, particularly ML and DL, enhances the potential of IR spectroscopic imaging to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The development of standardized workflows and guidelines is essential for the widespread adoption of this technology, ensuring that it can be effectively integrated into routine histopathological practice. As research in this area continues to advance, IR spectroscopic imaging is set to play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and study of disease.", "References": [{"title": "Infrared spectroscopic imaging: Label-free biochemical analysis of tissue", "authors": "Rohit Bhargava, Ira W.
