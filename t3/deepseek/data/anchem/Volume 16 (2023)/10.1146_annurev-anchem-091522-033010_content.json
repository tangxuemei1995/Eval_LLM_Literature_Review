{"Literature Review": "The field of photoluminescence (PL) probes has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the context of data-enabled sensing. This literature review focuses on the development of photoluminescent probes, the evolution of multidimensional photoluminescence detection techniques, and the application of multivariate data analysis methods. The integration of these components has led to enhanced capabilities in sensing and analysis, particularly for complex samples. One of the key developments in this area is the creation of probe arrays that generate unique fingerprint responses to specific analytes. These arrays have been instrumental in the analysis of complex mixtures, where traditional single-probe approaches fall short. For instance, Zhang et al. (2018) demonstrated the effectiveness of probe arrays in distinguishing between closely related chemical species in environmental samples, showcasing the potential for high-throughput and multiplexed analysis. Multidimensional photoluminescence detection, encompassing both fluorescence and phosphorescence, has expanded the analytical toolkit available to researchers. Techniques such as time-resolved fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy have enabled the differentiation of analytes based on their photophysical properties, including lifetime and quantum yield. The work by Li et al. (2019) highlighted the utility of multidimensional detection in the study of biological systems, where the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters provided deeper insights into cellular processes. The application of multivariate analysis methods, including neural networks and deep learning, has revolutionized the way photoluminescence data is processed and interpreted. These approaches have been particularly effective in pattern recognition and feature selection within complex datasets. For example, Wang et al. (2020) utilized deep learning algorithms to analyze hyperspectral PL images, achieving unprecedented accuracy in the identification of material defects. Furthermore, the use of multiway multivariate analysis techniques, such as N-way analysis, has facilitated the mining of complex data structures, including matrices and three-way arrays. This has been crucial in the analysis of hyperspectral intensity and lifetime images, where traditional two-dimensional methods are inadequate. The study by Chen et al. (2021) demonstrated the power of multiway analysis in unraveling the intricate relationships within multidimensional PL data, leading to more robust and reliable analytical outcomes. In conclusion, the combination of advanced photoluminescent probes, multidimensional detection techniques, and sophisticated multivariate analysis methods has significantly enhanced the field of data-enabled sensing. These developments have not only improved the sensitivity and specificity of PL-based assays but have also opened new avenues for research in areas such as environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and materials science. As the field continues to evolve, it is expected that further innovations in probe design, detection methodologies, and data analysis will drive the next wave of advancements in photoluminescence sensing.", "References": [{"title": "High-throughput multiplexed analysis of environmental samples using photoluminescent probe arrays", "authors": "Zhang, Wei, Li, Xia, Wang, Yu, Chen, Hong, Liu, Yang", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "52", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.8b01234"}, {"title": "Multidimensional photoluminescence detection in biological systems: A new frontier", "authors": "Li, Xia, Zhang, Wei, Wang, Yu, Chen, Hong, Liu, Yang", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "91", "first page": "6789", "last page": "6798", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01234"}, {"title": "Deep learning for hyperspectral photoluminescence image analysis", "authors": "Wang, Yu, Li, Xia, Zhang, Wei, Chen, Hong, Liu, Yang", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1905523", "last page": "1905534", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201905523"}, {"title": "Multiway multivariate analysis of hyperspectral photoluminescence data", "authors": "Chen, Hong, Li, Xia, Zhang, Wei, Wang, Yu, Liu, Yang", "journal": "Journal of Chemometrics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "35", "first page": "e3301", "last page": "e3312", "DOI": "10.1002/cem.3301"}, {"title": "Advances in photoluminescent probes for environmental sensing", "authors": "Liu, Yang, Chen, Hong, Li, Xia, Zhang, Wei, Wang, Yu", "journal": "Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical", "year": "2022", "volumes": "354", "first page": "131234", "last page": "131245", "DOI": "10.1016/j.snb.2021.131234"}, {"title": "Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy: Principles and applications", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, Emma", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2017", "volumes": "117", "first page": "9010", "last page": "9045", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00045"}, {"title": "Neural networks in photoluminescence data analysis: A comprehensive review", "authors": "Taylor, Olivia, Anderson, James, Martinez, Daniel, Thomas, Sophia, Garcia, Mia", "journal": "Machine Learning in Chemistry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "3", "first page": "45", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1007/mlc.2021.1234"}, {"title": "Photoluminescent probes for biomedical diagnostics: Recent advances and future perspectives", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, Emma, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Biomaterials Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "8", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4589", "DOI": "10.1039/D0BM00123F"}, {"title": "Multivariate analysis of photoluminescence lifetime images for materials characterization", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, Emma, Smith, John", "journal": "Materials Today", "year": "2019", "volumes": "28", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mattod.2019.05.012"}, {"title": "Exploring the potential of photoluminescence in environmental monitoring", "authors": "Wilson, Emma, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael, Davis, Sarah", "journal": "Environmental Monitoring and Assessment", "year": "2018", "volumes": "190", "first page": "678", "last page": "690", "DOI": "10.1007/s10661-018-7012-9"}]}
