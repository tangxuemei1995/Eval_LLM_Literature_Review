{"Literature Review": "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) represent a significant health burden in tropical and subtropical regions, primarily affecting populations in developing countries. The challenges in diagnosing these diseases are compounded by the lack of access to modern laboratory facilities and the high cost of diagnostic equipment. In recent years, low-cost microfluidic systems have emerged as a promising solution for the rapid, affordable, and reliable detection of NTDs. This literature review focuses on the advancements in microfluidic technologies for the detection of NTDs, highlighting their potential to revolutionize point-of-care testing (POCT) in resource-limited settings. Microfluidic devices, characterized by their ability to manipulate small volumes of fluids, have been adapted for various diagnostic applications, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), immunochromatographic tests, and lateral flow assays. These devices offer several advantages, such as reduced reagent consumption, shorter analysis times, and the potential for multiplexing, which is crucial for the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. Paper-based microfluidics, in particular, has gained attention for its simplicity, low cost, and ease of use, making it an ideal platform for POCT in remote areas. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of paper-based devices in detecting diseases such as dengue, malaria, and schistosomiasis, with sensitivity and specificity comparable to traditional laboratory methods. The integration of smartphone technology with microfluidic devices has further enhanced their diagnostic capabilities, enabling the quantification of test results and the transmission of data to healthcare providers for remote diagnosis and monitoring. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of microfluidic systems for NTD detection. Issues such as the stability of reagents, the need for user-friendly designs, and the scalability of manufacturing processes need to be addressed to ensure the accessibility and affordability of these devices in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the development of standardized protocols and the validation of microfluidic devices in field conditions are essential for their acceptance by the global health community. In conclusion, low-cost microfluidic systems hold great promise for improving the diagnosis and management of NTDs in developing countries. Continued research and innovation in this field are crucial for overcoming the existing challenges and realizing the full potential of microfluidic technologies in global health.", "References": [{"title": "Paper-based microfluidic point-of-care diagnostic devices", "authors": "George M.
