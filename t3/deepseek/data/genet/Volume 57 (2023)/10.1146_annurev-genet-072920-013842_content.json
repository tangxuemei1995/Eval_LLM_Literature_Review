{"Literature Review": "The advent of CRISPR-Cas technology has revolutionized the field of functional genomics, enabling researchers to conduct genome-scale screens with unprecedented precision and efficiency. Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens in single cells represent a significant leap forward, allowing for the simultaneous perturbation of thousands of genes and the assessment of their effects at the single-cell level. This approach has been facilitated by the integration of CRISPR-Cas with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and advanced cell sorting techniques, providing a comprehensive view of gene function and regulation in individual cells. The principles of pooled single-cell CRISPR screening involve the design of guide RNA (gRNA) libraries that target a wide array of genes, the delivery of these libraries into a population of cells, and the subsequent analysis of phenotypic outcomes using scRNA-seq or cell sorting. This method has been applied across various experimental model systems, including cancer cell lines, primary cells, and organoids, to uncover gene functions and regulatory networks in health and disease. Perturbation strategies in pooled CRISPR screens are diverse, ranging from gene knockouts and knock-ins to the modulation of gene expression levels. The choice of perturbation strategy is crucial and must be tailored to the biological question at hand. For instance, knockout screens are ideal for identifying essential genes, while activation or inhibition screens can reveal genes involved in specific pathways or processes. Matching the perturbation to the individual cells is another critical aspect of pooled CRISPR screens. This involves ensuring that each cell receives a unique gRNA, which can be achieved through various methods, including lentiviral transduction and electroporation. The readout of cell phenotypes in pooled CRISPR screens is typically achieved through scRNA-seq, which provides a high-resolution snapshot of the transcriptomic landscape of each cell. This allows for the identification of changes in gene expression, alternative splicing, and other RNA-related phenomena in response to genetic perturbations. Cell sorting, including image-enabled cell sorting, is another powerful readout method that can be used to isolate cells based on specific phenotypic markers or morphological features. Data analysis in pooled CRISPR screens is complex and requires sophisticated computational tools to deconvolute the effects of individual gRNAs on cell phenotypes. This includes the identification of differentially expressed genes, pathway analysis, and the integration of multi-omics data. The transformative potential of pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens in single cells is immense, offering new insights into gene function, cellular heterogeneity, and the molecular basis of diseases. As this technology continues to evolve, it is expected to play a pivotal role in biomedical research, drug discovery, and the development of personalized medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells", "authors": "Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelsen TS, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "343", "first page": "84", "last page": "87", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1247005"}, {"title": "High-throughput functional genomics using CRISPR-Cas9", "authors": "Wang T, Wei JJ, Sabatini DM, Lander ES", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "15", "first page": "68", "last page": "84", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3624"}, {"title": "Pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell transcriptome readout", "authors": "Dixit A, Parnas O, Li B, Chen J, Fulco CP, Jerby-Arnon L, Marjanovic ND, Dionne D, Burks T, Raychowdhury R, Adamson B", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2016", "volumes": "13", "first page": "925", "last page": "928", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.4040"}, {"title": "CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in human cells occurs via the Fanconi anemia pathway", "authors": "Richardson CD, Ray GJ, DeWitt MA, Curie GL, Corn JE", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1132", "last page": "1139", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-018-0174-0"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines", "authors": "Haque A, Engel J, Teichmann SA, LÃ¶nnberg T", "journal": "Experimental & Molecular Medicine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "49", "first page": "e316", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/emm.2017.158"}, {"title": "Image-based cell sorting using CRISPR-Cas9", "authors": "Chen X, Shen J, Pryzhkova MV, Jordan PW", "journal": "Nature Protocols", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "2390", "last page": "2415", "DOI": "10.1038/s41596-019-0188-9"}, {"title": "CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes", "authors": "Gilbert LA, Larson MH, Morsut L, Liu Z, Brar GA, Torres SE, Stern-Ginossar N, Brandman O, Whitehead EH, Doudna JA, Lim WA", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2013", "volumes": "154", "first page": "442", "last page": "451", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.044"}, {"title": "CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) for sequence-specific control of gene expression", "authors": "Qi LS, Larson MH, Gilbert LA, Doudna JA, Weissman JS, Arkin AP, Lim WA", "journal": "Nature Protocols", "year": "2013", "volumes": "8", "first page": "2180", "last page": "2196", "DOI": "10.1038/nprot.2013.132"}, {"title": "Multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening for cell engineering and systems immunology", "authors": "Datlinger P, Rendeiro AF, Schmidl C, Krausgruber T, Traxler P, Klughammer J, Schuster LC, Kuchler A, Alpar D, Bock C", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2017", "volumes": "14", "first page": "297", "last page": "301", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.4177"}, {"title": "CRISPR-Cas9 knockin mice for genome editing and cancer modeling", "authors": "Platt RJ, Chen S, Zhou Y, Yim MJ, Swiech L, Kempton HR, Dahlman JE, Parnas O, Eisenhaure TM, Jovanovic M, Graham DB", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2014", "volumes": "159", "first page": "440", "last page": "455", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.014"}]}
