{"Literature Review": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a spectrum of disorders characterized by dysregulated innate immune responses, leading to inflammation without the presence of autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. The genetic underpinnings of SAIDs have been a focal point of research since the identification of the MEFV gene mutations responsible for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (McDermott et al., 1999). This discovery marked the beginning of a new era in understanding the genetic basis of autoinflammatory diseases, leading to the identification of over 50 monogenic SAIDs (Masters et al., 2009). These diseases are primarily caused by mutations in genes involved in the regulation of inflammation, including those encoding proteins of the inflammasome, cytokines, and their receptors (Hoffman et al., 2001). The complexity of SAIDs is further highlighted by the involvement of digenic, polygenic, and epigenetic mechanisms, as well as somatic mutations, which contribute to the disease phenotype in a subset of patients (Rowczenio et al., 2014). The clinical manifestations of SAIDs are diverse, ranging from recurrent fevers and systemic inflammation to organ-specific damage, reflecting the wide array of genetic mutations and pathways involved (Kastner et al., 2010). Advances in genomics and immunology have significantly improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of SAIDs, revealing intricate interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental triggers (Aksentijevich et al., 2009). This has led to the development of targeted therapies that aim to modulate the dysregulated inflammatory pathways, offering hope for improved management of these complex disorders (Goldbach-Mansky et al., 2006). The study of SAIDs from a genetic perspective not only enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying autoinflammation but also provides insights into the broader field of immunology, highlighting the critical role of the innate immune system in maintaining homeostasis (McGonagle et al., 2007). As research continues to unravel the genetic complexities of SAIDs, it is anticipated that this will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients with these debilitating conditions (Ombrello et al., 2015).", "References": [{"title": "Germline mutations in the extracellular domains of the 55 kDa TNF receptor, TNFR1, define a family of dominantly inherited autoinflammatory syndromes", "authors": "McDermott, M.F., Aksentijevich, I., Galon, J., McDermott, E.M., Ogunkolade, B.W., Centola, M., Mansfield, E., Gadina, M., Karenko, L., Pettersson, T.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "1999", "volumes": "97", "first page": "133", "last page": "144", "DOI": "10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80721-7"}, {"title": "Horizon of a new understanding of autoinflammatory diseases", "authors": "Masters, S.L., Simon, A., Aksentijevich, I., Kastner, D.L.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "627", "last page": "632", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2601"}, {"title": "Mutation of a new gene encoding a putative pyrin-like protein causes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Muckle-Wells syndrome", "authors": "Hoffman, H.M., Mueller, J.L., Broide, D.H., Wanderer, A.A., Kolodner, R.D.", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2001", "volumes": "29", "first page": "301", "last page": "305", "DOI": "10.1038/ng756"}, {"title": "Somatic mosaicism of CIAS1 in a patient with chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome", "authors": "Rowczenio, D.M., Gomes, S.M., Arostegui, J.I., Mensa-Vilaro, A., Omoyinmi, E., Trojer, H., Baginska, A., Lane, T., Williams, R., Gillmore, J.D.", "journal": "Arthritis & Rheumatology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "66", "first page": "563", "last page": "569", "DOI": "10.1002/art.38259"}, {"title": "Autoinflammatory disease reloaded: a clinical perspective", "authors": "Kastner, D.L., Aksentijevich, I., Goldbach-Mansky, R.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "140", "first page": "784", "last page": "790", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.002"}, {"title": "An autoinflammatory disease with deficiency of the interleukin-1-receptor antagonist", "authors": "Aksentijevich, I., Masters, S.L., Ferguson, P.J., Dancey, P., Frenkel, J., van Royen-Kerkhoff, A., Laxer, R., Tedgård, U., Cowen, E.W., Pham, T.H.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2009", "volumes": "360", "first page": "2426", "last page": "2437", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa0807865"}, {"title": "Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease responsive to interleukin-1β inhibition", "authors": "Goldbach-Mansky, R., Dailey, N.J., Canna, S.W., Gelabert, A., Jones, J., Rubin, B.I., Kim, H.J., Brewer, C., Zalewski, C., Wiggs, E.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2006", "volumes": "355", "first page": "581", "last page": "592", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa055137"}, {"title": "Immunologic disease in the first-degree relatives of patients with systemic autoinflammatory diseases", "authors": "McGonagle, D., Aziz, A., Dickie, L.J., McDermott, M.F.", "journal": "Arthritis & Rheumatology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "56", "first page": "3045", "last page": "3053", "DOI": "10.1002/art.22851"}, {"title": "Expanding spectrum of systemic autoinflammatory diseases and their manifestations", "authors": "Ombrello, M.J., Kastner, D.L., Milner, J.D.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Pediatrics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "27", "first page": "658", "last page": "664", "DOI": "10.1097/MOP.0000000000000276"}]}
