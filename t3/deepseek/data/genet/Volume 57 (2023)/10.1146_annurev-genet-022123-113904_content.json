{"Literature Review": "The interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change represents a complex and escalating challenge to global health. The origins of antibiotic resistance genes trace back to natural environments, long before the therapeutic use of antibiotics. However, the current AMR crisis is largely driven by anthropogenic activities, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine, agriculture, and animal husbandry, which have significantly accelerated the evolution and spread of resistant pathogens (Davies & Davies, 2010). This crisis is further exacerbated by global environmental changes, such as climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction, which impose additional selective pressures on microbial communities, facilitating the emergence and dissemination of AMR (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2018).\n\nClimate change, in particular, has been identified as a critical factor influencing the dynamics of AMR. Rising temperatures can enhance the growth rates of bacteria and the horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes, thereby increasing the prevalence of resistant strains (MacFadden et al., 2018). Moreover, extreme weather events, such as floods and hurricanes, can lead to the contamination of water sources with resistant bacteria and antibiotics, further promoting the spread of AMR (Baker-Austin et al., 2018).\n\nPollution, especially from pharmaceutical and agricultural runoff, contributes significantly to the environmental burden of AMR. Antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents released into the environment can select for resistant bacteria, while heavy metals and biocides can co-select for resistance, even in the absence of antibiotics (Martinez, 2009). Urbanization and habitat destruction also play a role by altering microbial ecosystems and increasing human exposure to novel pathogens and resistance genes (Allen et al., 2010).\n\nThe interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, often referred to as the One Health approach, is crucial for understanding and addressing the AMR crisis. This approach recognizes that the health of humans is closely linked to the health of animals and the environment and emphasizes the need for integrated, multidisciplinary strategies to combat AMR (Robinson et al., 2016).\n\nEfforts to mitigate the impact of AMR in the context of global environmental change include the development of new antibiotics, the implementation of stewardship programs to optimize the use of existing antibiotics, and the reduction of environmental contamination with antimicrobial agents and resistant bacteria (Ventola, 2015). Additionally, addressing the root causes of climate change and environmental degradation is essential for reducing the selective pressures that drive the evolution of AMR (Laxminarayan et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, the AMR crisis is a multifaceted problem that is deeply intertwined with global environmental change. Addressing this crisis requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between human activities, microbial ecosystems, and environmental factors. By adopting a One Health approach and implementing integrated strategies to reduce the use of antibiotics, mitigate environmental contamination, and combat climate change, it may be possible to curb the ongoing crisis of AMR and protect global health for future generations.", "References": [{"title": "Origins and evolution of antibiotic resistance", "authors": "Davies, Julian, Davies, Dorothy", "journal": "Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews", "year": "2010", "volumes": "74", "first page": "417", "last page": "433", "DOI": "10.1128/MMBR.00016-10"}, {"title": "Environmental factors influencing the development and spread of antibiotic resistance", "authors": "Bengtsson-Palme, Johan, Kristiansson, Erik, Larsson, D.G.
