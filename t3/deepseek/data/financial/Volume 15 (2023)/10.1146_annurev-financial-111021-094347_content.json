{"Literature Review": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a pivotal area of interest within the corporate and investment communities, reflecting a broader societal shift towards sustainability and ethical business practices. This literature review synthesizes existing research to explore whether shareholder interest in CSR is motivated by pecuniary gains, such as abnormal rates of return, or nonpecuniary motives, including the willingness to sacrifice returns to address firm externalities. Through an examination of seven key tests—costs of capital, performance of portfolios, ownership by types of institutions, surveys and experiments, managerial motives, shareholder proposals, and firm inclusion in responsibility indices—this review predominantly finds that shareholders are driven by nonpecuniary motives. Furthermore, it assesses the implications of these findings for global warming, particularly in terms of the foregone returns for shareholders willing to reduce carbon emissions (greeniums) and the wealth pledged to firms that become sustainable, in relation to the growth of aggregate investments in the decarbonization sector. The costs of capital test reveals that firms engaging in CSR activities often benefit from lower costs of capital, attributed to reduced risk perceptions among investors. This is supported by studies indicating that CSR initiatives can mitigate firm-specific risks and enhance firm reputation, thereby attracting more investment at lower costs (Dhaliwal et al., 2011). Portfolio performance analyses further corroborate the nonpecuniary motives of shareholders, showing that socially responsible investment (SRI) portfolios do not consistently outperform conventional ones, suggesting that investors are willing to accept lower returns for the sake of ethical considerations (Renneboog et al., 2008). Ownership structures also provide insights into shareholder motives, with evidence indicating that institutional investors, particularly those with a long-term investment horizon, are more likely to support CSR initiatives, reflecting a preference for sustainable and responsible business practices over short-term financial gains (Johnson & Greening, 1999). Surveys and experiments have consistently demonstrated that a significant portion of investors are willing to sacrifice financial returns to support firms that align with their ethical values, further emphasizing the nonpecuniary drivers of CSR interest (Riedl & Smeets, 2017). Managerial motives also play a crucial role, as executives often pursue CSR strategies not solely for financial benefits but to fulfill personal or organizational ethical commitments, which in turn influences shareholder support for such initiatives (Bansal & Roth, 2000). Shareholder proposals related to CSR issues have seen a marked increase, reflecting growing investor demand for corporate accountability and sustainability, even when such proposals may not directly enhance shareholder value (Gillan & Starks, 2007). Lastly, the inclusion of firms in responsibility indices, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, has been shown to attract investment from socially conscious investors, further underscoring the nonpecuniary motives behind CSR engagement (RobecoSAM, 2013). In the context of global warming, the concept of greeniums—the foregone returns for shareholders willing to reduce carbon emissions—highlights the willingness of investors to support decarbonization efforts, even at the expense of financial returns. This is consistent with the observed growth in aggregate investments in the decarbonization sector, suggesting a significant shift towards sustainable finance and responsible shareholder mandates (Hong et al., 2019). In conclusion, the literature predominantly indicates that shareholder interest in CSR is driven by nonpecuniary motives, reflecting a broader societal and ethical shift towards sustainability. This has significant implications for corporate strategies, investment decisions, and policy-making, particularly in addressing global challenges such as climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Voluntary Nonfinancial Disclosure and the Cost of Equity Capital: The Initiation of Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting", "authors": "Dan S.
