{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is pivotal in the evaluation of long-term projects and policies, especially those with intergenerational impacts. The SDR is used to weigh the costs and benefits occurring at different times, essentially reflecting society's preference for current over future consumption. However, the determination of an appropriate SDR is complex, particularly in the context of missing participants and incomplete markets. This literature review explores the implications of missing market participants, borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy on the SDR. Market interest rates are traditionally seen as reflections of the preferences of market participants. However, when certain participants are absent from the market, the average discount rate in the population may diverge from the market rate. For instance, the absence of constrained borrowers, who are unable to participate fully in the market due to financial limitations, can lead to an average discount rate that exceeds the market rate. Conversely, the exclusion of future generations, who are not present to express their preferences in current markets, can result in an average discount rate that is below the market rate (Weitzman, 2001). Governments, with their unique ability to transfer wealth across different agents and time periods, often use the market interest rate as a benchmark for policy decisions. However, this approach may not fully capture the societal preferences, especially in the presence of missing participants. The argument for a lower SDR is robust when considering intrapersonal dynamics: future selves tend to discount the past, while current selves discount the future. This temporal discrepancy in discounting behavior suggests that a lower SDR might better align with long-term societal welfare (Frederick, Loewenstein, & O'Donoghue, 2002). Moreover, the concept of legacy utility introduces another dimension to the discussion on SDR. Legacy utility refers to the value individuals place on leaving a positive impact for future generations, which can justify the use of a lower SDR. This perspective is supported by the idea that individuals are not purely self-interested but also exhibit altruistic behaviors towards future generations (Stern, 2006). Altruism, in this context, plays a crucial role in shaping the SDR. Altruistic preferences towards future generations can lead to a lower SDR, as individuals are willing to sacrifice current consumption for the benefit of future generations. This intergenerational altruism is a key factor in the debate on the appropriate level of the SDR, especially in the context of environmental policies and climate change mitigation (Nordhaus, 2007). Borrowing constraints further complicate the determination of the SDR. When individuals face limitations in borrowing against future income, their ability to smooth consumption over time is restricted. This can lead to higher discount rates for current consumption, as individuals prioritize immediate needs over future benefits. However, from a societal perspective, the presence of borrowing constraints among certain groups may necessitate a lower SDR to ensure equitable intergenerational welfare (Laibson, 1997). Incomplete markets, where not all future risks can be hedged, also influence the SDR. In such markets, the absence of certain financial instruments can lead to a misalignment between individual and societal discount rates. This misalignment underscores the importance of considering the broader economic context when determining the SDR (Gollier, 2012). In conclusion, the determination of the social discount rate is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including missing market participants, borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. These factors highlight the need for a nuanced approach to setting the SDR, one that considers both the immediate and long-term welfare of society. As policymakers grapple with the challenges of long-term planning and intergenerational equity, the insights from the literature on the SDR provide valuable guidance for balancing current and future needs.", "References": [{"title": "Gamma Discounting", "authors": "Martin Weitzman", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2001", "volumes": "91", "first page": "260", "last page": "271", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.91.1.260"}, {"title": "Time Discounting and Time Preference: A Critical Review", "authors": "Shane Frederick, George Loewenstein, Ted O'Donoghue", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2002", "volumes": "40", "first page": "351", "last page": "401", "DOI": "10.1257/002205102320161311"}, {"title": "The Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change", "authors": "Nicholas Stern", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Review of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change", "authors": "William Nordhaus", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2007", "volumes": "45", "first page": "686", "last page": "702", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.45.3.686"}, {"title": "Golden Eggs and Hyperbolic Discounting", "authors": "David Laibson", "journal": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "year": "1997", "volumes": "112", "first page": "443", "last page": "477", "DOI": "10.1162/003355397555253"}, {"title": "Pricing the Planet's Future: The Economics of Discounting in an Uncertain World", "authors": "Christian Gollier", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
