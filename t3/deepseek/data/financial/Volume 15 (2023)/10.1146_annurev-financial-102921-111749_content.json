{"Literature Review": "The practice of using a single discount rate for evaluating public investments and policies has been a longstanding tradition in most Western countries. This approach, however, fails to account for the differential cost of risk across various projects, leading to a significant misallocation of capital and welfare costs. The asset pricing literature offers a compelling normative justification for adjusting discount rates based on risk, suggesting that project-specific discount rates should increase with the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This literature review explores the theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence supporting the need for risk-adjusted discount rates in public investment evaluation, with a particular focus on the implications for carbon pricing and cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThe concept of discounting future benefits and costs is central to the evaluation of public investments and policies. The traditional approach employs a single discount rate, often derived from the social rate of time preference or the opportunity cost of capital. However, this method overlooks the variability in risk across different projects, as highlighted by Weitzman (2001), who argued for the use of declining discount rates over time to reflect uncertainty about future economic growth. This perspective is further supported by Gollier (2002), who demonstrated that the appropriate discount rate should decrease with the time horizon when future growth rates are uncertain.\n\nThe asset pricing literature provides a robust framework for understanding the relationship between risk and discount rates. According to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the expected return on an asset should reflect its systematic risk, measured by its beta coefficient. This principle can be extended to public investments, where the discount rate should account for the project's exposure to macroeconomic risks. As argued by Arrow and Lind (1970), the government's ability to pool risks across a large number of projects allows for a lower discount rate compared to private investments. However, this does not justify the use of a uniform discount rate for all public projects, as the risk profiles can vary significantly.\n\nRecent studies have emphasized the importance of adjusting discount rates based on the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. Gollier (2012) proposed that projects whose benefits are more sensitive to income changes should be discounted at a higher rate, reflecting their greater exposure to economic fluctuations. This approach aligns with the principle of risk-adjusted discounting, which seeks to allocate capital more efficiently by recognizing the insurance value of projects that provide benefits in low-income states. The empirical evidence supports this view, with studies such as those by Nordhaus (2008) on climate change economics showing that risk-adjusted discount rates can lead to more optimal investment decisions.\n\nThe implications of risk-adjusted discounting are particularly relevant for carbon pricing and climate change mitigation policies. The Stern Review (Stern, 2007) famously argued for a low discount rate to reflect the long-term and uncertain nature of climate change impacts. However, this approach has been criticized for not adequately accounting for the risk of climate change. Weitzman (2009) introduced the concept of 'fat-tailed' uncertainty in climate change, suggesting that the potential for catastrophic outcomes warrants a higher discount rate to reflect the increased risk. This debate underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to discounting in the context of climate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, the current practice of using a single discount rate for public investment evaluation is increasingly seen as inadequate in a world where risk markets exhibit large prices of risk. The asset pricing literature provides a strong theoretical foundation for risk-adjusted discount rates, which can lead to a more efficient allocation of capital and higher welfare. By adjusting discount rates based on the income elasticity of the project's net benefit, policymakers can better account for the insurance value of projects that mitigate risks in low-income states. This approach is particularly relevant for carbon pricing and climate change mitigation, where the stakes are high and the risks are significant. It is time to reform our public discounting systems to reflect the realities of a risky world.", "References": [{"title": "Gamma Discounting", "authors": "Martin Weitzman", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2001", "volumes": "91", "first page": "260", "last page": "271", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.91.1.260"}, {"title": "Time Horizon and the Discount Rate", "authors": "Christian Gollier", "journal": "Journal of Economic Theory", "year": "2002", "volumes": "107", "first page": "463", "last page": "473", "DOI": "10.1006/jeth.2001.2951"}, {"title": "Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Public Investment Decisions", "authors": "Kenneth Arrow, Robert Lind", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "1970", "volumes": "60", "first page": "364", "last page": "378", "DOI": "10.2307/1817984"}, {"title": "Pricing the Planet's Future: The Economics of Discounting in an Uncertain World", "authors": "Christian Gollier", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies", "authors": "William Nordhaus", "journal": "Yale University Press", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change", "authors": "Nicholas Stern", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "On Modeling and Interpreting the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change", "authors": "Martin Weitzman", "journal": "The Review of Economics and Statistics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "91", "first page": "1", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1162/rest.91.1.1"}]}
