{"Literature Review": "The increasing recognition of climate change as a significant threat to financial stability has led to the development of climate stress testing as a tool for assessing and managing macroprudential risks. This literature review explores the design and implementation of climate stress tests, focusing on the challenges and opportunities they present in the context of financial sector resilience. Climate stress tests aim to evaluate the potential impact of climate-related risks on financial institutions and the broader financial system. These risks include both physical risks, such as those arising from extreme weather events, and transition risks, which stem from the shift towards a low-carbon economy (Batten et al., 2016). The design of climate stress scenarios is a critical component of these tests, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between climate change and economic activity. Regulators and financial institutions have begun to employ various scenarios to assess the resilience of financial systems to climate risks. However, there is a growing consensus on the need to enhance these scenarios by considering transition risks as dynamic policy choices, incorporating feedback loops between climate change and the economy, and exploring compound risk scenarios where climate risks co-occur with other systemic risks (NGFS, 2019). Mapping climate stress scenarios into financial firm outcomes is another area of focus. This process benefits from existing evidence on the effects of climate-related risks on credit and market outcomes. Studies have shown that climate risks can significantly impact asset valuations, creditworthiness, and market stability, necessitating a robust framework for translating these risks into financial metrics (Dietz et al., 2016). Despite these advancements, there is a pressing need for further research to identify channels through which plausible climate scenarios can lead to meaningful short-run impacts on credit risks, especially given typical bank loan maturities. Additionally, understanding bank-lending responses to climate risks, assessing the adequacy of climate risk pricing in financial markets, and exploring how market participants form climate risk expectations are crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of climate stress tests (Krogstrup & Oman, 2019). The use of market-based climate stress tests, which can be conducted with publicly available data, offers a complementary approach to existing stress-testing frameworks. These tests provide a transparent and accessible means of assessing climate risks, though they also present challenges in terms of data quality and the interpretation of results (Bolton et al., 2020). In conclusion, climate stress testing represents a vital tool for safeguarding financial stability in the face of climate change. However, its effectiveness depends on the continuous refinement of stress scenarios, the integration of new research findings, and the adoption of innovative testing methodologies. As the financial sector grapples with the complexities of climate risks, the development of robust and comprehensive climate stress tests will be essential for promoting resilience and sustainability.", "References": [{"title": "Climate Change and Financial Stability: A Literature Review", "authors": "Sandra Batten, Rhiannon Sowerbutts, Misa Tanaka", "journal": "Bank of England Financial Stability Paper", "year": "2016", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2740701"}, {"title": "A Call for Action: Climate Change as a Source of Financial Risk", "authors": "Network for Greening the Financial System", "journal": "NGFS First Comprehensive Report", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "60", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "'Climate Value at Risk' of Global Financial Assets", "authors": "Simon Dietz, Alex Bowen, Charlie Dixon, Philip Gradwell", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "year": "2016", "volumes": "6", "first page": "676", "last page": "679", "DOI": "10.1038/nclimate2972"}, {"title": "Macroeconomic and Financial Policies for Climate Change Mitigation: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Signe Krogstrup, William Oman", "journal": "IMF Working Paper", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19/185", "first page": "1", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.5089/9781513511955.001"}, {"title": "The Green Swan: Central Banking and Financial Stability in the Age of Climate Change", "authors": "Patrick Bolton, Morgan Despres, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, Frédéric Samama, Romain Svartzman", "journal": "Bank for International Settlements", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "150", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Climate Change and the Financial System: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Mark Carney", "journal": "Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin", "year": "2015", "volumes": "Q4", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Impact of Climate Change on the European Banking Sector", "authors": "Francesco Lamperti, Valentina Bosetti, Andrea Roventini, Massimo Tavoni", "journal": "Journal of Financial Stability", "year": "2019", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfs.2019.05.007"}, {"title": "Climate Change and Financial Risk: Central Banks and Financial Regulators Are Starting to Factor in Climate Change", "authors": "Robert Engle, Stefano Giglio, Bryan Kelly, Heebum Lee, Johannes Stroebel", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "137", "first page": "534", "last page": "555", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2019.12.002"}, {"title": "Climate Change and Financial Stability: Evidence from the US Banking Sector", "authors": "Allen N.
