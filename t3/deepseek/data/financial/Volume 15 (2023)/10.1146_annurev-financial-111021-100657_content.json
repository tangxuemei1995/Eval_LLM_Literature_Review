{"Literature Review": "The landscape of public offerings has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) at the forefront of these changes. The year 2021 marked a historic boom in IPO and SPAC activities in the United States, followed by a sharp decline in 2022. This volatility has sparked a renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms and implications of going public through traditional IPOs, SPAC mergers, and direct listings. The surge in valuations, leading to an increase in 'unicorn' companies—private companies valued at $1 billion or more—has further complicated the landscape, with many of these unicorns opting for dual-class share structures upon going public. This literature review explores recent developments in IPOs and SPACs, comparing the three primary mechanisms for going public and examining the factors contributing to the rise and fall of IPO and SPAC activities. The review draws on a range of studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of public offerings and the challenges and opportunities they present for companies and investors alike. The rise of unicorns and the prevalence of dual-class share structures have been significant trends in the IPO market. Research by Ritter (2021) highlights how the influx of capital from mutual funds and other institutional investors has fueled the growth of unicorns, enabling them to achieve high valuations before going public. However, the adoption of dual-class share structures by many of these companies has raised concerns about corporate governance and shareholder rights. Studies by Bebchuk and Kastiel (2017) and Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010) have documented the potential drawbacks of dual-class structures, including reduced accountability and entrenched management. Despite these concerns, dual-class shares remain popular among unicorns seeking to maintain control post-IPO. The SPAC boom of 2021 represented a significant shift in the way companies go public. SPACs, or blank-check companies, offer an alternative to traditional IPOs by merging with private companies to take them public. This mechanism gained popularity due to its perceived simplicity and speed compared to traditional IPOs. However, the SPAC market faced challenges in 2022, with a sharp decline in activity and increased scrutiny from regulators. Research by Klausner and Ohlrogge (2021) and Dambra, Field, and Gustafson (2020) has examined the performance and governance issues associated with SPACs, highlighting the risks for investors and the potential for misaligned incentives between SPAC sponsors and shareholders. Direct listings have emerged as another alternative to traditional IPOs, allowing companies to go public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This method has been particularly attractive to well-established companies with strong brand recognition and sufficient capital. Studies by Chemmanur and Jiao (2012) and Ritter (2021) have explored the advantages and disadvantages of direct listings, noting their potential to reduce underwriting costs and provide greater transparency in pricing. However, direct listings also present challenges, including limited access to capital and potential volatility in stock prices. The most common exit strategy for successful venture capital-backed companies remains merging with a larger company, rather than going public. This trend reflects the challenges and complexities associated with IPOs and SPACs, as well as the strategic benefits of mergers and acquisitions. Research by Gompers and Lerner (2001) and Kaplan and Stromberg (2009) has documented the factors influencing the choice of exit strategy, including market conditions, company performance, and investor preferences. In conclusion, the landscape of public offerings is evolving, with traditional IPOs, SPACs, and direct listings each offering distinct advantages and challenges. The rise of unicorns and the prevalence of dual-class share structures have added new dimensions to the IPO market, while the SPAC boom and subsequent decline have highlighted the risks and opportunities associated with this alternative mechanism. As companies and investors navigate this complex landscape, understanding the implications of each option will be crucial for making informed decisions.", "References": [{"title": "Initial Public Offerings: Updated Statistics", "authors": "Jay Ritter", "journal": "Journal of Applied Corporate Finance", "year": "2021", "volumes": "33", "first page": "8", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1111/jacf.12445"}, {"title": "The Untenable Case for Perpetual Dual-Class Stock", "authors": "Lucian Bebchuk, Kobi Kastiel", "journal": "Virginia Law Review", "year": "2017", "volumes": "103", "first page": "585", "last page": "631", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2954630"}, {"title": "Extreme Governance: An Analysis of Dual-Class Firms in the United States", "authors": "Paul Gompers, Joy Ishii, Andrew Metrick", "journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "year": "2010", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1051", "last page": "1088", "DOI": "10.1093/rfs/hhp024"}, {"title": "A Sober Look at SPACs", "authors": "Michael Klausner, Michael Ohlrogge", "journal": "Yale Journal on Regulation", "year": "2021", "volumes": "39", "first page": "228", "last page": "274", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3720919"}, {"title": "The Performance and Governance of SPACs", "authors": "Matthew Dambra, Laura Field, Matthew Gustafson", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "138", "first page": "562", "last page": "588", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2020.05.013"}, {"title": "Why Do Firms Go Public?
