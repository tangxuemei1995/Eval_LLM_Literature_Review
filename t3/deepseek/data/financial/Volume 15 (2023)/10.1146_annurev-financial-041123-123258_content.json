{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is central to the evaluation of public projects and policies, serving as a tool to weigh the present against the future. Financial economics offers a robust framework for understanding and determining the SDR, yet its application in government decision-making remains limited. This literature review explores the intersection of financial economics and public sector valuation, focusing on the SDR, government valuation practices, and the implications for public investment decisions. The principles of financial economics suggest that the cost of capital should reflect the opportunity cost of resources, adjusted for risk. However, governments often default to using their borrowing rate as a proxy for the SDR, a practice that may not accurately capture the social opportunity cost of capital (Arrow et al., 1996). This discrepancy raises questions about the efficiency and equity of public investment decisions. Fair value accounting, which seeks to measure assets and liabilities at their current market value, offers a potential solution to this issue. By aligning government valuation practices with those of the private sector, fair value accounting could provide a more accurate basis for determining the SDR (Barth & Landsman, 2010). However, the application of financial economics principles to public sector decision-making is not without its challenges. For projects with long-term impacts, such as climate change mitigation, the limitations of the financial economics approach become particularly apparent. The uncertainty surrounding future cash flows and discount rates, coupled with intergenerational equity concerns, complicates the use of present value calculations as a measure of value (Weitzman, 2001). In such cases, alternative decision criteria, such as sustainability thresholds or precautionary principles, may be necessary to guide public investment decisions (Dietz et al., 2007). Despite these challenges, the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare for the majority of government investments, which typically involve shorter time horizons. By incorporating risk premiums that reflect the specific characteristics of public projects, governments can better align their investment decisions with societal preferences and risk tolerance (Gollier, 2012). The debate over the appropriate SDR also touches on broader issues of budgetary accounting and government cost of capital. Critics argue that current practices fail to adequately account for the long-term liabilities and risks associated with public investments, potentially leading to underinvestment in critical areas such as infrastructure and education (Buiter, 2003). Proponents of reform advocate for a more comprehensive approach to government accounting, one that incorporates the principles of financial economics to provide a clearer picture of the true cost of public projects (Chan, 2003). In conclusion, while financial economics provides valuable insights into the determination of the SDR, its application in the public sector is fraught with challenges. The adoption of fair value accounting and standard risk adjustment methodologies could improve the efficiency and equity of public investment decisions. However, for projects with long-term impacts, alternative decision criteria may be necessary to address the limitations of present value calculations and ensure intergenerational equity. As governments continue to grapple with these issues, the principles of financial economics will remain an essential tool for understanding the complex trade-offs involved in public sector valuation.", "References": [{"title": "Discounting, morality, and gaming", "authors": "Kenneth J.
