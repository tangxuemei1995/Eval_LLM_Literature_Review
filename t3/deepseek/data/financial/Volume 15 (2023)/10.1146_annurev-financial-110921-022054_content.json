{"Literature Review": "The sustainability of state and local pension funds in the United States has become a critical issue, with unfunded public pension obligations representing the largest liability for these governments. As of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of these plans are $1.076 trillion, but when evaluated at market value, this figure skyrockets to approximately $6.501 trillion. This discrepancy significantly impacts the reported funding ratio, which drops from 82.5% to 43.8% under a market-based valuation (Novy-Marx & Rauh, 2011). This situation underscores the complexity of managing public pensions and the challenges in accurately assessing their financial health. The assumed discount rates, based on expected returns, remain elevated relative to risk-free rates, despite a decline since 2014. This practice not only understates the unfunded pension liability but also the yearly pension cost for newly accruing liabilities (Biggs, 2011). In response to the need for high returns to meet these obligations, pension funds have increasingly turned to risky assets, particularly alternative investments, which introduces a high degree of uncertainty in investment returns (Munnell & Aubry, 2013). The shift towards alternative investments, such as private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, has been a notable trend among state and local pension funds. This strategy aims to diversify portfolios and achieve higher returns than traditional investments in stocks and bonds can offer. However, it also exposes pension funds to higher volatility and potential losses, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of these investment strategies (Andonov, Bauer, & Cremers, 2017). The reliance on high-risk investments is partly driven by the actuarial assumptions used by pension funds, which often assume higher rates of return than what may be realistically achievable. This optimistic forecasting can lead to significant underfunding of pension obligations, as actual returns fall short of expectations (Brown & Wilcox, 2009). Moreover, the legal and contractual protections afforded to pension benefits complicate efforts to reform pension systems. These protections make it difficult for state and local governments to adjust benefits or contribution rates, even in the face of severe underfunding (Monahan, 2012). The political and social implications of pension reform further exacerbate the challenge, as changes to pension benefits can be highly contentious and face strong opposition from public sector unions and retirees (Hess & Squire, 2017). In light of these challenges, some researchers have proposed alternative approaches to managing public pension liabilities. These include shifting from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, which transfer the investment risk from the government to the individual employee (Mitchell & Smith, 1994). Others have suggested the adoption of more conservative investment strategies and actuarial assumptions to ensure the long-term sustainability of pension funds (Rauh, 2017). Despite these proposals, the path to reforming state and local pension systems remains fraught with difficulties, requiring careful consideration of the financial, legal, and social dimensions of public pensions. In conclusion, the trends in state and local pension funds highlight the urgent need for comprehensive reform to address the growing unfunded liabilities and ensure the financial stability of public pension systems. The reliance on risky investments and optimistic actuarial assumptions poses significant risks to the sustainability of these funds, necessitating a reevaluation of current practices and the exploration of alternative strategies to manage pension obligations effectively.", "References": [{"title": "Public Pension Promises: How Big Are They and What Are They Worth?", "authors": "Robert Novy-Marx, Joshua Rauh", "journal": "The Journal of Finance", "year": "2011", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1211", "last page": "1249", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01674.x"}, {"title": "An Options Pricing Method for Calculating the Market Price of Public Sector Pension Liabilities", "authors": "Andrew G.
