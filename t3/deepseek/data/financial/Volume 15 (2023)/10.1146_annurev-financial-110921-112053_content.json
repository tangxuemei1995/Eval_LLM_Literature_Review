{"Literature Review": "The integration of nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models has significantly advanced our understanding of financial markets and their impact on the broader economy. This literature review explores recent developments in macro-finance models that incorporate nonlinear dynamics, focusing on models with funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions. We also discuss the empirical evidence supporting these models and the challenges they present. Additionally, we construct an illustrative model featuring financial frictions and nonlinear dynamics to provide a foundational understanding for readers new to this area. The model is solved using various techniques, including global and perturbation solution methods, and we compare the accuracy of these solutions. Our analysis underscores the limitations of local linearization approximations, which often overlook critical nonlinear dynamics and produce biased impulse responses. Funding liquidity constraints have been a focal point in recent macro-finance literature. These constraints arise when financial institutions face difficulties in obtaining short-term funding, leading to fire sales and asset price volatility. Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) developed a model that links market liquidity and funding liquidity, demonstrating how shocks to funding liquidity can propagate through the financial system, causing severe disruptions. Their work highlights the importance of considering nonlinear dynamics in understanding financial crises. Market liquidity frictions, which refer to the costs and delays associated with trading assets, have also been incorporated into macro-finance models. Gromb and Vayanos (2002) examined the impact of these frictions on asset prices and market stability. They found that market liquidity frictions can lead to significant deviations from fundamental values, particularly during periods of financial stress. Their model emphasizes the need for nonlinear dynamics to capture the complex interactions between market participants and the resulting price dynamics. Bank run frictions, which occur when depositors lose confidence in a bank's solvency and withdraw their funds en masse, have been another area of interest. Diamond and Dybvig (1983) pioneered the study of bank runs, showing how they can lead to systemic banking crises. More recent work by Gertler and Kiyotaki (2015) extended this framework to include nonlinear dynamics, illustrating how bank run frictions can amplify shocks and lead to severe economic downturns. Their model provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving financial instability and the role of nonlinear dynamics in exacerbating crises. Empirical evidence supporting the importance of nonlinear dynamics in macro-finance models has been growing. Adrian and Shin (2010) analyzed the behavior of financial intermediaries during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, finding that their leverage cycles exhibited strong nonlinearities. These findings underscore the need for models that can capture the complex, nonlinear behavior of financial markets. Similarly, Krishnamurthy (2010) examined the role of liquidity transformation in the shadow banking system, highlighting the nonlinear dynamics that arise when liquidity dries up. Despite the advancements in incorporating nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models, several challenges remain. One major challenge is the computational complexity associated with solving these models. Global solution methods, which can accurately capture nonlinear dynamics, are often computationally intensive and require significant resources. In contrast, perturbation methods, while less computationally demanding, may fail to capture important nonlinearities. Aruoba, Fernández-Villaverde, and Rubio-Ramírez (2006) compared the accuracy of different solution techniques, finding that global methods generally provide more accurate results, particularly in the presence of strong nonlinearities. Another challenge is the identification and estimation of nonlinear models. Traditional econometric techniques, which rely on linear approximations, may not be suitable for models with nonlinear dynamics. Fernández-Villaverde, Rubio-Ramírez, and Schorfheide (2016) developed a Bayesian estimation framework for nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complex dynamics of financial markets. Their work highlights the importance of developing new econometric techniques to estimate and validate nonlinear macro-finance models. In conclusion, the integration of nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models has provided valuable insights into the behavior of financial markets and their impact on the broader economy. Models incorporating funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions have enhanced our understanding of financial crises and the mechanisms driving financial instability. However, challenges remain in solving and estimating these models, particularly in capturing the full range of nonlinear dynamics. Future research should focus on developing more efficient solution techniques and econometric methods to address these challenges and further advance our understanding of macro-finance dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity", "authors": "Brunnermeier, Markus K., Pedersen, Lasse Heje", "journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "year": "2009", "volumes": "22", "first page": "2201", "last page": "2238", "DOI": "10.1093/rfs/hhn098"}, {"title": "Equilibrium and Welfare in Markets with Financially Constrained Arbitrageurs", "authors": "Gromb, Denis, Vayanos, Dimitri", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2002", "volumes": "66", "first page": "361", "last page": "407", "DOI": "10.1016/S0304-405X(02)00200-6"}, {"title": "Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity", "authors": "Diamond, Douglas W., Dybvig, Philip H.", "journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "year": "1983", "volumes": "91", "first page": "401", "last page": "419", "DOI": "10.1086/261155"}, {"title": "Banking, Liquidity, and Bank Runs in an Infinite Horizon Economy", "authors": "Gertler, Mark, Kiyotaki, Nobuhiro", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2015", "volumes": "105", "first page": "2011", "last page": "2043", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.20130665"}, {"title": "Liquidity and Leverage", "authors": "Adrian, Tobias, Shin, Hyun Song", "journal": "Journal of Financial Intermediation", "year": "2010", "volumes": "19", "first page": "418", "last page": "437", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfi.2008.12.002"}, {"title": "How Debt Markets Have Malfunctioned in the Crisis", "authors": "Krishnamurthy, Arvind", "journal": "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "year": "2010", "volumes": "24", "first page": "3", "last page": "28", "DOI": "10.1257/jep.24.1.3"}, {"title": "Comparing Solution Methods for Dynamic Equilibrium Economies", "authors": "Aruoba, S.
