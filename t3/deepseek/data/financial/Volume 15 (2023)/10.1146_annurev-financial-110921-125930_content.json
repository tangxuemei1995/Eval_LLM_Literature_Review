{"Literature Review": "Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a critical area of research in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in sensitive applications such as credit scoring. The increasing reliance on algorithms for decision-making processes has raised concerns about the potential for these systems to perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases. This literature review explores the recent advancements in understanding and mitigating bias in algorithms, with a focus on credit scoring, and discusses the implications of these findings for the US mortgage market.The distinction between human and machine bias is a fundamental aspect of algorithmic fairness. While human decision-makers are susceptible to conscious and unconscious biases, algorithms can inadvertently learn and replicate these biases if not carefully designed and monitored. Studies have shown that machine learning models trained on historical data can inherit the biases present in that data, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups (Barocas & Selbst, 2016). This underscores the importance of developing methods to measure and mitigate bias in algorithmic decision-making.Bias measurement in algorithms is a complex task that requires careful consideration of the context in which the algorithm operates. Various fairness metrics have been proposed to quantify bias, including demographic parity, equalized odds, and individual fairness (Dwork et al., 2012; Hardt et al., 2016). These metrics aim to ensure that algorithms treat individuals and groups fairly, but they often present trade-offs that must be carefully balanced. For example, achieving demographic parity may require sacrificing some accuracy in predictions, which can be a contentious issue in applications like credit scoring.The debate between group fairness and individual fairness is another critical aspect of algorithmic fairness. Group fairness focuses on ensuring that different demographic groups receive equitable treatment, while individual fairness emphasizes the fair treatment of each individual, regardless of group membership. Research has shown that these two objectives can sometimes be at odds, necessitating a nuanced approach to fairness in algorithmic design (Kleinberg et al., 2017). This is particularly relevant in the context of credit scoring, where the goal is to assess the creditworthiness of individuals while avoiding discrimination against protected groups.The application of fairness metrics to the US mortgage market has revealed significant group imbalances in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, particularly with respect to gender and minority status. These imbalances can lead to poorer estimation and prediction for female and minority applicants, highlighting the need for more equitable algorithmic models (Bhutta et al., 2020). Despite these challenges, studies have found that loan applicants are generally treated fairly across both groups and individuals, although there are instances where local male (nonminority) neighbors of otherwise similar rejected female (minority) applicants were granted loans, suggesting potential areas for further investigation (Turner & Skidmore, 2019).Modern machine learning techniques have been shown to substantially outperform traditional logistic regression models in credit scoring, offering improved accuracy and predictive power. However, these advanced models often come at the cost of interpretability, making it more difficult to explain decisions to denied applicants, regulators, or the courts (Rudin, 2019). This trade-off between accuracy and explainability is a significant challenge in the field of algorithmic fairness, particularly in high-stakes applications like credit scoring.In conclusion, the literature on algorithmic fairness highlights the complexities and challenges of ensuring fair and unbiased decision-making in credit scoring and other sensitive applications. While significant progress has been made in developing fairness metrics and mitigating bias, there is still much work to be done to achieve equitable outcomes for all individuals and groups. The findings from the US mortgage market underscore the importance of continued research and vigilance in this area, as well as the need for transparent and interpretable models that can be effectively communicated to stakeholders.", "References": [{"title": "Big Data's Disparate Impact", "authors": "Solon Barocas, Andrew D.
