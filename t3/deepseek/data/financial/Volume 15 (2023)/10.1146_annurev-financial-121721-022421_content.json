{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is central to the evaluation of long-term government policies, particularly those with deferred impacts. This literature review explores the legal and philosophical underpinnings of the SDR, focusing on its application in benefit-cost analysis, the challenges it presents in intertemporal and intergenerational contexts, and the debates surrounding its determination and justification. The SDR is used to convert future costs and benefits into present value terms, facilitating the comparison of policy impacts over time. However, the selection of an appropriate SDR is fraught with legal and philosophical complexities, as it involves judgments about the value of future welfare, the rights of future generations, and the ethical considerations of time preference. Legal challenges to the SDR have underscored the necessity for transparent and scientifically grounded justifications for the chosen rate. Courts have generally accepted the principle of discounting at a nonzero rate, recognizing the opportunity cost of capital and the social rate of time preference as key determinants. However, the legal framework often requires detailed explanations for the selection of specific rates, reflecting the courts' familiarity with the principles of discounting and their insistence on methodological rigor. Philosophical debates surrounding the SDR are even more contentious, touching on fundamental questions about the valuation of nonmonetary impacts, the appropriate time frame for discounting, and the ethical implications of intergenerational equity. One of the most challenging issues is whether nonmonetary impacts, such as environmental degradation or loss of biodiversity, should be discounted in the same manner as monetary impacts. Critics argue that discounting nonmonetary impacts undervalues the importance of preserving natural resources for future generations, while proponents contend that some form of discounting is necessary to reflect the opportunity costs of conservation efforts. The choice between using the opportunity cost of capital or the social rate of time preference as the basis for the SDR is another area of philosophical debate. The opportunity cost of capital reflects the returns available from alternative investments, while the social rate of time preference captures society's willingness to trade off present for future consumption. The selection between these two approaches has significant implications for the valuation of long-term projects, with the opportunity cost of capital typically leading to higher discount rates and the social rate of time preference resulting in lower rates. Intergenerational issues present perhaps the most profound challenges for the determination of the SDR. The question of which generation's preferences should be recognized in setting the discount rate raises ethical concerns about the rights of future generations and the potential for intertemporal inequities. Dynamic inconsistencies can arise when different discount rates are applied over time, leading to changes in policy evaluations that may disadvantage future generations. Benefit-cost analyses that appropriately account for the impacts on future generations can play a constructive role in addressing these challenges, providing a mechanism for recognizing and valuing the long-term effects of policies on social welfare. In conclusion, the social discount rate is a critical tool for the evaluation of government policies with long-term impacts, but its determination involves complex legal and philosophical considerations. The ongoing debates about the appropriate rate, the valuation of nonmonetary impacts, and the ethical implications of intergenerational equity highlight the need for careful and transparent decision-making in the application of the SDR. As society continues to grapple with the challenges of sustainable development and the preservation of natural resources for future generations, the principles underlying the SDR will remain a central focus of legal and philosophical inquiry.", "References": [{"title": "Discounting and Intergenerational Equity", "authors": "Kenneth J.
