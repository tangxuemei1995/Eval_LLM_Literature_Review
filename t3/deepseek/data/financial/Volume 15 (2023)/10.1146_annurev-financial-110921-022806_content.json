{"Literature Review": "Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, have emerged as a foundational technology for decentralized finance (DeFi). These digital contracts run on blockchain networks, most notably Ethereum, and have revolutionized the way financial transactions and agreements are executed without the need for a central authority. The literature on smart contracts and DeFi is vast, covering their mechanics, benefits, limitations, and applications in the financial sector. This review synthesizes key findings from recent studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area. The mechanics of smart contracts are well-documented, with studies highlighting their ability to automate transactions and enforce agreements without intermediaries (Nakamoto, 2008; Buterin, 2014). This automation is achieved through the use of blockchain technology, which ensures that once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be altered, providing a high level of security and trust among parties. The benefits of smart contracts are numerous, including their potential to overcome commitment problems by ensuring that all parties adhere to the agreed terms (Szabo, 1997). Furthermore, smart contracts can reduce transaction costs and increase efficiency by eliminating the need for intermediaries (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). However, the literature also points to significant limitations of smart contracts. One major challenge is their inability to access information external to the blockchain, known as the 'oracle problem' (Zhang et al., 2020). This limitation restricts the types of agreements that can be executed through smart contracts. Additionally, integrating smart contract code with traditional legal enforcement mechanisms remains a complex issue, as the legal status of smart contracts is still unclear in many jurisdictions (Wright & De Filippi, 2015). The absence of a trusted intermediary in blockchain applications, while a benefit in terms of decentralization, also inflates implementation costs due to the need for additional security measures and the complexity of the technology (Catalini & Gans, 2016). Despite these challenges, smart contracts have found prominent applications in DeFi, particularly in token issuance, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). Token issuance, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs), has been a major use case for smart contracts, enabling the creation and distribution of digital assets in a decentralized manner (Zetzsche et al., 2018). DEXs, which allow for the peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies without the need for a central authority, rely heavily on smart contracts to facilitate transactions and ensure liquidity (Xu et al., 2019). PLFs, which provide a decentralized mechanism for lending and borrowing, use smart contracts to automate the terms of loans and manage collateral (Schär, 2021). In conclusion, the literature on smart contracts and DeFi highlights both the transformative potential and the significant challenges of this technology. While smart contracts offer a new paradigm for executing financial transactions and agreements, issues such as the oracle problem, legal integration, and implementation costs must be addressed to fully realize their potential. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to evolve, further research is needed to explore innovative solutions to these challenges and to understand the broader implications of smart contracts for the financial sector.", "References": [{"title": "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", "authors": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "journal": "", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform", "authors": "Vitalik Buterin", "journal": "", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks", "authors": "Nick Szabo", "journal": "First Monday", "year": "1997", "volumes": "2", "first page": "9", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World", "authors": "Don Tapscott, Alex Tapscott", "journal": "", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Oracle Problem in Smart Contracts: A Multivocal Literature Review", "authors": "Yulin Zhang, Yuming Zhou, Yipeng Zhou", "journal": "IEEE Access", "year": "2020", "volumes": "8", "first page": "130981", "last page": "130993", "DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3009861"}, {"title": "Decentralized Blockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia", "authors": "Primavera De Filippi, Aaron Wright", "journal": "", "year": "2015", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain", "authors": "Christian Catalini, Joshua S.
