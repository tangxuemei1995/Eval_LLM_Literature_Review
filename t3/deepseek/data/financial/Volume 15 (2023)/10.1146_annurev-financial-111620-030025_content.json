{"Literature Review": "The study of sovereign debt has long been a central topic in international finance and macroeconomics, yet it remains fraught with puzzles that challenge the canonical models of sovereign borrowing and default. This literature review delves into the complexities and anomalies that characterize sovereign debt markets, as highlighted by recent research. We organize these puzzles into three main categories: issuance, pricing, and default, drawing on a range of studies to illuminate the gaps between theoretical predictions and empirical observations. The issuance of sovereign debt presents the first set of puzzles. Traditional models suggest that countries borrow to smooth consumption over time or to finance productive investments. However, empirical evidence often contradicts these predictions. For instance, countries with higher growth prospects do not necessarily borrow more, and debt levels do not consistently correlate with investment rates (Reinhart & Rogoff, 2009). Moreover, the choice of debt instruments and maturity structures often defies the logic of minimizing borrowing costs or risk exposure (Broner et al., 2013). These anomalies suggest that political economy factors, such as the desire to avoid future fiscal constraints or to signal creditworthiness, may play a more significant role than previously acknowledged. The pricing of sovereign debt constitutes the second category of puzzles. Despite the assumption of rational markets, sovereign bond yields frequently exhibit patterns that are difficult to reconcile with fundamentals. For example, spreads over risk-free rates are often higher than what default probabilities would justify, a phenomenon known as the 'credit spread puzzle' (Longstaff et al., 2011). Additionally, the impact of credit ratings on bond yields appears to be non-linear and sometimes perverse, with downgrades leading to disproportionate increases in borrowing costs (Cantor & Packer, 1996). These pricing anomalies may reflect market imperfections, such as liquidity constraints or investor sentiment, which are not fully captured by standard models. The final category encompasses puzzles related to sovereign default and its resolution. Contrary to the predictions of models that emphasize the costs of default, such as exclusion from capital markets or output losses, countries sometimes default even when the immediate fiscal benefits are unclear (Tomz & Wright, 2007). Furthermore, the process of restructuring defaulted debt often results in outcomes that are suboptimal for both creditors and debtors, such as prolonged negotiations and repeated defaults (Sturzenegger & Zettelmeyer, 2008). These observations suggest that strategic considerations, legal frameworks, and the collective action problems among creditors may be more influential than the economic costs of default. In conclusion, the literature on sovereign debt is rich with puzzles that challenge our understanding of how countries borrow, how their debt is priced, and how defaults are resolved. These anomalies underscore the need for new theoretical frameworks that can better account for the complex interplay of economic, political, and institutional factors in sovereign debt markets. Future research should aim to integrate these dimensions, leveraging advances in data availability and computational methods to test and refine our models of sovereign debt.", "References": [{"title": "This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly", "authors": "Carmen Reinhart, Kenneth Rogoff", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2009", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Sovereign Risk and Secondary Markets", "authors": "Fernando Broner, Aitor Erce, Alberto Martin, Jaume Ventura", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2013", "volumes": "103", "first page": "2390", "last page": "2417", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.103.6.2390"}, {"title": "Corporate Yield Spreads: Default Risk or Liquidity?
