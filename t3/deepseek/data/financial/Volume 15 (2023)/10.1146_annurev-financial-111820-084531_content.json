{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is pivotal in the evaluation of public investments and policies, especially those with long-term implications such as climate change mitigation. The SDR is used to convert future costs and benefits into present values, thereby facilitating the comparison of projects with different time horizons. The selection of an appropriate SDR is not merely a technical issue but also a normative one, reflecting societal preferences regarding intergenerational equity and the valuation of future welfare. This literature review explores the theoretical underpinnings, practical considerations, and ethical dimensions of SDR selection, drawing on recent scholarly contributions to the field. The importance of a principles-based approach to SDR selection is underscored by the long-term nature of many public investments, particularly those aimed at addressing climate change. The literature emphasizes the need for SDRs to reflect the opportunity cost of capital, adjusted for risk, to ensure that public investments are evaluated on a consistent basis with private sector investments. However, the application of this principle is complicated by the unique characteristics of public projects, including their scale, duration, and the public goods they often provide. One of the key debates in the literature concerns the appropriate treatment of risk in the SDR. Traditional approaches advocate for a risk-adjusted SDR that reflects the systematic risk of the project. However, this approach has been critiqued for potentially undervaluing long-term benefits, especially in the context of climate change, where the benefits of mitigation accrue far into the future. Alternative approaches suggest using a declining discount rate over time to account for uncertainty and the diminishing marginal utility of consumption. The choice of SDR also has significant implications for intergenerational equity. A high SDR tends to favor current generations at the expense of future ones, by discounting future benefits more heavily. This raises ethical questions about the rights of future generations and the responsibilities of the present generation to ensure sustainable development. The literature explores various philosophical perspectives on this issue, including utilitarianism, rights-based approaches, and the precautionary principle. Practical considerations in SDR selection include the legal and institutional frameworks within which governments operate. In many jurisdictions, the SDR is prescribed by law or regulation, which may not always align with economic principles or ethical considerations. This can lead to a disconnect between the SDR used in practice and the theoretically optimal rate. The literature calls for greater flexibility in SDR selection, allowing for adjustments based on the specific characteristics of the project and the societal values it embodies. In conclusion, the selection of an SDR is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of economic principles, ethical values, and practical constraints. The literature highlights the need for a more nuanced and flexible approach to SDR selection, particularly in the context of long-term public investments such as climate change mitigation. By adopting a principles-based approach that accounts for risk, intergenerational equity, and the unique characteristics of public projects, governments can make more informed and socially optimal investment decisions.", "References": [{"title": "Discounting for Climate Change", "authors": "Nicholas Stern", "journal": "Economics of Climate Change", "year": "2007", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511817434.002"}, {"title": "The Social Discount Rate: A Primer for Policymakers", "authors": "David F.
