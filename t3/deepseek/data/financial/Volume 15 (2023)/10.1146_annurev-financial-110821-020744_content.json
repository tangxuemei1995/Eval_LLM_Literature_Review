{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted household behavior across various dimensions, including consumption, credit, and investments. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to provide a comprehensive overview of these changes. The pandemic led to an unprecedented economic shock, prompting households to adjust their financial behaviors in response to health risks, government policies, and economic uncertainty. One of the most immediate effects was a sharp decline in consumption. Research by Baker et al. (2020) documented that consumption dropped significantly even before the implementation of stay-at-home orders, suggesting that fear of the virus played a crucial role in reducing consumer spending. This decline was not uniform across all categories; while spending on services, especially those requiring physical presence, plummeted, there was a notable increase in spending on goods, particularly those related to home improvement and online shopping (Chen et al., 2021). Government stimulus measures were a critical component of the policy response to the pandemic. However, their effectiveness in stimulating consumption was mixed. According to a study by Chetty et al. (2020), while stimulus checks provided immediate relief to households, a significant portion of these funds was saved rather than spent, reflecting heightened uncertainty and precautionary savings behavior. This contrasts with previous recessions, where stimulus measures had a more pronounced impact on consumption. The pandemic also had a unique impact on household credit. Unlike previous economic downturns, delinquency rates on consumer debt did not rise sharply during the pandemic. This anomaly can be attributed to government interventions, such as debt relief programs and enhanced unemployment benefits, which provided households with the financial flexibility to meet their debt obligations (Haughwout et al., 2020). Furthermore, the mortgage forbearance programs introduced during the pandemic helped prevent a wave of foreclosures, stabilizing the housing market (Ganong et al., 2021). Investment behavior among households also underwent significant changes during the pandemic. The stock market experienced high volatility, and there was a notable increase in retail trading activity. Barber et al. (2021) found that individual investors, driven by changes in beliefs and increased time at home, engaged more actively in stock trading, often favoring high-risk, high-reward investments. This shift was facilitated by the proliferation of trading platforms and the availability of real-time financial information. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to profound changes in household behavior, with significant implications for consumption, credit, and investments. The unique nature of the pandemic, characterized by health risks and unprecedented government interventions, has resulted in behaviors that differ markedly from those observed in previous economic downturns. Future research should continue to explore the long-term effects of these changes, particularly in the context of evolving government policies and the ongoing adaptation of households to the post-pandemic world.", "References": [{"title": "How Does Household Spending Respond to an Epidemic?
