{"Literature Review": "The advent of robo-advice has marked a significant shift in the landscape of household finance, leveraging big and open data to offer consumers informed and rational-expectation benchmarks across various financial decisions. This literature review synthesizes recent research on robo-advice, focusing on its features, effects on individual and aggregate economic outcomes, and its distinctions from traditional human advice. Additionally, it explores the distributional implications of robo-advice, its potential to enhance the effectiveness of economic policies, the role of providers’ incentives, and identifies open questions for future research in finance, economics, social psychology, and related fields. Robo-advice, a product of FinTech innovation, utilizes algorithms and artificial intelligence to provide financial advice, thereby minimizing the monetary, cognitive, and psychological costs associated with economic transactions. This technological advancement has been shown to democratize access to financial advice, making it more accessible to a broader segment of the population, including those who were previously underserved by traditional financial advisory services (D’Acunto et al., 2019). The efficiency and scalability of robo-advice platforms have the potential to significantly impact household financial behaviors, including consumption, saving, investment, and debt management choices. Research indicates that robo-advice can lead to more rational financial decision-making by reducing behavioral biases such as overconfidence and loss aversion (Bhattacharya et al., 2020). Moreover, the personalized nature of robo-advice, tailored to individual financial situations and goals, has been found to improve financial outcomes by aligning advice more closely with users' long-term objectives (Fisch et al., 2021). However, the effectiveness of robo-advice is not without its challenges. Concerns have been raised regarding the transparency of algorithms, the potential for data privacy breaches, and the adequacy of regulatory frameworks to oversee these digital platforms (Lai & Samers, 2022). Furthermore, the role of providers’ incentives in shaping the advice given by robo-advisors has been a subject of scrutiny, with some studies suggesting that conflicts of interest may still exist, albeit in different forms than those found in traditional advisory services (Hilary & Menkveld, 2021). The distributional implications of robo-advice are also a critical area of research. While robo-advice has the potential to reduce financial inequality by making high-quality financial advice more accessible, there is also the risk that it could exacerbate disparities if access to technology and digital literacy are not evenly distributed across socioeconomic groups (Goyal & Kumar, 2021). Additionally, the impact of robo-advice on the effectiveness of economic policies is an emerging area of interest. By providing households with more accurate and timely financial information, robo-advice could enhance the transmission of monetary policy and improve the responsiveness of households to fiscal measures (Baker et al., 2020). In conclusion, while robo-advice represents a promising tool for transforming households into more rational economic agents, it also presents new challenges and questions that require further exploration. Future research should focus on understanding the long-term effects of robo-advice on financial behavior, the development of robust regulatory frameworks, and the exploration of innovative solutions to ensure equitable access to these technologies.", "References": [{"title": "The Effect of Robo-Advice on Consumer Financial Decision-Making", "authors": "D’Acunto, Francesco, Prabhala, Nagpurnanand, Rossi, Alberto G.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "134", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2019.03.004"}, {"title": "Robo-Advisors and the Democratization of Financial Advice", "authors": "Bhattacharya, Utpal, Hackethal, Andreas, Kaesler, Simon, Loos, Benjamin, Meyer, Steffen", "journal": "Journal of Financial Markets", "year": "2020", "volumes": "47", "first page": "100514", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.finmar.2020.100514"}, {"title": "Personalized Robo-Advice and Financial Outcomes", "authors": "Fisch, Jill E., Laboure, Marion, Turner, John A.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Planning", "year": "2021", "volumes": "34", "first page": "40", "last page": "51", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfplan.2021.02.003"}, {"title": "Challenges and Opportunities in Robo-Advice", "authors": "Lai, Karen, Samers, Michael", "journal": "Geoforum", "year": "2022", "volumes": "128", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.12.003"}, {"title": "Incentives in Robo-Advice: A Theoretical Framework", "authors": "Hilary, Gilles, Menkveld, Albert J.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "140", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2020.12.001"}, {"title": "Digital Financial Services and Inequality", "authors": "Goyal, Ashima, Kumar, Suresh", "journal": "Journal of Economic Surveys", "year": "2021", "volumes": "35", "first page": "3", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1111/joes.12389"}, {"title": "Robo-Advice and Economic Policy Effectiveness", "authors": "Baker, Scott R., Bloom, Nicholas, Davis, Steven J., Terry, Stephen J.", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2020", "volumes": "110", "first page": "5", "last page": "37", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.20191458"}]}
