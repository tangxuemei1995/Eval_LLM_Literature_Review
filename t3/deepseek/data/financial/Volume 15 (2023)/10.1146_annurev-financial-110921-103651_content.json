{"Literature Review": "The concept of fiscal capacity, traditionally understood as the government's ability to raise revenue and manage debt, has been re-examined through the lens of asset pricing, revealing nuanced insights into the constraints and opportunities faced by governments. This literature review synthesizes recent findings that leverage asset pricing models to understand fiscal capacity, emphasizing the role of aggregate risk, the term structure of interest rates, debt maturity, and the convenience yield of government bonds. Modern asset pricing theory suggests that fiscal capacity is not merely a function of the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate but is significantly influenced by the government's approach to managing aggregate risk. Barro (2006) and Bohn (1998) have laid foundational work in understanding how governments can manage debt in the presence of economic shocks, highlighting the importance of tax smoothing and debt sustainability. However, recent studies, including those by Farhi and Maggiori (2018) and Reis (2021), argue that the traditional view underestimates the impact of aggregate risk on fiscal capacity. They demonstrate that when governments borrow at the risk-free rate, they implicitly ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk, a scenario that is increasingly untenable in advanced economies where governments tend to insure taxpayers against such risks. The term structure of interest rates plays a crucial role in understanding fiscal capacity. Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein (2015) discuss how the maturity structure of government debt affects the government's exposure to interest rate risk and, consequently, its fiscal capacity. They argue that longer maturities can reduce refinancing risk but may increase exposure to interest rate volatility. This trade-off is critical for governments in managing their debt portfolios. The concept of convenience yield, or the non-pecuniary benefits of holding government bonds, has also been revisited in the context of fiscal capacity. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) highlight how the convenience yield affects the demand for government bonds, influencing the government's borrowing costs and fiscal space. They find that in times of financial stress, the convenience yield increases, lowering the government's borrowing costs and temporarily boosting fiscal capacity. Alternative mechanisms to enhance fiscal capacity have been explored in the literature. For instance, Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2016) discuss the role of financial repression and capital controls in managing debt and enhancing fiscal capacity. Similarly, Caballero and Farhi (2018) explore the concept of safe asset scarcity and its implications for fiscal policy, suggesting that the global demand for safe assets can influence a country's fiscal capacity. In conclusion, the asset pricing perspective offers a richer understanding of fiscal capacity, emphasizing the importance of managing aggregate risk, the strategic use of debt maturity, and the role of convenience yield. This review underscores the need for governments to adopt a more nuanced approach to fiscal policy, one that accounts for the complex interplay between financial markets and public finance.", "References": [{"title": "Optimal Debt Management", "authors": "Robert J.
