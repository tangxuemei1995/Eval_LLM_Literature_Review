{"Literature Review": "The field of fluid mechanics has seen significant advancements with the development of particle image-based volumetric flow measurement techniques, particularly in the realm of 3D Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT). These techniques have revolutionized the way researchers access unsteady flow properties, offering quantitative insights into various experimental applications. The focus of this literature review is to explore the physical properties and circumstances surrounding 3D particle-based measurements, with an emphasis on enhancing reconstruction accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution, and the completeness of the data obtained. 3D LPT stands out as a natural candidate for this exploration due to its ability to determine position, velocity, and acceleration, alongside tracking a large number of individual particles within the investigated volume. The introduction of the dense 3D LPT technique, known as Shake-The-Box, has further expanded the possibilities for characterizing unsteady flows. This technique provides input data for powerful data assimilation methods that utilize Navier–Stokes constraints, enabling the acquisition of high-resolution Lagrangian and Eulerian data, including long particle trajectories embedded in time-resolved 3D velocity and pressure fields. The evolution of 3D LPT techniques, including Shake-The-Box, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of fluid mechanics. These methods have been applied in various studies to investigate complex flow phenomena, offering insights into the dynamics of fluid motion at a granular level. The ability to track particles in three dimensions has opened new avenues for research, allowing for a more detailed analysis of flow structures and their evolution over time. Furthermore, the integration of data assimilation techniques has enhanced the accuracy and reliability of the measurements, providing a solid foundation for the development of predictive models in fluid mechanics. The advancements in 3D LPT have also facilitated the study of one- and multipoint statistics, velocity gradient tensors, and 3D pressure fields, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of fluid flows. As the field continues to evolve, the potential applications of 3D LPT in fluid mechanics are vast, ranging from environmental studies to industrial processes. The ongoing development of these techniques promises to further enhance our ability to analyze and predict complex fluid behaviors, paving the way for innovative solutions to challenging problems in fluid mechanics.", "References": [{"title": "Shake-The-Box: Lagrangian particle tracking at high particle image densities", "authors": "Christian J.
