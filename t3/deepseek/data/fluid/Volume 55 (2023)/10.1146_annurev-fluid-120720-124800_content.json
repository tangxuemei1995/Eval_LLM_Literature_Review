{"Literature Review": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become an indispensable tool in the aerospace industry, revolutionizing the way aircraft are designed, analyzed, and optimized. The evolution of CFD technology over the past several decades has been marked by significant advancements in numerical algorithms, turbulence modeling, and computational efficiency, enabling more accurate and detailed simulations of complex aerodynamic flows. This literature review explores the current state of aerospace CFD technology, highlighting its application process, challenges, and future prospects. The integration of CFD into the aerospace design process has been extensively documented. According to Spalart (2000), the use of CFD in the early stages of aircraft design allows for a more comprehensive understanding of aerodynamic performance, leading to optimized designs that meet stringent performance and safety standards. The centrality of geometry in CFD simulations cannot be overstated, as accurate geometric representation is crucial for reliable flow predictions. Mavriplis (2005) emphasizes the importance of high-quality mesh generation, noting that the fidelity of CFD results is directly related to the resolution and quality of the computational mesh. Turbulence modeling remains one of the most challenging aspects of CFD. Wilcox (1998) provides a comprehensive overview of various turbulence models, highlighting their strengths and limitations in predicting complex flow phenomena. The development of higher-order numerical algorithms has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of CFD simulations. Cockburn and Shu (2001) discuss the advantages of discontinuous Galerkin methods, which offer high-order accuracy and flexibility in handling complex geometries. Output-based mesh adaptation has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of CFD simulations while minimizing computational cost. Venditti and Darmofal (2002) demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving targeted error reduction in aerodynamic simulations. Numerical design optimization, enabled by advances in CFD and computational power, has transformed the aircraft design process. Jameson (2003) outlines the principles of adjoint-based optimization, which allows for efficient gradient computation and has been widely adopted in aerodynamic shape optimization. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the application of CFD in the aerospace industry. The need for improved turbulence models, more efficient numerical algorithms, and better integration of CFD with other design tools is widely recognized. The future of aerospace CFD lies in the realization of certification by analysis and model-based design as standard practices. This will require continued investment in research and development, as well as collaboration between academia, industry, and regulatory bodies. The potential of CFD to further enhance aircraft design and performance is immense, and the steps necessary to achieve this future are clear. In conclusion, the state of aerospace CFD technology is characterized by significant achievements and ongoing challenges. The continued evolution of this field will play a critical role in shaping the future of the aerospace industry, driving innovation and enabling the development of next-generation aircraft.", "References": [{"title": "Strategies for turbulence modelling and simulations", "authors": "Spalart, P.
