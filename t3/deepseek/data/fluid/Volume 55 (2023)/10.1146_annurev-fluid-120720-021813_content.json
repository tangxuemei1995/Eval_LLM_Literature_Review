{"Literature Review": "The study of turbulent spots has been a focal point in fluid dynamics research, offering insights into the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. This literature review synthesizes recent advancements in the understanding of turbulent spots across various flow configurations, including incompressible flat-plate boundary layers, pipe flows, hypersonic boundary layers, turbomachinery flows, channel flows, and plane Couette flows. The evolution of turbulent spot research over the past four decades has significantly contributed to our comprehension of their origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization. One of the pivotal findings in this domain is the hypothesis that transitional–turbulent spots serve as fundamental building blocks of the fully turbulent boundary layer. This hypothesis has been substantiated by the discovery of locally generated turbulent–turbulent spots that dominate the wall layer, highlighting the intrinsic role of turbulent spots in the structure of turbulence. Furthermore, the phenomenon of splitting transitional–turbulent spots in pipe flow has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot's frontal section, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics within turbulent spots. These advancements underscore the complexity and significance of turbulent spots in the transition process and their impact on the length of the transition zone in engineering flows. Future research directions are anticipated to explore the intricate mechanisms governing turbulent spots, their interaction with various flow configurations, and their implications for turbulence control and management in engineering applications. The ongoing investigation into turbulent spots not only enriches our theoretical knowledge of fluid dynamics but also has practical implications for enhancing the efficiency and performance of engineering systems.", "References": [{"title": "The role of turbulent spots in the transition to turbulence in a boundary layer", "authors": "Smith, Charles R., Walker, James D.
