{"Literature Review": "The evaporation of sessile droplets is a phenomenon that has garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines due to its fundamental nature and its implications in numerous applications, ranging from inkjet printing to the spread of diseases. This literature review delves into the insights provided by mathematical models, the influence of evaporation modes, the determination of droplet lifetimes, the patterns of deposition, and the interactions among multiple droplets. The complexity of sessile droplet evaporation arises from the interplay between physical forces, environmental conditions, and the properties of the liquid itself. Mathematical models have been instrumental in simplifying this complexity, offering predictions and explanations for observed behaviors. One of the foundational approaches is the diffusion-limited evaporation model, which assumes that the evaporation rate is governed by the diffusion of vapor molecules away from the droplet surface. This model has been validated in various studies, providing a baseline for understanding the evaporation process under different conditions (Deegan et al., 1997). The evaporation of sessile droplets can occur in different modes, primarily categorized into constant contact radius (CCR), constant contact angle (CCA), and mixed modes. Each mode has distinct implications for the droplet's shape and the rate of evaporation. Research has shown that the evaporation mode significantly affects the final deposition pattern of solutes within the droplet, which is crucial for applications in printing and coating technologies (Hu & Larson, 2002). Droplet lifetimes are another critical aspect of sessile droplet evaporation, with implications for the efficiency of processes such as cooling and drying. Mathematical models have been developed to predict droplet lifetimes based on initial conditions and environmental factors. These models take into account the evaporation rate, which can be influenced by temperature, humidity, and airflow (Picknett & Bexon, 1977). The deposition patterns left by evaporating droplets are of particular interest in the fields of materials science and biology. The 'coffee ring' effect, where particles are deposited at the edge of the droplet, is a well-documented phenomenon that has been extensively studied. Mathematical models have been employed to understand and control this effect, leading to advancements in the fabrication of thin films and the assembly of nanoparticles (Deegan et al., 2000). Finally, the interaction between multiple droplets introduces additional complexity to the evaporation process. The proximity of droplets can lead to changes in the local humidity and temperature, affecting the evaporation rate of each droplet. Studies have explored the collective behavior of droplet arrays, providing insights into the design of systems where multiple droplets are present, such as in microfluidic devices (Sefiane et al., 2008). In conclusion, the evaporation of sessile droplets is a rich field of study that benefits greatly from the application of mathematical models. These models have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of evaporation, the determination of droplet lifetimes, the formation of deposition patterns, and the interactions among multiple droplets. Future research directions may include the integration of more complex physical phenomena into existing models, such as the effects of surface roughness and chemical reactions, to further enhance our understanding and control of sessile droplet evaporation.", "References": [{"title": "Capillary flow as the cause of ring stains from dried liquid drops", "authors": "Robert D.
