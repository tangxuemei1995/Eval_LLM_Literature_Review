{"Literature Review": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of face masks in mitigating the spread of respiratory infections, particularly those caused by airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The effectiveness of face masks, however, is governed by a complex interplay of flow physics, material science, and human factors. This literature review delves into the flow physics of face masks, highlighting the key phenomena that determine their efficacy in filtering airborne particles and reducing transmission risks. The review synthesizes findings from experimental measurements and computational studies, offering insights into the challenges and open questions in the field. Respiratory aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in the functionality of face masks. When a person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets of varying sizes. The dynamics of these droplets, including their size distribution, velocity, and trajectory, are crucial for understanding how face masks can intercept and filter them. Studies have shown that larger droplets are more likely to be captured by the mask material due to inertial impaction, while smaller droplets may follow the airflow and be captured by mechanisms such as diffusion or electrostatic attraction (Duguid, 1946; Wells, 1934). The filtration efficiency of face masks is influenced by the properties of the mask material, including its porosity, fiber diameter, and electrostatic charge. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, for example, are designed to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns with high efficiency, leveraging a combination of mechanical and electrostatic filtration mechanisms (Hinds, 1999). However, the effectiveness of such materials in face masks can be compromised by factors such as mask fit, leakage, and the presence of moisture from exhaled breath (Rengasamy et al., 2010). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for studying the flow physics of face masks. These simulations can model the airflow patterns around and through the mask, providing insights into the distribution of pressure, velocity, and particle concentration. CFD studies have revealed that the fit of the mask significantly affects its performance, with gaps between the mask and the face leading to increased leakage of unfiltered air (Konda et al., 2020). Moreover, simulations have demonstrated that the shape and design of the mask can influence the airflow resistance and the wearer's comfort, which are important considerations for prolonged use (Tang et al., 2009). The interaction between respiratory droplets and the mask material is another critical aspect of face mask physics. When droplets impact the mask surface, they may be absorbed, rebound, or break up into smaller droplets. The outcome of this interaction depends on the droplet's size, velocity, and the surface properties of the mask material. Experimental studies have shown that hydrophobic coatings can reduce droplet absorption and minimize the risk of mask contamination (Borkow et al., 2010). However, the long-term effectiveness of such coatings under real-world conditions remains an area of active research. Human behavior and physiology also play a significant role in the effectiveness of face masks. Factors such as the frequency and duration of mask use, the manner in which the mask is worn, and the wearer's breathing patterns can all influence the mask's performance. For instance, improper mask wearing, such as leaving the nose uncovered, can significantly reduce the mask's effectiveness in filtering inhaled and exhaled air (MacIntyre et al., 2011). Additionally, the physiological response to wearing a mask, including changes in breathing resistance and carbon dioxide rebreathing, can affect the wearer's comfort and compliance (Roberge et al., 2012). Despite the advancements in understanding the flow physics of face masks, several open questions and technical challenges remain. One of the key challenges is the development of standardized testing methods to evaluate the performance of face masks under realistic conditions. Current testing protocols often do not account for the dynamic nature of respiratory emissions or the variability in human behavior (Rengasamy et al., 2017). Furthermore, there is a need for research into the environmental impact of face masks, particularly the disposal and degradation of mask materials. In conclusion, the flow physics of face masks is a multifaceted field that encompasses respiratory aerodynamics, filtration mechanisms, material science, and human factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of face masks in public health and spurred a surge in research aimed at understanding and improving their effectiveness. While significant progress has been made, ongoing research is essential to address the remaining challenges and ensure that face masks continue to serve as a vital tool in the fight against airborne infections.", "References": [{"title": "The size and the duration of air-carriage of respiratory droplets and droplet-nuclei", "authors": "Duguid, J.P.", "journal": "Journal of Hygiene", "year": "1946", "volumes": "44", "first page": "471", "last page": "479", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022172400019288"}, {"title": "On air-borne infection: study II.
