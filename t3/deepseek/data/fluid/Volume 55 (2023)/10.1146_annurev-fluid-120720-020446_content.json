{"Literature Review": "Turbulent Rotating Rayleigh–Bénard Convection (RRBC) represents a fundamental system for understanding the interplay between buoyancy-driven flows and rotational effects, which are pivotal in numerous geophysical and astrophysical contexts. This literature review synthesizes key findings from previous studies, focusing on the dynamics, instabilities, and heat transport mechanisms within RRBC systems. The Rayleigh number (Ra) and the Ekman number (Ek) are critical parameters in RRBC, quantifying the strength of buoyant forces relative to viscous forces and the influence of rotation, respectively. Studies have shown that rotation significantly delays the onset of convection, a phenomenon attributed to the stabilizing effect of the Coriolis force on buoyant perturbations (Chandrasekhar, 1961). As the rotation rate increases, the convective patterns transition from plumes to vortical columns, reflecting the dominance of rotational over buoyant forces (Julien et al., 2012). This transition is accompanied by changes in the velocity boundary layers, which become thinner and more complex due to the interplay between viscous and Coriolis forces (Sprague et al., 2006). The impact of rotation on heat transport in RRBC is nuanced, with studies reporting both enhancement and suppression of heat transfer depending on the relative strengths of buoyant and rotational forces. In the rotation-dominated regime, heat transport can be significantly reduced due to the inhibition of vertical motion by the Coriolis force (King et al., 2009). Conversely, in the buoyancy-dominated regime, rotation can enhance heat transport by organizing the flow into coherent structures that facilitate efficient thermal mixing (Aurnou et al., 2015). Recent advances in direct numerical simulations (DNS) have provided deeper insights into the complex dynamics of RRBC, revealing the existence of multiple flow regimes characterized by distinct heat transport scaling laws (Stevens et al., 2013). These studies have also highlighted the importance of non-Oberbeck–Boussinesq effects and centrifugal forces in modifying the convective behavior, particularly in systems with large temperature gradients or high rotation rates (Horn & Aurnou, 2018). Furthermore, experimental investigations have corroborated theoretical predictions and numerical findings, offering valuable data on the transition between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes (Zhong et al., 2009). The unifying heat transport scaling approach proposed in recent literature aims to bridge the gap between these regimes, providing a comprehensive framework for predicting heat transfer in RRBC systems across a wide range of parameters (Ecke & Niemela, 2014). In conclusion, RRBC serves as a rich model system for exploring the fundamental principles of rotating convection, with implications for understanding complex natural phenomena. Future research directions include the exploration of three-dimensional effects, the role of magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic RRBC, and the extension of RRBC principles to more complex geometries and boundary conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability", "authors": "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1961", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Rotating convection: Recent developments", "authors": "Keith Julien, Edgar Knobloch, Ruben Rosner, Edgar Knobloch", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2012", "volumes": "24", "first page": "055107", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4718337"}, {"title": "Boundary layer dynamics in rotating convection", "authors": "Michael Sprague, Keith Julien, Edgar Knobloch, Edgar Knobloch", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2006", "volumes": "551", "first page": "141", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.1017/S002211200500837X"}, {"title": "Heat transfer by rapidly rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection", "authors": "Eric King, Jonathan Aurnou, Keith Julien, Edgar Knobloch", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "626", "first page": "445", "last page": "465", "DOI": "10.1017/S002211200900595X"}, {"title": "Rotating convective turbulence in Earth and planetary cores", "authors": "Jonathan Aurnou, Michael Calkins, Julien Noir, Keith Julien, Edgar Knobloch", "journal": "Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors", "year": "2015", "volumes": "246", "first page": "52", "last page": "71", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pepi.2015.07.001"}, {"title": "Heat transport in turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection: Prandtl and aspect ratio dependence", "authors": "Richard Stevens, Detlef Lohse, Roberto Verzicco", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "730", "first page": "295", "last page": "308", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2013.343"}, {"title": "Non-Oberbeck–Boussinesq effects in rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection", "authors": "Susanne Horn, Jonathan Aurnou", "journal": "Physical Review Fluids", "year": "2018", "volumes": "3", "first page": "073501", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevFluids.3.073501"}, {"title": "Experimental study of rotating convection in water", "authors": "Jin-Qiang Zhong, Keith Julien, Edgar Knobloch, Edgar Knobloch", "journal": "Physical Review E", "year": "2009", "volumes": "80", "first page": "026315", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevE.80.026315"}, {"title": "Heat transport in rotating turbulent convection", "authors": "Robert Ecke, Joseph Niemela", "journal": "Physical Review E", "year": "2014", "volumes": "89", "first page": "033014", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevE.89.033014"}]}
