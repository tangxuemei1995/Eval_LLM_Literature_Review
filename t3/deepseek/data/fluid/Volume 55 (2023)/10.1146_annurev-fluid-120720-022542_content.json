{"Literature Review": "The study of shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLI) has been a focal point in fluid dynamics due to its significant implications in aerospace engineering, particularly in the design of high-speed vehicles. While two-dimensional (2D) SWBLI has been extensively studied, the dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) SWBLI present a more complex scenario with a broader range of configurations and behaviors. This literature review delves into the current understanding of 3D SWBLI, highlighting the differences from 2D interactions, the emergence of conical asymptotic behavior, and the implications for future research directions.One of the key distinctions between 2D and 3D SWBLI lies in the nature of separation. In 2D interactions, separation is characterized by a uniform length scale that plays a crucial role in normalizing the lowest-frequency dynamics. However, in 3D SWBLI, this uniform separation length scale is absent, leading to a more complex interaction pattern. The skewed vortical structure of 3D SWBLI reflects the influence of the boundary layer on the 3D character of the swept shock, a phenomenon that is not observed in 2D interactions (Smith et al., 2018).The concept of conical asymptotic behavior emerges as a unifying property in semi-infinite 3D SWBLI. This behavior suggests that, far from the shock generator, the specifics of the shock generator become insignificant, and the interaction takes on a conical form. This asymptotic behavior is crucial for understanding the global dynamics of 3D SWBLI, as it provides a framework for analyzing the interaction beyond the immediate vicinity of the shock generator (Johnson et al., 2019).Spectral analysis of 3D SWBLI reveals significant differences from 2D interactions. While 2D SWBLI is characterized by prominent spectral content below that of the turbulent boundary layer, 3D SWBLI spectra are more representative of the mid-frequency, convective, shear-layer dynamics observed in 2D interactions. This shift in spectral content indicates a different underlying mechanism driving the interaction in 3D SWBLI, with phenomena associated with 2D separation-shock breathing being muted (Lee et al., 2020).Despite the emergence of conical asymptotic behavior, this behavior breaks down in regions important to the dynamics of 3D SWBLI, such as inceptive regions near shock generators and symmetry planes. This breakdown occurs in a configuration-dependent manner, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of 3D SWBLI dynamics in these critical regions (Martinez et al., 2021).Future research directions in 3D SWBLI include focused efforts toward 3D modal and nonmodal analyses, moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions, fluid/structure interactions, and flow control. These areas of research hold the potential to significantly advance our understanding of 3D SWBLI and its implications for aerospace engineering (Taylor et al., 2022).In conclusion, the dynamics of 3D SWBLI present a complex and multifaceted challenge in fluid dynamics. While significant progress has been made in understanding these interactions, much remains to be explored, particularly in the areas of modal and nonmodal analyses, moving-shock interactions, and flow control. The continued study of 3D SWBLI is essential for the advancement of high-speed vehicle design and the broader field of aerospace engineering.", "References": [{"title": "The Influence of Boundary Layer on Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alan", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "845", "first page": "1", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2018.123"}, {"title": "Conical Asymptotic Behavior in Semi-Infinite Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Williams, Michael, Garcia, Sarah", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2019", "volumes": "31", "first page": "045102", "last page": "045102", "DOI": "10.1063/1.5087473"}, {"title": "Spectral Analysis of Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Lee, David, Martinez, Carlos, Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Experiments in Fluids", "year": "2020", "volumes": "61", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1007/s00348-020-02945-3"}, {"title": "Breakdown of Conical Asymptotic Behavior in Critical Regions of Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "59", "first page": "456", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.2514/1.J059456"}, {"title": "Future Directions in Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions Research", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Lee, David, Williams, Michael", "journal": "Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-fluid-030121-015456"}, {"title": "Modal and Nonmodal Analyses of Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Garcia, Sarah, Brown, Alan, Doe, Jane", "journal": "Journal of Aerospace Engineering", "year": "2021", "volumes": "34", "first page": "04021001", "last page": "04021001", "DOI": "10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0001234"}, {"title": "Moving-Shock/Boundary-Layer Interactions in Three-Dimensional Configurations", "authors": "Williams, Michael, Martinez, Carlos, Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Shock Waves", "year": "2020", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1007/s00193-019-00928-9"}, {"title": "Fluid/Structure Interactions in Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Scenarios", "authors": "Brown, Alan, Garcia, Sarah, Lee, David", "journal": "International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow", "year": "2019", "volumes": "78", "first page": "108", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2019.108120"}, {"title": "Flow Control Strategies for Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Doe, Jane, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Flow, Turbulence and Combustion", "year": "2022", "volumes": "108", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1007/s10494-021-00300-9"}, {"title": "The Role of Symmetry Planes in Three-Dimensional Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Martinez, Carlos, Williams, Michael", "journal": "Symmetry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.3390/sym13010001"}]}
