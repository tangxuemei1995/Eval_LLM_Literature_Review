{"Literature Review": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) have emerged as a pivotal computational framework for simulating fluid flows around complex geometries, leveraging the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian grids. The genesis of IBMs can be traced back to the early 1960s, a period marked by the nascent stage of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Despite the limited computational resources of the era, the foundational concepts of IBMs were laid, setting the stage for their evolution into a robust numerical tool in the new millennium (Peskin, 2002). The method's core principle involves embedding the boundary conditions of complex geometries within a Cartesian grid, thereby circumventing the need for body-fitted meshes and significantly reducing the computational overhead associated with mesh generation and adaptation (Mittal & Iaccarino, 2005).\n\nThe versatility of IBMs has been demonstrated across a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from biological flows to aerodynamics, where the interaction between fluid and structure plays a critical role. For instance, IBMs have been instrumental in simulating blood flow in the human cardiovascular system, providing insights into the hemodynamics of heart valves and arterial diseases (Peskin, 2002). Similarly, in the realm of aerodynamics, IBMs have facilitated the study of flow around complex aircraft geometries, contributing to the design optimization of wings and fuselages (Mittal & Iaccarino, 2005).\n\nDespite their widespread adoption, IBMs are not without limitations. One of the primary challenges lies in the accurate resolution of high-Reynolds number flows, particularly in the vicinity of solid boundaries where thin shear layers develop. The inherent isotropy of Cartesian grids in IBMs poses a significant hurdle in capturing these fine-scale flow features, necessitating the development of specialized wall models and local grid refinement strategies (Wang et al., 2008). These approaches aim to enhance the resolution of boundary layers without compromising the computational efficiency of IBMs, albeit with careful consideration of potential numerical artifacts.\n\nRecent advancements in IBM formulations have focused on addressing these limitations through the integration of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques and the development of physics-based wall models. AMR allows for the dynamic adjustment of grid resolution in regions of interest, such as boundary layers and wake regions, thereby improving the accuracy of flow predictions (Griffith & Patankar, 2020). On the other hand, physics-based wall models, derived from the underlying principles of turbulence and boundary layer theory, offer a more accurate representation of near-wall flow phenomena, reducing the reliance on empirical correlations (Bose & Moin, 2014).\n\nLooking ahead, the future of IBMs lies in their integration with emerging computational paradigms, such as machine learning and high-performance computing (HPC). Machine learning algorithms hold the promise of automating the selection of optimal IBM parameters and wall models, based on the specific characteristics of the flow problem at hand (Brunton et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the advent of exascale computing platforms offers unprecedented opportunities for scaling IBM simulations to tackle grand-challenge problems in fluid dynamics, such as global climate modeling and the design of next-generation aerospace vehicles (Keyes et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, Immersed Boundary Methods have come a long way since their inception, evolving into a versatile and efficient tool for simulating complex fluid flows. While challenges remain, particularly in the context of high-Reynolds number flows, ongoing research and technological advancements are poised to further enhance the capabilities of IBMs, opening new frontiers in computational fluid dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "The immersed boundary method", "authors": "Charles S.
