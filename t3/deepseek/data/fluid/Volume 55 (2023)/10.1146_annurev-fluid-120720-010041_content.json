{"Literature Review": "The first half of the twentieth century was a pivotal period for the development of fluid mechanics, particularly in France, where significant advancements were made despite the challenges posed by two world wars. This literature review explores the contributions of French scientists to fluid mechanics during this era, focusing on the role of the French Air Ministry, the establishment of research institutes, and the impact of these developments on the international stage. The review also examines the interplay between scientific progress and the socio-cultural context of the time. The French Air Ministry played a crucial role in the advancement of fluid mechanics in France. Starting in 1929, the Ministry established four Institutes of Fluid Mechanics and five teaching centers in faculties of science, providing substantial financial support and fostering an environment conducive to research and innovation (Darrigol, 2005). These institutes became hubs for groundbreaking work in areas such as boundary layers and turbulence, which were critical to the development of aeronautics. The 1930s, in particular, were a fruitful decade for fluid mechanics in France. During this period, French scientists made significant contributions to the understanding of fluid dynamics, which were instrumental in the design and improvement of aircraft (Guillen, 2004). The work of researchers such as Henri Villat and Joseph Pérès, who focused on the mathematical foundations of fluid mechanics, laid the groundwork for future advancements in the field (Villat, 1930; Pérès, 1936). The establishment of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) in 1946 marked a significant milestone in the international recognition of French contributions to fluid mechanics. France played a prominent role in the creation of IUTAM, reflecting the country's leadership in the field and the impact of its research institutes (Batchelor, 1996). The socio-cultural context of the first half of the twentieth century also influenced the development of fluid mechanics in France. The two world wars created a pressing need for advancements in aeronautics, driving research and innovation in fluid dynamics (Anderson, 1997). Additionally, the strengthening of international relationships during this period facilitated the exchange of ideas and collaboration among scientists from different countries (Eckert, 2006). Despite the significant contributions of French scientists to fluid mechanics in the first half of the twentieth century, their work is often underrepresented in modern textbooks. This oversight may be attributed to the dominance of other scientific traditions, particularly those from Germany and the United States, in the narrative of fluid mechanics history (Darrigol, 2005). However, a closer examination of contemporary documents, such as PhD theses, journals, and correspondence, reveals the remarkable achievements of French researchers during this period. In conclusion, the first half of the twentieth century was a transformative period for fluid mechanics in France, marked by significant advancements and international recognition. The establishment of research institutes by the French Air Ministry, the contributions of pioneering scientists, and the socio-cultural context of the time all played a crucial role in shaping the field. Despite being underrepresented in modern textbooks, the work of French scientists during this era laid the foundation for future developments in fluid mechanics and aeronautics.", "References": [{"title": "Worlds of Flow: A History of Hydrodynamics from the Bernoullis to Prandtl", "authors": "Olivier Darrigol", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Wright Brothers and the Birth of Aviation", "authors": "Michael Guillen", "journal": "Harper Perennial", "year": "2004", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Leçons sur les mouvements des fluides visqueux", "authors": "Henri Villat", "journal": "Gauthier-Villars", "year": "1930", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Mécanique des fluides", "authors": "Joseph Pérès", "journal": "Masson et Cie", "year": "1936", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Life and Legacy of G.I.
