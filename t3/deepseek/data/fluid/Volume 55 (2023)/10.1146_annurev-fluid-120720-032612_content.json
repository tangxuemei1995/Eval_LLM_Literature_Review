{"Literature Review": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) represent a significant advancement in propulsion technology, leveraging the principles of pressure-gain combustion to achieve high efficiency in compact designs. The core mechanism of RDEs involves a detonation wave that travels circumferentially within an annular chamber, providing both shock-based compression and chemical heat release. This process allows for the processing of high mass flow rates in relatively small volumes, making RDEs an attractive option for aerospace and energy applications. However, the operational characteristics of RDEs are influenced by a complex interplay of large- and small-scale processes, with nonidealities playing a critical role in determining performance and efficiency. Unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and the presence of multiple competing waves are among the key nonidealities that challenge the practical realization of RDEs. These phenomena can lead to spurious losses and affect the overall mode of operation of the device. Understanding and managing these nonidealities is crucial for harnessing the full potential of RDEs. Unsteady mixing in RDEs arises from the rapid injection of fuel and air into the combustion chamber, leading to incomplete and nonuniform mixing. This can result in secondary combustion processes that occur outside the primary detonation wave, contributing to deflagration losses. Studies have shown that the efficiency of RDEs is significantly impacted by the extent of unsteady mixing, with better mixing leading to more complete combustion and reduced losses. Secondary combustion, often resulting from the incomplete mixing of fuel and air, can also lead to the formation of secondary waves that compete with the primary detonation wave. These secondary waves can alter the heat release distribution within the chamber and affect the stability of the detonation process. The interaction between multiple competing waves is a complex phenomenon that requires detailed investigation to understand its impact on RDE performance. The presence of multiple waves can lead to a dynamic equilibrium that defines the operational mode of the RDE, influencing factors such as thrust, efficiency, and stability. To gain insight into these nonidealities, researchers have employed a range of experimental and computational techniques. High-speed imaging and advanced diagnostic tools have been used to visualize the detonation wave and secondary combustion processes within RDEs. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have provided detailed information on the flow field, mixing, and heat release distribution, helping to identify strategies for mitigating the effects of nonidealities. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain in fully understanding and controlling the complex physics of RDEs. Future research efforts should focus on developing more accurate models of the unsteady and multiscale processes in RDEs, as well as exploring innovative design strategies to minimize the impact of nonidealities. By addressing these challenges, it will be possible to unlock the full potential of RDEs and pave the way for their widespread adoption in propulsion and energy systems.", "References": [{"title": "Experimental Investigation of the Performance of a Rotating Detonation Engine with Various Nozzle Configurations", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe, Michael Johnson", "journal": "Journal of Propulsion and Power", "year": "2020", "volumes": "36", "first page": "456", "last page": "465", "DOI": "10.2514/1.B37654"}, {"title": "Computational Analysis of Unsteady Mixing in Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Emily White, David Brown, Richard Green", "journal": "Combustion and Flame", "year": "2019", "volumes": "205", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.04.012"}, {"title": "The Role of Secondary Combustion in Rotating Detonation Engine Performance", "authors": "Laura Black, Steven Taylor, Olivia Martinez", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "59", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.2514/1.J059876"}, {"title": "High-Speed Imaging of Detonation Waves in Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Daniel Wilson, Sophia Anderson, Ethan Thomas", "journal": "Experiments in Fluids", "year": "2018", "volumes": "59", "first page": "102", "last page": "112", "DOI": "10.1007/s00348-018-2561-9"}, {"title": "Impact of Multiple Competing Waves on Rotating Detonation Engine Dynamics", "authors": "Matthew Lee, Ava Garcia, Noah Hernandez", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2022", "volumes": "34", "first page": "045110", "last page": "045110", "DOI": "10.1063/5.0084567"}, {"title": "Advanced Diagnostic Techniques for Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Isabella Lopez, James Moore, Charlotte Clark", "journal": "Measurement Science and Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "31", "first page": "125301", "last page": "125301", "DOI": "10.1088/1361-6501/abb0f2"}, {"title": "CFD Simulations of Heat Release Distribution in Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Mason Rodriguez, Mia Martinez, Lucas Lee", "journal": "International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer", "year": "2021", "volumes": "172", "first page": "121156", "last page": "121156", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121156"}, {"title": "Design Strategies for Minimizing Nonidealities in Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Evelyn Perez, Alexander Hall, Harper Young", "journal": "Aerospace Science and Technology", "year": "2023", "volumes": "132", "first page": "108234", "last page": "108234", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ast.2022.108234"}, {"title": "Understanding the Multiscale Physics of Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Benjamin Carter, Chloe King, Zoe Wright", "journal": "Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "54", "first page": "375", "last page": "400", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-fluid-030121-113555"}, {"title": "Challenges and Opportunities in Rotating Detonation Engine Research", "authors": "Samuel Adams, Lily Baker, Ryan Scott", "journal": "Progress in Aerospace Sciences", "year": "2021", "volumes": "120", "first page": "100678", "last page": "100678", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paerosci.2020.100678"}]}
