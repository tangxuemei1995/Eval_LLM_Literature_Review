{"Literature Review": "Elasto-Inertial Turbulence (EIT) represents a fascinating and complex phenomenon that occurs in the presence of minute concentrations of polymers in wall-bounded flows. Unlike the well-documented phenomenon of polymer drag reduction, EIT has garnered less attention despite its potential to shed light on the intricate dynamics of viscoelastic fluids. This literature review aims to consolidate recent advancements in the understanding of EIT, emphasizing its distinctions from Newtonian/inertial turbulence, and exploring its connections to elastic turbulence and polymer drag reduction. The exploration of EIT is not only crucial for comprehending the behavior of viscoelastic fluids but also for enhancing our understanding of complex flow phenomena in various industrial and natural settings. Recent studies have employed a combination of experimental, numerical, and theoretical approaches to unravel the mechanisms underlying EIT. Experiments have revealed that EIT is characterized by a chaotic state driven by polymer dynamics, observable across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. This chaotic state involves an unconventional energy transfer mechanism, where energy is transferred from small elastic scales to larger flow scales, contrasting the energy cascade observed in Newtonian turbulence. Numerical simulations have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of EIT. By employing viscoelastic models, researchers have been able to simulate the onset and development of EIT, providing insights into the instabilities and coherent structures that define this turbulent state. These simulations have highlighted the importance of polymer elasticity in driving the transition to EIT, distinguishing it from the purely inertial mechanisms of Newtonian turbulence. Theoretical studies have focused on identifying the instabilities that lead to the emergence of EIT. It has been proposed that EIT arises from a complex interplay between elastic and inertial forces, leading to a new class of instabilities that are not observed in Newtonian fluids. These instabilities are thought to be responsible for the self-sustaining mechanism of EIT, which remains a subject of ongoing research. The investigation of EIT also offers valuable insights into related phenomena such as elastic turbulence and polymer drag reduction. Elastic turbulence, characterized by chaotic flow at low Reynolds numbers, shares some similarities with EIT, particularly in the role of polymer elasticity in driving flow instabilities. However, the mechanisms and characteristics of these two phenomena differ significantly, highlighting the complexity of viscoelastic flows. Polymer drag reduction, on the other hand, is a well-known effect where the addition of polymers to a turbulent flow results in a significant reduction in friction drag. The relationship between EIT and polymer drag reduction is still not fully understood, but it is believed that the mechanisms underlying EIT could provide clues to the maximum drag reduction asymptote observed in polymer solutions. Despite the progress made in understanding EIT, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is unraveling the self-sustaining mechanism of EIT, which requires a deeper understanding of the interactions between elastic and inertial forces. Additionally, the development of more accurate viscoelastic models and numerical methods is essential for capturing the complex dynamics of EIT. In conclusion, the study of Elasto-Inertial Turbulence is a rapidly evolving field that holds great promise for advancing our understanding of viscoelastic flows. By bridging the gap between elastic turbulence and polymer drag reduction, EIT offers a unique perspective on the complex interplay between elasticity and inertia in turbulent flows. Future research efforts should focus on addressing the remaining challenges in this field, paving the way for new discoveries and applications in fluid dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Elasto-inertial turbulence", "authors": "V.
