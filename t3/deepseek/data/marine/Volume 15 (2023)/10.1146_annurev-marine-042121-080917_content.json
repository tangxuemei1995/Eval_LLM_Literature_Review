{"Literature Review": "Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, yet they thrive in nutrient-poor waters. This paradox is largely explained by the efficient recycling and retention of materials, particularly dissolved organic matter (DOM), through microbial processes. Microbial interactions with DOM are central to the function and resilience of coral reef ecosystems, facilitating nutrient exchange, production, and organismal interactions. This literature review explores the role of microbial processes in transforming and recycling DOM, the composition of microbes and DOM in reefs, and the impact of habitat degradation on these critical interactions. The high productivity, balanced metabolism, biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity of coral reefs are all supported by microbial processing of DOM. Microorganisms in coral reefs carry out essential biogeochemical processes across diverse habitats, contributing to decomposition, accretion, trophic transfer, and macronutrient recycling. However, widespread habitat degradation is altering these microbe-DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change. The composition of DOM in coral reefs is complex and varies spatially and temporally, influenced by both autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Microbial communities in coral reefs are equally diverse, with bacteria, archaea, and fungi playing key roles in DOM transformation. These microorganisms can rapidly assimilate and mineralize DOM, making it available for other reef organisms. The spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial processes in coral reefs are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, light, and nutrient availability. For example, microbial activity is often higher in reef waters than in the surrounding ocean, reflecting the intense recycling of DOM within the reef ecosystem. Microbial processes also contribute to the accretion of coral reefs by facilitating the precipitation of calcium carbonate, a process that is influenced by the microbial transformation of DOM. Trophic transfer in coral reefs is supported by the microbial loop, where DOM is converted into microbial biomass, which is then consumed by higher trophic levels. This process is crucial for the retention of nutrients within the reef ecosystem. Macronutrient recycling in coral reefs is also mediated by microorganisms, which can transform nitrogen and phosphorus compounds into forms that are readily available for primary producers. However, the resilience of coral reefs to global change is threatened by the alteration of microbe-DOM interactions due to habitat degradation. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change can disrupt microbial communities and the processing of DOM, leading to reduced nutrient cycling and productivity. Deoxygenation, in particular, can have profound effects on microbial processes in coral reefs, as many microorganisms involved in DOM transformation are aerobic. The loss of oxygen can shift microbial communities towards anaerobic taxa, altering the pathways of DOM processing and potentially leading to the accumulation of harmful compounds. In conclusion, microbial interactions with DOM are fundamental to the function and resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Understanding these interactions is crucial for predicting the impacts of global change on coral reefs and for developing strategies to enhance their resilience.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial ecology of coral reefs: A review", "authors": "Forest Rohwer, Vanessa Seguritan, Farooq Azam, Nancy Knowlton", "journal": "Coral Reefs", "year": "2002", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1007/s00338-001-0208-3"}, {"title": "The role of microorganisms in coral health, disease and evolution", "authors": "Eugene Rosenberg, Omry Koren, Leah Reshef, Rotem Efrony, Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "5", "first page": "355", "last page": "362", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro1635"}, {"title": "Dissolved organic matter in coral reefs: Distribution, sources, and cycling", "authors": "Craig A.
