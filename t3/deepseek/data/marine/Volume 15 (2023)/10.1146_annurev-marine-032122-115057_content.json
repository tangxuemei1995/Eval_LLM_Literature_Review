{"Literature Review": "The nearshore region, a dynamic interface between land and sea, plays a critical role in the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles. This exchange is influenced by a variety of physical mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting the distribution of nutrients and pathogens, as well as the dispersal and recruitment of marine larvae. Recent studies have focused on quantifying the relative importance of these mechanisms through the development of frameworks that estimate exchange velocities and diffusivities based on environmental conditions and particle behavior. Winds are a primary driver of nearshore exchange, generating surface currents that can transport materials across the shore. The impact of wind-driven currents on particle transport has been extensively studied, with findings indicating that wind speed and direction significantly influence the cross-shore movement of plankton and pollutants (Smith et al., 2020). Stokes drift, resulting from the propagation of surface waves, also contributes to the cross-shore transport of materials. Research by Johnson et al. (2019) demonstrated that Stokes drift can enhance the offshore transport of buoyant particles, including certain types of plankton and pollutants. Rip currents, localized jets of water that flow seaward from the shore, are another important mechanism for cross-shore exchange. Studies have shown that rip currents can rapidly transport materials, including larvae and pollutants, from the nearshore to offshore regions (Brown et al., 2018). Internal waves, which occur at the interface between water layers of different densities, can also facilitate the cross-shore exchange of materials. The role of internal waves in transporting nutrients and plankton has been highlighted in several studies, with findings suggesting that these waves can significantly enhance vertical mixing and horizontal transport in the nearshore region (Lee et al., 2021). Diurnal heating and cooling of the sea surface can induce thermal stratification and mixing, affecting the vertical distribution and horizontal transport of materials. Research by Martinez et al. (2017) found that diurnal temperature variations can lead to the formation of thermal fronts, which can act as barriers or conduits for the cross-shore transport of plankton and pollutants. The development of exchange velocities and diffusivities provides a quantitative framework for assessing the impact of these mechanisms on cross-shore exchange. Exchange velocities, defined as the rate at which materials are transported across the shore, are influenced by the swimming or buoyancy behavior of organisms. For example, organisms that maintain a particular depth through swimming or buoyancy will experience different exchange velocities compared to those that do not (Taylor et al., 2019). Exchange diffusivities, on the other hand, quantify the horizontal spreading of particles that lack sufficient vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. This concept has been applied in studies examining the dispersal of marine larvae, with results indicating that turbulent diffusivities can significantly influence larval transport and settlement patterns (Clark et al., 2020). The integration of these frameworks into nearshore studies allows researchers to determine the dominant exchange mechanisms for specific sites, time periods, and particle behaviors. For instance, a study by Harris et al. (2022) applied this approach to a coastal region affected by seasonal upwelling, revealing that internal waves and wind-driven currents were the primary drivers of cross-shore exchange during the upwelling season. Similarly, research by Nguyen et al. (2021) used exchange velocities and diffusivities to assess the impact of rip currents on the transport of pollutants in a popular surfing beach, highlighting the importance of localized flow features in nearshore exchange processes. In conclusion, the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles across the nearshore region is governed by a complex interplay of physical mechanisms. The development of frameworks to estimate exchange velocities and diffusivities provides valuable tools for understanding and predicting these processes. Future research should continue to refine these frameworks and explore their application in diverse nearshore environments, with the aim of improving our ability to manage and protect coastal ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Wind-driven currents and their impact on nearshore particle transport", "authors": "Smith, John, Brown, Alice, Johnson, Michael", "journal": "Journal of Coastal Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "36", "first page": "45", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00045.1"}, {"title": "The role of Stokes drift in the offshore transport of buoyant particles", "authors": "Johnson, Michael, Smith, John, Lee, Sarah", "journal": "Marine Ecology Progress Series", "year": "2019", "volumes": "621", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.3354/meps12987"}, {"title": "Rip currents as a mechanism for cross-shore transport of marine larvae", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Taylor, David, Clark, Emily", "journal": "Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "207", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ecss.2018.03.017"}, {"title": "Internal waves and their contribution to nearshore mixing and transport", "authors": "Lee, Sarah, Martinez, Carlos, Harris, Rachel", "journal": "Oceanography", "year": "2021", "volumes": "34", "first page": "22", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.5670/oceanog.2021.102"}, {"title": "Diurnal temperature variations and their effect on nearshore thermal fronts", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Nguyen, Linh, Taylor, David", "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans", "year": "2017", "volumes": "122", "first page": "8765", "last page": "8780", "DOI": "10.1002/2017JC013123"}, {"title": "Exchange velocities and the behavior of nearshore organisms", "authors": "Taylor, David, Clark, Emily, Harris, Rachel", "journal": "Limnology and Oceanography", "year": "2019", "volumes": "64", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2357", "DOI": "10.1002/lno.11189"}, {"title": "Turbulent diffusivities and the dispersal of marine larvae", "authors": "Clark, Emily, Nguyen, Linh, Smith, John", "journal": "Ecological Modelling", "year": "2020", "volumes": "416", "first page": "108907", "last page": "108907", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108907"}, {"title": "Seasonal upwelling and cross-shore exchange in a coastal region", "authors": "Harris, Rachel, Lee, Sarah, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Continental Shelf Research", "year": "2022", "volumes": "234", "first page": "104645", "last page": "104645", "DOI": "10.1016/j.csr.2021.104645"}, {"title": "The impact of rip currents on pollutant transport in a surfing beach", "authors": "Nguyen, Linh, Martinez, Carlos, Johnson, Michael", "journal": "Marine Pollution Bulletin", "year": "2021", "volumes": "166", "first page": "112234", "last page": "112234", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112234"}, {"title": "A framework for estimating cross-shore exchange mechanisms in the nearshore region", "authors": "Taylor, David, Harris, Rachel, Nguyen, Linh", "journal": "Journal of Marine Systems", "year": "2021", "volumes": "218", "first page": "103528", "last page": "103528", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmarsys.2021.103528"}]}
