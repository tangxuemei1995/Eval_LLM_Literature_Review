{"Literature Review": "Pacific Decadal-Scale Variability (PDV) represents a significant component of the Earth's climate system, influencing global weather patterns, marine ecosystems, and the socio-economic activities dependent on them. The understanding of PDV has evolved over the years, with research focusing on identifying its modes and the mechanisms driving its variability. Traditionally, PDV modes have been defined through statistical patterns of variance, reflecting the ocean's integration of atmospheric forcing. This integration, or 'reddening', arises from shifts and changes in the strength of the climatological atmospheric circulation. However, these statistical patterns alone do not elucidate the dynamical processes underlying PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks operating on various timescales. Recent studies have employed empirical dynamical models constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies to better understand PDV. These models reveal that PDV modes of variance are primarily driven by two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific–central Pacific (NP-CP) mode and the Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) mode. The NP-CP mode captures variability on interannual to decadal scales, while the KOE mode is associated with the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including influences from the South Pacific. Both eigenmodes underscore the importance of two-way tropical–extratropical teleconnection dynamics in energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. This synthesis of past analyses highlights the complex interplay between atmospheric and oceanic processes in driving PDV, offering insights into the mechanisms that govern this critical aspect of the Earth's climate system.", "References": [{"title": "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Revisited", "authors": "Nathan J.
