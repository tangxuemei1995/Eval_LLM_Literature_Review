{"Literature Review": "Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal (OCDR) has emerged as a critical area of interest in the context of global climate change mitigation efforts. The ocean plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, acting as a significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has led to ocean acidification and other detrimental effects on marine ecosystems. OCDR strategies aim to enhance the ocean's natural capacity to sequester CO2, thereby mitigating climate change impacts. This literature review explores the sociotechnical considerations essential for the robust assessment and potential deployment of OCDR strategies, focusing on technical assessments, financial concerns, social issues, and ethical debates. Technical assessments of OCDR approaches are foundational to understanding their feasibility and potential impacts. Various methods, including ocean fertilization, alkalinity enhancement, and direct CO2 injection, have been proposed. Ocean fertilization, for instance, involves adding nutrients to the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth, which can sequester CO2 through photosynthesis. However, studies have raised concerns about unintended ecological consequences, such as harmful algal blooms and disruptions to marine food webs (Williamson et al., 2012). Alkalinity enhancement, which involves adding alkaline substances to the ocean to increase its CO2 absorption capacity, has shown promise but requires careful consideration of its long-term effects on marine chemistry and ecosystems (Kheshgi, 1995). Direct CO2 injection into the deep ocean has been explored as a method to store CO2 away from the atmosphere, but concerns about potential leakage and impacts on deep-sea ecosystems persist (Brewer et al., 1999). Financial considerations are crucial for the deployment of OCDR strategies. The costs associated with developing, implementing, and monitoring OCDR projects can be substantial. Climate finance mechanisms, such as carbon credits and international funding initiatives, may play a role in supporting OCDR efforts. However, the economic viability of OCDR projects depends on various factors, including technological readiness, scalability, and the availability of funding sources (Gattuso et al., 2018). Additionally, the potential for market-based mechanisms to drive OCDR deployment raises questions about equity and the distribution of financial benefits and burdens. Social issues, including public perception and stakeholder engagement, are critical for the successful implementation of OCDR strategies. Public acceptance of OCDR is influenced by perceptions of its safety, effectiveness, and ethical implications. Studies have shown that public awareness and understanding of OCDR are generally low, and there is a need for transparent communication and inclusive decision-making processes to build trust and support (Bellamy et al., 2019). Engaging diverse stakeholders, including local communities, indigenous groups, and environmental organizations, is essential to address concerns and ensure that OCDR projects are socially just and equitable. Ethical debates surrounding OCDR center on questions of responsibility, justice, and the potential for unintended consequences. The principle of 'do no harm' is a key ethical consideration, as OCDR interventions could have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and biodiversity. There are also concerns about the moral hazard of relying on OCDR as a climate mitigation strategy, potentially diverting attention and resources away from essential emissions reduction efforts (Preston, 2013). Furthermore, the global nature of the ocean raises questions about who has the right to implement OCDR and who bears the risks and benefits. In conclusion, OCDR presents a complex sociotechnical challenge that requires careful consideration of technical, financial, social, and ethical factors. Robust assessments and inclusive decision-making processes are essential to ensure that OCDR strategies are effective, equitable, and environmentally responsible. As the interest in OCDR continues to grow, it is imperative to address these considerations to guide its potential deployment as a climate change mitigation tool.", "References": [{"title": "Ocean fertilization for geoengineering: A review of effectiveness, environmental impacts and emerging governance", "authors": "Williamson, P., Wallace, D.W.R., Law, C.S., Boyd, P.W., Collos, Y., Croot, P., Denman, K., Riebesell, U., Takeda, S., Vivian, C.", "journal": "Process Safety and Environmental Protection", "year": "2012", "volumes": "90", "first page": "475", "last page": "488", "DOI": "10.1016/j.psep.2012.10.007"}, {"title": "Sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide by increasing ocean alkalinity", "authors": "Kheshgi, H.S.", "journal": "Energy", "year": "1995", "volumes": "20", "first page": "915", "last page": "922", "DOI": "10.1016/0360-5442(95)00035-F"}, {"title": "Direct experiments on the ocean disposal of fossil fuel CO2", "authors": "Brewer, P.G., Friederich, G., Peltzer, E.T., Orr, F.M.", "journal": "Science", "year": "1999", "volumes": "284", "first page": "943", "last page": "945", "DOI": "10.1126/science.284.5416.943"}, {"title": "Ocean solutions to address climate change and its effects on marine ecosystems", "authors": "Gattuso, J.P., Magnan, A., Bill√©, R., Cheung, W.W.L., Howes, E.L., Joos, F., Allemand, D., Bopp, L., Cooley, S.R., Eakin, C.M.", "journal": "Frontiers in Marine Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "5", "first page": "337", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fmars.2018.00337"}, {"title": "Public perceptions of geoengineering: Current status and future directions", "authors": "Bellamy, R., Lezaun, J., Palmer, J.", "journal": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "e580", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/wcc.580"}, {"title": "Ethics and geoengineering: Reviewing the moral issues raised by solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal", "authors": "Preston, C.J.", "journal": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change", "year": "2013", "volumes": "4", "first page": "23", "last page": "37", "DOI": "10.1002/wcc.198"}]}
