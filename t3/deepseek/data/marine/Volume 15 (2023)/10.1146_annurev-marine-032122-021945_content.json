{"Literature Review": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs) are among the most productive marine ecosystems on the planet, playing a crucial role in global ocean productivity and supporting a significant portion of the world's fisheries. These systems are characterized by the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, which fuels high primary productivity and supports complex food webs. However, the impacts of climate change on EBUSs are of growing concern, as they could alter the physical, biogeochemical, and ecological dynamics of these critical ecosystems. This literature review explores the current understanding of climate change impacts on EBUSs, focusing on observed changes, projected future scenarios, and the uncertainties that remain in predicting these impacts. Recent studies have highlighted a trend toward the intensification of upwelling in poleward regions of EBUSs, a phenomenon attributed to changes in wind patterns associated with global warming. This intensification could lead to increased nutrient supply to surface waters, potentially enhancing primary productivity in these regions. However, the effects of upwelling intensification are not uniformly positive. For example, increased upwelling can also lead to the shoaling of the mixed layer and enhanced water-column stratification, which may limit the vertical mixing of nutrients and reduce overall productivity in some areas. Furthermore, the warming of source waters due to climate change could mitigate the cooling effect of upwelling in near-coastal regions, altering the thermal habitat for marine species and potentially affecting their distribution and abundance. The biogeochemical impacts of climate change on EBUSs are also significant. Changes in upwelling intensity and source-water chemistry can affect the availability of essential nutrients, such as nitrate and iron, which are critical for phytoplankton growth. Additionally, the increased stratification of the water column can lead to the expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), which can have detrimental effects on marine life and alter the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in these ecosystems. Ecologically, the impacts of climate change on EBUSs are complex and multifaceted. Changes in primary productivity can cascade through the food web, affecting the abundance and distribution of zooplankton, fish, and top predators. Moreover, the combined effects of warming, acidification, and deoxygenation pose significant challenges to marine organisms, particularly those with limited mobility or narrow thermal tolerances. Despite these challenges, there is considerable uncertainty in how EBUSs will respond to climate change. The interactions between changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification are complex and not fully understood. Furthermore, regional differences in the physical and ecological characteristics of EBUSs mean that the impacts of climate change may vary significantly from one system to another. Future research efforts will need to address these uncertainties to improve our understanding of climate change impacts on EBUSs and to inform adaptive management strategies. This includes the development of more sophisticated models that can accurately simulate the complex interactions between physical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes in EBUSs. Additionally, long-term observational studies are essential for monitoring changes in these systems and validating model projections. In conclusion, while there is a growing body of evidence on the impacts of climate change on EBUSs, significant uncertainties remain. Addressing these uncertainties will be critical for predicting the future of these vital ecosystems and for developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on marine biodiversity and the services it provides to human society.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change impacts on eastern boundary upwelling systems", "authors": "Xochitl Cormon, Ryan R.
