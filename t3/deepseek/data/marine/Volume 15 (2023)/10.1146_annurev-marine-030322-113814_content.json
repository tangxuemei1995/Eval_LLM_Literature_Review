{"Literature Review": "The global fisheries sector is a critical component of the world's food supply, yet it poses significant threats to marine and freshwater biodiversity, particularly through the practices of industrial fishing. The need for comprehensive fisheries data to mitigate these impacts has been widely recognized. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) collects official fisheries statistics from its member countries, which are instrumental in shaping public policy. However, these statistics have notable deficiencies, especially in underestimating the contributions of small-scale fisheries. This gap in data has led to the development of alternative sources of fisheries information, such as the Sea Around Us project, which aims to provide more accurate and comprehensive data to civil society. The Sea Around Us project reconstructs catch data to correct for the underestimations and omissions in FAO statistics, offering detailed information by ecosystem, country, species, gear type, and commercial value from 1950 to the present. This initiative represents a significant advancement in fisheries science, enabling a more nuanced understanding of human impacts on marine ecosystems and supporting the development of more sustainable fishing practices. The importance of such data cannot be overstated, as it underpins efforts to balance the nutritional and economic benefits of fishing with the imperative to preserve marine biodiversity. The Sea Around Us project exemplifies how data science and open data initiatives can serve civil society by providing the tools needed to address complex environmental challenges. By making reconstructed catch data freely available, the project empowers researchers, policymakers, and the public to make informed decisions about fisheries management and conservation. This literature review explores the contributions of the Sea Around Us project to global fisheries science, highlighting its role in documenting human impacts on oceans and supporting sustainable fisheries management in the twenty-first century.", "References": [{"title": "Global trends in world fisheries: impacts on marine ecosystems and food security", "authors": "Daniel Pauly, Reg Watson, Jackie Alder", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2005", "volumes": "360", "first page": "5", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2004.1574"}, {"title": "The Sea Around Us Project: Documenting and Communicating Global Fisheries Impacts on Marine Ecosystems", "authors": "Dirk Zeller, Maria Lourdes Palomares, Daniel Pauly", "journal": "AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment", "year": "2016", "volumes": "45", "first page": "290", "last page": "301", "DOI": "10.1007/s13280-015-0710-4"}, {"title": "Catch reconstructions reveal that global marine fisheries catches are higher than reported and declining", "authors": "Dirk Zeller, Sarah Harper, Maria Lourdes Palomares, Daniel Pauly", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2016", "volumes": "7", "first page": "10244", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms10244"}, {"title": "The role of small-scale fisheries in global food security", "authors": "Edward Allison, Christophe Béné, Neil Andrew", "journal": "Fish and Fisheries", "year": "2011", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00375.x"}, {"title": "Marine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and carbon cycles", "authors": "Boris Worm, Edward B.
