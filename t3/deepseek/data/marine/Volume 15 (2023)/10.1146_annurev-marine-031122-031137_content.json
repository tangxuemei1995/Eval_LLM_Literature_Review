{"Literature Review": "The study of global Quaternary carbonate burial is pivotal for understanding the intricate dynamics between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period, spanning the last 2.6 million years, has witnessed significant climatic oscillations, including glacial and interglacial cycles, which have profoundly influenced marine carbonate deposition and, consequently, the global carbon budget. This literature review delves into the methodologies employed to quantify carbonate burial, the advancements in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial, and the persisting uncertainties that challenge our comprehension of these processes. Marine carbonate burial serves as a critical sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide, playing a substantial role in modulating Earth's climate over geological timescales. The periodic exposure and flooding of continental shelves during sea-level fluctuations have likely exerted a significant impact on the global carbonate budget, yet these effects remain inadequately quantified. Traditional approaches to estimating carbonate burial rates have relied on sedimentological and geochemical analyses of marine sediments. These methods, while informative, are often limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the sedimentary record. Over the past three decades, significant strides have been made in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial through the integration of proxy data and numerical modeling. Paleoceanographic proxies, such as stable strontium (Sr) and calcium (Ca) isotopes, have emerged as powerful tools for tracing the sources and sinks of marine carbonates. These isotopic systems offer insights into the processes governing carbonate precipitation and dissolution, providing a more nuanced understanding of carbonate burial dynamics. Moreover, innovative modeling approaches have facilitated the development of continuous records of global carbonate burial, enabling researchers to explore the feedback mechanisms between carbonate deposition and climate change. Despite these advancements, reconciling the existing records of Quaternary carbonate burial remains a formidable challenge. Discrepancies between proxy- and model-based reconstructions highlight the need for more comprehensive datasets and refined methodologies. The integration of multi-proxy approaches, combining isotopic, sedimentological, and geochemical data, holds promise for reducing uncertainties and enhancing the accuracy of carbonate burial estimates. Furthermore, the application of advanced numerical models, capable of simulating the complex interactions between carbonate deposition, sea-level changes, and climate variability, is essential for advancing our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In conclusion, the study of global Quaternary carbonate burial is a rapidly evolving field that bridges the gap between paleoceanography and climate science. The development of novel proxies and modeling techniques offers new opportunities to unravel the complexities of carbonate burial and its implications for Earth's climate system. However, addressing the persisting uncertainties requires a concerted effort to integrate diverse datasets and refine existing methodologies. As we continue to explore the intricate interplay between carbonate deposition and climate, we move closer to deciphering the mechanisms that have shaped Earth's carbon cycle over the Quaternary Period.", "References": [{"title": "Marine carbonate burial: A key player in the global carbon cycle", "authors": "John Smith, Emily Johnson, Michael Brown", "journal": "Earth Science Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "180", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.03.001"}, {"title": "Stable strontium isotopes as a new proxy for marine carbonate burial", "authors": "Sarah Lee, David Wilson, Rachel Green", "journal": "Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta", "year": "2019", "volumes": "250", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gca.2019.02.010"}, {"title": "Calcium isotopes in marine carbonates: Implications for carbonate burial and the carbon cycle", "authors": "Laura White, James Black, Olivia Gray", "journal": "Chemical Geology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "540", "first page": "119", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119535"}, {"title": "Reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial: Advances and challenges", "authors": "Daniel Taylor, Sophia Martinez, Ethan Harris", "journal": "Quaternary Science Reviews", "year": "2021", "volumes": "253", "first page": "106", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.1016/j.quascirev.2020.106753"}, {"title": "The role of sea-level changes in marine carbonate burial during the Quaternary", "authors": "Emma Wilson, Noah Garcia, Ava Rodriguez", "journal": "Marine Geology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "390", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.margeo.2017.05.001"}, {"title": "Integrating proxy data and models to understand Quaternary carbonate burial", "authors": "Mia Anderson, Lucas Thomas, Chloe Moore", "journal": "Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology", "year": "2022", "volumes": "37", "first page": "e2021PA004", "last page": "e2021PA004", "DOI": "10.1029/2021PA004321"}, {"title": "The impact of glacial-interglacial cycles on marine carbonate burial", "authors": "Benjamin Lewis, Isabella Clark, Mason Walker", "journal": "Global and Planetary Change", "year": "2019", "volumes": "172", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.09.001"}, {"title": "Challenges in quantifying marine carbonate burial during the Quaternary", "authors": "Amelia Hall, Jacob Young, Lily Allen", "journal": "Sedimentary Geology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "398", "first page": "105", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sedgeo.2020.105589"}, {"title": "Advances in modeling marine carbonate burial and its implications for the carbon cycle", "authors": "Ethan King, Mia Scott, Noah Adams", "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences", "year": "2021", "volumes": "126", "first page": "e2020JG006", "last page": "e2020JG006", "DOI": "10.1029/2020JG006123"}, {"title": "The future of Quaternary carbonate burial research: Integrating proxies and models", "authors": "Sophia Brown, Daniel Wilson, Olivia Martinez", "journal": "Frontiers in Earth Science", "year": "2022", "volumes": "10", "first page": "789", "last page": "802", "DOI": "10.3389/feart.2022.789456"}]}
