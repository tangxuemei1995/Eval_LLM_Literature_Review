{"Literature Review": "The study of nitrogen isotopes within fossilized biominerals offers a unique window into the past, providing insights into the nitrogen cycle, ocean biogeochemistry, and global climate dynamics. Nitrogen, being a fundamental element for biological productivity, plays a crucial role in the Earth's ecosystems. The isotopic composition of nitrogen encapsulated in fossil biominerals, such as diatoms, foraminifera, and corals, serves as a valuable proxy for reconstructing past environmental conditions and understanding the mechanisms driving changes in the nitrogen cycle over time. Recent advancements in analytical techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen, thereby expanding the scope of paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic research. This literature review focuses on the utility of nitrogen isotopes in diatoms, foraminifera, and corals as proxies for reconstructing past nitrogen cycling, highlighting key findings and future directions in this field. Diatoms, as primary producers in the ocean, incorporate nitrogen from their surrounding environment into their silica frustules. The nitrogen isotopic composition (δ15N) of diatom-bound organic matter has been used to infer past changes in nitrate utilization, nitrogen sources, and the extent of nitrogen fixation in the surface ocean. Studies have demonstrated that diatom δ15N records can provide high-resolution evidence for anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to the oceans, as well as insights into glacial-interglacial variations in the marine nitrogen inventory. For example, Sigman et al. (1999) utilized diatom δ15N to reconstruct nitrate utilization in the Southern Ocean, revealing significant changes in response to glacial-interglacial cycles. Similarly, Robinson et al. (2004) employed diatom δ15N to assess the impact of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on marine ecosystems, highlighting the sensitivity of the nitrogen cycle to human activities. Foraminifera, another group of marine microorganisms, incorporate nitrogen into their calcium carbonate shells. The δ15N of foraminiferal-bound organic matter has been used to reconstruct past variations in the nitrogen isotopic composition of seawater, providing insights into the global nitrogen cycle and its response to climate change. Studies have shown that foraminiferal δ15N records can capture changes in the nitrogen inventory of the ocean, as well as variations in nitrogen sources and processing. For instance, Altabet et al. (2002) used foraminiferal δ15N to reconstruct the nitrogen isotopic composition of the deep ocean during the last glacial maximum, revealing significant changes in the global nitrogen cycle. Additionally, Thunell et al. (2004) employed foraminiferal δ15N to investigate the impact of upwelling on nitrogen cycling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, demonstrating the utility of this proxy for understanding regional oceanographic processes. Corals, as long-lived marine organisms, incorporate nitrogen into their calcium carbonate skeletons, providing a continuous record of nitrogen isotopic variations over time. The δ15N of coral-bound organic matter has been used to reconstruct past changes in nitrogen sources, nutrient dynamics, and the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems. Studies have demonstrated that coral δ15N records can provide insights into the effects of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs, as well as variations in nitrogen cycling associated with climate change. For example, Heikoop et al. (2000) utilized coral δ15N to assess the impact of sewage discharge on coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the potential of this proxy for monitoring environmental change. Similarly, Marion et al. (2005) employed coral δ15N to reconstruct past variations in nitrogen sources in the Caribbean Sea, providing valuable information on the response of marine ecosystems to environmental perturbations. In conclusion, the study of nitrogen isotopes in fossilized biominerals, including diatoms, foraminifera, and corals, offers a powerful tool for reconstructing past variations in the nitrogen cycle and understanding its role in global biogeochemical cycles and climate dynamics. Future research in this field should focus on expanding method development, characterizing ecological and physiological variations, and exploring extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history. By leveraging the unique insights provided by fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes, we can enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between the nitrogen cycle, ocean biogeochemistry, and global climate.", "References": [{"title": "The isotopic composition of diatom-bound nitrogen in Southern Ocean sediments", "authors": "Daniel M.
