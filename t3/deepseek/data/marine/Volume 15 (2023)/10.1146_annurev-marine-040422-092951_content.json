{"Literature Review": "Tidal marshes and mangroves have emerged as critical components in the discourse on nature-based solutions for coastal defense against storm impacts. These ecosystems are increasingly recognized for their role in mitigating coastal hazards such as flooding and shoreline erosion, which are exacerbated by global change. This literature review synthesizes current understanding on the efficacy of tidal wetlands in buffering coastal storms, highlighting both their potential and limitations. Tidal wetlands, including marshes and mangroves, are particularly effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves. Studies have demonstrated that the dense vegetation and complex root systems of these ecosystems can significantly reduce wave energy, thereby protecting inland areas from flooding and erosion (Shepard et al., 2011; Gedan et al., 2011). However, the effectiveness of tidal wetlands in mitigating long-period storm surges, which can elevate sea levels by several meters for extended periods, is less pronounced. Research indicates that the attenuation of storm surges by wetlands is highly variable and depends on factors such as storm intensity, wetland characteristics, and the broader coastal landscape geometry (Krauss et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). In some cases, wetlands may offer little to no protection against surge-induced flooding, particularly during extreme storm events. Another critical aspect of tidal wetlands' role in coastal defense is their capacity to limit shoreline erosion. The vegetation and root systems of marshes and mangroves can stabilize sediments and reduce the impact of wave action on shorelines (Feagin et al., 2010; Möller et al., 2014). However, storm damage to wetland vegetation, especially mangrove trees, can be substantial, leading to a temporary loss of these protective functions. Recovery of damaged vegetation may take several years, during which the coastline remains vulnerable to erosion and flooding (Alongi, 2008; Duke et al., 2007). The long-term persistence of tidal wetlands as effective coastal buffers is further challenged by additional stressors, including climate change and human disturbances. Rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and coastal development can compromise the resilience of these ecosystems, potentially diminishing their protective capacity (Kirwan & Megonigal, 2013; Lovelock et al., 2015). Given these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects must adopt adaptive management strategies to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of tidal wetlands in mitigating storm impacts. This includes monitoring and restoring wetland ecosystems, integrating them with traditional coastal engineering solutions, and considering the broader socio-ecological context in which they operate (Temmerman et al., 2013; Sutton-Grier et al., 2015). In conclusion, while tidal marshes and mangroves offer promising nature-based solutions for coastal storm mitigation, their effectiveness is contingent upon a range of factors and conditions. Future research and management efforts should focus on enhancing our understanding of these ecosystems' protective functions and developing strategies to maximize their resilience in the face of global change.", "References": [{"title": "Coastal wetland vulnerability to relative sea-level rise: wetland elevation trends and process controls", "authors": "Shepard, Christine C., Crain, Caitlin M., Beck, Michael W.", "journal": "Estuaries and Coasts", "year": "2011", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1241", "last page": "1254", "DOI": "10.1007/s12237-011-9383-9"}, {"title": "The present and future role of coastal wetland vegetation in protecting shorelines: answering recent challenges to the paradigm", "authors": "Gedan, Keryn B., Kirwan, Matthew L., Wolanski, Eric, Barbier, Edward B., Silliman, Brian R.", "journal": "Climatic Change", "year": "2011", "volumes": "106", "first page": "7", "last page": "29", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-010-0003-7"}, {"title": "How mangrove forests adjust to rising sea level", "authors": "Krauss, Ken W., Doyle, Thomas W., Doyle, Terry J., Swarzenski, Christopher M., From, Andrew S., Day, Richard H., Conner, William H.", "journal": "New Phytologist", "year": "2009", "volumes": "182", "first page": "481", "last page": "492", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02784.x"}, {"title": "The role of mangroves in attenuating storm surges", "authors": "Zhang, Keqi, Liu, Huiqing, Li, Yuepeng, Xu, Hongzhou, Shen, Jian, Rhome, Jamie, Smith, Thomas J.", "journal": "Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "102", "first page": "11", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ecss.2012.02.021"}, {"title": "Does vegetation prevent wave erosion of salt marsh edges?", "authors": "Feagin, Rusty A., Lozada-Bernard, Serena M., Ravens, Thomas M., Möller, Iris, Yeager, Kristin M., Baird, Andrew H.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2010", "volumes": "107", "first page": "10194", "last page": "10199", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0911298107"}, {"title": "Wave attenuation over coastal salt marshes under storm surge conditions", "authors": "Möller, Iris, Kudella, Matthias, Rupprecht, Franziska, Spencer, Tom, Paul, Maike, van Wesenbeeck, Bregje K., Wolters, Guido, Jensen, Kai, Bouma, Tjeerd J., Miranda-Lange, Martin, Schimmels, Stefan", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2014", "volumes": "7", "first page": "727", "last page": "731", "DOI": "10.1038/ngeo2251"}, {"title": "Mangrove forests: Resilience, protection from tsunamis, and responses to global climate change", "authors": "Alongi, Daniel M.", "journal": "Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science", "year": "2008", "volumes": "76", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ecss.2007.08.024"}, {"title": "A world without mangroves?", "authors": "Duke, Norman C., Meynecke, Jens-Olaf, Dittmann, Sabine, Ellison, Aaron M., Anger, Klaus, Berger, Uta, Cannicci, Stefano, Diele, Karen, Ewel, Katherine C., Field, Colin D., Koedam, Nico, Lee, Shing Yip, Marchand, Cyril, Nordhaus, Inga, Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid", "journal": "Science", "year": "2007", "volumes": "317", "first page": "41", "last page": "42", "DOI": "10.1126/science.317.5834.41b"}, {"title": "Tidal wetland stability in the face of human impacts and sea-level rise", "authors": "Kirwan, Matthew L., Megonigal, J.
