{"Literature Review": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) represents a fascinating physiological process that allows microorganisms to interact with their environment in unique ways, particularly through the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond their cellular boundaries. This capability is not only crucial for the survival of certain bacteria but also has significant implications for biogeochemical cycles, bioenergy, and bioremediation. The pioneering studies on Shewanella and Geobacter species have laid the groundwork for understanding EET, revealing that these organisms can couple their growth to the reduction of extracellular iron or manganese oxide minerals. This process distinguishes EET from other forms of respiration by necessitating the transfer of electrons beyond the cell membrane, a challenge that has spurred extensive research into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in elucidating the conserved strategies that facilitate electron transfer from the inner membrane to the outer surface of these bacteria. However, emerging evidence suggests that the mechanisms enabling electron transfer to distant acceptors are more diverse and complex than previously understood. This literature review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on EET, with a particular focus on the processes occurring across the outer membrane and beyond, which enable the reduction of a wide range of minerals, electrodes, and even other organisms. The role of cytochromes and electron shuttles in facilitating EET has been a central theme in this research. Cytochromes, particularly those located in the outer membrane, have been identified as crucial components of the electron transfer chain in both Shewanella and Geobacter. These proteins facilitate the movement of electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface, where they can be transferred to extracellular acceptors. Additionally, electron shuttles, small molecules that can carry electrons between the cell and external acceptors, have been shown to play a significant role in EET. The diversity of these shuttles and their mechanisms of action are areas of active investigation, with recent studies highlighting the potential for novel shuttles to expand the range of electron acceptors that can be utilized by these bacteria. The implications of EET extend beyond the fundamental understanding of microbial physiology. The ability of Shewanella and Geobacter to transfer electrons to extracellular acceptors has been harnessed in various biotechnological applications, including microbial fuel cells and the bioremediation of contaminated environments. Moreover, the discovery of EET in a broader range of microorganisms suggests that this process may be more widespread than previously thought, opening new avenues for research and application. In conclusion, the study of EET in Shewanella and Geobacter has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of electron transfer beyond the cell membrane. While significant progress has been made, the diversity and complexity of these processes underscore the need for continued research. Understanding the full range of mechanisms and their implications will not only advance our knowledge of microbial physiology but also enhance our ability to harness these processes for biotechnological applications.", "References": [{"title": "Extracellular electron transfer mechanisms between microorganisms and minerals", "authors": "Lovley, Derek R.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "4", "first page": "651", "last page": "662", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro1492"}, {"title": "Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 uses overlapping pathways for iron reduction at a distance and by direct contact under conditions relevant for biofilms", "authors": "Ross, Daniel E., Brantley, Susan L., Tien, Ming", "journal": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "75", "first page": "4414", "last page": "4426", "DOI": "10.1128/AEM.00101-09"}, {"title": "Electron transfer by Desulfobulbus propionicus to Fe(III) and graphite electrodes", "authors": "Holmes, Dawn E., Bond, Daniel R., Lovley, Derek R.", "journal": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "70", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1237", "DOI": "10.1128/AEM.70.2.1234-1237.2004"}, {"title": "Microbial nanowires: a new paradigm for biological electron transfer and bioelectronics", "authors": "Reguera, Gemma, McCarthy, Kevin D., Mehta, Teena, Nicoll, Julie S., Tuominen, Mark T., Lovley, Derek R.", "journal": "ChemSusChem", "year": "2005", "volumes": "1", "first page": "417", "last page": "419", "DOI": "10.1002/cssc.200500013"}, {"title": "The role of outer membrane cytochromes in extracellular electron transfer by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1", "authors": "Myers, Charles R., Myers, Judith M.", "journal": "FEMS Microbiology Letters", "year": "2004", "volumes": "238", "first page": "219", "last page": "225", "DOI": "10.1016/j.femsle.2004.07.041"}, {"title": "Electron shuttling via humic acids in microbial iron(III) reduction in a freshwater sediment", "authors": "Lovley, Derek R., Coates, John D., Blunt-Harris, Elizabeth L., Phillips, Elizabeth J.P., Woodward, Joan C.", "journal": "FEMS Microbiology Ecology", "year": "1996", "volumes": "20", "first page": "237", "last page": "247", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1574-6941.1996.tb00322.x"}, {"title": "Extracellular electron transfer via microbial nanowires", "authors": "Gorby, Yuri A., Yanina, Svetlana, McLean, Jeffrey S., Rosso, Kevin M., Moyles, Dianne, Dohnalkova, Alice, Beveridge, Terry J., Chang, In Seop, Kim, Byung Hong, Kim, Kyung Shik, Culley, David E., Reed, Samantha B., Romine, Margaret F., Saffarini, Daad A., Hill, Eric A., Shi, Liang, Elias, Dwayne A., Kennedy, David W., Pinchuk, Grigoriy, Watanabe, Kazuya, Ishii, Shun'ichi, Logan, Bruce, Nealson, Kenneth H., Fredrickson, James K.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "441", "first page": "39", "last page": "42", "DOI": "10.1038/nature04702"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of electron transfer in the decaheme cytochrome MtrF", "authors": "Clarke, Thomas A., Edwards, Marcus J., Gates, Andrew J., Hall, Andrea, White, Gaye F., Bradley, Justin, Reardon, Catherine L., Shi, Liang, Beliaev, Alex S., Marshall, Matthew J., Wang, Zheming, Watmough, Nicholas J., Fredrickson, James K., Zachara, John M., Butt, Julea N., Richardson, David J.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "108", "first page": "9384", "last page": "9389", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1017200108"}, {"title": "Electron transfer in syntrophic communities of anaerobic bacteria and archaea", "authors": "Stams, Alfons J.M., Plugge, Caroline M.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "7", "first page": "568", "last page": "577", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro2166"}, {"title": "Syntrophic growth via quinone-mediated interspecies electron transfer", "authors": "Summers, Zarath M., Fogarty, Heather E., Leang, Ching, Franks, Ashley E., Malvankar, Nikhil S., Lovley, Derek R.", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2010.00001"}]}
