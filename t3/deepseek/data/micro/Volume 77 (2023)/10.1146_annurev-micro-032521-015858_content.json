{"Literature Review": "Candida auris has emerged as a formidable fungal pathogen, posing significant challenges to global health due to its multidrug resistance and high mortality rates. Since its first identification in 2009 in Japan, C. auris has rapidly spread across more than 40 countries, with mortality rates ranging from 30% to 60% (Satoh et al., 2009). This pathogen's ability to cause outbreaks in healthcare settings, particularly in nursing homes, is attributed to its efficient transmission through skin-to-skin contact (Chowdhary et al., 2013). The unique aspect of C. auris is its pronounced resistance to all major classes of antifungal drugs, including azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, making it the first fungal pathogen to exhibit such widespread resistance (Lockhart et al., 2017). The genome organization of C. auris reveals a complex genetic makeup that contributes to its drug resistance and pathogenicity. Studies have identified several genes associated with drug resistance, including those encoding efflux pumps and alterations in drug target sites (Rybak et al., 2019). Additionally, the role of MAP kinase signaling pathways in the regulation of stress responses and drug resistance in C. auris has been highlighted, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Lee et al., 2021). The cell wall composition of C. auris also plays a crucial role in its resistance mechanisms, with modifications in the cell wall structure contributing to reduced drug uptake and increased survival under stress conditions (Garcia-Effron et al., 2020). The rapid spread of C. auris is further exacerbated by its ability to persist on environmental surfaces and medical devices, facilitating its transmission in healthcare settings (Eyre et al., 2018). To combat the spread of C. auris, future research should focus on understanding the genetic basis of its drug resistance, developing novel antifungal agents, and implementing effective infection control measures. The exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies, such as targeting the MAP kinase signaling pathways and cell wall biosynthesis, could provide new avenues for the treatment of C. auris infections (Borman et al., 2020). In conclusion, the emergence of C. auris as a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen underscores the urgent need for comprehensive research and global collaboration to address this growing threat to public health.", "References": [{"title": "Candida auris sp. nov., a novel ascomycetous yeast isolated from the external ear canal of an inpatient in a Japanese hospital", "authors": "Kazuo Satoh, Koichi Makimura, Yayoi Hasumi, Yuko Nishiyama, Keiko Uchida, Hideyo Yamaguchi", "journal": "Microbiology and Immunology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "53", "first page": "41", "last page": "44", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1348-0421.2008.00083.x"}, {"title": "Multidrug-resistant Candida auris: 'new kid on the block' in hospital-associated infections?", "authors": "Anuradha Chowdhary, Cheshta Sharma, Jacques F.
