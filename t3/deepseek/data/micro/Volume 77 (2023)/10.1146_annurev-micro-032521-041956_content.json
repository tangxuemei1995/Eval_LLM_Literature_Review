{"Literature Review": "The study of microbiome assembly in fermented foods is a burgeoning field that intersects microbiology, ecology, and food science. Fermented foods, such as surface-ripened cheese, sourdough starters, and fermented vegetables, have been part of human diets for millennia, offering unique flavors, extended shelf-life, and enhanced nutritional profiles. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have enabled detailed surveys of microbial diversity across different fermented foods, shedding light on the complex microbial communities involved in these processes. However, understanding the mechanisms behind the assembly of these microbiomes has only recently gained momentum. This literature review explores the ecological and evolutionary principles guiding microbiome assembly in fermented foods, focusing on dispersal, selection, diversification, and drift as key processes. The integration of in situ sequencing surveys with in vitro models offers a promising approach to unravel the dynamics of microbial community assembly in fermented foods. Such insights not only enrich our understanding of microbial ecology but also provide practical strategies for managing and optimizing fermented food production. The exploration of microbiome assembly in fermented foods is not just an academic pursuit but a practical one, offering pathways to enhance food quality, safety, and sustainability. By applying ecological and evolutionary theories, food producers can gain new tools for controlling the microbial communities in their products, from the initial stages of production through to fermentation. This review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in advancing our understanding of fermented food microbiomes and underscores the potential for ecological and evolutionary principles to revolutionize food production practices.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial diversity and function in cheese: insights from molecular and metagenomic approaches", "authors": "Monica Gatti, Erasmo Neviani, Benedetta Bottari", "journal": "Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "98", "first page": "7765", "last page": "7775", "DOI": "10.1007/s00253-014-5931-0"}, {"title": "The sourdough microflora: biodiversity and metabolic interactions", "authors": "Marco Gobbetti, Carlo Giuseppe Rizzello, Raffaella Di Cagno, Maria De Angelis", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "16", "first page": "43", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2004.02.012"}, {"title": "Microbial ecology of fermented vegetables and non-alcoholic drinks and current knowledge on their impact on human health", "authors": "Svetoslav Dimitrov Todorov, Iskra Vitanova Ivanova, Bernadette Dora Gombossy de Melo Franco", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "5", "first page": "491", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2014.00491"}, {"title": "Ecological and evolutionary forces shaping microbial diversity in the human intestine", "authors": "Ruth E.
