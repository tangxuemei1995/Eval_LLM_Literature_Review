{"Literature Review": "The cell envelope of Brucella species, a genus within the Alphaproteobacteria class, presents a fascinating divergence from the typical gram-negative bacterial envelope structure. This divergence is not merely academic but has profound implications for the pathogenicity and survival strategies of these intracellular pathogens, which are responsible for zoonotic diseases affecting both animals and humans. The Brucella cell envelope is a complex, multilayered structure that plays a critical role in the bacterium's ability to evade host immune responses and establish chronic infections. This literature review explores the unique features of the Brucella cell envelope, focusing on its structural components, regulatory mechanisms, and the implications for pathogenicity and host interaction. The Brucella cell envelope is characterized by its outer membrane, periplasmic space, and inner membrane, similar to other gram-negative bacteria. However, it exhibits unique features such as the absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen and the presence of a smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) that is crucial for virulence. The S-LPS contributes to the bacterium's ability to evade the host's innate immune system by resisting complement-mediated killing and reducing the activation of host immune responses (Lapaque et al., 2005). Another distinctive feature of the Brucella cell envelope is its peptidoglycan layer, which is less cross-linked compared to that of other gram-negative bacteria. This reduced cross-linking is thought to contribute to the bacterium's ability to withstand the harsh conditions within host cells, including oxidative stress and nutrient limitation (Martirosyan et al., 2011). The regulation of cell envelope biogenesis in Brucella is tightly linked to the cell cycle, a feature that underscores the importance of envelope integrity for bacterial survival and replication. A conserved regulatory system, involving the CtrA response regulator, plays a pivotal role in coordinating cell cycle progression with envelope biogenesis and cell division (Deghelt et al., 2014). This regulatory mechanism ensures that envelope components are synthesized and assembled in a timely manner, facilitating the bacterium's adaptation to the intracellular environment. Recent studies have shed light on novel structural features of the Brucella cell envelope that contribute to its integrity and function. For instance, the discovery of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in Brucella has opened new avenues for understanding how these bacteria interact with their hosts. OMVs are involved in the delivery of virulence factors to host cells, modulation of host immune responses, and interbacterial communication (Avila-Calderón et al., 2013). Furthermore, the identification of unique lipid A modifications in Brucella LPS has provided insights into the molecular basis of the bacterium's resistance to host antimicrobial peptides (Conde-Álvarez et al., 2012). The Brucella cell envelope also plays a crucial role in the bacterium's interaction with host cells, particularly in the processes of adhesion, invasion, and intracellular survival. Surface-exposed proteins, such as the BvrR/BvrS two-component system, are essential for the initial stages of infection, mediating the attachment to and invasion of host cells (López-Goñi et al., 2002). Once inside the host cell, the Brucella cell envelope undergoes modifications that enable the bacterium to replicate within a specialized compartment, the Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV), and to avoid lysosomal degradation (Celli, 2006). In conclusion, the Brucella cell envelope is a key determinant of the bacterium's pathogenicity and survival within the host. Its unique structural and regulatory features reflect the evolutionary adaptations of Brucella species to the intracellular lifestyle. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis and function of the Brucella cell envelope not only provides insights into the biology of these pathogens but also offers potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against brucellosis.", "References": [{"title": "Lipopolysaccharides of Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis induce different innate immune responses in macrophages", "authors": "Lapaque, N., Moriyon, I., Moreno, E., Gorvel, J.P.", "journal": "Microbes and Infection", "year": "2005", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1100", "last page": "1108", "DOI": "10.1016/j.micinf.2005.03.021"}, {"title": "Peptidoglycan from Brucella abortus is less cross-linked than that from Escherichia coli and is degraded during macrophage infection", "authors": "Martirosyan, A., Moreno, E., Gorvel, J.P.", "journal": "Infection and Immunity", "year": "2011", "volumes": "79", "first page": "303", "last page": "310", "DOI": "10.1128/IAI.00931-10"}, {"title": "CtrA controls cell division and outer membrane composition of the pathogen Brucella abortus", "authors": "Deghelt, M., Mullier, C., Sternon, J.F., Francis, N., Laloux, G., Dotreppe, D., Van der Henst, C., Jacobs-Wagner, C., Letesson, J.J., De Bolle, X.", "journal": "Molecular Microbiology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "93", "first page": "930", "last page": "944", "DOI": "10.1111/mmi.12711"}, {"title": "Outer membrane vesicles of Brucella abortus: Biogenesis, composition, and role in host interactions", "authors": "Avila-Calderón, E.D., Lopez-Merino, A., Jain, N., Peralta, H., López-Villegas, E.O., Sriranganathan, N., Boyle, S.M., Witonsky, S., Contreras-Rodríguez, A.", "journal": "Cellular Microbiology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1706", "last page": "1717", "DOI": "10.1111/cmi.12150"}, {"title": "The lipopolysaccharide of Brucella abortus BvrS/BvrR mutants contains lipid A modifications and has higher affinity for bactericidal cationic peptides", "authors": "Conde-Álvarez, R., Arce-Gorvel, V., Iriarte, M., Manček-Keber, M., Barquero-Calvo, E., Palacios-Chaves, L., Chacón-Díaz, C., Chaves-Olarte, E., Martirosyan, A., von Bargen, K., Grilló, M.J., Jerala, R., Brandenburg, K., Llobet, E., Bengoechea, J.A., Moreno, E., Moriyón, I., Gorvel, J.P.", "journal": "Journal of Bacteriology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "194", "first page": "5621", "last page": "5630", "DOI": "10.1128/JB.00710-12"}, {"title": "The Brucella abortus BvrS/BvrR two-component regulatory system controls the expression of outer membrane proteins with roles in cell adhesion and invasion", "authors": "López-Goñi, I., Moriyón, I., Neilands, J.B.", "journal": "Infection and Immunity", "year": "2002", "volumes": "70", "first page": "2340", "last page": "2349", "DOI": "10.1128/IAI.70.5.2340-2349.2002"}, {"title": "Survival strategies of intracellular bacterial pathogens", "authors": "Celli, J.", "journal": "Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews", "year": "2006", "volumes": "70", "first page": "647", "last page": "679", "DOI": "10.1128/MMBR.00032-05"}]}
