{"Literature Review": "The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a sophisticated molecular machine that plays a pivotal role in the virulence of many pathogenic bacteria and in the motility of others. This system is central to the function of two distinct bacterial structures: the flagellum, which propels bacterial movement, and the injectisome, which facilitates the delivery of effector proteins into host cells. The evolutionary relationship between these two nanomachines has been a subject of considerable interest, with the injectisome hypothesized to have evolved from the flagellum, shedding motility functions while acquiring specialized components for pathogenesis (Aizawa, 2001). Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have provided unprecedented insights into the structural organization and functional mechanisms of the T3SS in both the flagellum and injectisome (Kuhlen et al., 2018). The flagellar T3SS is responsible for the secretion and assembly of flagellar components, a process that requires precise temporal and spatial regulation. Studies have revealed that the flagellar T3SS is composed of a basal body embedded in the bacterial membranes, a hook that acts as a universal joint, and a filament that extends into the extracellular environment (Minamino et al., 2008). The injectisome, on the other hand, shares a similar basal body structure but is distinguished by the presence of a needle complex that extends from the bacterial surface and is involved in the delivery of effector proteins into host cells (Cornelis, 2006). The structural similarities between the flagellar and injectisome T3SSs underscore their common evolutionary origin, while the differences highlight the functional specialization of the injectisome for pathogenesis. Cryo-EM and cryo-ET studies have been instrumental in elucidating the molecular architecture of these nanomachines, revealing the intricate details of their assembly and function. For instance, high-resolution structures of the Salmonella flagellar basal body and the Shigella injectisome have provided insights into the mechanisms of protein secretion and translocation (Worrall et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017). These studies have also shed light on the dynamic nature of the T3SS, demonstrating how conformational changes in the secretion apparatus facilitate the transport of substrates across the bacterial membranes. Furthermore, comparative analyses of the flagellar and injectisome T3SSs have identified key differences in their regulatory mechanisms and substrate specificity, reflecting their distinct biological roles (Diepold & Armitage, 2015). The injectisome, for example, has evolved additional components that enable it to recognize and translocate effector proteins into host cells, a capability that is absent in the flagellar T3SS. These findings have important implications for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and motility, as well as for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the T3SS. In conclusion, the structural and functional studies of the T3SS in the bacterial flagellum and injectisome have greatly advanced our knowledge of these complex nanomachines. The integration of cryo-EM and cryo-ET techniques has been particularly transformative, enabling the visualization of these systems at near-atomic resolution and providing new insights into their evolutionary relationships, assembly mechanisms, and functional diversity. As research in this field continues to progress, it is expected that further discoveries will enhance our understanding of the T3SS and its role in bacterial biology.", "References": [{"title": "Bacterial flagella and type III secretion systems", "authors": "Aizawa, S.I.", "journal": "FEMS Microbiology Letters", "year": "2001", "volumes": "202", "first page": "157", "last page": "164", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1574-6968.2001.tb10797.x"}, {"title": "The cryo-EM structure of the bacterial flagellum cap complex suggests a molecular mechanism for filament elongation", "authors": "Kuhlen, L., Abrusci, P., Johnson, S., Gault, J., Deme, J.C., Caesar, J.J.E., DiMaio, F., Lea, S.M.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-05217-1"}, {"title": "Molecular motors of the bacterial flagella", "authors": "Minamino, T., Imada, K., Namba, K.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Structural Biology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "18", "first page": "693", "last page": "701", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sbi.2008.09.006"}, {"title": "The type III secretion injectisome", "authors": "Cornelis, G.R.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "4", "first page": "811", "last page": "825", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro1526"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structure of the Shigella type III needle complex", "authors": "Worrall, L.J., Hong, C., Vuckovic, M., Deng, W., Bergeron, J.R.C., Majewski, D.D., Huang, R.K., Spreter, T., Finlay, B.B., Yu, Z.", "journal": "PLoS Pathogens", "year": "2016", "volumes": "12", "first page": "e1006083", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1006083"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM analysis of the T3SS injectisome reveals the structure of the needle and open secretin", "authors": "Hu, B., Lara-Tejero, M., Kong, Q., Gal√°n, J.E., Liu, J.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2017", "volumes": "8", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-017-00126-1"}, {"title": "Type III secretion systems: the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome", "authors": "Diepold, A., Armitage, J.P.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2015", "volumes": "370", "first page": "20150020", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2015.0020"}]}
