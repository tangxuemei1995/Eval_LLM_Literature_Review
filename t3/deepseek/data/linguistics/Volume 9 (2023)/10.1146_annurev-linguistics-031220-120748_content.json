{"Literature Review": "Opacity in phonological theory represents a significant challenge to the understanding of phonological processes and their interactions. This phenomenon, where a phonological process is not directly observable on the surface due to the influence of other processes, has been a central topic of discussion in the field of phonology. The exploration of opacity has led to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying phonological rules and their representations. This literature review aims to explore the concept of opacity within the frameworks of serialism and Optimality Theory (OT), highlighting the theoretical implications and the ongoing debate between these approaches. Opacity has been traditionally analyzed within the rule-based serial approach, as exemplified by Chomsky and Halle's Sound Pattern of English (SPE). In this framework, phonological rules are applied in a specific order, and opacity arises when a rule's application is obscured by subsequent rules. This serial approach has been effective in accounting for various opaque phenomena by allowing for intermediate representations that are not surface-true. However, the introduction of Optimality Theory by Prince and Smolensky presented a new challenge to the analysis of opacity. OT operates on the principle of constraint interaction in a parallel fashion, without the explicit ordering of rules. This parallel approach has been successful in explaining a wide range of phonological phenomena but has faced difficulties in accounting for certain types of opacity. The debate between serialism and parallelism in phonology has been significantly influenced by the issue of opacity. Proponents of serialism argue that the rule-ordering mechanism is essential for capturing the complexity of opaque interactions. On the other hand, advocates of OT have proposed various modifications to the theory to address opacity, such as the introduction of Harmonic Serialism (HS), which incorporates a serial component into the parallel framework of OT. HS allows for a step-by-step optimization process, where candidates are evaluated and modified in a series of steps, potentially providing a solution to the problem of opacity within OT. The discussion of opacity in phonological theory also touches upon the distinction between input-motivated and output-motivated processes. It has been suggested that the challenges OT faces with certain types of opacity are not due to its lack of serialism but rather because these processes are driven by the input rather than the output. This insight has led to a reevaluation of the theoretical tools used to analyze opacity and has opened new avenues for research in phonological theory. In conclusion, the study of opacity in phonology has highlighted the strengths and limitations of both serial and parallel approaches. The ongoing debate between these frameworks continues to shape our understanding of phonological processes and their interactions. As phonologists strive to develop more comprehensive theories, the analysis of opacity remains a critical area of investigation, offering valuable insights into the nature of phonological representations and the mechanisms that govern their realization.", "References": [{"title": "The Sound Pattern of English", "authors": "Noam Chomsky, Morris Halle", "journal": "", "year": "1968", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar", "authors": "Alan Prince, Paul Smolensky", "journal": "", "year": "1993", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Harmonic Serialism", "authors": "John J.
