{"Literature Review": "Constructed languages, or conlangs, represent a fascinating area of linguistic study that diverges from the traditional focus on naturally occurring languages. These languages are deliberately created by individuals or groups for various purposes, ranging from philosophical exploration to practical communication solutions, artistic expression, and scientific research. This literature review explores the four main types of constructed languages, highlighting their unique characteristics, purposes, and the research questions they pose to linguists and other scholars. Philosophical languages emerged in the seventeenth century as an attempt to create a language that could more accurately represent the world's reality. These languages were based on the idea that a systematic classification of knowledge could lead to a universal language of thought. John Wilkins' 'An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language' (1668) is a seminal work in this area, proposing a language that categorizes all human knowledge into a hierarchical structure (Wilkins, 1668). International auxiliary languages, such as Esperanto, were developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to facilitate communication across linguistic and cultural barriers. Esperanto, created by L.L. Zamenhof in 1887, is the most well-known example, designed to be easy to learn and politically neutral (Zamenhof, 1887). Research on Esperanto and other auxiliary languages has focused on their effectiveness in promoting international understanding and their linguistic features that facilitate learning (Gledhill, 2000). Constructed languages for fiction, or artistic languages, have gained popularity in recent decades, especially within the genres of science fiction and fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien's creation of Elvish languages for his Middle-earth legendarium is a pioneering example, demonstrating how conlangs can enrich fictional worlds and narratives (Tolkien, 1954). The study of artistic languages explores their role in storytelling, world-building, and the expression of cultural identity within fictional contexts (Adams, 2011). Finally, constructed languages are increasingly used in psycholinguistic experiments to investigate language acquisition, processing, and cognition. These languages allow researchers to control linguistic variables and test hypotheses about the nature of language and the human mind. Studies using constructed languages have provided insights into the mechanisms of language learning and the cognitive processes involved in language use (Culbertson & Schuler, 2019). Each type of constructed language offers unique opportunities for linguistic research, challenging traditional notions of language and expanding our understanding of its possibilities. As the field of constructed languages continues to grow, it invites linguists and scholars from various disciplines to explore the rich and diverse landscape of human linguistic creativity.", "References": [{"title": "An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language", "authors": "John Wilkins", "journal": "", "year": "1668", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Esperanto: The International Language", "authors": "L.L.
