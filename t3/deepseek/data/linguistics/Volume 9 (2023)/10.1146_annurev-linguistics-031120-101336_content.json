{"Literature Review": "The actuation problem in linguistics seeks to understand why and how linguistic changes occur at specific times and places. This complex issue has been approached from various angles, with sound change being a particularly fruitful area of investigation. The process of linguistic change begins at the individual level, with idiolectal differences playing a crucial role. These differences arise from the unique combination of past linguistic experiences, physical, perceptual, cognitive, and social factors that influence how speaker-listeners process and analyze linguistic data, leading to divergent linguistic representations and grammars (Labov, 2001; Bybee, 2006).\n\nAt the heart of the actuation problem is the question of how these individual differences contribute to the broader process of linguistic change within a population. The incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovations depend on the nature of contact between speakers with unique idiolects and the ability of individuals to leverage these innovations for specific ideological purposes (Eckert, 2000; Milroy & Milroy, 1985). This process is inherently stochastic, with a multitude of contingencies needing to align for a linguistic innovation to spread and become established within a community (Blythe & Croft, 2012).\n\nAgent-based modeling has emerged as a promising tool for exploring the stochastic nature of language change propagation. By simulating the interactions between individuals with varying linguistic behaviors and preferences, researchers can gain insights into the conditions under which linguistic innovations are likely to spread (Nettle, 1999; Baxter et al., 2009). However, developing a comprehensive model of linguistic change actuation at the individual level remains a significant challenge, as it requires a detailed understanding of the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying language use and change (Pierrehumbert, 2001; Trudgill, 2004).\n\nCognitive processing style is another critical factor in the actuation of linguistic change. Individuals differ in how they perceive, process, and produce language, which can lead to variations in linguistic behavior and, ultimately, linguistic change (Hay & Drager, 2007; Foulkes & Docherty, 2006). These differences can be influenced by a range of factors, including age, gender, social class, and linguistic background, highlighting the complex interplay between individual and social factors in the process of linguistic change (Eckert, 2008; Labov, 1994).\n\nIn conclusion, the actuation problem in linguistics is a multifaceted issue that requires an understanding of both individual and population-level processes. While significant progress has been made in identifying the factors that contribute to linguistic change, much work remains to be done in developing a comprehensive model of how these changes are actuated and propagated. Agent-based modeling and a deeper understanding of cognitive processing styles offer promising avenues for future research, but a complete solution to the actuation problem will require integrating insights from a wide range of disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, and sociology.", "References": [{"title": "Principles of Linguistic Change, Volume 2: Social Factors", "authors": "William Labov", "journal": "Blackwell Publishing", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "From Usage to Grammar: The Mind's Response to Repetition", "authors": "Joan Bybee", "journal": "Language", "year": "2006", "volumes": "82", "first page": "711", "last page": "733", "DOI": "10.1353/lan.2006.0186"}, {"title": "Linguistic Variation as Social Practice", "authors": "Penelope Eckert", "journal": "Blackwell Publishing", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Linguistic Change, Social Network and Speaker Innovation", "authors": "James Milroy, Lesley Milroy", "journal": "Journal of Linguistics", "year": "1985", "volumes": "21", "first page": "339", "last page": "384", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022226700010306"}, {"title": "S-Curves and the Mechanisms of Propagation in Language Change", "authors": "Richard A.
