{"Literature Review": "The evolution of the physician–patient relationship over the past century has significantly influenced health care communication and, consequently, treatment outcomes. This literature review explores the dynamics of face-to-face clinical care, emphasizing the shift from a physician-dominated model to a more patient-centered approach. The transformation has led to a spectrum of interactions, ranging from collaborative partnerships to adversarial encounters, each with distinct implications for treatment efficacy. Research underscores the dual nature of patient engagement: while it can enhance treatment outcomes through increased adherence and satisfaction, it can also introduce complexities that may hinder effective care delivery. Studies have identified various communication strategies employed by patients that influence treatment outcomes. For instance, patients who actively participate in their care discussions tend to have better health outcomes, as noted by Street et al. (2009), who found that patient involvement in decision-making processes is positively associated with treatment adherence and health status improvement. However, this engagement can also lead to challenges, such as when patients' preferences conflict with medical advice, potentially leading to non-adherence or dissatisfaction. The impact of patient engagement on physician communication has also been a focal point of research. Physicians may adjust their communication style in response to patients' levels of engagement, sometimes leading to more personalized and effective care. Yet, this dynamic can also result in physicians feeling pressured to accommodate patients' demands, even when they conflict with clinical guidelines. Effective communication strategies have been identified to navigate these complexities. For example, the use of shared decision-making (SDM) models has been shown to improve treatment outcomes by fostering a collaborative environment where both physicians and patients contribute to the care plan. Elwyn et al. (2012) highlight the importance of SDM in enhancing patient satisfaction and treatment adherence. Additionally, training programs aimed at improving physicians' communication skills have been found to positively affect patient outcomes, as demonstrated by Boissy et al. (2016), who reported that such training leads to better patient understanding and engagement. In conclusion, the role of health care communication in treatment outcomes is multifaceted, with patient engagement playing a pivotal yet complex role. While the shift towards patient-centered care has many benefits, it also presents challenges that require careful navigation. Effective communication strategies, such as SDM and physician communication training, are crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes in the context of today's engaged patients.", "References": [{"title": "How does communication heal?
