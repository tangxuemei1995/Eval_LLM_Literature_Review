{"Literature Review": "The phenomenon of raising out of finite clauses, commonly referred to as hyperraising, presents a significant challenge to classical syntactic theories that restrict raising to infinitival clauses. This literature review explores the crosslinguistic evidence for hyperraising, the theoretical implications of this phenomenon, and the various Minimalist analyses proposed to account for it. The discussion is structured around three main types of analyses: defectiveness/nonphase analyses, deactivation analyses, and phase-edge analyses, each of which offers unique insights into the mechanics of hyperraising while also facing distinct challenges. Crosslinguistic studies have documented hyperraising in a variety of languages, challenging the universality of locality constraints on movement. For instance, hyperraising has been observed in languages such as Malagasy and Tsez, where movement out of finite clauses is not only possible but also exhibits properties distinct from those of raising out of infinitival clauses (Polinsky & Potsdam, 2001; Richards, 2016). These observations have prompted syntacticians to reconsider the theoretical underpinnings of movement and the role of clause finiteness in syntactic operations. Defectiveness/nonphase analyses propose that the ability of a clause to permit hyperraising is tied to its structural properties, specifically whether it is defective or nonphase in nature. This approach suggests that certain clauses lack the features that typically block movement, thereby allowing hyperraising to occur (Chomsky, 2001; Legate, 2003). While this analysis successfully links hyperraising to observable structural properties, it struggles to provide a principled explanation for why these properties should permit movement, leaving a gap in the theoretical account. Deactivation analyses, on the other hand, focus on the mechanisms that deactivate the barriers to movement in finite clauses. These analyses have been successful in explaining the empirical patterns of hyperraising in languages where it occurs, but they face the challenge of accounting for its absence in languages like English (Wurmbrand, 2014; Bobaljik & Wurmbrand, 2012). The inability to straightforwardly rule out hyperraising in English raises questions about the universality of the deactivation mechanism and its interaction with other syntactic principles. Phase-edge analyses offer another perspective by emphasizing the role of phase edges in facilitating movement. According to this view, hyperraising is possible when the moved element reaches the edge of a phase, from where it can be extracted (Chomsky, 2008; Richards, 2016). While this analysis has empirical support, it also encounters conceptual and empirical challenges, particularly regarding the learnability of phase-edge properties and their crosslinguistic variation. The exploration of these analyses underscores the complexity of hyperraising and the need for further research to refine our understanding of movement and Merge. Each type of analysis contributes valuable insights but also highlights areas where our theoretical models fall short. Future work should aim to integrate the strengths of these analyses while addressing their shortcomings, ultimately advancing our understanding of the syntactic principles that govern movement across languages.", "References": [{"title": "Long-distance agreement and topic in Tsez", "authors": "Maria Polinsky, Eric Potsdam", "journal": "Natural Language & Linguistic Theory", "year": "2001", "volumes": "19", "first page": "583", "last page": "646", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1010757806504"}, {"title": "Contiguity Theory", "authors": "Norvin Richards", "journal": "MIT Press", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Derivation by Phase", "authors": "Noam Chomsky", "journal": "MIT Working Papers in Linguistics", "year": "2001", "volumes": "18", "first page": "1", "last page": "52", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Some interface properties of the phase", "authors": "Julie Anne Legate", "journal": "Linguistic Inquiry", "year": "2003", "volumes": "34", "first page": "506", "last page": "516", "DOI": "10.1162/002438903322520142"}, {"title": "The syntax of valuation and the interpretability of features", "authors": "Susanne Wurmbrand", "journal": "Phrasal and Clausal Architecture: Syntactic Derivation and Interpretation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "271", "last page": "302", "DOI": "10.1075/la.101.10wur"}, {"title": "Word order and scope: Transparent interfaces and the 3/4 signature", "authors": "Jonathan Bobaljik, Susanne Wurmbrand", "journal": "Linguistic Inquiry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "43", "first page": "371", "last page": "415", "DOI": "10.1162/LING_a_00094"}, {"title": "On phases", "authors": "Noam Chomsky", "journal": "Foundational Issues in Linguistic Theory: Essays in Honor of Jean-Roger Vergnaud", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "133", "last page": "166", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262013767.003.0007"}, {"title": "Contiguity Theory", "authors": "Norvin Richards", "journal": "MIT Press", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The syntax of valuation and the interpretability of features", "authors": "Susanne Wurmbrand", "journal": "Phrasal and Clausal Architecture: Syntactic Derivation and Interpretation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "271", "last page": "302", "DOI": "10.1075/la.101.10wur"}, {"title": "Word order and scope: Transparent interfaces and the 3/4 signature", "authors": "Jonathan Bobaljik, Susanne Wurmbrand", "journal": "Linguistic Inquiry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "43", "first page": "371", "last page": "415", "DOI": "10.1162/LING_a_00094"}]}
