{"Literature Review": "The analysis of (psycho)linguistic data presents unique challenges and opportunities for researchers. The complexity of language and cognition necessitates sophisticated statistical methods that can handle the intricacies of such data. This literature review focuses on the best practices in statistical analysis within the field of experimental linguistics, emphasizing the importance of methodological rigor and the avoidance of common pitfalls in statistical inference. Recent years have seen a growing awareness of the misuse of statistical methods, particularly concerning p values and statistical significance. This has led to a call for more nuanced approaches to data analysis, including the use of Bayesian methods and linear mixed models (LMMs) for hypothesis testing and uncertainty quantification. One of the key recommendations in the literature is the use of simulation to understand the design properties of an experiment before it is conducted. This approach allows researchers to anticipate potential issues and adjust their experimental design accordingly. For example, Gelman and Hill (2007) advocate for the use of simulation in the context of hierarchical models, highlighting its utility in understanding model behavior and in the validation of statistical methods. Visualization of data before formal analysis is another critical step in the data analysis process. Visual inspection can reveal patterns, outliers, or anomalies that might not be apparent through statistical tests alone. Wickham (2016) emphasizes the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the role of visualization in uncovering insights that guide subsequent statistical modeling. The choice between frequentist and Bayesian approaches in statistical analysis is a topic of ongoing debate. While frequentist methods have traditionally dominated the field, Bayesian methods offer several advantages, particularly in the context of complex models and small sample sizes. Kruschke (2013) provides a comprehensive overview of Bayesian data analysis, illustrating its application in various research contexts, including experimental linguistics. Hypothesis testing using Bayes factors is one area where Bayesian methods have shown particular promise. Bayes factors provide a way to quantify the evidence for or against a hypothesis, offering a more nuanced alternative to traditional p values. Rouder et al. (2009) demonstrate the use of Bayes factors in cognitive psychology, highlighting their utility in model comparison and hypothesis testing. Uncertainty quantification is another critical aspect of statistical analysis, particularly in the context of LMMs. Understanding the uncertainty associated with model estimates is essential for drawing reliable conclusions from data. Bolker et al. (2009) discuss the challenges of uncertainty quantification in ecological models, many of which are applicable to (psycho)linguistic research. Finally, the literature emphasizes the importance of not overstating the evidence and recognizing the limitations of statistical methods. Statistical analysis is a powerful tool, but it is not a panacea. Researchers must be cautious in their interpretation of results and avoid the temptation to draw conclusions that go beyond what the data can support. Cumming (2014) provides a critical perspective on the misuse of statistical significance, advocating for a more thoughtful and restrained approach to statistical inference. In conclusion, the analysis of (psycho)linguistic data requires careful consideration of statistical methods and a commitment to methodological rigor. By embracing best practices such as simulation, visualization, and the thoughtful application of Bayesian methods, researchers can enhance the reliability and validity of their findings.", "References": [{"title": "Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models", "authors": "Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis", "authors": "Hadley Wickham", "journal": "Springer", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan", "authors": "John Kruschke", "journal": "Academic Press", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Bayesian t tests for accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis", "authors": "Jeffrey N.
