{"Literature Review": "The study of language, as a multifaceted and dynamic field, extends beyond the confines of traditional linguistics departments, permeating various disciplines and fostering a rich, interdisciplinary dialogue. This literature review explores the epistemological and methodological frameworks that underpin the study of language, highlighting its organizational structure across departments, degree programs, organizations, and professions. Furthermore, it underscores the emerging transdisciplinary trends in language and communication studies, emphasizing the necessity to recenter humans and the human communicative experience in research endeavors. The complexity and relevance of language studies are illustrated through examples from lexical and morphological investigations, showcasing the intricate interplay between language and diverse areas of inquiry. The interdisciplinary nature of language studies is well-documented, with linguistics serving as a foundational discipline that intersects with psychology, sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, and computer science, among others. This intersectionality facilitates a comprehensive understanding of language as a cognitive, social, and cultural phenomenon. For instance, psycholinguistics explores the psychological processes underlying language acquisition and use, while sociolinguistics examines the relationship between language and society, including issues of language variation and change. Anthropological linguistics, on the other hand, delves into the role of language in cultural practices and identity formation. The transdisciplinary approach to language studies is increasingly recognized as essential for addressing complex linguistic phenomena that cannot be fully understood within the confines of a single discipline. This approach encourages collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, leveraging diverse methodologies and theoretical perspectives to enrich our understanding of language. For example, the integration of computational methods in linguistics has led to significant advancements in natural language processing and machine learning, enabling the analysis of large-scale linguistic data and the development of language technologies. Similarly, the application of cognitive science principles to language studies has shed light on the neural mechanisms of language processing and the cognitive architecture underlying linguistic competence. The organizational structure of language studies across academic institutions reflects its interdisciplinary nature, with linguistics departments often collaborating with other departments to offer joint degree programs and interdisciplinary research opportunities. This collaborative framework not only broadens the scope of linguistic inquiry but also prepares students for diverse career paths in academia, industry, and beyond. The emphasis on transdisciplinary research in language studies is also evident in the growing number of interdisciplinary journals, conferences, and research networks dedicated to exploring the intersections between language and other fields. Despite the progress made in interdisciplinary language studies, there is a pressing need to recenter humans and the human communicative experience in research. This entails a shift towards more human-centered approaches that prioritize the lived experiences of language users and the socio-cultural contexts in which language is embedded. Such approaches are crucial for addressing real-world linguistic challenges, such as language preservation, language education, and the impact of language on social inequality. Lexical and morphological investigations provide valuable insights into the complexity of language and its relevance across different areas of inquiry. For example, studies on lexical semantics explore the meaning of words and their relationships, shedding light on the cognitive processes involved in word comprehension and production. Morphological studies, on the other hand, examine the structure of words and the rules governing word formation, offering insights into the generative capacity of language and its role in communication. These investigations not only contribute to our theoretical understanding of language but also have practical applications in fields such as language teaching, lexicography, and computational linguistics. In conclusion, the study of language across disciplines is characterized by its interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature, reflecting the complexity and multifacetedness of language as a subject of inquiry. The integration of diverse methodologies and theoretical perspectives enriches our understanding of language and its role in human cognition, society, and culture. However, there is a need to recenter humans and the human communicative experience in language research, ensuring that linguistic studies remain relevant and impactful in addressing real-world challenges. The examples from lexical and morphological investigations underscore the relevance and complexity of language studies, highlighting the importance of continued interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing our knowledge of language.", "References": [{"title": "Psycholinguistics: Introduction and Applications", "authors": "Lise Menn, Nan Bernstein Ratner", "journal": "Journal of Psycholinguistic Research", "year": "2000", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1005187822756"}, {"title": "Sociolinguistics: An Introduction to Language and Society", "authors": "Peter Trudgill", "journal": "Language in Society", "year": "2000", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1017/S0047404500001016"}, {"title": "Anthropological Linguistics: An Introduction", "authors": "William Foley", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "1997", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "37", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.1"}, {"title": "Computational Linguistics: Models, Resources, Applications", "authors": "Daniel Jurafsky, James H.
