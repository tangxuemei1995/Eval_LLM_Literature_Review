{"Literature Review": "The Principle of Compositionality, which posits that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them, has been a cornerstone in linguistic theory and computational linguistics. However, the advent of neural models, which have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, has prompted a reevaluation of the role of compositionality in computational linguistics. This literature review explores the tension between the empirical success of neural models and the theoretical underpinnings of compositionality, focusing on semantic parsing tasks and the potential for neurosymbolic models to bridge this divide. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of an overly strict interpretation of compositionality in achieving broad coverage in semantic parsing. For instance, Lake and Baroni (2018) argue that while compositionality is crucial for understanding and generating novel combinations of known elements, neural models often achieve broad coverage by learning statistical patterns that may not align with compositional principles. This suggests that a balance must be struck between the flexibility of neural models and the structured, rule-based approach of compositional semantics. On the other hand, the necessity of compositionality for learning correct linguistic generalizations from limited data has been underscored by several studies. For example, Gulordava et al. (2018) demonstrate that neural models trained on limited data can fail to generalize correctly without incorporating compositional principles. This indicates that compositionality remains a valuable tool for ensuring that models can extrapolate from training data to novel, unseen examples. The challenge, then, is to design models that can leverage the strengths of both neural and compositional approaches. Recent work in neurosymbolic models offers a promising direction for reconciling these qualities. These models aim to combine the representational power of neural networks with the interpretability and generalization capabilities of symbolic, rule-based systems. For instance, Yi et al. (2018) propose a neurosymbolic model for semantic parsing that integrates neural networks with a compositional grammar, achieving both broad coverage and the ability to generalize from limited data. Similarly, Andreas et al. (2016) introduce a modular neural network architecture that incorporates compositional principles, allowing the model to learn complex functions by composing simpler, interpretable modules. These studies suggest that the careful exploration of the design space for neurosymbolic models can lead to systems that effectively balance the flexibility of neural models with the structured, rule-based approach of compositionality. In conclusion, while neural models have significantly advanced the field of computational linguistics, the Principle of Compositionality remains a valuable tool for ensuring that models can learn correct linguistic generalizations from limited data. The development of neurosymbolic models represents a promising direction for reconciling the empirical success of neural models with the theoretical underpinnings of compositionality. Future research should continue to explore this design space, with the goal of developing models that can achieve both broad coverage and the ability to generalize correctly from limited data.", "References": [{"title": "Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks", "authors": "Brenden Lake, Marco Baroni", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.00350", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Colorless green recurrent networks dream hierarchically", "authors": "Kristina Gulordava, Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Tal Linzen, Marco Baroni", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.11138", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning: A Survey and Interpretation", "authors": "Kai Yi, Yexiang Xue, Carla P.
