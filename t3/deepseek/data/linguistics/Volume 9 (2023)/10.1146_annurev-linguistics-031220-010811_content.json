{"Literature Review": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework represents a significant advancement in the field of pragmatics, offering a probabilistic approach that integrates insights from formal and experimental semantics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science. This framework has been instrumental in accounting for a wide range of pragmatic phenomena by treating language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs as crucial for interpretation. The RSA framework also provides a comprehensive account of the link between language production and interpretation, marking a departure from traditional approaches that often treat these processes in isolation. One of the foundational studies that laid the groundwork for the RSA framework is Goodman and Frank (2016), which introduced the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA, demonstrating its applicability across various linguistic contexts. The success of RSA in explaining pragmatic phenomena can be attributed to its ability to model the probabilistic nature of language use, where speakers and listeners are seen as rational agents who aim to maximize communicative efficiency. This perspective is supported by experimental evidence from studies such as Bergen, Levy, and Goodman (2016), which showed how RSA can predict pragmatic inferences in a variety of scenarios. Moreover, the RSA framework has been extended to address more complex linguistic phenomena, including scalar implicatures, presuppositions, and indirect speech acts. For instance, Franke and J채ger (2016) extended the RSA model to account for the context-dependency of scalar implicatures, highlighting the framework's flexibility and scalability. Despite its successes, the RSA framework faces several challenges, including the need to better incorporate the boundedness of human cognition and the incremental and compositional nature of language processing. These challenges are addressed in part by recent work that seeks to integrate RSA with models of memory and attention, as discussed in Smith, Goodman, and Frank (2013). Additionally, the RSA framework's treatment of subjective prior beliefs has been critiqued for its reliance on idealized assumptions about world knowledge. This critique is explored in depth by Kao, Wu, Bergen, and Goodman (2014), who propose modifications to the RSA model to better capture the variability in listeners' prior beliefs. Another area of ongoing research is the application of RSA to real-time language processing, with studies such as Degen, Hawkins, Graf, Kreiss, and Goodman (2020) investigating how RSA can be adapted to account for the incremental nature of language comprehension. Despite these challenges, the RSA framework continues to be a leading approach in probabilistic pragmatics, offering a unified account of language use that bridges the gap between production and interpretation. Its influence extends beyond theoretical linguistics, impacting areas such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence, where RSA-inspired models are being developed to improve machine understanding of human language. As the field of pragmatics continues to evolve, the RSA framework is likely to play a central role in shaping our understanding of the probabilistic and context-dependent nature of language.", "References": [{"title": "Pragmatic language interpretation as probabilistic inference", "authors": "Noah D.
