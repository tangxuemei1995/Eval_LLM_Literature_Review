{"Literature Review": "The classification of verbs across languages presents a complex challenge for natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the context of multilingual applications. Recent advancements in language modeling have demonstrated the ability of large text encoders to extract significant linguistic information from raw text corpora without explicit supervision (Devlin et al., 2019). These models have achieved remarkable success across a variety of NLP tasks, leading to a reevaluation of the necessity of traditional, human-made computational resources such as verb lexicons. However, probing analyses have also highlighted the limitations of these neural architectures, suggesting that while they are adept at solving specific tasks, they may not possess a deep, nuanced understanding of language akin to that of a trained linguist (Rogers, Kovaleva, & Rumshisky, 2020). This raises the question of whether human-designed lexical resources can still play a crucial role in filling the knowledge gaps of these models, particularly in the domain of verb classification. Verb classification is a fundamental aspect of linguistic analysis, involving the categorization of verbs based on their semantic and syntactic properties. This process is essential for a wide range of NLP applications, including machine translation, information extraction, and semantic parsing. The challenge is compounded in multilingual contexts, where the semantic and syntactic properties of verbs can vary significantly across languages (Levin, 1993). Traditional approaches to verb classification have relied heavily on manual lexicographic work, which, while accurate, is time-consuming and resource-intensive. In response to these challenges, there has been growing interest in alternative methods for generating verb classes, including the use of crowdsourcing to leverage the linguistic intuitions of native speakers (Snow, O'Connor, Jurafsky, & Ng, 2008). Crowdsourcing offers a potentially cost-effective and scalable solution for verb classification, particularly for low-resource languages where traditional lexicographic resources may be lacking. However, the quality and consistency of crowdsourced data can vary, raising questions about its reliability for linguistic analysis. Another promising avenue for verb classification involves the augmentation of pretrained language models with external verb knowledge. This approach seeks to combine the strengths of neural models—their ability to learn from vast amounts of data—with the depth and precision of human-curated lexical resources. Several studies have explored the potential benefits of this hybrid approach, with findings suggesting that the integration of external knowledge can enhance the performance of language models on tasks requiring a nuanced understanding of verb semantics (Zhang, Zhao, & LeCun, 2015; Peters et al., 2018). Despite these advancements, the role of human expertise in multilingual NLP remains a topic of debate. While neural models have demonstrated an impressive capacity for learning from data, they are not infallible, and their performance can be significantly improved through the incorporation of human-curated knowledge. This is particularly true in the case of verb classification, where the semantic and syntactic nuances of verbs can be difficult for models to capture without explicit guidance. As such, there is a compelling argument for the continued involvement of human linguists in the development of NLP resources, particularly in the context of multilingual applications where the complexity of verb classification is magnified. In conclusion, the classification of verbs across languages is a multifaceted challenge that requires a combination of computational and linguistic expertise. While recent developments in language modeling have reduced the reliance on traditional lexicographic resources, there is still a significant role for human-designed lexical knowledge in enhancing the performance of neural models. The integration of crowdsourcing and external knowledge augmentation offers promising avenues for advancing verb classification in multilingual NLP, but the expertise of human linguists remains indispensable for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of these resources.", "References": [{"title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding", "authors": "Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Primer in BERTology: What We Know About How BERT Works", "authors": "Anna Rogers, Olga Kovaleva, Anna Rumshisky", "journal": "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "8", "first page": "842", "last page": "866", "DOI": "10.1162/tacl_a_00349"}, {"title": "English Verb Classes and Alternations: A Preliminary Investigation", "authors": "Beth Levin", "journal": "University of Chicago Press", "year": "1993", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Cheap and Fast—But is it Good?
