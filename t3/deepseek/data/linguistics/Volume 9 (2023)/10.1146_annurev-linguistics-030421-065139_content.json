{"Literature Review": "Speech prosody, the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, plays a crucial role in conveying linguistic and emotional information. Recent research has highlighted its significance in understanding mental disorders, offering potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on speech prosody in mental disorders, focusing on schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression, and discusses the implications for future research and clinical practice. Schizophrenia is characterized by significant impairments in prosody recognition and production, affecting patients' ability to interpret and express emotions through speech. Studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia exhibit difficulties in distinguishing between different emotional tones, which may contribute to social communication challenges (Leitman et al., 2010). Similarly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with atypical prosody, often described as monotonous or sing-song, which can impact social interactions. Research suggests that these prosodic abnormalities in ASD may stem from underlying neural processing differences (McCann et al., 2007). Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, also affects speech prosody, with patients showing reduced variability in pitch and rhythm. This decline in prosodic features may reflect the broader cognitive and linguistic impairments associated with the disease (Ash et al., 2014). Depression, on the other hand, is linked to changes in speech prosody that convey emotional states, such as flat or slowed speech. These prosodic changes can serve as indicators of the severity of depressive symptoms and may have implications for diagnosis and monitoring treatment progress (Cannizzaro et al., 2004). The study of speech prosody in mental disorders has been advanced by interdisciplinary approaches, integrating insights from psycholinguistics, neuroscience, and psychiatry. However, there is a need for more comprehensive models that account for the complex interplay between cognition, emotion, and language. Future research should also explore multisensory and cross-modal effects to better understand the mechanisms underlying prosodic impairments and to develop more effective interventions. In conclusion, speech prosody offers valuable insights into the nature of mental disorders and has the potential to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. By fostering multidisciplinary collaboration and developing integrated theoretical frameworks, researchers can address the challenges in this field and contribute to the advancement of linguistic theories and psychiatric care.", "References": [{"title": "The neural substrates of impaired prosodic detection in schizophrenia and its sensorial antecedents", "authors": "Leitman, David I., Wolf, Daniel H., Ragland, J.
