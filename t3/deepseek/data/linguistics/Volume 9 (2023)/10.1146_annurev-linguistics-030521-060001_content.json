{"Literature Review": "The study of homesign, the gestural communication systems developed by deaf individuals without access to a conventional sign language, has undergone significant evolution over the past few decades. Early research in this area, grounded in developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, primarily focused on documenting the structural properties of homesign systems and their implications for understanding language acquisition and development. These studies often portrayed homesign as a rudimentary form of communication, emphasizing its limitations in comparison to established sign languages (Goldin-Meadow & Mylander, 1984; Feldman, Goldin-Meadow, & Gleitman, 1978). However, this perspective has been increasingly challenged by a new wave of linguistic ethnographic research that adopts a more nuanced and critical approach to studying homesign and its users. This shift is part of a broader critical movement within Deaf Studies, led by deaf scholars who advocate for a more inclusive and respectful representation of deaf individuals and their communication practices (Ladd, 2003; Bauman & Murray, 2010). One of the key contested issues in homesign research revolves around the conceptualization of language itself. Traditional studies often applied a narrow, prescriptive definition of language, which led to the marginalization of homesign systems as 'incomplete' or 'deficient' (Senghas & Coppola, 2001). In contrast, recent scholarship argues for a more expansive understanding of language that recognizes the creativity and complexity of homesign systems and their role in the linguistic and social lives of their users (Kusters, 2012; Hou, 2016). This perspective is informed by sociolinguistic theories that emphasize the diversity of language practices and the importance of context in shaping linguistic forms and functions (Blommaert, 2010). Another area of contention is the portrayal of deaf individuals in homesign research. Early studies often framed deaf homesigners as isolated individuals, cut off from linguistic and social resources, which contributed to a deficit-oriented narrative (Morford & Goldin-Meadow, 1997). Contemporary research, however, highlights the agency of deaf individuals in creating and using homesign systems, as well as the social networks and communities that support these practices (Kisch, 2008; Green, 2014). This shift reflects a broader commitment within Deaf Studies to challenge stereotypes and promote a more positive and empowering representation of deaf people. The current moment of transition in homesign research is also characterized by methodological innovations. Linguistic ethnography, with its emphasis on participant observation and the analysis of naturally occurring interactions, has emerged as a key approach for studying homesign in its social and cultural context (Snoddon, 2016; De Meulder, 2017). This method allows researchers to capture the richness and diversity of homesign practices, as well as the perspectives of deaf individuals themselves. Furthermore, the involvement of deaf scholars in homesign research has led to a greater emphasis on ethical considerations, such as the importance of informed consent and the need to ensure that research benefits the deaf community (Hauser, O'Hearn, McKee, Steider, & Thew, 2010). In conclusion, the study of homesign is at a crossroads, with traditional approaches being reevaluated in light of new theoretical insights and methodological practices. The contested issues surrounding the conceptualization of language, the portrayal of deaf individuals, and the methods used to study homesign reflect broader debates within linguistics and Deaf Studies. As the field continues to evolve, it is crucial that researchers engage with these issues in a way that respects the diversity and complexity of homesign systems and the communities that use them.", "References": [{"title": "Gestural communication in deaf children: The effects and noneffects of parental input on early language development", "authors": "Susan Goldin-Meadow, Carolyn Mylander", "journal": "Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development", "year": "1984", "volumes": "49", "first page": "1", "last page": "121", "DOI": "10.2307/1165838"}, {"title": "Beyond Herodotus: The creation of language by linguistically deprived deaf children", "authors": "Heidi Feldman, Susan Goldin-Meadow, Lila Gleitman", "journal": "Action, Symbol, and Gesture: The Emergence of Language", "year": "1978", "volumes": "", "first page": "351", "last page": "414", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood", "authors": "Paddy Ladd", "journal": "", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.21832/9781853595479"}, {"title": "Deaf Gain: Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity", "authors": "H-Dirksen L.
