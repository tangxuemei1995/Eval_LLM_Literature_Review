{"Literature Review": "The concept of the modern nation-state has been a central framework in the study of language policy and planning (LPP), particularly in postcolonial contexts. However, this framework has its limitations, especially when applied to the complex linguistic landscapes of Africa. This literature review explores these limitations, advocating for a revision of the history of LPP and sociolinguistics to better account for the colonial legacies that have shaped language issues in these regions. The colonial history of LPP has often framed African multilingualisms as problems to be solved, rather than as rich, dynamic systems of communication. This perspective has been critiqued for its methodological nationalism, which assumes the nation-state as the natural and primary unit of analysis, thereby erasing the colonial histories that have shaped contemporary language policies. The case of Sudan serves as a poignant example of how the contemporary understanding of citizenship and language policy is deeply entangled with the colonial history of the state. The construct of the 'developing nation' within the early LPP framework has been problematized for its failure to recognize the importance of Southern epistemologies and the need for language policies that are historically and locally embedded. This review argues for a postcolonial approach to LPP that recognizes the limitations of the modern nation-state framework and advocates for a more nuanced understanding of language issues in Africa, one that is informed by Southern perspectives and the complex histories of colonialism and state formation.", "References": [{"title": "Language Policy and Planning in Africa: The Case of Sudan", "authors": "Abdelhay, Asmak, Makoni, Sinfree, Makoni, Busi", "journal": "Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development", "year": "2011", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1080/01434632.2010.527343"}, {"title": "Postcolonial Approaches to Language Policy and Planning", "authors": "Pennycook, Alastair", "journal": "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics", "year": "2002", "volumes": "22", "first page": "60", "last page": "77", "DOI": "10.1017/S026719050200003X"}, {"title": "The Politics of Language in Africa", "authors": "Mazrui, Ali, Mazrui, Alamin", "journal": "African Studies Review", "year": "1998", "volumes": "41", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.2307/524673"}, {"title": "Language and Nation Building in Africa", "authors": "Bamgbose, Ayo", "journal": "International Journal of the Sociology of Language", "year": "1991", "volumes": "1991", "first page": "85", "last page": "98", "DOI": "10.1515/ijsl.1991.91.85"}, {"title": "Southern Theory: The Global Dynamics of Knowledge in Social Science", "authors": "Connell, Raewyn", "journal": "Theory and Society", "year": "2007", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1", "last page": "40", "DOI": "10.1007/s11186-007-9024-2"}, {"title": "Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples", "authors": "Smith, Linda Tuhiwai", "journal": "Journal of Indigenous Studies", "year": "1999", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1080/13688790903384109"}, {"title": "Language Policy and Identity Construction: The Dynamics of Cameroon's Multilingualism", "authors": "Echu, George", "journal": "Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development", "year": "2003", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1080/01434630308666489"}, {"title": "The Sociolinguistics of Globalization", "authors": "Blommaert, Jan", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-anthro-091908-164406"}, {"title": "Language and the Nation: The Language Question in Sub-Saharan Africa", "authors": "Webb, Vic, Kembo-Sure", "journal": "International Journal of the Sociology of Language", "year": "2000", "volumes": "2000", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1515/ijsl.2000.141.1"}, {"title": "African Languages and the Politics of Development", "authors": "Alexander, Neville", "journal": "Journal of Southern African Studies", "year": "2003", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1080/0305707032000060489"}]}
