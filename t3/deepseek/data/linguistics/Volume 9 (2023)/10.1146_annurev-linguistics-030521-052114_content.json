{"Literature Review": "The assessment of second language (L2) speaking proficiency is a critical area of research in applied linguistics, given its importance in global communication, education, and professional settings. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to explore the construct of speaking proficiency, the challenges in its assessment, and the factors that influence the validity and reliability of speaking tests. Speaking proficiency in a second language encompasses a complex set of skills, including linguistic competence, strategic competence, and the ability to engage in interaction. Linguistic competence refers to the mastery of language forms, such as vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, which are essential for effective communication (Bachman & Palmer, 1996). Strategic competence involves the use of communication strategies to overcome linguistic gaps and enhance message conveyance (Canale & Swain, 1980). The interactive aspect of speaking, particularly the ability to predict and respond to interlocutors in real-time, is increasingly recognized as a crucial component of speaking proficiency (Galaczi & Taylor, 2018). Assessing speaking proficiency presents unique challenges due to its transient nature and the influence of various factors, such as task design, rater behavior, and interlocutor effects. Task design is critical in speaking assessments, as it must elicit a range of speaking skills while minimizing construct-irrelevant variance (Fulcher, 2003). Rater reliability is another concern, with studies highlighting the impact of rater background, training, and biases on scoring consistency (McNamara, 1996). Interlocutor effects, including the role of the interlocutor in test interactions, can also affect test-taker performance and, consequently, the validity of the assessment (O'Sullivan, 2002). Recent research has focused on developing more authentic and interactive speaking tasks, such as role-plays and discussions, to better capture the construct of speaking proficiency (Nakatsuhara et al., 2017). The use of technology, including computer-mediated communication and automated scoring systems, offers new possibilities for speaking assessment but also raises questions about fairness and the nature of interaction (Chapelle & Chung, 2010). Despite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring the validity, reliability, and fairness of speaking assessments. Future research directions include exploring the impact of cultural and linguistic diversity on speaking assessment, developing more nuanced frameworks for assessing interactional competence, and investigating the potential of technology to enhance speaking test delivery and scoring (Knoch & Macqueen, 2020). In conclusion, the assessment of L2 speaking proficiency is a multifaceted endeavor that requires careful consideration of the speaking construct, task design, rater and interlocutor effects, and the use of technology. By addressing these challenges, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective and equitable speaking assessments that meet the needs of a globalized world.", "References": [{"title": "Language Testing in Practice: Designing and Developing Useful Language Tests", "authors": "Lyle Bachman, Adrian Palmer", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1996", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Theoretical bases of communicative approaches to second language teaching and testing", "authors": "Michael Canale, Merrill Swain", "journal": "Applied Linguistics", "year": "1980", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.1093/applin/1.1.1"}, {"title": "Interactional competence: Conceptualisations, operationalisations, and outstanding questions", "authors": "Evelina Galaczi, Lynda Taylor", "journal": "Language Assessment Quarterly", "year": "2018", "volumes": "15", "first page": "219", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1080/15434303.2018.1453816"}, {"title": "Testing Second Language Speaking", "authors": "Glenn Fulcher", "journal": "Pearson Education", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Measuring Second Language Performance", "authors": "Tim McNamara", "journal": "Longman", "year": "1996", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Learner characteristics and test performance: A structural modelling approach", "authors": "Barry O'Sullivan", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Developing a set of descriptors for assessing interactional competence in paired speaking tests", "authors": "Fumiyo Nakatsuhara, Chihiro Inoue, Nahal Khabbazbashi", "journal": "Language Testing", "year": "2017", "volumes": "34", "first page": "319", "last page": "341", "DOI": "10.1177/0265532217710044"}, {"title": "Technology and second language assessment", "authors": "Carol Chapelle, Yoo-Ree Chung", "journal": "The Modern Language Journal", "year": "2010", "volumes": "94", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1540-4781.2010.01109.x"}, {"title": "Assessing English for Professional Purposes: Language and the workplace", "authors": "Ute Knoch, Susy Macqueen", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
