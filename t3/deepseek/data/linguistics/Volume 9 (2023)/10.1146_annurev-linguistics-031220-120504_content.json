{"Literature Review": "Language documentation has evolved significantly over the past two and a half decades, largely due to advancements in technology. This evolution has been marked by the development, testing, adoption, and eventual obsolescence of various technological tools. The primary focus of language documentation is to create resources that include recorded language events across different genres and settings, along with sufficient annotation to make these recordings decipherable. The subsequent mobilization of these resources is crucial for their use in language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis. Recent technological advances have played a pivotal role in both the creation and mobilization of these documentary resources. One of the key advancements in resource creation is the development of high-quality, portable recording equipment. This equipment has enabled linguists to capture language events in diverse settings with greater ease and accuracy. Additionally, software tools for annotation and transcription have become more sophisticated, allowing for more detailed and accessible documentation of languages. These tools often include features for time-aligned transcription, morphological analysis, and the integration of metadata, which are essential for making the recorded data useful for further linguistic analysis and language revitalization efforts. On the mobilization front, digital archives and online platforms have emerged as vital resources for sharing and accessing language documentation. These platforms not only provide a repository for storing digital objects but also offer tools for searching, browsing, and analyzing the data. The use of standardized formats and metadata schemas has facilitated the interoperability of these resources, making it easier for researchers and community members to access and utilize the documentation. Furthermore, the development of mobile applications and online courses has opened new avenues for language learning and revitalization, making the documented resources more accessible to a wider audience. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring the sustainability and accessibility of language documentation. Issues such as data preservation, intellectual property rights, and the digital divide need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of these technological tools. Moreover, the involvement of language communities in the documentation process is crucial for the success of language revitalization efforts. Collaborative approaches that empower community members to take an active role in documenting and revitalizing their languages are increasingly being recognized as best practices in the field. In conclusion, recent technological advances have significantly enhanced the capabilities for resource creation and mobilization in language documentation. These advancements have not only improved the quality and accessibility of language documentation but also opened new possibilities for language learning, reclamation, and revitalization. However, ongoing efforts are needed to address the challenges and ensure that these technologies are used effectively and ethically in the service of language preservation and revitalization.", "References": [{"title": "Language Documentation and Archiving: Challenges and Opportunities", "authors": "Peter K.
