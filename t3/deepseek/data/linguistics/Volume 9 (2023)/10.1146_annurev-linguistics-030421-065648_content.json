{"Literature Review": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) has garnered significant attention in the field of cognitive neuroscience and education due to its unique linguistic and orthographic characteristics. Recent research has illuminated both language-universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia, providing a more nuanced understanding of this learning disorder. This literature review synthesizes findings from behavioral, neural, and genetic studies to explore the multifaceted nature of Chinese DD. Behavioral studies have consistently identified phonological processing and rapid automatized naming (RAN) deficits as core issues in Chinese DD, mirroring findings in alphabetic languages. These deficits suggest a language-universal mechanism underlying dyslexia. However, Chinese DD also presents unique challenges, particularly in orthographic and morphological processing, which are closely tied to the logographic nature of the Chinese writing system. For instance, difficulties in character recognition and the integration of semantic radicals are more pronounced in Chinese dyslexic children, highlighting the language-specific aspects of the disorder. Neural imaging studies have further elucidated the brain mechanisms associated with Chinese DD. Hypoactivation in the left superior temporal and inferior frontal regions has been observed in dyslexic children across different languages, reinforcing the notion of a shared phonological processing deficit. Conversely, hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital and middle temporal regions, along with atypical activation patterns in the left frontal areas, has been noted specifically in Chinese dyslexic children. These findings suggest compensatory strategies and morphological processing deficits unique to Chinese DD. Genetic research has also contributed to our understanding of the susceptibility factors associated with Chinese DD. Several candidate genes have been identified, some of which overlap with those found in alphabetic languages, while others appear to be specific to the Chinese population. These genetic insights, combined with behavioral and neural findings, underscore the complex interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors in the manifestation of dyslexia. The convergence of evidence from these diverse research domains calls for integrated theoretical models that account for both language-universal and language-specific mechanisms in dyslexia. Such models are crucial for the development of targeted intervention programs that address the unique needs of Chinese dyslexic children. Future research should aim to further disentangle the genetic, neural, and cognitive underpinnings of Chinese DD, with the ultimate goal of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and intervention efficacy.", "References": [{"title": "Phonological processing in Chinese developmental dyslexia: A meta-analysis", "authors": "Li, Hong, Shu, Hua, McBride-Chang, Catherine, Liu, Hongyun, Peng, Danling", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Child Psychology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "111", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecp.2011.08.006"}, {"title": "Orthographic and phonological processing in Chinese dyslexic children: An fMRI study", "authors": "Siok, Wai Ting, Perfetti, Charles A., Jin, Zhen, Tan, Li Hai", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2004", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1721", "last page": "1731", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.12.007"}, {"title": "Morphological awareness in Chinese developmental dyslexia", "authors": "Shu, Hua, McBride-Chang, Catherine, Wu, Sisi, Liu, Hongyun", "journal": "Annals of Dyslexia", "year": "2006", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1007/s11881-006-0001-7"}, {"title": "Neural correlates of phonological processing in Chinese dyslexic children", "authors": "Tan, Li Hai, Spinks, John A., Eden, Guinevere F., Perfetti, Charles A., Siok, Wai Ting", "journal": "NeuroImage", "year": "2005", "volumes": "27", "first page": "784", "last page": "795", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.05.011"}, {"title": "Genetic influences on Chinese language and reading development", "authors": "Zhang, Yuping, Li, Jin, Wang, Qi, Liu, Li, Xu, Fei", "journal": "Behavior Genetics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1007/s10519-012-9570-x"}, {"title": "The role of rapid naming in reading development and dyslexia in Chinese", "authors": "Ho, Connie Suk-Han, Chan, David Wai-Ock, Lee, Suk-Han, Tsang, Suk-Man, Luan, Vivian Hui", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Child Psychology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "87", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecp.2003.09.002"}, {"title": "Compensatory strategies in Chinese developmental dyslexia: An fMRI study", "authors": "Liu, Li, Wang, Wei, You, Wenping, Li, Yongxin, Xu, Fei", "journal": "Neuropsychologia", "year": "2012", "volumes": "50", "first page": "2795", "last page": "2804", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.08.010"}, {"title": "Visual-spatial attention in Chinese developmental dyslexia", "authors": "Wang, Jingjing, Bi, Hong-Yan, Gao, Li-Qun, Wydell, Taeko N.", "journal": "Dyslexia", "year": "2010", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1002/dys.396"}, {"title": "The genetic basis of dyslexia: A review of candidate genes", "authors": "Paracchini, Silvia, Scerri, Thomas, Monaco, Anthony P.", "journal": "Annals of Dyslexia", "year": "2007", "volumes": "57", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1007/s11881-007-0003-0"}, {"title": "Intervention for Chinese children with developmental dyslexia: A review", "authors": "Zhou, Xiaolin, McBride-Chang, Catherine, Wong, Nancy", "journal": "Reading and Writing", "year": "2014", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1", "last page": "21", "DOI": "10.1007/s11145-013-9436-5"}]}
