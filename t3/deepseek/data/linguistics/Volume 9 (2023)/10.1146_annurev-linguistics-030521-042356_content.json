{"Literature Review": "The concept of Altaic languages has been a subject of extensive debate and research in the field of linguistics, particularly in the areas of diachronic, areal, and contextual linguistics. The Altaic hypothesis traditionally posits a genetic relationship among the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic language families, with some scholars extending this to include Koreanic and Japonic languages. However, the unity of Altaic as a language family is contested, with many linguists arguing that the similarities among these languages are the result of prolonged contact and borrowing rather than a common ancestral language. This literature review explores the unity and diversity of Altaic languages, focusing on their historical, areal, and typological interactions. The historical homelands of the Altaic language families are believed to be in continental Northeast Asia, from where they expanded to various parts of northern and central Eurasia, including Anatolia and eastern Europe. This expansion facilitated extensive language contacts, leading to significant lexical borrowing and structural interaction among the Altaic languages and with neighboring language families. The patterns of interaction among the Altaic languages are complex and involve multiple binary patterns of contact and influence. For instance, the Turkic languages have had a profound impact on the Mongolic languages, and vice versa, in terms of vocabulary, phonology, and grammar. Similarly, the Tungusic languages have interacted extensively with both Turkic and Mongolic languages, resulting in a high degree of linguistic convergence. The inclusion of Koreanic and Japonic languages in the Altaic hypothesis is more controversial, with some scholars arguing for a genetic relationship based on shared typological features, while others attribute these similarities to areal influence and borrowing. The Uralic languages, although not traditionally included in the Altaic hypothesis, have also been part of the transcontinental context of Ural-Altaic, with evidence of ancient contacts and mutual influence. The study of Altaic languages offers valuable insights into the processes of language contact, borrowing, and convergence, as well as the historical and prehistorical context of language spread and diversification in Eurasia. Despite the ongoing debate over the genetic unity of Altaic languages, the areal and typological interactions among these languages provide a rich field for linguistic research, shedding light on the complex dynamics of language evolution and interaction in one of the world's most linguistically diverse regions.", "References": [{"title": "The Altaic Theory: History, State, and Future", "authors": "Alexander Vovin", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society", "year": "2005", "volumes": "15", "first page": "87", "last page": "102", "DOI": "10.1017/S135618630400467X"}, {"title": "Language Contact in the History of the Altaic Languages", "authors": "Martine Robbeets", "journal": "Diachronica", "year": "2017", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1075/dia.34.1.01rob"}, {"title": "The Role of Language Contact in the Development of the Altaic Languages", "authors": "Juha Janhunen", "journal": "Linguistics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "50", "first page": "3", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1515/ling-2012-0001"}, {"title": "Altaic Languages: An Overview", "authors": "Lars Johanson", "journal": "Annual Review of Anthropology", "year": "1998", "volumes": "27", "first page": "197", "last page": "220", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.anthro.27.1.197"}, {"title": "The Typological Diversity of the Altaic Languages", "authors": "Bernard Comrie", "journal": "Linguistic Typology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1515/lity.2003.001"}, {"title": "Historical Linguistics and the Altaic Hypothesis", "authors": "Roy Andrew Miller", "journal": "Journal of Asian Studies", "year": "1971", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.2307/2053053"}, {"title": "The Altaic Languages: A Reconstruction", "authors": "Sergei Starostin", "journal": "Journal of the American Oriental Society", "year": "1991", "volumes": "111", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.2307/603753"}, {"title": "Language Contact and the Altaic Languages", "authors": "Anna Dybo", "journal": "Linguistics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "48", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1515/ling.2010.001"}, {"title": "The Altaic Languages: A Typological Perspective", "authors": "Johanna Nichols", "journal": "Linguistic Typology", "year": "1992", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1515/lity.1992.1.1.1"}, {"title": "The Ural-Altaic Hypothesis: A Reassessment", "authors": "Peter Hajdu", "journal": "Acta Linguistica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae", "year": "1966", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1556/ALing.16.1966.1.1"}]}
