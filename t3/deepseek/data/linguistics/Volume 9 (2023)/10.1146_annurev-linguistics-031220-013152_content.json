{"Literature Review": "Environmental linguistics represents a pivotal shift in the study of language, emphasizing the intrinsic link between linguistic diversity and ecological sustainability. This emerging field, as highlighted by Maffi (2001), underscores the importance of linguistic diversity in the conservation of biodiversity, arguing that languages encode unique environmental knowledge that is crucial for sustainable living. Maffi's work lays the foundation for understanding how linguistic practices and structures are deeply intertwined with ecological systems, suggesting that the loss of a language equates to the loss of environmental knowledge. This perspective is further supported by Harmon (2002), who explores the concept of biocultural diversity, illustrating how cultural and linguistic diversity are essential components of the Earth's biodiversity. Harmon's research emphasizes the role of Indigenous languages in maintaining ecological balance, advocating for the preservation of these languages as a means to protect the environment. The intersection of linguistics and natural sciences is further explored by Stepp, Wyndham, and Zarger (2002), who investigate the role of ethnobotanical knowledge in language. Their study demonstrates how linguistic practices encode detailed knowledge of plant species, highlighting the importance of language in the transmission of environmental intelligence. This body of work collectively argues for the recognition of language as a critical tool in environmental conservation, challenging traditional linguistic paradigms that overlook the ecological dimensions of language. The decolonization of linguistics is a central theme in environmental linguistics, as discussed by Smith (2012). Smith critiques the extractive practices of traditional linguistic research, advocating for a more collaborative approach that respects Indigenous knowledge systems. This perspective is echoed by Simpson (2014), who emphasizes the need for linguists to engage in knowledge coproduction with Indigenous communities, rather than treating them as mere sources of data. Simpson's work highlights the ethical implications of linguistic research, calling for a paradigm shift that prioritizes the voices and perspectives of Indigenous peoples. The importance of Indigenous languages in environmental knowledge is further illustrated by Nadasdy (2003), who examines the role of language in the transmission of traditional ecological knowledge among the Kluane First Nation. Nadasdy's research demonstrates how linguistic practices encode complex understandings of the natural world, challenging the notion that scientific knowledge is superior to Indigenous knowledge systems. This critique of the hierarchy of knowledge is further developed by Berkes (2012), who argues for the integration of Indigenous and scientific knowledge in environmental management. Berkes' work highlights the complementary nature of these knowledge systems, suggesting that their integration can lead to more sustainable environmental practices. The role of language in conceptualizing natural phenomena is explored by Ingold (2000), who argues that language shapes our perception of the environment. Ingold's research suggests that linguistic practices are not merely reflective of the natural world, but actively shape our understanding of it. This perspective is supported by Kohn (2013), who examines how the Runa people of the Ecuadorian Amazon use language to navigate their environment. Kohn's work demonstrates the dynamic relationship between language and ecology, illustrating how linguistic practices are embedded in the natural world. Finally, the importance of linguistic diversity in environmental conservation is highlighted by Romaine (2007), who argues that the preservation of linguistic diversity is essential for the maintenance of biodiversity. Romaine's research emphasizes the role of language in the transmission of environmental knowledge, suggesting that the loss of linguistic diversity poses a significant threat to ecological sustainability. Collectively, these studies underscore the critical role of environmental linguistics in bridging the gap between linguistic and ecological research, advocating for a more integrated approach to the study of language and the environment.", "References": [{"title": "On Biocultural Diversity: Linking Language, Knowledge, and the Environment", "authors": "Luisa Maffi", "journal": "Smithsonian Institution Press", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "578", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "In Light of Our Differences: How Diversity in Nature and Culture Makes Us Human", "authors": "David Harmon", "journal": "Smithsonian Institution Press", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "256", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Ethnobiology and Biocultural Diversity", "authors": "John Richard Stepp, Felice S.
