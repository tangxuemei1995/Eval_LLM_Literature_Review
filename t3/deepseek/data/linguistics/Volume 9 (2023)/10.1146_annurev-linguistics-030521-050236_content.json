{"Literature Review": "Heritage languages, defined as sociopolitically minority or minoritized languages acquired in bilingual or multilingual contexts, present a unique area of study within linguistics and cognitive sciences. These languages are typically acquired under conditions of reduced exposure compared to the majority language, leading to structural differences and changes at all levels of linguistic analysis. This literature review explores foundational studies on the linguistic properties of heritage languages, age effects in language acquisition, and recent research on heritage language relearning and reactivation, highlighting their implications for bilingualism, society, and the language and cognitive sciences.\n\nFoundational studies have established that heritage languages exhibit distinct linguistic properties compared to baseline grammars, primarily due to the complex interaction between the nature and quantity of input and the age of bilinguals. Montrul (2008) highlights that heritage speakers often show incomplete acquisition or attrition of their heritage language, particularly in areas of grammar that are less salient or less frequent in the input. This phenomenon is attributed to the reduced exposure to the heritage language during critical periods of language development.\n\nAge effects play a crucial role in differentiating heritage language acquisition from first (L1) and second language (L2) acquisition. Research by Polinsky (2011) suggests that heritage speakers, who acquire their heritage language as an L1 but shift to the majority language during childhood, often exhibit patterns of language use and proficiency that differ from both monolingual native speakers and L2 learners. These differences are influenced by the age at which the shift to the majority language occurs, with earlier shifts leading to greater divergence from baseline grammars.\n\nRecent studies have focused on the potential for heritage language relearning and reactivation, offering insights into the plasticity of language systems in bilingual individuals. Oh, Au, and Jun (2010) demonstrate that heritage speakers can achieve significant improvements in their heritage language proficiency through targeted instruction and increased exposure, suggesting that aspects of the heritage language remain accessible even after periods of disuse. This finding has important implications for language education and policy, particularly in supporting heritage language maintenance and revitalization.\n\nThe study of heritage languages also contributes to our understanding of bilingualism and its cognitive and societal impacts. Bialystok, Craik, and Luk (2012) discuss how bilingualism, including heritage language use, can enhance cognitive flexibility and executive function, highlighting the benefits of maintaining heritage languages for individual and societal well-being. Furthermore, heritage languages serve as a vital link to cultural identity and heritage, underscoring the importance of their preservation in multicultural societies.\n\nIn conclusion, heritage languages offer a rich field of study that intersects with linguistics, cognitive science, and sociocultural research. The foundational and recent studies reviewed here underscore the complexity of heritage language acquisition, use, and relearning, as well as their significant implications for bilingualism, language education, and societal integration. As the global landscape becomes increasingly multilingual, understanding and supporting heritage languages will be crucial for fostering linguistic diversity and cultural heritage.", "References": [{"title": "Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: Re-examining the age factor", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "Studies in Second Language Acquisition", "year": "2008", "volumes": "30", "first page": "225", "last page": "257", "DOI": "10.1017/S0272263108080290"}, {"title": "Reanalysis in adult heritage language: A case for attrition", "authors": "Maria Polinsky", "journal": "Studies in Second Language Acquisition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "33", "first page": "305", "last page": "328", "DOI": "10.1017/S027226311000077X"}, {"title": "Heritage language literacy: A study of US biliterates", "authors": "Janet S.
