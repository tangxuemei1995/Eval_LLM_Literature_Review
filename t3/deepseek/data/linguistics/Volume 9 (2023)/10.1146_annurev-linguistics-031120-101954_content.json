{"Literature Review": "Prosodic prominence, a key concept in the study of phonology and linguistics, has evolved significantly since its theoretical inception in the mid-twentieth century. Initially, the concept of stress was generalized across word and sentence levels, as seen in English word pairs like 'insight'/'incite' and sentence pairs like 'THEY left'/'they LEFT'. This broad notion was later refined into a distinction between abstract word stress and concrete phrasal accent or prominence, which applies to specific words within an utterance (Liberman & Prince, 1977). This distinction has paved the way for extensive research into the phonetic and non-phonetic cues that signal prosodic prominence. Early studies predominantly focused on intonational pitch movements as the primary cue for prominence (Bolinger, 1958). However, subsequent research has highlighted the importance of other phonetic cues, such as duration, intensity, and spectral tilt, as well as categorical differences between types of pitch movements (Ladd, 1996). Moreover, non-phonetic factors, including word frequency and syntactic structure, have been shown to influence the perception and production of prominence (Cutler & Carter, 1987). Despite these advancements, the definition of prosodic prominence remains largely informal, relying on intuitions that are primarily well-motivated in European languages. This limitation has become increasingly apparent as research has uncovered significant cross-linguistic differences in the realization and perception of prominence (Beckman & Edwards, 1994). These findings suggest the need for a more comprehensive theory of word and sentence stress that can accommodate the diversity of prosodic systems across languages. One promising approach is to treat both word stress and sentence stress as manifestations of a hierarchical prosodic structure, as assumed in metrical phonology (Hayes, 1995). This framework allows for the integration of significant differences in prosodic typology, providing a more nuanced understanding of how prominence operates across languages. Recent methodologies, such as Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT), have further contributed to this area by enabling the collection of large-scale, cross-linguistic data on the perception of prosodic prominence (Cole et al., 2010). These developments underscore the importance of considering both universal principles and language-specific characteristics in the study of prosodic prominence. As research continues to explore the phonetic, phonological, and cognitive aspects of prominence, it is clear that a more inclusive and flexible theoretical framework is essential for capturing the full range of prosodic phenomena observed across the world's languages.", "References": [{"title": "On stress and linguistic rhythm", "authors": "Liberman, Mark, Prince, Alan", "journal": "Linguistic Inquiry", "year": "1977", "volumes": "8", "first page": "249", "last page": "336", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A theory of pitch accent in English", "authors": "Bolinger, Dwight", "journal": "Word", "year": "1958", "volumes": "14", "first page": "109", "last page": "149", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Intonational Phonology", "authors": "Ladd, D.
