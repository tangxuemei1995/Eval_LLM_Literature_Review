{"Literature Review": "Mimas, one of Saturn's mid-sized moons, has long been considered a frozen, geologically inactive world due to its heavily cratered surface and lack of visible tectonic features, such as those observed on its neighbor Enceladus. However, recent findings from the Cassini mission have sparked a reevaluation of Mimas' internal structure and geological history, suggesting the possibility of a subsurface ocean beneath its icy shell. This literature review explores the evidence supporting the ocean hypothesis for Mimas, its implications for the moon's formation and evolution, and the broader implications for understanding ocean worlds within the Saturnian system and beyond. The hypothesis of a subsurface ocean within Mimas is primarily based on Cassini's measurements of the moon's libration, which indicated a non-synchronous rotation that could be explained by the presence of a global ocean beneath the ice shell (Tajeddine et al., 2014). This finding was surprising, given Mimas' heavily cratered surface, which suggests a long history of geological inactivity. However, subsequent studies have proposed that Mimas' ocean could be relatively young, formed through tidal heating as a result of its orbital evolution (Rhoden et al., 2017). This scenario would imply that Mimas is not a primordial body but rather a product of a more recent event, such as the disruption of Saturn's rings. The idea that Mimas could have originated from Saturn's rings is supported by models of ring dynamics, which suggest that moons can form from ring material and migrate outward over time (Charnoz et al., 2011). This process could also explain the formation of Enceladus' ocean and its associated geological activity, suggesting a common mechanism for the development of ocean worlds within the Saturnian system. The potential for a subsurface ocean within Mimas has significant implications for our understanding of the moon's thermal and geological evolution. If Mimas does indeed harbor an ocean, it would join Enceladus and possibly Titan as ocean worlds within the Saturnian system, expanding the potential for habitability beyond Earth (Hedman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the presence of oceans within Saturn's mid-sized moons raises questions about the habitability of similar bodies in other planetary systems, such as the moons of Uranus. The Uranus system, with its diverse array of icy moons, has been identified as a high-priority target for future exploration, with the potential to uncover new insights into the processes that drive the formation and evolution of ocean worlds (Schenk et al., 2018). In conclusion, the hypothesis of a subsurface ocean within Mimas challenges our traditional view of the moon as a frozen, geologically inactive body. Instead, Mimas may represent a young ocean world, formed through processes related to Saturn's rings and destined to become an active world in the future. This reevaluation of Mimas' internal structure and geological history has broad implications for our understanding of ocean worlds within the Saturnian system and beyond, highlighting the importance of continued exploration and study of these enigmatic bodies.", "References": [{"title": "Constraints on Mimas' interior from Cassini ISS libration measurements", "authors": "Tajeddine, Radwan, Rambaux, Nicolas, Lainey, Valéry, Charnoz, Sébastien, Richard, André, Rivoldini, Attilio, Noyelles, Benoît", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "346", "first page": "322", "last page": "324", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1255299"}, {"title": "The implications of Mimas' libration for its interior structure", "authors": "Rhoden, Alyssa Rose, Henning, Wade, Hurford, Terry, Hamilton, Douglas P.", "journal": "Icarus", "year": "2017", "volumes": "286", "first page": "48", "last page": "59", "DOI": "10.1016/j.icarus.2016.09.025"}, {"title": "Accretion of Saturn's mid-sized moons during the viscous spreading of young rings", "authors": "Charnoz, Sébastien, Salmon, Julien, Crida, Aurélien", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "475", "first page": "357", "last page": "359", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10209"}, {"title": "The source of Saturn's G ring", "authors": "Hedman, Matthew M., Burns, Joseph A., Tiscareno, Matthew S., Porco, Carolyn C., Jones, Geraint H., Roussos, Elias, Krupp, Norbert, Paranicas, Chris, Kempf, Sascha", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "317", "first page": "653", "last page": "656", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1143964"}, {"title": "The geology of the Uranian satellites", "authors": "Schenk, Paul M., Moore, Jeffrey M., Pappalardo, Robert T., McKinnon, William B., Spencer, John R., Zahnle, Kevin J., Dones, Luke, Levison, Harold F., Prockter, Louise M., Stern, S.
