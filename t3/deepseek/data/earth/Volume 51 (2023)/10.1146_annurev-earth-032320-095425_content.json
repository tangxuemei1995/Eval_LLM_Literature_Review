{"Literature Review": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels through the Phanerozoic Eon has been a subject of intense research due to its critical role in the development and sustenance of complex life forms. The early Earth's atmosphere was largely anoxic, and the transition to an oxygen-rich environment was pivotal for the evolution of complex animals, including humans. This literature review synthesizes findings from various studies that have attempted to reconstruct the atmospheric O2 levels over the past 539 million years, focusing on the methodologies employed and the consensus they have helped to build. The Cambrian period, marking the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon, is characterized by an atmospheric O2 concentration of approximately 5–10%. This period witnessed the Cambrian Explosion, a significant evolutionary event that led to the rapid diversification of life forms. Studies suggest that the rise in O2 levels during this time may have been a key driver of this evolutionary radiation (Berner et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2016). Following the Cambrian, the Ordovician period also experienced evolutionary radiations, which some researchers attribute to further increases in atmospheric O2 (Edwards et al., 2017). The Devonian period, often referred to as the 'Age of the Fishes', saw O2 levels rise to around 15–20%. This increase in oxygen is believed to have facilitated the evolution of large, active fish and the colonization of land by plants and animals (Dahl et al., 2010; Glasspool & Scott, 2010). The Permo-Carboniferous period represents the peak of atmospheric O2 levels during the Phanerozoic, with concentrations exceeding 25%. This high oxygen environment is thought to have supported the gigantism observed in insects and amphibians of the time (Harrison et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2006). However, following this peak, O2 levels began to decline, a trend that has continued toward the present day. The methods used to reconstruct past O2 levels include geochemical proxies, such as the isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks and the abundance of redox-sensitive elements, as well as modeling approaches that simulate the Earth's carbon and oxygen cycles (Bergman et al., 2004; Krause et al., 2018). Despite the challenges and uncertainties associated with these methods, a consensus is emerging that links significant evolutionary events to changes in atmospheric O2 levels. This review underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics of Earth's atmospheric composition, not only for unraveling the history of life on our planet but also for assessing the potential for life on exoplanets.", "References": [{"title": "GEOCARBSULF: A combined model for Phanerozoic atmospheric O2 and CO2", "authors": "Robert A.
