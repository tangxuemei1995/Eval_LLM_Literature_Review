{"Literature Review": "The study of fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes is pivotal in understanding the mechanics of earthquake rupture propagation and the dynamic weakening of faults. Large seismogenic faults are characterized by meter-thick fault cores enveloped by extensive damage zones, where the dissipation of stored elastic strain energy occurs through fracture and frictional processes, as well as the radiation of seismic waves (Aki, 1979). This energy partitioning is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms behind fault weakening and the processes driving rupture across various scales.\n\nFracture energy (G) or breakdown work (Wb) refers to the energy dissipated during the propagation of an earthquake rupture along a fault. Research has demonstrated that these energies scale with fault slip, indicating a relationship between the amount of slip and the energy dissipated during an earthquake (Kanamori and Heaton, 2000). This scaling suggests that while material-dependent constant fracture energies are significant at the microscale, affecting the fracturing of individual grains within the fault zone, they play a negligible role in the macroscale processes that govern rupture propagation on natural faults (Rice, 2006).\n\nThe energy budget of an earthquake, encompassing the distribution of energy among various processes, remains a subject of debate. Contributions from seismological, geological, modeling, and experimental studies are essential to unraveling this complex issue (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005). Seismological estimates of fracture energy, derived from the analysis of seismic waves, provide insights into the dynamic processes occurring during an earthquake (Ide and Takeo, 1997). Geological studies, on the other hand, offer a perspective on the long-term accumulation and release of energy through the examination of fault zone structures and the materials within them (Sibson, 2003).\n\nModeling studies have been instrumental in simulating the conditions under which earthquakes occur, allowing for the exploration of the relationship between fracture energy and fault slip (Andrews, 2004). Experimental studies, conducted under controlled conditions, have contributed to our understanding of the frictional properties of fault materials and the mechanisms of dynamic weakening (Di Toro et al., 2011). Together, these multidisciplinary approaches have advanced our understanding of the energy budget of earthquakes and the processes that govern rupture propagation.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes is essential for understanding the mechanics of earthquake rupture and the dynamic weakening of faults. The scaling of fracture energy with fault slip highlights the importance of macroscale processes in governing rupture propagation on natural faults. Despite the progress made, the energy budget of earthquakes remains a complex issue that requires further investigation through a multidisciplinary approach.", "References": [{"title": "A constitutive law for rate of earthquake production and its application to earthquake clustering", "authors": "Keiiti Aki", "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "year": "1979", "volumes": "84", "first page": "6140", "last page": "6148", "DOI": "10.1029/JB084iB11p06140"}, {"title": "Microscopic and Macroscopic Physics of Earthquakes", "authors": "Hiroo Kanamori, Thomas Heaton", "journal": "Geophysical Monograph Series", "year": "2000", "volumes": "120", "first page": "147", "last page": "163", "DOI": "10.1029/GM120p0147"}, {"title": "Heating and weakening of faults during earthquake slip", "authors": "James R.
