{"Literature Review": "Estella Atekwana's autobiographical notes provide a compelling narrative of her journey from Cameroon to becoming a distinguished geophysicist and academic leader. Her story is not just a personal memoir but also a testament to the challenges and triumphs faced by women, especially Black women, in the geosciences. Atekwana's career trajectory offers insights into the development of biogeophysics as a subdiscipline, her contributions to the understanding of continental rift tectonics, and her leadership in enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the geosciences. This literature review explores these themes, drawing on Atekwana's narrative and related studies to contextualize her contributions and the broader implications for the geosciences and academia. Atekwana's pioneering work in biogeophysics has significantly advanced our understanding of the interactions between biological processes and geophysical phenomena. Her research has demonstrated how microbial activity can influence geophysical properties, a concept that was not widely recognized before her contributions (Atekwana and Slater, 2009). This interdisciplinary approach has opened new avenues for research in environmental science, hydrology, and geobiology, highlighting the importance of integrating biological and geophysical methods to address complex environmental issues. In the realm of continental rift tectonics, Atekwana's work has been instrumental in elucidating the processes that drive the formation and evolution of continental rifts. Her studies in the East African Rift System have provided critical insights into the role of magmatism, faulting, and sedimentation in rift development (Atekwana et al., 2004). These findings have not only advanced our understanding of rift tectonics but also have implications for natural resource exploration and hazard assessment in rift zones. Atekwana's leadership in promoting DEI in the geosciences is another significant aspect of her career. As the first Black woman in many of her professional roles, she has been a vocal advocate for increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences. Her efforts to develop a diverse talent pipeline through mentorship, outreach, and policy advocacy have contributed to a more inclusive academic environment (Atekwana, 2018). These initiatives are crucial for addressing the systemic barriers that hinder the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Navigating the academic job market as part of a dual-career couple is another challenge that Atekwana has openly discussed. Her experiences shed light on the complexities of balancing professional aspirations with personal relationships, a common issue in academia that often goes unaddressed (Atekwana and Atekwana, 2010). By sharing her story, Atekwana has contributed to a broader conversation about the need for institutional support for dual-career couples, which is essential for attracting and retaining diverse talent in academia. Atekwana's commitment to student success is evident in her extensive mentorship and teaching activities. She has played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of numerous students, many of whom have gone on to make significant contributions to the geosciences (Atekwana, 2020). Her approach to mentorship, which emphasizes the importance of creating supportive and inclusive learning environments, serves as a model for fostering the next generation of geoscientists. In conclusion, Estella Atekwana's autobiographical notes offer a rich and multifaceted account of her career, highlighting her contributions to biogeophysics, continental rift tectonics, DEI, and student success. Her story is a powerful reminder of the impact that one individual can have on their field and the importance of diversity, mentorship, and resilience in overcoming the challenges of academia. Atekwana's legacy will undoubtedly continue to inspire and influence the geosciences for years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Biogeophysics: A new frontier in Earth science research", "authors": "Estella A.
