{"Literature Review": "River deltas, as dynamic interfaces between terrestrial and marine environments, are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR), a consequence of global climate change. The intricate balance between sediment supply, fluvial processes, and marine dynamics that sustains these landforms is increasingly threatened by accelerated SLR rates. This literature review synthesizes current understanding of river delta responses to SLR, drawing on models, experimental studies, and geological records, with a focus on the Holocene epoch to projections for 2300 CE. The review highlights advancements in detecting and modeling regional SLR, improvements in morphodynamic delta modeling, and the persistent uncertainties surrounding subsidence rates and delta submergence observations. The initiation and progradation of river deltas during the Holocene were significantly influenced by variations in sea-level and sediment supply histories, leading to diverse delta morphologies and evolutionary paths (Syvitski et al., 2009). Modern deltas, having developed under relatively stable sea-level conditions, now face unprecedented SLR rates, increasing their susceptibility to forced transgression and potential loss of land area (Tessler et al., 2015). Recent advancements in regional sea-level projections have enhanced our understanding of the dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the contributions from the Antarctic ice sheet, which remains a critical factor in future SLR scenarios (Kopp et al., 2014). Vertical land motion, including subsidence and uplift, plays a pivotal role in determining relative sea-level changes in deltaic regions. However, limited observational data complicate accurate projections and underscore the need for improved monitoring and modeling efforts (Erkens et al., 2016). Morphodynamic models of river deltas have seen significant improvements, incorporating complex interactions between fluvial, marine, and atmospheric processes. These models are crucial for predicting delta responses to SLR and informing adaptation strategies (Nienhuis et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, substantial uncertainties remain, particularly regarding present and future subsidence rates in deltaic regions. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern SLR are scarce, posing challenges for model validation and the development of effective mitigation strategies (Giosan et al., 2014). Projections indicate that river deltas globally could lose approximately 5% of their surface area by 2100, and up to 50% by 2300 under high-emission scenarios, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive research and policy interventions to safeguard these critical ecosystems (Nicholls et al., 2019). The integration of geological records, modern observations, and advanced modeling techniques offers a promising pathway for understanding and mitigating the impacts of SLR on river deltas. However, addressing the knowledge gaps and uncertainties identified in this review is essential for developing robust strategies to protect these vulnerable landforms and the communities that depend on them.", "References": [{"title": "Sinking deltas due to human activities", "authors": "James P.
