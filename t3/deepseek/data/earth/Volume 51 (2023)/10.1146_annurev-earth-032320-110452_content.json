{"Literature Review": "The Gangdese Batholith in southern Tibet serves as a critical archive for understanding continental crustal growth processes, particularly in the context of the India-Asia collision zone. This batholith, characterized by an overthickened layer of felsic composition with an underlying granulite-eclogite layer, records a complex history of magmatism spanning from 245 to 10 Ma. The magmatic activity within the Gangdese Batholith was not continuous but punctuated by significant flare-ups at 185−170, 90−75, and 55−45 Ma, each driven by a combination of external and internal factors (Zhu et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2009). These flare-ups are indicative of the dynamic processes involved in the growth and stabilization of continental crust in collision zones. The initial phase of crustal growth in the Gangdese Batholith was dominated by fractional crystallization, leading to the formation of voluminous (ultra)mafic arc cumulates in the lower crust during subduction. This process was followed by the melting of these cumulates during late-subduction and collision phases, a transition that was significantly influenced by changes in the convergence rate between the Indian and Asian plates (Chung et al., 2005; Hou et al., 2004). The combined accumulation-melting process not only contributed to the vertical stratification of the Gangdese crust but also facilitated density sorting, which is a critical factor in the stabilization of continental crust. Comparisons with other thickened collision zones, such as the Andes and the Himalayas, suggest that the accumulation-melting process observed in the Gangdese Batholith is a general mechanism for the vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust (DeCelles et al., 2009; Kapp et al., 2007). The Gangdese Batholith's record of the world's thickest crust, reaching greater than 50 km at 55–45 Ma and greater than 70 km after 32 Ma, underscores the significance of magmatic processes in the development of continental crust in collision zones (Zhang et al., 2012; Mo et al., 2007). The last magmatic flare-up at 55−45 Ma, which marks the arrival of India, highlights the role of external drivers in initiating significant magmatic events that contribute to crustal growth and stabilization (Lee et al., 2009; Yin & Harrison, 2000). In conclusion, the Gangdese Batholith provides invaluable insights into the processes of continental crustal growth, particularly through the lens of magmatic arc development, crustal stratification, and the dynamics of collision zones. The accumulation-melting process, as recorded in the Gangdese Batholith, offers a general model for understanding the vertical stratification and stabilization of continental crust in similarly thickened collision zones around the world.", "References": [{"title": "Zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic constraints on petrogenesis of the Gangdese batholith, southern Tibet", "authors": "Zhu, D.C., Pan, G.T., Mo, X.X., Wang, L.Q., Zhao, Z.D., Liao, Z.L., Dong, G.C., Liu, Y.S.", "journal": "Chemical Geology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "280", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.10.014"}, {"title": "The Gangdese magmatic belt: A window into the evolution of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean and the India-Asia collision", "authors": "Ji, W.Q., Wu, F.Y., Chung, S.L., Li, J.X., Liu, C.Z.", "journal": "Earth-Science Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "96", "first page": "236", "last page": "257", "DOI": "10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.06.005"}, {"title": "Tibetan tectonic evolution inferred from spatial and temporal variations in post-collisional magmatism", "authors": "Chung, S.L., Chu, M.F., Zhang, Y.Q., Xie, Y.W., Lo, C.H., Lee, T.Y., Lan, C.Y., Li, X.H., Zhang, Q., Wang, Y.Z.", "journal": "Earth-Science Reviews", "year": "2005", "volumes": "68", "first page": "173", "last page": "196", "DOI": "10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.05.001"}, {"title": "The Himalayan collision zone carbonatites in western Sichuan, SW China: petrogenesis, mantle source and tectonic implication", "authors": "Hou, Z.Q., Tian, S.H., Yuan, Z.X., Xie, Y.L., Yin, S.P., Yi, L.S., Fei, H.C., Yang, Z.M.", "journal": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "year": "2004", "volumes": "228", "first page": "525", "last page": "542", "DOI": "10.1016/j.epsl.2004.10.018"}, {"title": "Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Himalayan orogen as constrained by along-strike variation of structural geometry, exhumation history, and foreland sedimentation", "authors": "DeCelles, P.G., Kapp, P., Gehrels, G.E., Ding, L.", "journal": "Earth-Science Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "92", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1016/j.earscirev.2008.12.003"}, {"title": "Geologic evolution of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen", "authors": "Kapp, P., DeCelles, P.G., Gehrels, G.E., Heizler, M., Ding, L.", "journal": "Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences", "year": "2007", "volumes": "35", "first page": "273", "last page": "313", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.earth.35.031306.140158"}, {"title": "Crustal thickening prior to 38 Ma in southern Tibet: Evidence from lower crust-derived adakitic magmatism in the Gangdese Batholith", "authors": "Zhang, Z.M., Zhao, G.C., Santosh, M., Wang, J.L., Dong, X., Shen, K.", "journal": "Gondwana Research", "year": "2012", "volumes": "21", "first page": "88", "last page": "99", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gr.2011.07.004"}, {"title": "Contribution of syncollisional felsic magmatism to continental crust growth: A case study of the Paleogene Linzizong volcanic succession in southern Tibet", "authors": "Mo, X.X., Hou, Z.Q., Niu, Y.L., Dong, G.C., Qu, X.M., Zhao, Z.D., Yang, Z.M.", "journal": "Chemical Geology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "245", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chemgeo.2007.07.022"}, {"title": "Eocene Neotethyan slab breakoff in southern Tibet inferred from the Linzizong volcanic record", "authors": "Lee, H.Y., Chung, S.L., Lo, C.H., Ji, J.Q., Lee, T.Y., Qian, Q., Zhang, Q.", "journal": "Tectonophysics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "477", "first page": "20", "last page": "35", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tecto.2009.02.031"}, {"title": "Geologic evolution of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen", "authors": "Yin, A., Harrison, T.M.", "journal": "Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences", "year": "2000", "volumes": "28", "first page": "211", "last page": "280", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.earth.28.1.211"}]}
