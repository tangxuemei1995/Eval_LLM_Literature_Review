{"Literature Review": "The chronology of Moon formation has been a subject of intense research and debate within the scientific community. The age of the Moon is crucial for understanding the early history of the Solar System and the processes involved in the formation of terrestrial planets. Radiometric dating of lunar samples has provided insights into the timing of Moon formation, with a particular focus on the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) as a key event. This event is considered the most reliable for dating because it occurred shortly after the Moon's formation, within tens of millions of years. The crystallization of the LMO produced three main types of dateable materials: mafic mantle cumulates, felsic crustal cumulates, and the late-stage crystallization product known as urKREEP (uniform residuum K, rare earth elements, and P). Despite the wide range of ages reported in the literature, spanning 200 million years, a significant number of reliable ages cluster around 4.35 billion years for all three lunar rock types. This clustering suggests that the Moon's formation and the crystallization of its magma ocean occurred around this time, indicating a late formation in the context of Solar System history. The repeated occurrence of 4.35 Gyr ages in both primary and secondary crustal rocks further supports the hypothesis that these materials were produced contemporaneously, possibly during the crystallization and overturn of the magma ocean. The giant impact hypothesis, which posits that the Moon formed from the debris of a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized body, is consistent with this late formation age. This hypothesis is supported by the isotopic similarities between Earth and Moon rocks, suggesting a common origin. The duration of planet formation, as inferred from the ages of the oldest lunar rocks, provides key information on the mechanisms of terrestrial planet formation. However, the interpretation of these ages is complicated by the potential for impact metamorphism to disturb the isotopic systems used for dating. Despite these challenges, the clustering of ages around 4.35 Gyr for compositionally distinct crust and mantle materials produced by LMO differentiation is a robust finding. This age not only marks the time of Moon formation but also provides a critical constraint for models of the early Solar System. The evolving chronology of Moon formation, as revealed by radiometric dating of lunar samples, underscores the importance of the Moon as a natural laboratory for studying planetary formation processes. Future research, including the analysis of new lunar samples and the refinement of dating techniques, will continue to refine our understanding of the Moon's formation and its implications for the history of the Solar System.", "References": [{"title": "The age of the Moon and the early bombardment history of the terrestrial planets", "authors": "William F.
