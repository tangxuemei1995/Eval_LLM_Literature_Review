{"Literature Review": "Iceberg calving, the process by which ice breaks off from the terminus of a glacier or ice sheet, is a critical component of the Earth's cryosphere and has significant implications for global sea-level rise. The phenomenon is complex, involving both mechanical and environmental factors that influence the rate and magnitude of ice loss. Recent studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms behind iceberg calving, with particular attention to the role of ice flow dynamics and environmental conditions in controlling calving rates. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on iceberg calving, emphasizing the classification of calving regimes, the factors influencing regime transitions, and the implications for sea-level rise projections. The majority of iceberg calving occurs near or just downglacier of locations where ice flows into environments more conducive to calving, suggesting that the rate of ice flow to the margin is a primary control on calving rates rather than the fracturing process itself (Benn et al., 2007). This insight has led to the classification of calving into five distinct regimes, each characterized by specific ice dynamics and environmental conditions. These regimes are generally persistent and predictable, and they exhibit a degree of insensitivity to minor perturbations in flow velocity, ice characteristics, or environmental forcing (Bassis & Walker, 2012). However, sufficiently large perturbations can induce rapid transitions between calving regimes or between calving and non-calving behavior, during which the fracturing process may become the dominant control on calving rates (Nick et al., 2013). Such transitions are of particular concern because they underlie the largest uncertainties in projections of sea-level rise. Despite their importance, regime transitions have been difficult to observe and study instrumentally, especially those that are most critical for sea-level rise projections (Joughin et al., 2014). To address these uncertainties, researchers have called for the development of process-based models informed by studies of ongoing calving events, as well as the assimilation of paleoclimatic data to better understand the potential for future regime transitions (Pollard et al., 2015). The failure to accurately incorporate calving processes into predictive models could result in significant underestimates of warming-induced sea-level rise, highlighting the need for continued research in this area. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which contain the vast majority of the Earth's glacial ice, are of particular concern due to their potential to contribute significantly to sea-level rise through iceberg calving (Rignot et al., 2011). Studies have shown that the stability of these ice sheets is closely linked to the dynamics of their marine-terminating glaciers, where calving is a primary mechanism of ice loss (Mouginot et al., 2014). The interaction between ice flow, ocean temperatures, and basal melting at the ice-ocean interface plays a critical role in determining calving rates and the overall stability of these ice sheets (Holland et al., 2008). As global temperatures continue to rise, the potential for increased calving and accelerated ice loss from these critical regions poses a significant threat to global sea levels. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the processes governing iceberg calving, much remains to be learned about the factors that influence regime transitions and their implications for sea-level rise. Continued research, including the development of more sophisticated models and the integration of paleoclimatic data, will be essential for improving projections of future sea-level rise and informing strategies for mitigating its impacts.", "References": [{"title": "Calving processes and the dynamics of calving glaciers", "authors": "Benn, Douglas I., Warren, Charles R., Mottram, Ruth H.", "journal": "Earth-Science Reviews", "year": "2007", "volumes": "82", "first page": "143", "last page": "179", "DOI": "10.1016/j.earscirev.2007.02.002"}, {"title": "Upper and lower limits on the stability of calving glaciers from the yield strength envelope of ice", "authors": "Bassis, Jeremy N., Walker, Catherine C.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences", "year": "2012", "volumes": "468", "first page": "913", "last page": "931", "DOI": "10.1098/rspa.2011.0422"}, {"title": "Future sea-level rise from Greenland’s main outlet glaciers in a warming climate", "authors": "Nick, Faezeh M., Vieli, Andreas, Andersen, Morten L., Joughin, Ian, Payne, Antony, Edwards, Tamsin L., Pattyn, Frank, van de Wal, Roderik S.W.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "497", "first page": "235", "last page": "238", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12068"}, {"title": "Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Under Way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica", "authors": "Joughin, Ian, Smith, Benjamin E., Medley, Brooke", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "344", "first page": "735", "last page": "738", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1249055"}, {"title": "Potential Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat driven by hydrofracturing and ice cliff failure", "authors": "Pollard, David, DeConto, Robert M., Alley, Richard B.", "journal": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "year": "2015", "volumes": "412", "first page": "112", "last page": "121", "DOI": "10.1016/j.epsl.2014.12.035"}, {"title": "Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise", "authors": "Rignot, Eric, Velicogna, Isabella, van den Broeke, Michiel R., Monaghan, Andrew, Lenaerts, Jan T.M.", "journal": "Geophysical Research Letters", "year": "2011", "volumes": "38", "first page": "L05503", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1029/2011GL046583"}, {"title": "Sustained increase in ice discharge from the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, from 1973 to 2013", "authors": "Mouginot, Jérémie, Rignot, Eric, Scheuchl, Bernd", "journal": "Geophysical Research Letters", "year": "2014", "volumes": "41", "first page": "1576", "last page": "1584", "DOI": "10.1002/2013GL059069"}, {"title": "Acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbræ triggered by warm subsurface ocean waters", "authors": "Holland, David M., Thomas, Robert H., de Young, Brad, Ribergaard, Mads H., Lyberth, Bjarne", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2008", "volumes": "1", "first page": "659", "last page": "664", "DOI": "10.1038/ngeo316"}]}
