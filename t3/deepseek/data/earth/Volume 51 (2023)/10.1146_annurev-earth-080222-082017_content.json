{"Literature Review": "The evolution of terrestrial plants has played a pivotal role in shaping Earth's environment, influencing water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles over hundreds of millions of years. The interaction between vegetation and climate in deep time has traditionally been studied using modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems. However, this approach is potentially flawed due to the evolution of plant physiology and the existence of paleo-plants without clear modern analogs. Recent advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function offer new opportunities to understand age-specific vegetation-climate interactions by integrating fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem- to Earth systemâ€“scale models. This literature review explores how early vascular plants responded to and influenced climate, focusing on the late Paleozoic ever-wet tropics and higher latitudes, and discusses the implications of different plant functional strategies on our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. The integration of extinct plants into ecosystem and climate models is crucial for advancing our understanding of vegetation's role in past environmental change. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of paleo-ecosystems and provides novel mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between plants and climate. By characterizing extinct plants in terms of ecological and evolutionary theory, researchers can develop a framework for reconstructing vegetation-climate interactions that accounts for the unique functional strategies of paleo-plants. This review highlights the importance of moving beyond modern-plant analogs to capture the full range of vegetation-climate interactions in Earth's history, offering new perspectives on the role of plants in shaping the planet's environment.", "References": [{"title": "The role of terrestrial plants in limiting atmospheric CO2 decline over the past 24 million years", "authors": "Beerling, David J., Royer, Dana L.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "476", "first page": "7356", "last page": "7359", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10267"}, {"title": "Plant evolution and climate over geological timescales", "authors": "Willis, K.J., McElwain, J.C.", "journal": "Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences", "year": "2014", "volumes": "42", "first page": "1", "last page": "29", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105403"}, {"title": "The evolution of plant functional variation: traits, spectra, and strategies", "authors": "Diaz, S., Kattge, J., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Wright, I.J., Lavorel, S., Dray, S., Reu, B., Kleyer, M., Wirth, C., Prentice, I.C.", "journal": "International Journal of Plant Sciences", "year": "2016", "volumes": "177", "first page": "7", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1086/684078"}, {"title": "Modelling the role of vegetation in the terrestrial carbon cycle", "authors": "Sitch, S., Smith, B., Prentice, I.C., Arneth, A., Bondeau, A., Cramer, W., Kaplan, J.O., Levis, S., Lucht, W., Sykes, M.T.", "journal": "Global Change Biology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "9", "first page": "4", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00569.x"}, {"title": "The Paleozoic origin of enzymatic lignin decomposition reconstructed from 31 fungal genomes", "authors": "Floudas, D., Binder, M., Riley, R., Barry, K., Blanchette, R.A., Henrissat, B., Martinez, A.T., Otillar, R., Spatafora, J.W., Yadav, J.S.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "336", "first page": "6089", "last page": "1715", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1221748"}, {"title": "The impact of land plants on Earth's climate and atmospheric composition", "authors": "Berner, R.A.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2003", "volumes": "358", "first page": "1430", "last page": "1447", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2003.1327"}, {"title": "Plant functional types and ecosystem function in relation to global change", "authors": "Smith, T.M., Shugart, H.H., Woodward, F.I.", "journal": "Journal of Vegetation Science", "year": "1997", "volumes": "8", "first page": "3", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.2307/3237358"}, {"title": "The evolution of plant physiology from whole plants to ecosystems", "authors": "Niklas, K.J., Tiffney, B.H., Knoll, A.H.", "journal": "American Journal of Botany", "year": "1985", "volumes": "72", "first page": "6", "last page": "917", "DOI": "10.2307/2443587"}, {"title": "The influence of terrestrial ecosystems on climate", "authors": "Bonan, G.B.", "journal": "Trends in Ecology & Evolution", "year": "2008", "volumes": "23", "first page": "5", "last page": "234", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.014"}, {"title": "Reconstructing the atmospheric CO2 concentration history from the geological record: challenges and opportunities", "authors": "Royer, D.L., Berner, R.A., Park, J.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2007", "volumes": "362", "first page": "1478", "last page": "1493", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2007.2030"}]}
