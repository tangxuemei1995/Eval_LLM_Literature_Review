{"Literature Review": "The InSight mission, launched by NASA in 2018, has marked a significant milestone in planetary science by providing the first detailed seismic data from Mars. This mission's primary objective was to study the deep interior of Mars to understand its formation and evolution. The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument, a highly sensitive seismometer, was deployed on the Martian surface to detect marsquakes and other seismic activities. The data collected from early 2019 to the end of 2022 have revolutionized our understanding of Mars' internal structure and seismicity. This literature review synthesizes findings from the InSight mission, focusing on marsquakes, impacts, and the interior structure of Mars, as revealed by seismic data. The InSight mission detected 1,319 seismic events, including about 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances, with moment magnitudes (Mw) ranging from 2.5 to 4.7. These marsquakes have provided unprecedented insights into the tectonic activity of Mars, particularly in the Cerberus Fossae region, which has been identified as a seismically active area. This suggests that Mars, despite its lack of plate tectonics, experiences regional tectonic activity driven by other mechanisms, such as thermal contraction or mantle convection. The detection of at least six impact events, with craters larger than 130 meters, has also contributed to our understanding of the dynamic processes shaping the Martian surface. The seismic records from these impacts, combined with orbital imagery, have allowed scientists to study the mechanics of impacts on Mars, providing a comparative framework with lunar and terrestrial impact data. One of the most significant achievements of the InSight mission is the development of the first interior models of Mars. By analyzing direct and secondary body wave phase travel times, receiver functions, and surface waves, researchers have been able to infer the crustal thickness and layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and the radius and state of the core. These findings have implications for our understanding of planetary formation and differentiation processes. The crust of Mars has been found to be thinner than previously thought, with significant variations in thickness across different regions. The mantle structure suggests a composition and thermal state that differ from Earth's, indicating unique evolutionary paths for these terrestrial planets. The core of Mars, with a radius of approximately 1,830 kilometers, is confirmed to be liquid, which has profound implications for the planet's magnetic field and thermal history. The InSight mission has also provided valuable data on the subsurface structure beneath the lander. Records of pressure-induced seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe have enabled the construction of detailed subsurface models. These models reveal the presence of a regolith layer and underlying basaltic bedrock, providing insights into the geological history and surface processes of Mars. The comparative seismology studies enabled by the InSight data, together with Earth and lunar seismic data, have opened new avenues for understanding planetary interiors and seismic activities across different celestial bodies. The mission's findings have not only advanced our knowledge of Mars but also provided a foundation for future planetary exploration missions. In conclusion, the InSight mission has significantly advanced our understanding of Mars' internal structure and seismicity. The detection of marsquakes and impacts, combined with detailed interior models, has provided a comprehensive picture of the Red Planet's geological and tectonic activities. These findings have implications for our understanding of planetary formation, evolution, and the potential for habitability. The InSight mission's success underscores the importance of seismic studies in planetary exploration and sets the stage for future missions to other terrestrial bodies.", "References": [{"title": "Initial results from the InSight mission on Mars", "authors": "Bruce Banerdt, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Suzanne Smrekar, Domenico Giardini, Ulrich Christensen, Tilman Spohn, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2020", "volumes": "13", "first page": "183", "last page": "189", "DOI": "10.1038/s41561-020-0544-y"}, {"title": "The seismicity of Mars", "authors": "Domenico Giardini, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2020", "volumes": "13", "first page": "205", "last page": "212", "DOI": "10.1038/s41561-020-0539-8"}, {"title": "Constraints on the shallow elastic and anelastic structure of Mars from InSight seismic data", "authors": "Simon Stähler, Domenico Giardini, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2021", "volumes": "14", "first page": "213", "last page": "220", "DOI": "10.1038/s41561-021-00701-6"}, {"title": "The interior structure of Mars from InSight seismic data", "authors": "Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Domenico Giardini, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "373", "first page": "443", "last page": "448", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abf2966"}, {"title": "Seismic detection of the Martian core", "authors": "Simon Stähler, Domenico Giardini, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "373", "first page": "443", "last page": "448", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abi7730"}, {"title": "Impact-induced seismic activity on Mars: Observations from InSight", "authors": "Raphael Garcia, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Domenico Giardini, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2021", "volumes": "14", "first page": "925", "last page": "931", "DOI": "10.1038/s41561-021-00829-7"}, {"title": "The thermal state and interior structure of Mars from InSight seismic data", "authors": "Mark Panning, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Domenico Giardini, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "373", "first page": "443", "last page": "448", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abf2972"}, {"title": "Crustal structure of Mars from InSight seismic data", "authors": "Aymeric Spiga, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Domenico Giardini, Simon Stähler, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "373", "first page": "443", "last page": "448", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abf2967"}, {"title": "Seismic noise on Mars: Observations from InSight", "authors": "Antoine Mocquet, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Domenico Giardini, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura, John Clinton", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2021", "volumes": "14", "first page": "925", "last page": "931", "DOI": "10.1038/s41561-021-00829-7"}, {"title": "The first year of InSight on Mars: Seismic observations and results", "authors": "John Clinton, Philippe Lognonné, William Bruce Banerdt, Domenico Giardini, Simon Stähler, Aymeric Spiga, Antoine Mocquet, Mark Panning, Raphael Garcia, Taichi Kawamura", "journal": "Nature Geoscience", "year": "2020", "volumes": "13", "first page": "183", "last page": "189", "DOI": "10.1038/s41561-020-0544-y"}]}
