{"Literature Review": "The governance of global supply chains is a complex and multifaceted issue that has significant implications for social and environmental outcomes at various levels. Existing literature predominantly focuses on the role of transnational firms in shaping these outcomes, often adopting an actor-centric approach. This perspective has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms through which firms and nations influence supply chain governance and its consequences. However, this focus has also led to a relative neglect of the localized social and environmental outcomes that emerge at the production sites themselves. These outcomes are influenced by a complex interplay of local, national, and global actors and institutions, suggesting the need for a more nuanced, multi-level approach to understanding supply chain governance. Recent studies have begun to explore the drivers of variation in these localized outcomes, highlighting the importance of considering the broader context in which supply chains operate. For instance, research by Gereffi et al. (2005) emphasizes the role of global value chains in shaping labor and environmental standards across different production sites. Similarly, Locke (2013) examines how local labor conditions are influenced by both global supply chain pressures and local institutional contexts. These studies underscore the need to move beyond an actor-centric approach and consider the multi-level interactions that shape supply chain governance. A multi-level approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs, synergies, and spillovers between social and environmental outcomes. For example, research by Ponte and Sturgeon (2014) highlights how local environmental regulations can interact with global supply chain pressures to produce varying outcomes at different production sites. Similarly, studies by Bartley (2007) and O’Rourke (2014) explore how local labor movements and global corporate social responsibility initiatives can influence labor conditions in supply chains. These findings suggest that a multi-level approach can provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of supply chain governance. Furthermore, the concept of polycentricity offers a useful framework for understanding the multi-level nature of supply chain governance. Polycentricity refers to the presence of multiple, overlapping centers of decision-making that operate at different levels of governance. This concept has been applied to various fields, including environmental governance and labor standards, and can help to illuminate the complex interactions between local, national, and global actors in supply chains. For instance, research by Ostrom (2010) demonstrates how polycentric governance systems can effectively address complex environmental challenges by leveraging the strengths of multiple governance levels. Similarly, studies by Abbott and Snidal (2009) and Bäckstrand (2008) explore how polycentric governance can enhance the effectiveness of global supply chain initiatives by incorporating local knowledge and practices. These insights highlight the potential of a polycentric approach to improve the governance of global supply chains and address the localized social and environmental outcomes that emerge at production sites. In conclusion, the governance of global supply chains is a complex issue that requires a multi-level approach to fully understand its social and environmental implications. While existing literature has provided valuable insights into the role of transnational firms in shaping supply chain governance, there is a need to consider the broader context in which supply chains operate. A multi-level approach that incorporates the concept of polycentricity can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers of variation in localized outcomes and identify potential trade-offs, synergies, and spillovers between social and environmental outcomes. Future research should continue to explore the multi-level dynamics of supply chain governance and develop innovative approaches to address the complex challenges it presents.", "References": [{"title": "The governance of global value chains", "authors": "Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, Timothy Sturgeon", "journal": "Review of International Political Economy", "year": "2005", "volumes": "12", "first page": "78", "last page": "104", "DOI": "10.1080/09692290500049805"}, {"title": "The Promise and Limits of Private Power: Promoting Labor Standards in a Global Economy", "authors": "Richard M.
