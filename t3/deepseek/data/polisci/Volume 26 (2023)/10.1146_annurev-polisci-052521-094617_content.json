{"Literature Review": "Political inequality in rich democracies has become a focal point of scholarly attention, particularly in the context of rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions. This literature review examines the dimensions of participation and representation, exploring how these factors contribute to political inequality. Research consistently shows that individuals with fewer resources participate less in political processes than their more affluent counterparts. This disparity is exacerbated by the declining influence of collective organizations, such as trade unions, which historically played a crucial role in mobilizing lower-income groups (Schlozman, Verba, & Brady, 2012). The weakening of these organizations has diminished their capacity to counteract the trends of unequal participation, leading to a political landscape that increasingly favors the affluent. In terms of representation, the congruence between the preferences of decision-makers and those of the better-off is striking. Studies have found that policy choices in rich democracies are more aligned with the interests of higher-status social groups, reflecting a significant bias in representative democracy (Gilens & Page, 2014). This bias is further compounded by the increasing social distance between rulers and the ruled, which undermines the principle of equal representation. The descriptive representation of lower-income groups in political institutions is also lacking, with their voices being significantly underrepresented in decision-making processes (Carnes & Lupu, 2016). This underrepresentation not only affects the substantive representation of their interests but also perpetuates the cycle of political inequality. The link between descriptive and substantive representation is crucial, as the presence of diverse voices in political institutions can lead to more inclusive policy outcomes (Mansbridge, 1999). However, the current trends in rich democracies suggest a widening gap between the representation of different social groups, with significant implications for the health of democratic governance. The role of income inequality in shaping political participation and representation cannot be overstated. As income disparities grow, the political influence of the wealthy increases, while the political efficacy of the less affluent diminishes (Bartels, 2008). This dynamic is further reinforced by the declining power of trade unions, which have traditionally served as a counterbalance to the political influence of the wealthy (Western & Rosenfeld, 2011). The erosion of union strength has left lower-income groups with fewer avenues for political mobilization, exacerbating the inequalities in political participation and representation. In conclusion, political inequality in rich democracies is a multifaceted issue that is deeply intertwined with economic and social factors. The disparities in participation and representation are not only a reflection of individual resource disparities but also of the broader structural changes in society. Addressing these inequalities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the interplay between economic policies, the strength of collective organizations, and the mechanisms of political representation. Only by tackling these underlying factors can the promise of equal political participation and representation be realized in rich democracies.", "References": [{"title": "The Unheavenly Chorus: Unequal Political Voice and the Broken Promise of American Democracy", "authors": "Kay Lehman Schlozman, Sidney Verba, Henry E.
