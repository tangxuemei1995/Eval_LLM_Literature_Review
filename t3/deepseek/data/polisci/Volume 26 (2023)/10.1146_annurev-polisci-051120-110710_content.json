{"Literature Review": "The South has long been a distinctive region within the United States, with its political development and cultural identity diverging significantly from the rest of the nation. Recent scholarship has reignited interest in understanding the South's unique role in American political development, challenging the traditional narrative that anticipated the region's convergence with the political patterns of the post–New Deal North. This literature review explores the evolving perspectives on southern distinctiveness, focusing on the enduring legacy of white supremacy, the region's influence on national politics, and the debates surrounding southern regimes. The traditional view of the South in political science was largely shaped by the expectation that the region would eventually align with the political and social norms of the North, particularly following the transformative impact of the New Deal. However, recent works have contested this narrative, emphasizing instead the South's persistent commitment to white supremacy and its profound influence on the shaping of national politics and institutions. This shift in perspective has led to a reevaluation of the South's role in American political development, with scholars identifying two broad pathways through which the region has exerted its influence. The first pathway involves the South's impact on national political institutions and policies. Scholars have argued that the South's political elite played a crucial role in shaping the New Deal coalition, leveraging their influence to ensure that federal policies accommodated the region's racial hierarchy. This strategic maneuvering allowed the South to maintain its distinct social order while benefiting from federal economic programs. The second pathway focuses on the South's cultural and ideological influence, particularly its role in perpetuating authoritarian and white supremacist ideologies. Recent studies have highlighted how the South's political culture, characterized by a commitment to states' rights and resistance to federal intervention, has shaped national debates on civil rights, voting rights, and social welfare policies. The debates over the sources of southern influence have also been a focal point of recent scholarship. Some scholars attribute the South's distinctiveness to its historical legacy of slavery and the Jim Crow system, which entrenched racial hierarchies and shaped the region's political institutions. Others emphasize the role of economic factors, such as the South's reliance on agriculture and its late industrialization, in shaping its political development. These differing perspectives have led to a rich and nuanced understanding of the South's role in American political development. Recent works on southern regimes have further complicated the picture, challenging the notion of a monolithic South and highlighting the diversity of political systems within the region. Scholars have examined the varying degrees of authoritarianism and white supremacy across different southern states, as well as the ways in which these regimes have evolved over time. These studies have provoked debates about the nature of southern politics and the factors that have contributed to its persistence and transformation. In conclusion, the renewed interest in southern distinctiveness has led to a significant reevaluation of the South's role in American political development. By challenging the traditional narrative of convergence and emphasizing the enduring influence of white supremacy and authoritarianism, recent scholarship has provided a more complex and nuanced understanding of the region's impact on national politics and institutions. However, overcoming the limits of these recent works will require further research and a critical examination of some of the more sweeping interpretive claims and foundational premises that have shaped our understanding of the South.", "References": [{"title": "The New Deal and the South", "authors": "Gavin Wright", "journal": "Journal of Economic History", "year": "1986", "volumes": "46", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022050700045601"}, {"title": "White Supremacy and the Politics of the New Deal", "authors": "Ira Katznelson", "journal": "Political Science Quarterly", "year": "2005", "volumes": "120", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1002/j.1538-165X.2005.tb00533.x"}, {"title": "The Southern Political Tradition", "authors": "V.O.
