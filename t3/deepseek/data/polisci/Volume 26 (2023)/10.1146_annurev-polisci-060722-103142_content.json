{"Literature Review": "The intersection of democracy, policing, and race in the United States presents a complex tableau that challenges traditional notions of citizenship and governance. The conversation facilitated by Hakeem Jefferson with Cathy J. Cohen, Yanilda M. González, Rebecca U. Thorpe, and Vesla M. Weaver delves into these intricacies, particularly in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. This literature review synthesizes key themes from their discussion, supported by academic research, to explore how policing and the criminal justice system influence democracy and racial dynamics in America.\n\nDemocracy in the United States is often narrowly conceptualized around electoral participation and voting rights. However, as Jefferson and colleagues argue, this perspective overlooks the broader implications of policing and criminal justice on democratic ideals. The panelists highlight how these institutions redefine citizenship, not through the ballot box, but through the exercise of power and control over marginalized communities. This redefinition is particularly evident in the context of racial authoritarianism, where policing practices disproportionately target Black and Brown individuals, effectively marginalizing them from full participation in democratic life.\n\nThe concept of multiracial democracy is central to understanding the challenges and opportunities for reforming American policing. Multiracial democracy envisions a society where all racial groups have equal access to political power and representation. Yet, as Cohen and Weaver discuss, the current state of policing in the United States often undermines this ideal by perpetuating racial inequalities and reinforcing systemic barriers to political engagement. Their insights are supported by research demonstrating how aggressive policing tactics, such as stop-and-frisk, have a chilling effect on political participation among targeted communities.\n\nRacial authoritarianism, as González and Thorpe elaborate, is a framework for understanding how policing and criminal justice systems operate as mechanisms of racial control. This form of governance uses the state's coercive powers to maintain racial hierarchies, often under the guise of public safety. The panelists' discussion aligns with studies showing that racial disparities in policing outcomes are not merely the result of individual biases but are embedded in the institutional structures of law enforcement.\n\nThe potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people is a critical theme of the conversation. Jefferson and his colleagues argue for a reimagining of policing that prioritizes community safety and well-being over punitive measures. This approach requires a fundamental shift in how political scientists and policymakers conceptualize the role of law enforcement in a democratic society. Research on community policing and restorative justice offers promising models for such reforms, emphasizing collaboration between law enforcement and communities to address the root causes of crime and violence.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversation facilitated by Jefferson and his colleagues provides a compelling critique of the traditional boundaries of democracy in the United States. By examining the intersections of race, policing, and criminal justice, they challenge us to consider how these institutions shape the lived experiences of marginalized communities and their access to democratic participation. The insights from this discussion, supported by academic research, underscore the urgent need for systemic reforms that align policing practices with the principles of multiracial democracy and racial justice.", "References": [{"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Policing the Black Man: Arrest, Prosecution, and Imprisonment", "authors": "Angela J.
