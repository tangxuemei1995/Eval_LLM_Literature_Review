{"Literature Review": "The study of power sharing within authoritarian regimes has garnered significant attention in political science, particularly in understanding how autocratic rulers maintain stability and manage potential threats from within. This literature review synthesizes existing research on authoritarian power sharing, focusing on its concepts, mechanisms, and strategies, as outlined in the provided abstract. The discussion is structured around the key themes of institutional concessions, the role of coercive capabilities, and the strategic conditions under which dictators share power. Institutional concessions are a critical mechanism for power sharing in authoritarian regimes. As noted by Svolik (2012), such concessions can take various forms, including delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers. These measures aim to reallocate power in a manner that makes it costly for the ruler to renege on power-sharing agreements. However, the effectiveness of these institutional mechanisms is contingent upon the strength of the institutions themselves. Weak institutions create a Catch-22 situation, where the very mechanisms designed to enforce power sharing are undermined by the lack of institutional robustness (Gandhi & Przeworski, 2007). This paradox highlights the challenges autocratic rulers face in establishing credible commitments to power sharing. The role of coercive capabilities in enforcing power-sharing agreements is another critical aspect of authoritarian politics. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing becomes possible if challengers possess the means to defend their spoils coercively. This dynamic is particularly evident in the context of civil wars and coups, where the balance of coercive power between the ruler and challengers can determine the stability of power-sharing arrangements (Fearon & Laitin, 2003). However, the possession of coercive capabilities by challengers presents a double-edged sword. While these capabilities can enforce power-sharing agreements, they also enable challengers to overthrow the ruler, thereby undermining the very stability these agreements aim to achieve (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). The strategic conditions under which dictators share power are shaped by the interplay of coercive capabilities and the willingness of both parties to adhere to power-sharing agreements. As highlighted by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), a strategic dictator will only share power under specific conditions: when challengers can credibly punish the ruler for reneging on agreements, when the challenger is willing to forgo taking harmful actions if power is shared, and when the ruler is willing to acquiesce to diminished power and rents. These conditions underscore the delicate balance autocratic rulers must strike in managing internal threats while maintaining their grip on power. The literature also emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader political context in which power sharing occurs. For instance, the role of external actors and international pressures can influence the dynamics of power sharing within authoritarian regimes (Levitsky & Way, 2010). Additionally, the historical and cultural context of a regime can shape the strategies and mechanisms of power sharing, as seen in the varied experiences of authoritarian regimes across different regions (Slater, 2010). In conclusion, the study of authoritarian power sharing reveals the complex interplay of institutional mechanisms, coercive capabilities, and strategic considerations that shape the stability and dynamics of autocratic rule. While institutional concessions and coercive enforcement mechanisms offer potential pathways for power sharing, the inherent challenges of weak institutions and the double-edged nature of coercive capabilities highlight the precarious nature of these arrangements. Future research could further explore the role of external actors and the impact of historical and cultural contexts on power-sharing strategies in authoritarian regimes.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Authoritarian Rule", "authors": "Milan W.
