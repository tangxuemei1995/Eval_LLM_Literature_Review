{"Literature Review": "The politics of global health governance has evolved significantly over the past centuries, shaped by the interplay of imperialism, colonialism, and the emergence of international health organizations. The initial era of global health governance was deeply intertwined with the imperial ambitions of European powers, where health interventions were often tools for colonial expansion and control. This period laid the groundwork for the state-centered approach to global health, emphasizing the control of infectious diseases to protect economic interests and maintain colonial order (Packard, 2016).\n\nThe post-colonial era saw the establishment of international health organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), which aimed to address global health issues through collective action. However, the Cold War period introduced new complexities, as global health became a battleground for ideological influence, with both the United States and the Soviet Union using health aid as a tool for political leverage (Cueto, 2007).\n\nThe late 20th century marked a shift towards a more cosmopolitan vision of global health, emphasizing the importance of health system strengthening and the social determinants of health. This period also saw the rise of new actors in global health governance, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private foundations, which played a significant role in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other global health challenges (Brown, Cueto, & Fee, 2006).\n\nThe mid-2000s are often referred to as the 'Golden Age' of global health, characterized by an unprecedented influx of funding and political attention to global health issues. This era was marked by significant achievements in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, as well as the establishment of new global health initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Garrett, 2007). However, this period also highlighted the tensions between the state-centered approach and the cosmopolitan vision of global health, as the focus on specific diseases often came at the expense of broader health system strengthening (Shiffman, 2008).\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has reinforced the centrality of states in global health governance, as countries around the world implemented travel restrictions and other measures to control the spread of the virus. The pandemic has also exposed the limitations of the current global health governance system, particularly in terms of coordination and equity in the distribution of vaccines and other resources (Gostin & Friedman, 2020).\n\nDespite these challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of international cooperation and the role of international health organizations such as the WHO in addressing global health crises. The pandemic has underscored the need for a more integrated approach to global health governance, one that balances the state-centered approach with the cosmopolitan vision of global health (Kickbusch, 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the politics of global health governance has evolved through various eras, each shaped by the prevailing political and economic context. While significant progress has been made in addressing global health challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a more equitable and coordinated approach to global health governance. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic and other global health challenges, it is essential to learn from the lessons of the past and work towards a more inclusive and effective global health governance system (Fidler, 2020).", "References": [{"title": "A History of Global Health: Interventions into the Lives of Other Peoples", "authors": "Randall M.
