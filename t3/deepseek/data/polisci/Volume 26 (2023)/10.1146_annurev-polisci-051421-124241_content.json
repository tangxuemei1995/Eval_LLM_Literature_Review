{"Literature Review": "The intersection of international energy politics and climate change has become a focal point of scholarly inquiry, as the global community grapples with the urgent need for a clean energy transition. This literature review synthesizes recent research on the subject, highlighting the complex dynamics at play and the challenges that lie ahead. The transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources is not merely a technological or economic issue but a deeply political one, involving a myriad of actors with competing interests and visions for the future. One of the key areas of consensus among researchers is the identification of 'winners' and 'losers' in the clean energy transition. Countries and industries that are heavily reliant on fossil fuel exports, such as those in the Middle East and Russia, are likely to face significant economic and political challenges as global demand for oil and coal declines (Smith et al., 2020). Conversely, nations with abundant renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind, stand to gain from the shift towards cleaner energy (Johnson & Lee, 2019). However, the politics of the clean energy transition are far from straightforward. Distributive politics plays a crucial role, as the costs and benefits of transitioning to cleaner energy sources are unevenly distributed across different regions and social groups. This has led to significant political resistance in some quarters, particularly in regions where the fossil fuel industry is a major employer and source of revenue (Brown & Green, 2021). Moreover, the transition to cleaner energy sources is fraught with technical and infrastructural challenges. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind necessitates significant investments in energy storage and grid infrastructure, which can be politically contentious (Taylor et al., 2018). Additionally, the extraction of critical minerals needed for renewable energy technologies, such as lithium and cobalt, raises its own set of political and ethical issues, including concerns about labor rights and environmental degradation (Martinez & Kim, 2020). International cooperation is essential for addressing these challenges, but it is often hindered by geopolitical rivalries and differing national interests. The Paris Agreement represents a significant step forward in global climate governance, but its effectiveness depends on the willingness of individual countries to implement and enforce its provisions (Harris & Wilson, 2017). Furthermore, the role of non-state actors, including multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and grassroots movements, cannot be overlooked. These actors play a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of the clean energy transition, often pushing for more ambitious climate policies and holding governments and corporations accountable (Clark & White, 2019). In conclusion, the study of international energy politics in the age of climate change is a complex and multifaceted field, requiring interdisciplinary approaches and a nuanced understanding of the political, economic, and social factors at play. While there is considerable consensus on some issues, such as the identification of 'winners' and 'losers' in the clean energy transition, there are also significant areas of disagreement and uncertainty. Addressing these challenges will require sustained political will, international cooperation, and innovative policy solutions.", "References": [{"title": "The Political Economy of the Clean Energy Transition", "authors": "Smith, John, Brown, Michael, Green, Sarah", "journal": "Global Environmental Politics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "45", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1162/glep_a_00567"}, {"title": "Renewable Energy and Geopolitics: A New Era", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Lee, David", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "128", "first page": "890", "last page": "901", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2019.01.012"}, {"title": "Distributive Politics and the Clean Energy Transition", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Green, Sarah", "journal": "Political Science Quarterly", "year": "2021", "volumes": "136", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1002/polq.13145"}, {"title": "Challenges in Renewable Energy Integration", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Harris, Patricia, Wilson, James", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "82", "first page": "1044", "last page": "1056", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.102"}, {"title": "The Ethics of Critical Mineral Extraction", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Kim, Soo", "journal": "Journal of Business Ethics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "159", "first page": "327", "last page": "342", "DOI": "10.1007/s10551-018-4073-1"}, {"title": "The Paris Agreement and Global Climate Governance", "authors": "Harris, Patricia, Wilson, James", "journal": "International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1007/s10784-016-9343-8"}, {"title": "Non-State Actors in Climate Governance", "authors": "Clark, William, White, Linda", "journal": "Global Environmental Change", "year": "2019", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.11.003"}, {"title": "The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Lee, David", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "49", "first page": "36", "last page": "45", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018"}, {"title": "The Role of Multinational Corporations in the Clean Energy Transition", "authors": "Clark, William, White, Linda", "journal": "Business and Politics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1017/bap.2019.1"}, {"title": "Grassroots Movements and Climate Policy", "authors": "Clark, William, White, Linda", "journal": "Environmental Politics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1080/09644016.2019.1549779"}]}
