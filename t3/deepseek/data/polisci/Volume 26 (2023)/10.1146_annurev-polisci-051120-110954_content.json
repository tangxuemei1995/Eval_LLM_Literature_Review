{"Literature Review": "The study of gender and sexuality within the realm of international relations (IR) has evolved significantly over the past three decades, reflecting broader societal shifts towards recognizing and addressing gender inequities. This literature review explores four key areas of research within this field: gender and political economy, gender and security, queer approaches, and feminist foreign policy, as highlighted in the provided abstract. Each area is examined through recent scholarly contributions, illustrating the depth and breadth of current research.\\n\\n**Gender and Political Economy**\\nThe intersection of gender and political economy has been a fertile ground for feminist IR scholars. Recent work by True (2012) has emphasized the gendered impacts of global economic policies, arguing that neoliberal economic reforms disproportionately affect women, particularly in the Global South. This perspective is supported by findings from Rai and Waylen (2014), who explore how gender shapes economic governance and the distribution of resources. Their research underscores the necessity of integrating gender analysis into economic policy-making to achieve more equitable outcomes.\\n\\n**Gender and Security**\\nGender and security studies have increasingly focused on the roles and experiences of women in conflict and post-conflict settings. Hudson et al. (2012) have contributed significantly to this area by developing the 'Women and Peace Hypothesis,' which posits that the security of women is a crucial indicator of the peacefulness of a state. This hypothesis has been further explored by Sjoberg (2013), who examines the gendered dimensions of warfare and the implications for international security policy. These studies highlight the importance of gender-sensitive approaches to security and conflict resolution.\\n\\n**Queer Approaches**\\nQueer approaches to IR challenge traditional notions of gender and sexuality, offering new perspectives on global politics. Weber (2016) has been at the forefront of this field, critiquing the heteronormative assumptions underlying much of IR theory and practice. This critique is expanded upon by Richter-Montpetit (2014), who explores the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality in the context of U.S. military interventions. Together, these works advocate for a more inclusive and diverse understanding of international relations.\\n\\n**Feminist Foreign Policy**\\nThe concept of feminist foreign policy has gained traction in recent years, with countries like Sweden and Canada adopting policies that prioritize gender equality and women's rights in their international relations. Aggestam and Bergman-Rosamond (2016) analyze the implications of such policies, arguing that they represent a significant shift towards more ethical and inclusive global governance. This perspective is complemented by Enloe (2014), who examines the role of feminist activism in shaping foreign policy agendas. These studies suggest that feminist foreign policy has the potential to transform international relations by centering gender equality as a key objective.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the study of gender and sexuality in international relations is a dynamic and evolving field, with significant contributions across various subfields. The research discussed in this review demonstrates the importance of integrating gender analysis into IR scholarship and policy-making, offering insights into how gender shapes and is shaped by global political and economic processes. As the field continues to grow, it will be crucial to build on these foundations, addressing emerging challenges and opportunities in the pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive international order.", "References": [{"title": "The Political Economy of Violence Against Women", "authors": "Jacqui True", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755929.001.0001"}, {"title": "New Frontiers in Feminist Political Economy", "authors": "Shirin Rai, Georgina Waylen", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2014", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203078544"}, {"title": "Sex and World Peace", "authors": "Valerie M.
