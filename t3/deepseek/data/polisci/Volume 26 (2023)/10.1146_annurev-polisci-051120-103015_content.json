{"Literature Review": "The intersection of politics and public health has long been a subject of interest, yet the specific contributions of political science to understanding the political economy of health remain underexplored. This literature review aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing recent findings on the policy, political, and structural factors influencing population health and health equity, and by outlining the potential for a more deeply rooted political science approach to the political economy of health. The political economy of health examines how political and economic systems and policies influence health outcomes and health equity. It extends beyond the provision of medical care to include the broader social determinants of health, such as income inequality, education, housing, and employment conditions. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of political decisions and power dynamics in shaping these determinants. For instance, research by Navarro and Shi (2001) demonstrates how political ideologies and the strength of labor movements significantly impact health outcomes across different countries. Similarly, Bambra et al. (2005) have shown that welfare state regimes, characterized by their levels of decommodification and stratification, are closely associated with variations in population health. The global rise of emerging infectious diseases and pandemics has further underscored the importance of political economy in public health. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has revealed how pre-existing inequalities and political decisions can exacerbate health disparities. A study by Elgar et al. (2020) found that countries with higher levels of income inequality experienced more severe COVID-19 outbreaks, highlighting the role of economic policies in pandemic response. Moreover, the pandemic has brought attention to the global governance of health and the need for international cooperation. Kickbusch and Reddy (2015) argue that global health governance is inherently political, involving negotiations of power and interests among states, international organizations, and non-state actors. The social determinants of health framework provides a useful lens for understanding the pathways through which political and economic systems affect health. Marmot et al. (2008) emphasize that health inequities are the result of the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services, and call for action on the social determinants of health to achieve health equity. Political science can contribute to this framework by analyzing the mechanisms through which power configurations influence health outcomes. For example, studies by Beckfield and Krieger (2009) explore how political institutions and policies shape the social determinants of health, including through taxation, social welfare, and labor market regulations. Furthermore, the role of political participation and democracy in health outcomes has been a growing area of research. Franco et al. (2004) found that democratic governance is associated with better health outcomes, suggesting that political systems that promote participation and accountability can lead to more equitable health policies. In conclusion, the political economy of health offers a critical perspective on the interplay between politics, economics, and health. By integrating insights from political science, researchers can better understand the pathways and mechanisms through which power configurations cause illness and inequity. This literature review calls for more political scientists to engage with the political economy of health, leveraging their unique expertise to advance our understanding of the drivers of health in an era of global challenges.", "References": [{"title": "The political context of social inequalities and health", "authors": "Vicente Navarro, Leiyu Shi", "journal": "Social Science & Medicine", "year": "2001", "volumes": "52", "first page": "481", "last page": "491", "DOI": "10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00197-0"}, {"title": "Welfare state regimes and population health: Integrating East Asian welfare states into the debate", "authors": "Clare Bambra, Terje Eikemo", "journal": "Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health", "year": "2005", "volumes": "59", "first page": "889", "last page": "894", "DOI": "10.1136/jech.2005.038646"}, {"title": "Income inequality and COVID-19: We are in this together", "authors": "Frank J.
