{"Literature Review": "Bureaucratic politics has emerged as a critical area of study within political science, reflecting the central role that unelected bureaucrats play in the nexus between government policy and its implementation. This literature review explores the theoretical and empirical blind spots in the study of bureaucracy, as well as the opportunities for innovation, by examining three key research areas: the selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel, oversight of bureaucratic activities, and opportunities for external influence on bureaucracy. The review draws on a diverse body of literature to highlight the divides between American and comparative politics traditions and suggests pathways for cross-pollination between these subfields. The selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel have been extensively studied within the American politics tradition, with a focus on the appointment processes at the national level. Research by Lewis (2008) and Gallo and Lewis (2012) has illuminated the strategic considerations presidents face in appointing bureaucrats, emphasizing the trade-offs between loyalty and competence. Comparatively, studies by Dahlström and Lapuente (2017) have explored how meritocratic recruitment practices in local bureaucracies can enhance government effectiveness and reduce corruption, offering valuable insights for American scholars. Oversight of bureaucratic activities represents another area where the American and comparative politics traditions diverge. American politics scholars, such as McCubbins and Schwartz (1984), have developed the 'fire alarm' and 'police patrol' models of oversight, focusing on the mechanisms through which Congress monitors federal agencies. In contrast, comparative scholars like Grzymala-Busse (2007) have examined the role of political parties and civil society in overseeing local bureaucracies, highlighting the importance of societal accountability mechanisms. Opportunities for external influence on bureaucracy, including lobbying and procurement, have also been approached differently across subfields. American politics research, exemplified by work from Carpenter (2001), has detailed how interest groups and lobbyists navigate the federal bureaucracy to influence policy outcomes. Meanwhile, comparative studies, such as those by Johnston (2005), have explored how external actors can shape bureaucratic behavior in different institutional contexts, offering a broader perspective on the dynamics of influence. This literature review underscores the potential for American and comparative politics scholars to learn from each other's approaches to studying bureaucracy. By bridging the divides between these traditions, political science can develop a more comprehensive understanding of bureaucratic politics, addressing blind spots and seizing opportunities for theoretical and empirical innovation.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Presidential Appointments: Political Control and Bureaucratic Performance", "authors": "David E.
