{"Literature Review": "The discourse on women and power in the developing world has evolved significantly, challenging the traditional narrative that women's empowerment is predominantly a phenomenon of the Global North. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to explore the multifaceted ways in which women negotiate power in the Global South, focusing on macro, meso, and micro levels of analysis. At the macro level, the subordination of women has been historically central to the establishment of liberal democratic states. However, emerging research suggests that the developing world is at the forefront of creating effective alternatives to patriarchal political orders. For instance, the implementation of electoral quotas in countries like Rwanda and Argentina has significantly increased women's political representation, challenging the notion that gender equality in politics is a Western-centric achievement (Htun & Weldon, 2018). At the meso level, developing-world states exhibit a unique propensity to recognize and co-opt women's power within policy-making processes. Studies have shown that in countries such as India and South Africa, women's movements have successfully influenced policy reforms in areas ranging from land rights to domestic violence, illustrating the dynamic interplay between gender and governance (Goetz & Hassim, 2003). Finally, at the micro level, intrafamily negotiations of patriarchal power are particularly dynamic in the developing world. Research in countries like Bangladesh and Nigeria highlights how women navigate and challenge traditional gender roles within the household, offering insights into the broader systems of power that shape societal norms and state policies (Kabeer, 2005; Adepoju & Mbugua, 1997). These findings collectively underscore the importance of re-evaluating established concepts of political and economic development through the lens of gender. The developing world not only challenges the hegemony of Western models of women's empowerment but also provides innovative approaches to achieving gender equality. As such, future research should continue to explore the unique contributions of the Global South to our understanding of women and power, with a particular emphasis on the intersections of gender, politics, and development.", "References": [{"title": "The Logics of Gender Justice: State Action on Women's Rights Around the World", "authors": "Mala Htun, S.
