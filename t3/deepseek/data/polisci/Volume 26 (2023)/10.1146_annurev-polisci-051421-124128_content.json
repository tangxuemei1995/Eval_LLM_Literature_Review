{"Literature Review": "The study of nonviolent resistance has gained significant traction in the past two decades, with scholars exploring its efficacy, strategies, and outcomes in various socio-political contexts. Nonviolent resistance, characterized by the mobilization of unarmed individuals through collective protests, strikes, and boycotts, has been lauded for its ability to effect change without resorting to physical violence. However, the presence of violence within predominantly nonviolent movements—termed 'violent flanks'—has sparked a nuanced debate on its impact on movement outcomes. This literature review delves into the existing body of work to understand the effects of violent flanks on nonviolent resistance movements, focusing on the relationships between nonviolent and unarmed resistance, violence, and the outcomes of mass mobilization. The empirical evidence suggests a complex interplay between nonviolent resistance and violence, with organized armed violence generally undermining the success of nonviolent movements, while the effects of unarmed collective violence remain more ambiguous. The review also highlights the need for greater analytical precision in studying violent flanks, particularly in terms of units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing. The literature on nonviolent resistance underscores its strategic advantages, including higher rates of success compared to violent resistance, greater legitimacy, and the ability to attract broader participation. Studies have shown that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to achieve their objectives, partly because they are perceived as more legitimate by both domestic and international audiences. This legitimacy can translate into increased support, both moral and material, for the movement. Moreover, nonviolent resistance tends to be more inclusive, enabling participation from a wider demographic, including women, the elderly, and those who are physically unable to engage in violent conflict. However, the introduction of violence into nonviolent movements, whether through organized armed groups or spontaneous unarmed collective violence, complicates this narrative. Organized armed violence within nonviolent movements has been found to reduce the likelihood of success. This is attributed to several factors, including the erosion of the movement's legitimacy, the justification it provides for state repression, and the potential for internal divisions within the movement. The presence of armed groups can shift the focus from the movement's original goals to the dynamics of armed conflict, thereby alienating potential supporters and undermining the movement's moral high ground. On the other hand, the effects of unarmed collective violence, such as riots or spontaneous acts of aggression, are less clear-cut. Some studies suggest that such violence can serve as a form of 'radical flank effect,' where the presence of more extreme elements within a movement can make the nonviolent factions appear more moderate and reasonable, thereby increasing their appeal. However, other research indicates that unarmed collective violence can also lead to negative outcomes, including increased repression, public backlash, and the delegitimization of the movement. The directionality of the relationship between nonviolent resistance and violence is another area of interest. While some argue that violence emerges as a response to the failure of nonviolent tactics, others contend that violence can be a strategic choice, employed to escalate the conflict and attract attention to the movement's cause. The media's role in framing violent flanks is also crucial, as it can influence public perception and the movement's trajectory. Media coverage that emphasizes the violent aspects of a movement can overshadow its nonviolent components, leading to a skewed understanding of the movement's nature and objectives. In conclusion, the literature on nonviolent resistance and violent flanks presents a complex picture, with organized armed violence generally detrimental to movement success, while the effects of unarmed collective violence remain ambiguous. The field would benefit from more nuanced analyses that consider the specific contexts, strategies, and media representations of violent flanks. Such research could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of nonviolent resistance and inform strategies for maximizing its effectiveness in achieving social and political change.", "References": [{"title": "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", "authors": "Erica Chenoweth, Maria J.
