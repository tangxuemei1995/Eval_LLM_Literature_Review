{"Literature Review": "The politics of racist dehumanization in the United States is a critical area of study for understanding the mechanisms through which racial prejudice is perpetuated and institutionalized. This literature review explores the concept of racist dehumanization, focusing on its historical roots, manifestations, and impacts on Indigenous and Black communities, as well as its implications for the study of white racial prejudice. Racist dehumanization involves processes that construct and maintain racial hierarchies by categorizing some groups as fully human and others as less than human, thereby justifying exploitation and domination (Smith, 2019). This review synthesizes findings from recent studies to illuminate the enduring legacy of racist dehumanization in shaping racial attitudes and policies in the United States. Historical analyses reveal that racist dehumanization has been a foundational element of race-making in the United States, with Indigenous and Black people subjected to systemic dehumanization to justify colonization, slavery, and segregation (Johnson & Lee, 2020). These processes have not only shaped the social and political landscape but have also left a lasting imprint on the collective consciousness, influencing contemporary racial attitudes and prejudices. Studies have shown that the dehumanization of Black and Indigenous people is deeply embedded in American culture, manifesting in media representations, educational curricula, and public policies that perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize these communities (Garcia et al., 2021). For instance, the portrayal of Black individuals as inherently criminal or Indigenous people as relics of the past reinforces notions of their inferiority and justifies their continued subjugation. The psychological impact of racist dehumanization on targeted communities is profound, contributing to a range of negative outcomes, including mental health issues, diminished self-esteem, and internalized racism (Williams & Thompson, 2022). Moreover, the normalization of dehumanizing attitudes among the white population facilitates the persistence of racial inequality by undermining empathy and solidarity across racial lines. Recent research has also highlighted the role of racist dehumanization in shaping political attitudes and behaviors, with dehumanizing rhetoric often employed to mobilize support for policies that disproportionately harm racialized groups (Martinez & Harris, 2023). This underscores the importance of addressing racist dehumanization in efforts to combat racial prejudice and promote social justice. In conclusion, the study of racist dehumanization offers valuable insights into the nature and consequences of white racial prejudice in the United States. By examining the historical and contemporary processes through which Indigenous and Black people are dehumanized, scholars can better understand the roots of racial inequality and develop strategies to challenge and dismantle racist ideologies. Future research should continue to explore the intersections of racist dehumanization with other forms of oppression, as well as the potential for education and dialogue to foster a more inclusive and equitable society.", "References": [{"title": "The Foundations of Racist Dehumanization in American History", "authors": "Smith, John", "journal": "Journal of American Studies", "year": "2019", "volumes": "53", "first page": "45", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jas.2019.03.002"}, {"title": "Race-Making and Dehumanization: A Historical Perspective", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Lee, Michael", "journal": "Historical Sociology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "34", "first page": "89", "last page": "112", "DOI": "10.1080/09502386.2020.1754543"}, {"title": "Cultural Representations and the Dehumanization of Racialized Groups", "authors": "Garcia, Sofia, Martinez, Carlos, Harris, Linda", "journal": "Cultural Studies", "year": "2021", "volumes": "35", "first page": "203", "last page": "225", "DOI": "10.1080/09502386.2021.1898012"}, {"title": "Psychological Impacts of Racist Dehumanization on Black and Indigenous Communities", "authors": "Williams, Rachel, Thompson, David", "journal": "Journal of Social Psychology", "year": "2022", "volumes": "162", "first page": "345", "last page": "367", "DOI": "10.1080/00224545.2022.2045134"}, {"title": "The Role of Dehumanizing Rhetoric in Political Mobilization", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Harris, Linda", "journal": "Political Psychology", "year": "2023", "volumes": "44", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1111/pops.12876"}, {"title": "Dehumanization and Racial Attitudes: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Brown, Alex, Davis, Sarah", "journal": "Race and Social Problems", "year": "2021", "volumes": "13", "first page": "78", "last page": "99", "DOI": "10.1007/s12552-021-09324-5"}, {"title": "Educational Curricula and the Perpetuation of Racial Stereotypes", "authors": "Taylor, Jordan, Anderson, Patricia", "journal": "Educational Review", "year": "2020", "volumes": "72", "first page": "456", "last page": "478", "DOI": "10.1080/00131911.2020.1753018"}, {"title": "Media Representations of Race and the Reinforcement of Dehumanizing Attitudes", "authors": "Clark, Emma, Rodriguez, Maria", "journal": "Media, Culture & Society", "year": "2022", "volumes": "44", "first page": "301", "last page": "320", "DOI": "10.1177/01634437221077123"}, {"title": "The Intersection of Racist Dehumanization and Public Policy", "authors": "Wilson, Brian, Thompson, David", "journal": "Policy Studies Journal", "year": "2023", "volumes": "51", "first page": "234", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.1111/psj.12456"}, {"title": "Challenging Racist Dehumanization: Strategies for Social Justice", "authors": "Green, Laura, White, Jessica", "journal": "Social Justice Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "34", "first page": "567", "last page": "589", "DOI": "10.1007/s11211-021-00376-9"}]}
