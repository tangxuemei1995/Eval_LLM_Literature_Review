{"Literature Review": "The concept of agenda democracy bridges the gap between the study of agenda setting and democratic theory, offering a comprehensive framework to understand the dynamics of political contests, institutional transformations, and the mechanisms of inequality within democratic regimes. This literature review synthesizes key insights from political theory and empirical studies to underscore the importance of reintegrating agenda setting into the broader discourse on democracy and democratization. Drawing on foundational works by Schattschneider and Dahl, as well as recent advancements in political theory, we explore the multifaceted nature of agendas beyond mere policy choices, the role of institutions in shaping democratic agendas, and the critical intersections between institutions and societal movements that drive significant political change. The concept of agenda democracy not only enriches our understanding of democratic processes but also highlights the strategic role of conservative organizations, the potential of petition and grievance mechanisms, and the transformative power of advocacy campaigns in expanding the 'shortlist of the possible.' Through this lens, we examine the democratizing potential of agenda restrictions and the complex dynamics of social movements, advocating for a nuanced approach to decomposing the term 'movement' to better capture its diverse manifestations and impacts on democratic agendas.", "References": [{"title": "The Semisovereign People: A Realist's View of Democracy in America", "authors": "E.E.
