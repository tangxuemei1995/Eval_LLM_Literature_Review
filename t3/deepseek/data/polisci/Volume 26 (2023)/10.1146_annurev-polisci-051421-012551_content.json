{"Literature Review": "The study of how local environments, or contexts, influence political behavior has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly through the lens of interpersonal contact with social out-groups. This literature review synthesizes findings from a range of studies that explore the intersection of context, contact theory, and political behavior, with a focus on the mechanisms through which these factors interact to shape political outcomes. Drawing on a typology of forms of context and contact, we aim to aggregate findings across disparate cases and highlight the broader mechanisms at play beyond those typically explored in psychologically oriented research. The review also proposes future directions for research, emphasizing the importance of examining the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact and the role of built or computer-based environments in mediating or mirroring the effects of demographic contexts. Contact theory, originally developed by Allport (1954), posits that under certain conditions, interpersonal contact can reduce prejudice between majority and minority group members. Recent studies have expanded on this theory by examining how different forms of contact, such as casual versus intimate interactions, can have varying effects on political attitudes and behaviors (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Moreover, the role of the local environment in facilitating or hindering such contact has been a focal point of research. For instance, studies have shown that neighborhoods with higher levels of ethnic diversity tend to foster more frequent intergroup contact, which can lead to reduced prejudice and more positive intergroup attitudes (Laurence, 2011). However, the relationship between diversity and contact is not always straightforward. Some research suggests that in highly segregated or unequal contexts, increased diversity can lead to heightened intergroup tensions and reduced social cohesion (Putnam, 2007). This highlights the importance of considering the broader socio-economic and political context in which contact occurs. In addition to demographic factors, the built environment has also been identified as a key mediator of intergroup contact and its political effects. For example, urban design features such as public spaces, transportation networks, and housing arrangements can either facilitate or impede opportunities for intergroup interaction (Musterd & Ostendorf, 2013). Similarly, the rise of digital and computer-based environments has opened new avenues for intergroup contact, with studies exploring how online interactions can mirror or differ from face-to-face encounters in their political effects (Wojcieszak & Mutz, 2009). Another important area of research is the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact. While much of the literature on contact theory has focused on ethnic or racial divisions, there is growing recognition of the role that class and economic inequality play in shaping intergroup dynamics. For instance, studies have shown that in contexts of high economic inequality, class-based identities can become more salient, potentially overshadowing ethnic divisions and altering the nature of intergroup contact (Gest, 2016). This suggests that future research should pay greater attention to the interplay between ethnic and class-based contact and its implications for political behavior. Finally, the review highlights the need for more research on the political effects of intergroup contact in lower- and middle-income countries. While much of the existing literature has focused on high-income, Western contexts, there is a growing body of work that examines these dynamics in more diverse settings. For example, studies in sub-Saharan Africa have explored how ethnic diversity and intergroup contact shape political mobilization and voting behavior (Posner, 2004). Similarly, research in Latin America has examined the role of class and ethnic divisions in shaping political attitudes and behaviors (Zucco, 2013). These studies underscore the importance of considering the unique historical, cultural, and institutional contexts in which intergroup contact occurs. In conclusion, the literature on context and contact offers valuable insights into the mechanisms through which local environments shape political behavior. By developing a typology of forms of context and contact, this review aims to facilitate the aggregation of findings across disparate cases and highlight the broader mechanisms at play. Future research should continue to explore the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact, the role of built and computer-based environments, and the political effects of intergroup contact in diverse global contexts.", "References": [{"title": "The Nature of Prejudice", "authors": "Gordon W.
