{"Literature Review": "The exploration of relativistic heavy-ion collisions has significantly advanced our understanding of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP), a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have been instrumental in this endeavor, providing a platform for studying the properties of QGP through high-energy collisions. Jet quenching, a phenomenon where jets lose energy as they traverse the QGP, has emerged as a powerful probe for investigating the transport properties of this exotic medium (Wang & Gyulassy, 1991). This process not only offers insights into the energy loss mechanisms of jets but also sheds light on the medium's response to such energy deposition.\n\nRecent theoretical and phenomenological studies have focused on understanding the medium's response to jet energy loss, emphasizing the importance of jet-induced medium excitation. This aspect of jet–QGP interaction is crucial for comprehending the soft components of jets and their modification in the medium. Both weakly and strongly coupled approaches have been employed to describe the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets, highlighting the complex dynamics involved in these processes (Majumder & Van Leeuwen, 2011).\n\nThe effects of medium response on jet observables have been extensively studied, revealing that jet-induced medium excitation plays a significant role in modifying jet properties. For instance, the redistribution of lost energy within the medium can lead to the enhancement of soft particles at large angles relative to the jet axis, a phenomenon that has been observed in both experimental data and theoretical simulations (Qin & Muller, 2014). This redistribution is a direct consequence of the medium's attempt to thermalize the energy deposited by the jet, leading to the excitation of collective modes within the QGP.\n\nJet–hadron correlations have been identified as a unique signature of medium response, providing a window into the in-medium dynamics of jets. These correlations offer a way to disentangle the contributions of jet quenching and medium excitation to the observed jet modifications. By analyzing the angular and momentum distributions of hadrons associated with jets, researchers can infer the mechanisms of energy loss and the properties of the QGP (Renk, 2013).\n\nThe exploration of jet-induced medium excitation has also led to the development of new theoretical frameworks for describing jet propagation in the QGP. These include hydrodynamic models that incorporate the effects of medium response on jet evolution, as well as perturbative QCD calculations that account for the interaction between jets and the medium (Casalderrey-Solana et al., 2014). Such advancements have improved our ability to predict jet observables and interpret experimental results, bringing us closer to a precise extraction of QGP properties.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of medium response and jet–hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions has provided valuable insights into the properties of the QGP. Jet quenching and jet-induced medium excitation are essential components of this research, offering a comprehensive picture of jet–QGP interactions. As theoretical models continue to evolve and experimental data become more precise, our understanding of the QGP and its implications for the early universe will undoubtedly deepen (Schenke et al., 2012).", "References": [{"title": "Gluon shadowing and jet quenching in A + A collisions at s**(1/2) = 200-GeV", "authors": "Wang, Xin-Nian, Gyulassy, Miklos", "journal": "Phys.
