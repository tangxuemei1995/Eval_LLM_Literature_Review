{"Literature Review": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a central issue in particle physics, questions why the Higgs boson mass is so much lighter than the Planck scale, suggesting new physics at the TeV scale. Traditional solutions, such as supersymmetry and technicolor, propose new particles at this scale to naturally explain the Higgs mass. However, the absence of such particles in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has challenged these theories, prompting the exploration of alternative solutions that do not rely on new TeV-scale particles. This literature review focuses on three innovative approaches: the relaxation mechanism, the historical approach, and conditional probability solutions. The relaxation mechanism introduces a dynamical process that adjusts the Higgs mass to a small value at the minimum of its potential. This approach, inspired by the cosmological relaxation of the electroweak scale, suggests that the Higgs mass could be a result of a dynamical field evolving to its minimum, thus naturally explaining its smallness without introducing new particles at the TeV scale (Graham et al., 2015). The historical approach considers the cosmological history of the universe, particularly the periods of inflation and reheating, as a factor influencing the Higgs mass. It posits that specific conditions during these epochs could lead to a smaller Higgs mass than expected, offering a cosmological solution to the hierarchy problem (Hertzberg et al., 2016). Conditional probability solutions, on the other hand, leverage the anthropic principle by conditioning on the smallness of the cosmological constant. This approach suggests that in a multiverse scenario, the selection of vacua with a small cosmological constant naturally leads to a small Higgs mass, thereby addressing the hierarchy problem without the need for new physics at the TeV scale (Agrawal et al., 2018). These novel approaches provide compelling alternatives to traditional solutions, offering new insights into the gauge hierarchy problem without relying on the existence of new particles at the TeV scale. They represent a shift in the theoretical framework, emphasizing the importance of cosmological considerations and the multiverse in understanding fundamental physics questions.", "References": [{"title": "Cosmological Relaxation of the Electroweak Scale", "authors": "Peter W.
