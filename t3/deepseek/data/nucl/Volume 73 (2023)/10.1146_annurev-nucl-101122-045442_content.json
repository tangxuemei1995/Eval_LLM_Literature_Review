{"Literature Review": "The exploration of lepton flavor universality (LFU) and lepton flavor violation (LFV) in b and c decays has become a focal point in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Recent experimental results have hinted at deviations from LFU, suggesting the presence of new physics. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and experimental advancements in this field, emphasizing the interplay between LFU and LFV and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics assumes LFU, implying that the interactions of leptons are independent of their flavor. However, anomalies in b and c decays, particularly those observed by the LHCb experiment, challenge this assumption. These anomalies include discrepancies in the ratios of branching fractions of B meson decays to different lepton flavors, such as R(K) and R(K*), which deviate from SM predictions. Theoretical frameworks extending the SM, such as those incorporating new gauge bosons or leptoquarks, have been proposed to explain these anomalies. These models often predict correlated effects in LFV processes, making the search for LFV a complementary strategy to test BSM physics. Experimental efforts to detect LFV in b and c decays have intensified, with significant progress reported by collaborations like LHCb, Belle, and BaBar. These experiments have set stringent limits on LFV processes, such as B meson decays to final states with different lepton flavors. The interplay between LFU and LFV is a central theme in current research. Theoretical arguments suggest that the size of LFU violations observed in b and c decays could imply observable LFV signals. This connection is explored in various models, including those with extended Higgs sectors or additional Z' bosons. The potential for discovering LFV in upcoming experiments, such as the upgraded LHCb and Belle II, is significant. These experiments will provide increased sensitivity to rare decays and allow for more precise tests of LFU and LFV. The implications of discovering LFV would be profound, offering direct evidence of BSM physics and potentially shedding light on the nature of neutrino masses and mixing. In conclusion, the study of LFU and LFV in b and c decays represents a promising avenue for uncovering new physics. The combination of theoretical insights and experimental advancements has positioned this field at the forefront of particle physics research. With the ongoing and future experiments, there is a concrete possibility of making unexpected discoveries that could reshape our understanding of the fundamental interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Test of lepton universality using B+ → K+ℓ+ℓ− decays", "authors": "R.
