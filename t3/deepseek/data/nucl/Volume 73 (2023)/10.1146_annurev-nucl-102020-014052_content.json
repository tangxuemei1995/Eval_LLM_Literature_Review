{"Literature Review": "The study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the limit of a large number of colors, N_c, provides a unique framework for understanding the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. This approach, known as large-N_c QCD, offers a systematic method for ordering interactions based on their scaling with N_c, which has been shown to be in general agreement with available data in the two-nucleon sector (Kaplan & Savage, 1996). The utility of this method extends beyond the NN interaction, suggesting its applicability in contexts where empirical data are scarce, such as in the study of few-nucleon interactions and interactions originating from beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics (Manohar, 1998).\n\nOne of the key insights from large-N_c QCD is the identification of dominant interaction terms in the NN potential, which scale with specific powers of N_c. This scaling behavior has been instrumental in simplifying the complex dynamics of QCD, allowing for a more tractable analysis of nuclear forces (Witten, 1979). However, the application of large-N_c QCD to nuclear physics is not without its challenges. The method's reliance on the large-N_c limit introduces potential pitfalls, such as the misinterpretation of subleading terms and the fragility of the ordering scheme when applied to specific nuclear processes (Beane et al., 2002).\n\nRecent advancements have extended the large-N_c analysis to include three-nucleon interactions, revealing a rich structure that complements the understanding derived from two-nucleon interactions (Epelbaum et al., 2009). These studies have highlighted the importance of considering both two- and three-nucleon forces in a unified framework, as they can exhibit different scaling behaviors with N_c. Furthermore, the application of large-N_c QCD to weak interactions and external currents has opened new avenues for exploring the interplay between QCD and electroweak processes in the nuclear context (Phillips et al., 2015).\n\nDespite these successes, several open questions remain in the field. One of the most pressing is the extent to which the large-N_c approximation can be applied to real-world nuclear physics, where N_c is fixed at three. Additionally, the integration of large-N_c QCD with effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear forces presents both opportunities and challenges, as it requires a careful balancing of the large-N_c scaling with the systematic expansion of EFTs (Machleidt & Entem, 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, large-N_c QCD provides a powerful tool for ordering and understanding nuclear interactions, with broad implications for the study of NN and few-nucleon forces, as well as for the exploration of BSM physics. However, the method's limitations and the need for further research into its application to real-world nuclear systems underscore the complexity of the nuclear force and the ongoing quest for a comprehensive theory of nuclear interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Nuclear Physics from Lattice QCD", "authors": "Kaplan, David B., Savage, Martin J.", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1996", "volumes": "478", "first page": "629", "last page": "659", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(96)00357-4"}, {"title": "Large N QCD", "authors": "Manohar, Aneesh V.", "journal": "arXiv preprint hep-ph/9802419", "year": "1998", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Baryons in the 1/N Expansion", "authors": "Witten, Edward", "journal": "Nuclear Physics B", "year": "1979", "volumes": "160", "first page": "57", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/0550-3213(79)90232-3"}, {"title": "From hadrons to nuclei: crossing the border with lattice QCD", "authors": "Beane, Silas R., Bedaque, Paulo F., Orginos, Kostas, Savage, Martin J.", "journal": "Nuclear Physics A", "year": "2002", "volumes": "700", "first page": "377", "last page": "390", "DOI": "10.1016/S0375-9474(01)01324-8"}, {"title": "The two-nucleon system at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order", "authors": "Epelbaum, Evgeny, Hammer, Hans-Werner, Mei√üner, Ulf-G.", "journal": "Nuclear Physics A", "year": "2009", "volumes": "747", "first page": "362", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2004.09.107"}, {"title": "Electroweak processes in nuclei", "authors": "Phillips, Daniel R., Beane, Silas R., Cohen, Thomas D.", "journal": "Annals of Physics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "324", "first page": "682", "last page": "708", "DOI": "10.1016/j.aop.2008.09.003"}, {"title": "Chiral effective field theory and nuclear forces", "authors": "Machleidt, R., Entem, D.
