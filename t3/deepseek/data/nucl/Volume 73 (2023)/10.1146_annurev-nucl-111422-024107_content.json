{"Literature Review": "The Hubble tension, a discrepancy between the local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) under the assumption of the ΛCDM model, has become one of the most pressing issues in modern cosmology. This tension suggests either the presence of systematic errors in measurements or the need for new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. Recent studies have extensively explored both possibilities, with a growing consensus that systematic errors alone are unlikely to resolve the tension, thereby pointing towards new physics as a more plausible solution (Riess et al., 2019; Planck Collaboration, 2020).\n\nLocal measurements of H0, primarily based on the distance ladder method using Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae, have consistently yielded higher values compared to those derived from the CMB data assuming the ΛCDM model. This discrepancy has been reinforced by independent methods, including time delays in gravitationally lensed quasars and the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method, which have also reported higher values of H0 (Wong et al., 2020; Freedman et al., 2019). These findings have led to a reevaluation of the ΛCDM model, particularly its assumptions about the early Universe.\n\nOne of the most promising avenues for resolving the Hubble tension involves modifications to the physics of the early Universe, specifically before recombination. Early dark energy (EDE) models, which propose a transient phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field that decays before recombination, have gained significant attention. These models can increase the inferred value of H0 from the CMB data by altering the sound horizon at recombination, thereby bringing it into closer agreement with local measurements (Poulin et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020).\n\nEDE models must satisfy several observational constraints, including those from the CMB power spectrum, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Recent studies have shown that EDE models can be consistent with these constraints while also alleviating the Hubble tension (Hill et al., 2020; Ivanov et al., 2020). However, the precise nature of the scalar field and its interactions remain poorly understood, necessitating further theoretical and observational investigations.\n\nFuture measurements, particularly those from next-generation CMB experiments like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, as well as improved local distance ladder measurements, are expected to provide critical tests of EDE models and other early-Universe solutions to the Hubble tension (Ade et al., 2019; Abazajian et al., 2019). These observations will help to refine the constraints on the properties of the scalar field and its impact on the early Universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the Hubble tension represents a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model, with early dark energy emerging as a promising solution. While EDE models have shown potential in reconciling the discrepancy between local and CMB-based measurements of H0, further research is needed to fully understand their implications and to test their predictions against upcoming observational data. The resolution of the Hubble tension will not only shed light on the nature of dark energy but also provide deeper insights into the fundamental physics of the early Universe.", "References": [{"title": "Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheid Standards Provide a 1% Foundation for the Determination of the Hubble Constant and Stronger Evidence for Physics Beyond ΛCDM", "authors": "Adam G.
