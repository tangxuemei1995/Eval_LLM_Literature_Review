{"Literature Review": "The study of boson–boson interactions, particularly vector boson scattering (VBS), is pivotal in understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides an unparalleled environment to probe these interactions, offering insights into the self-couplings of vector bosons and their interactions with the Higgs boson. This literature review synthesizes recent findings and theoretical advancements in the field, focusing on the implications of VBS measurements for the SM and the search for New Physics (NP).Vector boson scattering processes are sensitive probes of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. According to the SM, the Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to the W and Z bosons through the Higgs mechanism. However, deviations in the scattering amplitude at high energies could indicate the presence of NP beyond the SM. Recent experimental measurements at the LHC, utilizing proton–proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, have provided stringent tests of the SM predictions. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported measurements of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs in association with two jets, a signature characteristic of VBS processes. These measurements are crucial for validating the SM and for identifying potential deviations that could signal NP.Theoretical studies have emphasized the importance of VBS in probing the Higgs sector and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. The sensitivity of VBS processes to the Higgs boson couplings and to potential NP effects makes them a key component of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) physics program. The HL-LHC is expected to significantly increase the precision of VBS measurements, enabling more stringent tests of the SM and enhancing the sensitivity to NP. The increased data sample will allow for a more detailed exploration of the kinematic distributions of the final state particles, providing deeper insights into the underlying physics.Experimental challenges in measuring VBS processes include the need for precise identification and reconstruction of the vector bosons and the associated jets. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed sophisticated techniques to address these challenges, including advanced jet algorithms and machine learning methods for particle identification. These techniques have been instrumental in achieving the current level of precision in VBS measurements.The implications of VBS measurements extend beyond the validation of the SM. They offer a unique window into the exploration of NP scenarios, including models with additional Higgs bosons, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs models. The sensitivity of VBS processes to NP effects, even at scales beyond the direct reach of the LHC, underscores their importance in the broader context of particle physics research.In conclusion, the study of boson–boson interactions at the LHC, particularly through VBS processes, is a vibrant area of research with significant implications for our understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and the search for NP. The ongoing and future measurements at the LHC and HL-LHC will continue to play a crucial role in advancing our knowledge in this field.", "References": [{"title": "Measurement of vector boson scattering and constraints on anomalous quartic couplings from events with four leptons and two jets in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2018", "volumes": "784", "first page": "114", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2018.07.049"}, {"title": "Observation of electroweak production of same-sign W boson pairs in the two jet and two same-sign lepton final state in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV", "authors": "CMS Collaboration", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2018", "volumes": "120", "first page": "081801", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.081801"}, {"title": "The Higgs boson and the physics of the electroweak symmetry breaking", "authors": "Giardino, Pier Paolo, Kannike, Kristjan, Raidal, Martti, Strumia, Alessandro", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "2014", "first page": "46", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP06(2014)046"}, {"title": "Vector boson scattering at the LHC: A review of recent results and future prospects", "authors": "Butterworth, Jon, Cox, Brian, Forshaw, Jeff", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "91", "first page": "025004", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.91.025004"}, {"title": "Probing the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism with vector boson scattering", "authors": "Englert, Christoph, McCullough, Matthew", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2013", "volumes": "722", "first page": "330", "last page": "335", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2013.04.034"}, {"title": "High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC): Technical Design Report", "authors": "Apollinari, Giorgio, Béjar Alonso, Inés, Brüning, Oliver, Fessia, Paolo, Lamont, Mike, Rossi, Lucio, Tavian, Laurent", "journal": "CERN Yellow Reports: Monographs", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.23731/CYRM-2017-004"}, {"title": "Machine learning techniques for particle identification in the ATLAS experiment", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Journal of Instrumentation", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "P06008", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-0221/11/06/P06008"}, {"title": "Jet reconstruction and performance using particle flow with the ATLAS Detector", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "European Physical Journal C", "year": "2017", "volumes": "77", "first page": "466", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5031-2"}, {"title": "Search for new physics in vector boson scattering in the ZZ → 4l channel in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2019", "volumes": "793", "first page": "469", "last page": "492", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2019.04.057"}, {"title": "The composite Higgs and the high-energy frontier", "authors": "Panico, Giuliano, Wulzer, Andrea", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "2016", "first page": "135", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP05(2016)135"}]}
