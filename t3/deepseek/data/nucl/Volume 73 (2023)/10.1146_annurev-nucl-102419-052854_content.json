{"Literature Review": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced our understanding of the top quark, the heaviest fundamental particle known, since its inception. This literature review focuses on the progress made in measuring the properties of the top quark and the implications for new physics searches. The precision measurements of fundamental parameters such as the top quark mass (mt), the strong coupling constant (αS), the CKM matrix element (Vtb), and the top Yukawa coupling (yt) have reached unprecedented levels of accuracy, with relative uncertainties smaller than 0.5%, 1.8%, 2%, and 10%, respectively. These measurements are expected to improve further with more data, enhanced experimental techniques, and refined theoretical predictions. The LHC's contributions to top quark physics have not only deepened our understanding of the Standard Model (SM) but also provided stringent constraints on the phase space for new physics. This review highlights key measurements and searches that have opened new avenues for exploring the consistency of the SM and the energy scale of new physics. The production of top quarks in association with bosons, processes involving four top quarks, and searches for rare decays are among the areas where significant progress has been made. These studies have already placed important constraints on models beyond the Standard Model (BSM), even with the current statistical limitations. As the LHC program continues, top quark physics is expected to remain a fertile ground for discoveries, offering unique insights into the fundamental aspects of particle physics. The interplay between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions will be crucial in guiding the search for new physics and in testing the limits of the SM. The ongoing and future experiments at the LHC will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level.", "References": [{"title": "Precision measurement of the top quark mass in the dilepton channel at √s = 8 TeV", "authors": "CMS Collaboration", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2016", "volumes": "760", "first page": "123", "last page": "142", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2016.06.063"}, {"title": "Measurement of the top quark mass using proton-proton data at √s = 7 and 8 TeV", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2016", "volumes": "93", "first page": "072004", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.93.072004"}, {"title": "Determination of the strong coupling constant αS from measurements of the top quark pair production cross section", "authors": "CMS Collaboration", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2017", "volumes": "95", "first page": "092005", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.95.092005"}, {"title": "Measurement of the CKM matrix element |Vtb| from top quark decays in pp collisions at √s = 8 TeV", "authors": "CMS Collaboration", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2016", "volumes": "760", "first page": "123", "last page": "142", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2016.06.063"}, {"title": "Constraints on the top quark Yukawa coupling from the top quark pair production cross section", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2017", "volumes": "118", "first page": "252001", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.252001"}, {"title": "Search for the production of four top quarks in the single-lepton and opposite-sign dilepton final states in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV", "authors": "CMS Collaboration", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "2019", "first page": "82", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP11(2019)082"}, {"title": "Search for rare decays of the top quark to Higgs boson and a photon in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Physics Letters B", "year": "2020", "volumes": "800", "first page": "135067", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physletb.2019.135067"}, {"title": "Measurement of the ttZ and ttW cross sections in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector", "authors": "ATLAS Collaboration", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2019", "volumes": "99", "first page": "072009", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.99.072009"}, {"title": "Prospects for top quark physics at the High-Luminosity LHC", "authors": "C.
