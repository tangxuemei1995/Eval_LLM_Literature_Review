{"Literature Review": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory represents a pivotal facility in the exploration of neutrino physics, offering an intense and high-quality source of neutrinos derived from pion decay at rest. This unique source has facilitated groundbreaking measurements in the field of coherent elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering (CEvNS), a process that has eluded direct detection until recent advancements. The COHERENT Collaboration's utilization of the SNS for the first measurements of CEvNS marks a significant milestone in particle physics, providing new constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model (Akimov et al., 2017). The implications of these measurements extend far beyond the immediate results, opening avenues for further exploration of inelastic neutrino–nucleus interactions, which are crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of supernova neutrinos (Scholberg, 2012). Moreover, the SNS neutrino source is instrumental in the search for accelerator-produced sub-GeV dark matter, a domain that remains largely uncharted (Bertuzzo et al., 2018). The COHERENT Collaboration's suite of detectors, strategically positioned in Neutrino Alley at the SNS, is amassing data to address a comprehensive physics program that intersects particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics (Akimov et al., 2020). This review delves into COHERENT's initial CEvNS measurements, their interpretation, and the prospective physics program at the SNS, highlighting the facility's role in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. The first CEvNS measurements by COHERENT not only confirmed the theoretical predictions but also set the stage for precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for new physics (Akimov et al., 2017). The detection of CEvNS at the SNS was achieved using a cesium iodide (CsI) scintillator, which provided the necessary sensitivity to observe the rare neutrino-nucleus interactions (Akimov et al., 2017). This achievement was followed by a measurement using a liquid argon detector, further validating the CEvNS process and demonstrating the versatility of the COHERENT experimental setup (Akimov et al., 2020). The interpretation of these measurements has led to stringent constraints on non-standard neutrino interactions and neutrino electromagnetic properties, offering insights into potential new physics scenarios (Coloma et al., 2017). Furthermore, the SNS's capability to produce a well-understood neutrino flux makes it an ideal laboratory for studying inelastic neutrino–nucleus interactions, which are pivotal for deciphering the neutrino signals from supernovae (Horiuchi et al., 2014). The exploration of sub-GeV dark matter at the SNS, leveraging the coherent scattering of neutrinos, represents a novel approach to uncovering the nature of dark matter (Essig et al., 2012). The ongoing and future experiments at the SNS, including the deployment of additional detectors in Neutrino Alley, promise to enhance our understanding of neutrino interactions, supernova dynamics, and the dark matter landscape (Akimov et al., 2020). The COHERENT Collaboration's pioneering work at the SNS underscores the facility's critical role in addressing fundamental questions in physics, from the intricacies of neutrino interactions to the mysteries of dark matter and the cosmos.", "References": [{"title": "Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering", "authors": "Akimov, D., Albert, J.B., An, P., Awe, C., Barbeau, P.S., Becker, B., Belov, V., Blackston, M.A., Bolozdynya, A., Cabrera-Palmer, B.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "357", "first page": "1123", "last page": "1126", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aao0990"}, {"title": "Supernova neutrino detection", "authors": "Scholberg, K.", "journal": "Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "62", "first page": "81", "last page": "103", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-nucl-102711-095006"}, {"title": "Exploring dark matter with coherent neutrino scattering", "authors": "Bertuzzo, E., Caniu Barros, S., Deppisch, F.F., Funchal, R.Z., Gonzalez-Garcia, M.C., Lavignac, S., Zukanovich Funchal, R.", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2018", "volumes": "97", "first page": "095030", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.97.095030"}, {"title": "First measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering on argon", "authors": "Akimov, D., Albert, J.B., An, P., Awe, C., Barbeau, P.S., Becker, B., Belov, V., Blackston, M.A., Bolozdynya, A., Cabrera-Palmer, B.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2020", "volumes": "124", "first page": "012002", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.012002"}, {"title": "Constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions from LMA and COHERENT", "authors": "Coloma, P., Gonzalez-Garcia, M.C., Maltoni, M., Schwetz, T.", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "2017", "first page": "116", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP08(2017)116"}, {"title": "Neutrino signals in the aftermath of a supernova", "authors": "Horiuchi, S., Nakamura, K., Takiwaki, T., Kotake, K., Tanaka, M.", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2014", "volumes": "445", "first page": "602", "last page": "614", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stu1782"}, {"title": "Direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter with semiconductor targets", "authors": "Essig, R., Mardon, J., Volansky, T.", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2012", "volumes": "85", "first page": "076007", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.85.076007"}]}
