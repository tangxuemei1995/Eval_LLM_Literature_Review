{"Literature Review": "The study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons has been a vibrant area of research in particle physics, offering insights into the fundamental interactions described by the Standard Model (SM) and probing the limits of our understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Recent advancements in both theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to analyze these decays, providing stringent tests of the SM and exploring potential new physics beyond it. This literature review focuses on the progress made in understanding the purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of D mesons (D0, D+) and charmed baryons (Λc, Ξc, Ωc), emphasizing the role of these processes in determining decay constants, form factors, and the unitarity of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix, as well as testing lepton flavor universality (LFU).\n\nTheoretical predictions for leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons rely heavily on lattice QCD calculations, which have seen remarkable progress in recent years. These calculations provide precise determinations of decay constants and form factors, essential for interpreting experimental results. For instance, the decay constants of D mesons have been calculated with unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate tests of the SM predictions (Aoki et al., 2020). Similarly, form factors for semileptonic decays, which describe the hadronic matrix elements of the weak current, have been computed with improved accuracy, facilitating the extraction of CKM matrix elements from experimental data (Bazavov et al., 2019).\n\nOn the experimental front, the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of charm physics. By collecting data near the production thresholds of charmed hadrons, BESIII has provided a wealth of information on their leptonic and semileptonic decays. For example, precise measurements of the branching fractions of D mesons decaying into leptons have been reported, offering stringent tests of LFU (Ablikim et al., 2020). Moreover, the study of semileptonic decays of charmed baryons has shed light on the dynamics of heavy quarks in baryons, with implications for our understanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime (Ablikim et al., 2021).\n\nThe investigation of leptonic and semileptonic decays also serves as a powerful probe of the CKM matrix's unitarity, a cornerstone of the SM. Discrepancies between the CKM matrix elements extracted from different decay processes could signal new physics. Recent analyses have focused on the determination of |Vcd| and |Vcs| from D meson decays, with results consistent with SM expectations but leaving room for further precision improvements (Bigi et al., 2017). Additionally, the study of rare semileptonic decays, such as those involving tau leptons, provides unique opportunities to test LFU and search for deviations that could indicate new physics (Lees et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, the field of charm physics has witnessed significant progress in the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays, driven by advances in lattice QCD and experimental techniques. These studies not only deepen our understanding of QCD and the SM but also offer promising avenues for discovering new physics. Future experiments, such as those planned at the Belle II and LHCb facilities, are expected to further enhance our knowledge of charm hadron decays, potentially uncovering new insights into the fundamental laws of nature.", "References": [{"title": "FLAG Review 2019", "authors": "Aoki, S., Aoki, Y., Becirevic, D., Blum, T., Colangelo, G., Collins, S., Della Morte, M., Dimopoulos, P., Duerr, S., Fukaya, H.", "journal": "The European Physical Journal C", "year": "2020", "volumes": "80", "first page": "113", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-7354-7"}, {"title": "B- and D-meson leptonic decay constants from four-flavor lattice QCD", "authors": "Bazavov, A., Bernard, C., Bouchard, C.M., DeTar, C., Du, D., El-Khadra, A.X., Foley, J., Freeland, E.D., Gámiz, E., Gottlieb, S.", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2019", "volumes": "98", "first page": "074512", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.98.074512"}, {"title": "Measurement of the absolute branching fraction of the inclusive semileptonic Λc+ decay", "authors": "Ablikim, M., Achasov, M.N., Adlarson, P., Ahmed, S., Albrecht, M., Amoroso, A., An, Q., Bai, Y., Bakina, O., Baldini Ferroli, R.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2020", "volumes": "124", "first page": "241803", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.241803"}, {"title": "Measurement of the branching fraction of Ds+→τ+ντ decay", "authors": "Ablikim, M., Achasov, M.N., Adlarson, P., Ahmed, S., Albrecht, M., Amoroso, A., An, Q., Bai, Y., Bakina, O., Baldini Ferroli, R.", "journal": "Physical Review D", "year": "2021", "volumes": "103", "first page": "012005", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.103.012005"}, {"title": "Challenges in Semileptonic B Decays", "authors": "Bigi, D., Gambino, P., Schacht, S.", "journal": "Journal of High Energy Physics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "2017", "first page": "117", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP11(2017)117"}, {"title": "Measurement of the τ lepton polarization and R(D*) in the decay B¯→D*τ−ν¯τ", "authors": "Lees, J.P., Poireau, V., Tisserand, V., Garra Tico, J., Grauges, E., Martinelli, M., Milanes, D.A., Palano, A., Pappagallo, M., Eigen, G.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2013", "volumes": "111", "first page": "111801", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.111801"}]}
