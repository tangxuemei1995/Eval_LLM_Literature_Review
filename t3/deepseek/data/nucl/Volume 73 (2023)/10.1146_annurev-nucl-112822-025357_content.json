{"Literature Review": "Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) Gamma-Ray Astronomy represents a frontier in astrophysics, offering insights into the most energetic processes in the universe. The detection of gamma rays with energies exceeding 0.1 PeV has opened a new observational window, revealing the existence of PeVatrons—sources capable of accelerating particles to PeV energies. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has been instrumental in this discovery, identifying 12 PeVatrons and detecting photons above 1 PeV, marking a significant milestone in the field (Cao et al., 2021). These findings suggest that nearly all celestial objects emitting in the TeV band also produce UHE photons, indicating a universal mechanism for particle acceleration across different astrophysical environments. The absorption of UHE gamma rays by the infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds limits their observable horizon to within our Galaxy, providing a unique probe into galactic cosmic ray (CR) sources (Protheroe & Stanev, 1996). The detection of UHE gamma rays has been made possible through the adaptation of traditional CR measurement techniques, such as extensive air shower (EAS) detection, which has broadened the field of view for source observations (Hillas, 1984). This method allows for the measurement of UHE radiation surrounding sources, offering insights into particle propagation within accelerators and their subsequent injection into the interstellar medium. The Crab Nebula, a well-studied astrophysical object, has been a focal point in UHE gamma-ray astronomy, with detected photon emissions up to 1 PeV. These emissions, in the absence of hadronic processes, suggest the presence of an extreme accelerator of electron-positron pairs, challenging our understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms (Aharonian et al., 2004). The study of UHE gamma rays is crucial for identifying hadronic radiation sources, thereby tracing the origins of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The suppression of UHE radiation in the deep Klein–Nishina regime for leptonic sources further underscores the importance of UHE gamma-ray detection in distinguishing between leptonic and hadronic processes (Blumenthal & Gould, 1970). The advancements in UHE gamma-ray astronomy, facilitated by observatories like LHAASO, have not only expanded our knowledge of the universe's most energetic phenomena but also paved the way for future discoveries in the field. The integration of EAS detection techniques with traditional gamma-ray observation methods has enhanced our ability to probe the extreme environments of cosmic accelerators, offering a comprehensive understanding of particle acceleration and propagation mechanisms (Gaisser, 1990). As the field continues to evolve, the pursuit of UHE gamma-ray sources remains a key endeavor in unraveling the mysteries of cosmic rays and their origins.", "References": [{"title": "Ultrahigh-energy photons up to 1.4 petaelectronvolts from 12 γ-ray Galactic sources", "authors": "Cao, Zhen, Aharonian, Felix, An, Qing, Axikegu, Bai, Bai, Y.
