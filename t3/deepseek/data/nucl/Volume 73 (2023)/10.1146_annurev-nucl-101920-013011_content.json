{"Literature Review": "The search for long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) represents a frontier in the exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). LLPs are predicted by various BSM theories, including supersymmetry, hidden sector models, and theories with extra dimensions. These particles are characterized by their significantly longer lifetimes compared to typical particles produced in high-energy collisions, leading to unique experimental signatures that challenge traditional detection methods. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the theoretical motivations for LLPs, the experimental techniques developed to search for them at the LHC, and the challenges associated with these searches. Theoretical motivations for LLPs stem from their ability to address several open questions in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter, the hierarchy problem, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. For instance, in supersymmetric models, the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) can be long-lived if the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) that serves as a dark matter candidate (Ellis et al., 2010). Similarly, hidden sector models predict the existence of particles that interact very weakly with Standard Model particles, leading to long lifetimes (Essig et al., 2013). Experimental searches for LLPs at the LHC exploit their delayed decays, displaced vertices, or missing transverse energy signatures. These searches require specialized techniques to distinguish LLP signals from background processes. For example, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed dedicated triggers and reconstruction algorithms to identify displaced vertices and tracks (Aad et al., 2015; Khachatryan et al., 2016). Additionally, the use of timing information from detectors such as the LHCb VELO and the CMS MIP Timing Detector has been proposed to further enhance the sensitivity to LLPs (Aaij et al., 2018; CMS Collaboration, 2020). Estimating signal efficiencies and background rates for LLP searches involves several subtleties. The long lifetimes of LLPs mean that their decays can occur over a wide range of distances from the interaction point, requiring careful modeling of the detector response. Furthermore, the backgrounds to LLP searches can be complex, involving Standard Model processes with displaced vertices or misreconstructed tracks. Advanced simulation techniques and data-driven methods are employed to accurately estimate these backgrounds (Alimena et al., 2020). In conclusion, the search for LLPs at the LHC is a vibrant area of research that bridges theoretical predictions and experimental techniques. The development of innovative detection strategies and the continuous improvement of background estimation methods are crucial for advancing our understanding of the fundamental constituents of the universe.", "References": [{"title": "Supersymmetric Dark Matter Candidates", "authors": "John Ellis, Keith A.
