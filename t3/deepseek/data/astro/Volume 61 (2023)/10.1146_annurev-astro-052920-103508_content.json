{"Literature Review": "The application of Gaussian Process (GP) regression in astronomical time series analysis has marked a significant evolution in the field of astrostatistics. This method, known for its flexibility and robustness, has become increasingly popular for modeling stochastic signals in astronomical data. The emergence of GP regression in astronomy can be traced back to the need for more sophisticated tools to handle the complexity and variability of time-domain data sets. The foundational work by Rasmussen and Williams (2006) laid the mathematical groundwork for GP regression, highlighting its advantages in terms of flexibility and the ability to model complex, non-linear relationships without specifying a parametric form. In the context of astronomy, GP regression has been applied to a wide range of phenomena, from the study of exoplanetary systems to the analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For instance, Gibson et al. (2012) demonstrated the utility of GP regression in modeling the transit light curves of exoplanets, showcasing its ability to account for correlated noise and stellar variability. Similarly, Kelly et al. (2014) applied GP regression to the analysis of AGN light curves, illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the stochastic variability inherent in these sources. The versatility of GP regression is further evidenced by its application to the study of optical transients, where it has been used to model the complex light curves of supernovae and other transient events (Villar et al., 2019). Despite its many advantages, the application of GP regression in astronomy is not without challenges. One of the primary concerns is the computational cost associated with GP regression, particularly for large data sets. To address this issue, several algorithmic and conceptual advances have been proposed, including the use of sparse GP approximations and the development of scalable GP software packages (Hensman et al., 2013). These developments have significantly reduced the computational burden, making GP regression more accessible to the astronomical community. Furthermore, the availability of open-source GP software packages, such as George (Ambikasaran et al., 2015) and celerite (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2017), has facilitated the widespread adoption of GP regression in astronomy. These packages provide user-friendly interfaces and efficient implementations of GP regression, enabling researchers to easily apply this method to their data. In summary, GP regression has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series, offering a flexible and robust approach to modeling stochastic signals. Its application spans a wide range of astronomical phenomena, from exoplanets to AGN, and it continues to gain traction in the field of time-domain astronomy. With ongoing algorithmic and conceptual advances, GP regression is poised to remain an essential tool for astronomers seeking to extract meaningful insights from complex time-domain data sets.", "References": [{"title": "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning", "authors": "Carl Edward Rasmussen, Christopher K.
