{"Literature Review": "Optical/Infrared (O/IR) interferometry has undergone significant advancements in recent years, revolutionizing our ability to observe and understand the universe. The development of instruments like GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) has pushed the boundaries of what is possible in astronomical observations. These instruments have enabled the observation of objects fainter than 19 mag, with submilliarcsecond resolution and microarcsecond precision in astrometry, leading to groundbreaking discoveries in various fields of astrophysics (Eisenhauer et al., 2011; Monnier et al., 2012).\n\nThe GRAVITY instrument, in particular, has been a game-changer in the field. By combining the light from four 8-m telescopes, it has achieved sensitivity levels that are a thousand times greater than those of earlier interferometers. This has allowed for detailed studies of the Galactic Center, providing insights into the supermassive black hole at its core and the dynamics of stars orbiting it (Gravity Collaboration et al., 2018). Similarly, CHARA's ability to offer baselines up to 330 m with six 1-m telescopes has facilitated high-resolution imaging and aperture synthesis, contributing to our understanding of stellar physics and the structure of young stellar objects (ten Brummelaar et al., 2005).\n\nOne of the key technological advancements that have enabled these achievements is the development of single-mode beam combiners. These devices allow for the coherent combination of light from up to six telescopes, significantly improving the resolution and sensitivity of interferometric observations. Additionally, advances in image reconstruction software, initially developed for radio interferometry, have been adapted for O/IR interferometry, further enhancing the quality of the images obtained (Berger et al., 2012).\n\nAnother critical factor in the performance boost of modern interferometers is the integration of adaptive optics (AO) and fringe tracking systems. AO systems correct for atmospheric distortions in real-time, while fringe tracking ensures the stability of the interference pattern, both of which are essential for high-precision measurements. The combination of these technologies with large telescopes and dual-beam interferometry has resulted in a dramatic increase in sensitivity, enabling the observation of previously inaccessible targets (Lacour et al., 2014).\n\nLooking to the future, the use of laser guide star AO is expected to bring another order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity. This technology, combined with large separation fringe tracking, will provide complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets. This will open up new possibilities for studying a wide range of astronomical phenomena, from the formation and evolution of stars and planets to the nature of active galactic nuclei and the large-scale structure of the universe (Davies et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the recent advances in O/IR interferometry have significantly expanded our observational capabilities, leading to a deeper understanding of the universe. The continued development of new technologies and techniques promises to further enhance the performance of interferometers, paving the way for future discoveries in astrophysics.", "References": [{"title": "GRAVITY: observing the universe in motion", "authors": "Eisenhauer, Frank, Perrin, Guy, Brandner, Wolfgang, Straubmeier, Christian, Perraut, Karine, Amorim, Antonio, Schöller, Markus, Gillessen, Stefan, Kervella, Pierre, Benisty, Myriam", "journal": "The Messenger", "year": "2011", "volumes": "143", "first page": "16", "last page": "24", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "First results from the CHARA Array.
