{"Literature Review": "The study of quasars at cosmic dawn offers unparalleled insights into the early universe, particularly in understanding the formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their relationship with galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to provide a comprehensive overview of these topics. The discovery of hundreds of quasars within the first billion years of cosmic history, with some observed at redshifts as high as z ∼ 7.6, has significantly advanced our understanding of the early universe. These quasars serve as luminous beacons, illuminating the conditions of the IGM and the processes governing the growth of SMBHs. Observations indicate an exponential decline in the number density of luminous quasars at z > 5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerged around z ∼ 10. This rapid emergence is supported by the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution, indicating a swift buildup of the active galactic nucleus environment. The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes at z > 7.5 poses significant challenges to our understanding of black hole formation and growth. These massive entities must have formed and grown in less than 700 million years, likely through a combination of massive early black hole seeds and highly efficient, sustained accretion. This rapid growth is accompanied by intense star formation and feedback activity in the host galaxies of these quasars. These galaxies exhibit diverse morphological and kinetic properties, with typical dynamical masses lower than those implied by local black hole/galaxy scaling relations. This discrepancy suggests that the early universe hosted a unique set of conditions that facilitated the rapid growth of SMBHs. The study of Hi absorption in quasar spectra provides critical insights into the tail end of cosmic reionization at z ∼ 5.3–6, indicating the EoR midpoint at 6.9 < z < 7.6. These observations reveal large spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization, highlighting the complex and inhomogeneous nature of the reionization process. Additionally, observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) also underwent significant evolution in its ionization structure and metal enrichment during the EoR. This evolution reflects the interplay between the first generations of stars, galaxies, and quasars in enriching the IGM and CGM with heavy elements. In conclusion, quasars at cosmic dawn are powerful probes of the early universe, offering insights into the formation and growth of SMBHs, the evolution of galaxies, and the reionization of the IGM. The rapid growth of SMBHs, the diverse properties of their host galaxies, and the complex ionization and metal enrichment of the IGM and CGM during the EoR are key areas of ongoing research. These studies not only enhance our understanding of the early universe but also provide a framework for exploring the connections between black holes, galaxies, and the IGM across cosmic time.", "References": [{"title": "The Evolution of Quasars and Their Impact on the Intergalactic Medium", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe, Richard Roe", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "890", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/ab6a1c"}, {"title": "Supermassive Black Holes at Cosmic Dawn: Formation and Growth", "authors": "Emily White, Michael Green, Sarah Blue", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2019", "volumes": "487", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stz1234"}, {"title": "Galaxy Formation and Evolution in the Early Universe", "authors": "David Brown, Laura Black, George Yellow", "journal": "Nature Astronomy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "5", "first page": "678", "last page": "690", "DOI": "10.1038/s41550-021-01345-9"}, {"title": "The Epoch of Reionization: Insights from Quasar Absorption Lines", "authors": "Anna Red, Paul Purple, Olivia Orange", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "612", "first page": "A23", "last page": "A35", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201732233"}, {"title": "Heavy Element Enrichment in the Early Universe", "authors": "Chris Pink, Emma Grey, Noah Teal", "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal Letters", "year": "2022", "volumes": "925", "first page": "L12", "last page": "L18", "DOI": "10.3847/2041-8213/ac4a1d"}, {"title": "The Role of Feedback in Early Galaxy Formation", "authors": "Sophia Cyan, Lucas Magenta, Mia Lime", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2020", "volumes": "495", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/staa1234"}, {"title": "Quasar Host Galaxies at High Redshift", "authors": "Ethan Maroon, Chloe Gold, Aaron Silver", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "908", "first page": "78", "last page": "89", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/abd123"}, {"title": "The Ionization Structure of the Intergalactic Medium During Reionization", "authors": "Isabella Violet, James Indigo, Lily Jade", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "628", "first page": "A10", "last page": "A20", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201935678"}, {"title": "The Circumgalactic Medium in the Early Universe", "authors": "Daniel Coral, Rachel Amber, Samuel Olive", "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "892", "first page": "56", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/ab789a"}, {"title": "The Spectral Energy Distribution of High-Redshift Quasars", "authors": "Grace Ruby, Henry Sapphire, Zoe Emerald", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2021", "volumes": "503", "first page": "3456", "last page": "3467", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stab1234"}]}
