{"Literature Review": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has opened a new chapter in the study of celestial objects, providing unique insights into the composition and dynamics of bodies originating from beyond our Solar System. These objects, characterized by their hyperbolic trajectories, offer a rare glimpse into the material that populates the vast expanses of the Milky Way. The first of these, 1I/‘Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017 and exhibited characteristics that defied easy classification, appearing as an elongated, asteroid-like body without the typical cometary coma (Meech et al., 2017). In contrast, 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, displayed clear cometary features, including a coma and tail, indicative of volatile sublimation (Guzik et al., 2020). The divergent properties of these two interlopers underscore the diversity of the interstellar object population and challenge our understanding of their origins and evolution. The presence of nongravitational accelerations in both objects further complicates their study, suggesting interactions with solar radiation or outgassing that are not fully understood (Micheli et al., 2018; Jewitt et al., 2020). The estimated number density of such objects, approximately 0.1 AU−3, implies a vast population of similar bodies traversing the galaxy, potentially numbering in the range of 1025 to 1026 (Do et al., 2018). This staggering figure highlights the significance of interstellar interlopers as a previously unrecognized component of the galactic inventory. The origins of these objects are thought to lie in the protoplanetary disks of young stars, from which they were ejected through dynamic processes (Raymond et al., 2018). However, the paucity of data on these interlopers leaves room for alternative explanations, including the possibility of their formation in more exotic environments or through mechanisms not yet considered (Jackson & Desch, 2021). The study of interstellar interlopers is still in its infancy, and future discoveries are expected to shed light on their nature, origins, and the processes that govern their journey through the galaxy. As our observational capabilities improve, particularly with the advent of next-generation telescopes and surveys, we anticipate a significant increase in the detection rate of these enigmatic objects, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of their role in the cosmic landscape (Trilling et al., 2017). The investigation of interstellar interlopers not only enriches our knowledge of the universe but also challenges our preconceptions about the formation and evolution of planetary systems, offering a unique perspective on the material that bridges the stars.", "References": [{"title": "A brief visit from a red and extremely elongated interstellar asteroid", "authors": "Karen J.
