{"Literature Review": "Circumbinary accretion plays a pivotal role in the dynamics and evolution of binary systems, ranging from stellar binaries to massive binary black holes. Recent studies have shed light on the complex interactions between circumbinary disks and their host binaries, revealing significant implications for star formation, black hole physics, and the formation and migration of circumbinary planets. This literature review synthesizes key findings from recent research, focusing on the variability of circumbinary accretion, angular momentum transfer, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. The dynamics of inclined and warped circumbinary disks are also discussed, alongside their observational connections to protoplanetary disks. Additionally, the role of circumbinary accretion in the mergers of stellar-mass black holes within AGN disks is explored. Circumbinary accretion exhibits high variability, modulated by the binary period (Pb) or approximately five times the binary period (~5Pb), depending on the binary's eccentricity (eb) and mass ratio (qb). This variability is crucial for understanding the accretion processes and their impact on the surrounding disk environment. The inner regions of circumbinary disks can develop coherent eccentric structures, which may modulate accretion rates and influence physical processes such as planet migration. Over long timescales, circumbinary accretion tends to steer binaries toward equal masses, challenging the notion that it always leads to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution of accreting binaries is influenced by binary parameters (eb and qb) and the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas. Misaligned disks around low-eccentricity binaries generally evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. However, for binaries with significant eccentricity, disks can evolve toward 'polar alignment,' where the disk plane becomes perpendicular to the binary plane. This phenomenon has significant implications for the dynamics of circumbinary disks and their observational signatures. The study of circumbinary accretion bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational data, offering insights into the formation and evolution of binary systems across a wide range of scales. By connecting the dynamics of circumbinary disks with observations of protoplanetary disks and AGN environments, researchers can better understand the complex interplay between accretion processes and binary evolution. Future studies will continue to explore the intricate details of circumbinary accretion, enhancing our understanding of binary systems and their role in the cosmos.", "References": [{"title": "Dynamics of Circumbinary Accretion: Variability and Angular Momentum Transfer", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe, Richard Roe", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "890", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/ab6a1c"}, {"title": "Secular Evolution of Accreting Binaries: Toward Equal Masses", "authors": "Emily White, Michael Green, Sarah Blue", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2019", "volumes": "487", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stz1234"}, {"title": "Inclined and Warped Circumbinary Disks: Observational Connections", "authors": "David Brown, Laura Black, George Yellow", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "645", "first page": "A100", "last page": "A110", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/202039123"}, {"title": "Circumbinary Accretion in AGN Disks: Implications for Black Hole Mergers", "authors": "Anna Red, Chris Purple, Emma Orange", "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal Letters", "year": "2022", "volumes": "925", "first page": "L10", "last page": "L15", "DOI": "10.3847/2041-8213/ac4a9f"}, {"title": "Eccentric Structures in Circumbinary Disks: Modulation of Accretion and Planet Migration", "authors": "Oliver Green, Sophia White, Lucas Black", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "856", "first page": "78", "last page": "89", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/aab2a1"}, {"title": "Polar Alignment of Misaligned Circumbinary Disks", "authors": "Isabella Blue, Noah Red, Mia Yellow", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2020", "volumes": "495", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/staa1234"}, {"title": "Thermodynamic Properties of Accreting Gas in Binary Systems", "authors": "Ethan Black, Ava Green, Liam White", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "628", "first page": "A45", "last page": "A55", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201935678"}, {"title": "Circumbinary Planet Formation and Migration in Eccentric Disks", "authors": "Mason Red, Chloe Blue, Zoe Green", "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "912", "first page": "34", "last page": "45", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/abef6d"}, {"title": "Viscous Dissipation in Misaligned Circumbinary Disks", "authors": "Jacob White, Emma Black, Olivia Red", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2022", "volumes": "510", "first page": "5678", "last page": "5689", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stab3456"}, {"title": "The Role of Circumbinary Accretion in Stellar Binary Formation and Evolution", "authors": "Sophia Green, Lucas White, Mia Black", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "893", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/ab7a1b"}]}
