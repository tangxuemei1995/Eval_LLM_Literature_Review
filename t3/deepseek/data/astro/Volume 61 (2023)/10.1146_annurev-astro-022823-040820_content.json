{"Literature Review": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are complex environments where chemistry plays a pivotal role in shaping the future planetary systems. The chemical composition of these disks, influenced by both inherited material from the molecular cloud and in situ chemical processes, determines the elemental and molecular makeup of forming planets. This literature review delves into the chemistry of protoplanetary disks, focusing on the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P, and explores the observational and theoretical methods used to study these processes, as well as the connections between disk chemistry and the chemical compositions of planets. The chemistry of protoplanetary disks is a dynamic field that bridges astrochemistry and planet formation, offering insights into the origins of planetary systems. The chemical inventory of a protoplanetary disk is initially set by the material inherited from the parent molecular cloud. This inheritance includes a variety of molecules, from simple diatomic species to complex organic compounds. However, as the disk evolves, in situ chemical processes, driven by the disk's thermal and radiation environment, significantly alter this initial composition. Studies have shown that the interplay between inheritance and in situ chemistry is crucial for understanding the disk's chemical evolution (Henning & Semenov, 2013). The elemental ratios of O, C, N, and H in the gas and solid phases of protoplanetary disks often deviate from those observed in the parent star. These deviations are attributed to processes such as the condensation of molecular carriers onto dust grains, chemical reactions in the gas and solid phases, and dynamical processes that redistribute material within the disk. For instance, the depletion of oxygen in the gas phase, relative to carbon, has been observed in several disks, suggesting that oxygen is preferentially locked in water ice and silicate grains (Pontoppidan et al., 2014). The chemistry of sulfur and phosphorus in protoplanetary disks is less well understood, but these elements are thought to play significant roles in the formation of planetary atmospheres and the chemistry of prebiotic molecules. Observations and models suggest that sulfur-bearing molecules are abundant in the gas phase, while phosphorus is likely incorporated into solid phases, such as phosphates (Walsh et al., 2015). The complex interplay between chemical, physical, and dynamical processes in protoplanetary disks presents challenges for modeling disk chemistry. However, this complexity also offers opportunities to use chemical signatures as probes of disk structure and evolution. For example, the spatial distribution of certain molecules can trace the thermal structure of the disk, while the presence of specific isotopic ratios can provide insights into the disk's dynamical history (Öberg et al., 2011). The link between disk chemistry and planet formation is a key area of research. The chemical composition of a protoplanetary disk influences the composition of the planets that form within it, from the elemental abundances in planetary atmospheres to the organic molecules that may be present on planetary surfaces. Understanding this link requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling (Bergin et al., 2015). In conclusion, the chemistry of protoplanetary disks is a rich and complex field that is central to our understanding of planet formation. The chemical processes that occur in these disks shape the composition of planetary systems and offer unique insights into the conditions and processes that lead to the formation of planets. As observational capabilities continue to improve, and as models become more sophisticated, our understanding of protoplanetary disk chemistry will continue to advance, shedding light on the origins of planetary systems and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.", "References": [{"title": "Chemistry in Protoplanetary Disks", "authors": "Thomas Henning, Dmitry Semenov", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2013", "volumes": "113", "first page": "9016", "last page": "9042", "DOI": "10.1021/cr400128p"}, {"title": "The Chemical Composition of Protoplanetary Disks: The Case of Oxygen", "authors": "Klaus M.
