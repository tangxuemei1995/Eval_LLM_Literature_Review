{"Literature Review": "The study of the first stars, known as Population III (Pop III) stars, is a cornerstone in understanding the early Universe's evolution. These stars formed from pristine, metal-free gas at high redshifts (z ∼ 30 and below) and played a pivotal role in the cosmic dawn by initiating the first episodes of star formation and reionization. This literature review synthesizes current theoretical models and observational constraints on the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars, drawing on recent advancements in cosmology and astrophysics.\n\nPrimordial gas, devoid of metals, exhibits unique cooling mechanisms primarily through molecular hydrogen (H2), leading to a distinct fragmentation process. Bromm et al. (2002) demonstrated that this results in the formation of Pop III stars within small clusters, characterized by a logarithmically flat mass function. This contrasts sharply with the more familiar Salpeter mass function observed in later stellar populations, highlighting the unique conditions of the early Universe.\n\nFeedback mechanisms from massive Pop III stars are crucial in shaping the subsequent star formation history. These stars, often exceeding 100 solar masses, emit intense ultraviolet radiation, which can ionize the surrounding medium and drive outflows, thereby regulating further star formation. However, as noted by Wise et al. (2012), the immediate impact of such feedback remains uncertain, with models suggesting a complex interplay between radiative feedback and the gravitational collapse of gas clouds.\n\nIn extreme scenarios, supermassive Pop III stars with masses up to several 105M⊙ can form. These behemoths, as explored by Hosokawa et al. (2013), may serve as the progenitors of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars. Their formation and evolution provide critical insights into the early growth of black holes and the reionization epoch.\n\nDirect observation of Pop III stars remains a formidable challenge due to their immense distances and the faintness of their signals. However, indirect methods offer promising avenues. The global 21-cm signal, as discussed by Furlanetto et al. (2006), can trace the ionization history of the Universe, potentially revealing the era of Pop III star formation. Similarly, gravitational waves from Pop III star remnants, such as black hole mergers, could provide unique signatures of these ancient stars, as explored by Belczynski et al. (2016).\n\nStellar archeology, the study of ancient stars in the local Universe, offers another window into the Pop III era. Surveys have identified stars with extremely low metallicities, which are thought to be the descendants of Pop III stars. These observations, as detailed by Frebel & Norris (2015), help constrain the mass distribution of Pop III stars, suggesting that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae. This distinction is crucial for understanding the chemical enrichment of the early Universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of Pop III stars bridges our understanding of the Universe's infancy and its subsequent evolution. While direct observations remain elusive, theoretical models and indirect observational techniques continue to shed light on these enigmatic objects. Future advancements in observational astronomy and computational astrophysics promise to further unravel the mysteries of the first stars and their profound impact on the cosmos.", "References": [{"title": "Formation of the First Stars: Protostellar Collapse in the Presence of Radiative Feedback", "authors": "Volker Bromm, Paul S.
