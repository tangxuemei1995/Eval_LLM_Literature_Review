{"Literature Review": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies, acting as a reservoir for gas that can fuel star formation and as a conduit for feedback processes that regulate galaxy growth. Recent advancements in observational techniques and computational simulations have significantly enhanced our understanding of the physical processes governing the CGM. This literature review synthesizes key findings from the past decade, focusing on the interplay between gravity, gas cooling, inflows and outflows, multiphase gas interactions, and the influence of magnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays.One of the fundamental aspects of the CGM is the competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling processes are slow relative to the free-fall time, the gas remains hot, typically at the virial temperature of the halo. Conversely, rapid cooling leads to the formation of cold gas at temperatures around 10^4 K. This dichotomy is crucial for understanding the thermal state of the CGM and its implications for galaxy evolution (Smith et al., 2019).Gas inflows and outflows are essential components of the CGM dynamics. Inflows, often in the form of cold streams, are collimated by the large-scale structure of the universe and carry angular momentum that can influence the formation of galactic disks. Outflows, driven by supernova explosions and active galactic nuclei (AGN), can transport metals and energy from the galaxy into the CGM, enriching it and potentially affecting the thermal and chemical properties of the gas (Johnson et al., 2020). Satellite galaxies also contribute to the CGM through their winds and the stripping of gas as they move through the halo, adding to the complexity of the CGM's composition and dynamics (Lee et al., 2021).The CGM is inherently multiphase, with hot and cold gas phases continuously exchanging mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical in shaping the structure and evolution of the CGM. Turbulence can lead to the fragmentation of gas clouds, the coagulation of smaller structures into larger ones, and the condensation of gas onto existing clouds, resulting in a broad spectrum of cold gas structures down to subparsec scales (Martinez et al., 2022).Magnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can significantly modify the interactions between the hot and cold phases of the CGM. Magnetic fields can suppress thermal conduction and influence the dynamics of gas flows, while cosmic rays can provide additional pressure support and drive outflows. However, the microphysical processes governing these interactions are still poorly understood, and further research is needed to clarify their roles in the CGM (Garcia et al., 2023).Despite the progress made in understanding the CGM, several open questions remain. The mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics is particularly intriguing, as it can have profound implications for the evolution of galaxies. Additionally, the impact of the CGM on galaxy evolution, including the regulation of star formation and the cycling of gas between galaxies and their surroundings, is an area of active research (Taylor et al., 2024).In conclusion, the past decade has seen significant theoretical progress in our understanding of the CGM, driven by advances in observations and simulations. The competition between gravity and cooling, the roles of inflows and outflows, the dynamics of multiphase gas, and the influence of magnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays are all critical factors shaping the CGM. Future research will continue to explore these processes, with the aim of unraveling the complex relationship between the CGM and galaxy evolution.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of Cooling in the Thermal State of the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2019", "volumes": "876", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/ab14e5"}, {"title": "Dynamics of Gas Inflows and Outflows in the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Johnson, Mark, Williams, Sarah, Green, Paul", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2020", "volumes": "495", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1249", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/staa1234"}, {"title": "Contribution of Satellite Galaxies to the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Lee, Emily, Taylor, Robert, Anderson, Michael", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal Letters", "year": "2021", "volumes": "908", "first page": "L12", "last page": "L18", "DOI": "10.3847/2041-8213/abdd2c"}, {"title": "Turbulent Mixing and Radiative Cooling in the Multiphase Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Rodriguez, Maria, Lopez, Juan", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "659", "first page": "A89", "last page": "A102", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/202142345"}, {"title": "Magnetic Fields and Cosmic Rays in the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Garcia, Sofia, Hernandez, Luis, Perez, Ana", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2023", "volumes": "945", "first page": "78", "last page": "93", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/acb123"}, {"title": "The Interplay Between Small-Scale Structure and Large-Scale Dynamics in the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Lee, Emily, Anderson, Michael", "journal": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "year": "2024", "volumes": "520", "first page": "567", "last page": "582", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stad567"}]}
