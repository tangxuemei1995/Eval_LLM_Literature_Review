{"Literature Review": "The study of galaxy formation and evolution has been significantly advanced through the use of hydrodynamical simulations within the ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) cosmological framework. These simulations have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing researchers to model the complex processes that govern the formation, growth, and interaction of galaxies. A key achievement of these simulations is their ability to reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies, a fundamental aspect of the large-scale structure of the universe (Springel et al., 2005). Furthermore, they have successfully captured the distributions of critical galaxy characteristics such as mass, size, and star formation rate (SFR), aligning with observational data (Vogelsberger et al., 2014). This alignment extends to the scaling relations that connect diverse galaxy properties to mass, offering insights into the underlying physics that drive galaxy evolution (Schaye et al., 2015). Despite these successes, hydrodynamical simulations face significant challenges, particularly in modeling the properties of circumgalactic gas. The behavior of this gas is highly sensitive to the subgrid models employed to approximate the effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) (Oppenheimer et al., 2016). Feedback processes are crucial for regulating star formation and shaping the galaxy population, yet their implementation in simulations remains a subject of ongoing research and debate (Somerville & Davé, 2015). Comparisons between leading simulation suites and observational data have highlighted both the enduring successes and the outstanding challenges in the field. For instance, the EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) and Illustris projects have demonstrated remarkable agreement with observations in terms of galaxy stellar mass functions and the cosmic star formation history (Crain et al., 2015; Genel et al., 2014). However, discrepancies remain in the detailed properties of galaxies, such as their gas fractions and the kinematics of their stellar and gaseous components (Naab & Ostriker, 2017). These discrepancies underscore the need for improved subgrid models and higher resolution simulations to better capture the complex interplay of physical processes that shape galaxies. Looking ahead, the next generation of hydrodynamical simulations promises to address these challenges through advances in computational power, algorithmic techniques, and our understanding of galaxy formation physics. Efforts to refine feedback models, incorporate additional physical processes, and increase simulation resolution will be critical for achieving a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the galaxy population (Weinberger et al., 2017). As these simulations continue to evolve, they will provide invaluable tools for interpreting observational data and testing theoretical predictions, furthering our understanding of the cosmos.", "References": [{"title": "The large-scale structure of the universe", "authors": "Springel, Volker, White, Simon D.
