{"Literature Review": "Food insecurity remains a critical issue in the United States, affecting millions of households and individuals. The genesis and development of the Food Security Module have been pivotal in understanding and measuring food insecurity across different demographics. This module has enabled researchers to assess the prevalence of food insecurity and its impact on dietary quality and caloric intake. A conceptual model of food insecurity, grounded in consumer choice theory, illustrates the quality–quantity trade-off that households face when allocating limited resources to food consumption. This model also highlights the linkages between food insecurity and policy levers, suggesting that targeted interventions can mitigate the adverse effects of food insecurity.Recent studies have shed light on the dietary patterns of individuals in food-insecure households. Adults in these households tend to consume lower-quality diets across the entire distribution of diet quality and experience more volatility in caloric intake. This volatility can lead to periods of both undernutrition and overnutrition, contributing to long-term health issues. Interestingly, the impact of food insecurity on diet quality and caloric intake varies by age and gender. Males younger than 20 years in food-insecure households consume fewer calories but do not exhibit differences in diet quality. In contrast, younger females in similar circumstances consume more calories but do not show significant differences in diet quality. These findings underscore the complex relationship between food insecurity and dietary outcomes, which can vary significantly across different population groups.Federal food assistance programs play a crucial role in addressing food insecurity in the United States. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is one of the largest and most effective programs in reducing household food insecurity. However, its impact on improving the nutritional quality of diets is limited. This suggests that while SNAP provides essential support in ensuring access to sufficient calories, additional measures may be needed to enhance the nutritional quality of the diets of SNAP participants.Programs specifically targeting children, such as the School Breakfast Program (SBP), the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), have been more successful in both reducing food insecurity and improving the nutritional quality of children's diets. These programs provide not only access to food but also ensure that the food meets specific nutritional standards, contributing to better health outcomes for children. The effectiveness of these programs highlights the importance of targeted interventions in addressing food insecurity and improving dietary quality among vulnerable populations.In conclusion, food insecurity in the United States is a multifaceted issue that requires comprehensive and targeted interventions. The development of the Food Security Module has been instrumental in measuring and understanding food insecurity. Economic models based on consumer choice theory provide valuable insights into the quality–quantity trade-offs faced by food-insecure households. Federal food assistance programs, particularly those targeting children, have shown promise in reducing food insecurity and improving dietary quality. However, there is a need for continued research and policy innovation to address the complex challenges of food insecurity and ensure that all individuals have access to sufficient, nutritious food.", "References": [{"title": "Measuring Food Insecurity and Hunger: Phase 1 Report", "authors": "National Research Council", "journal": "National Academies Press", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.17226/11227"}, {"title": "Household Food Security in the United States in 2019", "authors": "Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Matthew P.
