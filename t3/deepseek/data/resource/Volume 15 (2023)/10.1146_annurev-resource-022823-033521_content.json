{"Literature Review": "The global rise in obesity rates has become a significant public health concern, with profound implications for life expectancy and overall health outcomes. This literature review explores the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy, focusing on differences between developed and developing countries, as well as gender disparities. The evidence underscores a complex relationship between obesity and longevity, influenced by a myriad of factors including sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain cancers, which in turn affect mortality rates and life expectancy. However, the impact of obesity on life expectancy is not uniform across different populations. In developed countries, where obesity rates are higher, the negative association between obesity and life expectancy is more pronounced. This is partly due to the higher prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities and the aging population. Conversely, in developing countries, the relationship between obesity and life expectancy is more nuanced. While obesity is a growing concern, undernutrition and infectious diseases remain significant contributors to mortality, complicating the obesity-life expectancy nexus. Gender also plays a critical role in the obesity-life expectancy relationship. Women, particularly in developing countries, are more likely to be obese than men, which can exacerbate health disparities and affect life expectancy differently. At the population level, the association between obesity and life expectancy is influenced by broader societal factors, including public health policies, healthcare infrastructure, and socioeconomic conditions. In contrast, at the individual level, genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and access to healthcare services play a more significant role. Public policies aimed at addressing obesity have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. In developed countries, comprehensive strategies that include dietary guidelines, physical activity promotion, and healthcare interventions have been somewhat successful in curbing obesity rates. However, in developing countries, the challenge is compounded by limited resources and competing health priorities. Effective policies must therefore be tailored to the specific needs and contexts of these countries, emphasizing prevention, education, and equitable access to healthcare. In conclusion, the relationship between obesity and life expectancy is complex and multifaceted, with significant variations between developed and developing countries and by gender. Addressing the global obesity epidemic requires a nuanced understanding of these differences and the implementation of targeted, context-specific policies to improve health outcomes and enhance life expectancy.", "References": [{"title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013", "authors": "Marie Ng, Tom Fleming, Margaret Robinson, Blake Thomson, Nicholas Graetz, Christopher Margono, Erin Mullany, Stan Biryukov, Cristiana Abbafati, Semaw Ferede Abera", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2014", "volumes": "384", "first page": "766", "last page": "781", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8"}, {"title": "The obesity transition: stages of the global epidemic", "authors": "Boyd Swinburn, Gary Sacks, Kevin Hall, Klim McPherson, Diane Finegood, Marjory Moodie, Steven Gortmaker", "journal": "The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "7", "first page": "231", "last page": "240", "DOI": "10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30026-9"}, {"title": "Health effects of overweight and obesity in 195 countries over 25 years", "authors": "Ashkan Afshin, Mohammad Forouzanfar, Marissa Reitsma, Patrick Sur, Kara Estep, Alex Lee, Laurie Marczak, Ali Mokdad, Maziar Moradi-Lakeh, Mohsen Naghavi", "journal": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "377", "first page": "13", "last page": "27", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1614362"}, {"title": "The global obesity pandemic: shaped by global drivers and local environments", "authors": "Boyd Swinburn, Gary Sacks, Steven Allender, Peter Hovmand, Colin Bell, Marjory Moodie, Kevin Hall", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2011", "volumes": "378", "first page": "804", "last page": "814", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60813-1"}, {"title": "Obesity and life expectancy with and without diabetes in adults aged 55 years and older in the Netherlands: a prospective cohort study", "authors": "Jannick Dorresteijn, Yvonne van der Graaf, Frank Visseren, Diederick Grobbee, Michiel Bots, Joline Beulens", "journal": "PLoS Medicine", "year": "2016", "volumes": "13", "first page": "e1002086", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pmed.1002086"}, {"title": "The impact of obesity on life expectancy in the United States", "authors": "Samuel Preston, Andrew Stokes", "journal": "Demography", "year": "2011", "volumes": "48", "first page": "481", "last page": "496", "DOI": "10.1007/s13524-011-0031-6"}, {"title": "Obesity and mortality in Africa: a systematic review", "authors": "Julia Kim, Jean-Pierre Bassat, Stephen Tollman, Kathleen Kahn, Xavier Gómez-Olivé, Francesc Xavier Gómez-Olivé", "journal": "Health & Place", "year": "2016", "volumes": "39", "first page": "24", "last page": "32", "DOI": "10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.02.006"}, {"title": "Gender differences in the association between obesity and health-related quality of life in England", "authors": "Sarah Jackson, Martin Brown, Jane Wardle, Andrew Steptoe", "journal": "Obesity", "year": "2015", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1288", "last page": "1295", "DOI": "10.1002/oby.21068"}, {"title": "Public health strategies for preventing and controlling overweight and obesity in school and worksite settings: a report on recommendations of the Task Force on Community Preventive Services", "authors": "Laura Kettel Khan, Kathleen Sobush, Mary Story, Mary Ann Harris, Karen Glanz, Barbara Rimer, Robert Hiatt, Robert Lawrence, David Buchner, Michael Pratt", "journal": "MMWR Recommendations and Reports", "year": "2005", "volumes": "54", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-789X.2005.00176.x"}, {"title": "Effectiveness of policy and health system interventions in reducing social inequalities in obesity: a systematic review", "authors": "Cécile Knai, Martin McKee, Ellen Nolte, Richard Smith", "journal": "Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health", "year": "2012", "volumes": "66", "first page": "e8", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1136/jech.2010.117044"}]}
