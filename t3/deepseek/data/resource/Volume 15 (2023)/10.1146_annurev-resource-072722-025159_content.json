{"Literature Review": "Food losses in agrifood systems represent a critical challenge to global food security, environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency. Despite the recognition of this issue by the United Nations and the G20 in 2015, the distinction between food loss and food waste remains blurred in both research and policy discussions. This literature review aims to delineate the current understanding of food losses within agrifood systems, focusing on measurements, causes, determinants, and interventions to mitigate these losses. The review underscores the necessity of separating food loss from food waste in data collection and analysis to enhance the effectiveness of interventions and to understand the cascading effects across the value chain. Food loss, defined as the decrease in edible food mass throughout the part of the supply chain that specifically leads to edible food for human consumption, occurs primarily during production, postharvest, and processing stages. In contrast, food waste refers to the discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption by retailers and consumers. The distinction is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Recent studies have highlighted the complexity of measuring food losses due to the lack of standardized methodologies and the variability across different agrifood systems. Parfitt et al. (2010) emphasize the importance of developing consistent measurement techniques to accurately assess the scale of food losses and to monitor the impact of interventions over time. The causes of food losses are multifaceted, involving technical, managerial, and infrastructural factors. Gustavsson et al. (2011) identify inadequate storage facilities, poor handling practices, and insufficient infrastructure as primary contributors to food losses in developing countries. In developed countries, stringent quality standards and consumer preferences for aesthetic perfection lead to significant food losses at the retail and consumer levels. Determinants of food losses include economic, social, and environmental factors. Lipinski et al. (2013) argue that economic incentives for maximizing yield and minimizing costs often result in practices that inadvertently increase food losses. Social factors, such as cultural norms and consumer behavior, also play a significant role in shaping the patterns of food losses. Environmental determinants, including climate variability and pest infestations, further exacerbate the problem. Interventions to reduce food losses require a holistic approach that considers the entire agrifood system. Innovations in technology, such as improved storage and processing techniques, have shown promise in reducing losses. Stuart (2009) highlights the potential of mobile technology and data analytics in enhancing supply chain efficiency and reducing food losses. Policy interventions, including subsidies for infrastructure development and incentives for adopting best practices, are also critical. However, the effectiveness of these interventions depends on the availability of accurate and disaggregated data on food losses. The integration of feedback loops and cascading effects across the value chain is essential for identifying intervention hot spots and understanding the trade-offs and synergies of different strategies. Reducing food losses has the potential to contribute significantly to achieving socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals. However, this requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders in the agrifood system, supported by improved data collection and standardized measurements.", "References": [{"title": "Food waste within food supply chains: quantification and potential for change to 2050", "authors": "Julian Parfitt, Mark Barthel, Sarah Macnaughton", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2010", "volumes": "365", "first page": "3065", "last page": "3081", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2010.0126"}, {"title": "Global food losses and food waste: extent, causes and prevention", "authors": "Jenny Gustavsson, Christel Cederberg, Ulf Sonesson, Robert van Otterdijk, Alexandre Meybeck", "journal": "FAO", "year": "2011", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Reducing Food Loss and Waste", "authors": "Brian Lipinski, Craig Hanson, James Lomax, Lisa Kitinoja, Richard Waite, Tim Searchinger", "journal": "World Resources Institute", "year": "2013", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal", "authors": "Tristram Stuart", "journal": "Penguin Books", "year": "2009", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The State of Food and Agriculture 2019.
