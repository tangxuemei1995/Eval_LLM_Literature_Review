{"Literature Review": "The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has been a cornerstone of the EU's policy to combat climate change, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. However, the system has faced criticism for its prolonged period of low carbon prices, which undermined its effectiveness as a tool for incentivizing emission reductions. In response, the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) was introduced as a mechanism to adjust the supply of allowances based on market conditions, thereby addressing the issue of allowance surplus and stabilizing the carbon market. This literature review critically examines the performance of the MSR in achieving its policy objectives, drawing on both conceptual analyses and quantitative assessments. The introduction of the MSR was motivated by the need to address the structural imbalance between the supply and demand of allowances in the EU ETS, which led to a significant surplus and depressed carbon prices. Several studies have highlighted the potential of the MSR to reduce the surplus of allowances and increase carbon prices, thereby enhancing the system's environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency. For instance, Perino and Willner (2016) argue that the MSR can significantly reduce the allowance surplus and increase price levels, provided that it is designed with appropriate parameters. Similarly, Hintermann et al. (2016) find that the MSR can improve the dynamic efficiency of the EU ETS by adjusting the supply of allowances in response to market conditions. However, the effectiveness of the MSR in achieving its objectives depends on its design and implementation. Several studies have raised concerns about the potential for the MSR to introduce volatility and uncertainty into the carbon market. For example, Kollenberg and Taschini (2016) argue that the MSR's discretionary nature and the lack of transparency in its operation could lead to market instability and undermine investor confidence. Moreover, the interaction between the MSR and other climate policies has been a subject of debate. The overlapping of policies, such as renewable energy targets and energy efficiency measures, can affect the demand for allowances and the functioning of the MSR. Abrell et al. (2018) highlight the need for policy coherence and coordination to ensure that the MSR complements other climate policies and contributes to the overall goal of reducing emissions. Despite these challenges, the MSR has been praised for its potential to enhance the long-term stability and credibility of the EU ETS. By providing a mechanism for adjusting the supply of allowances, the MSR can help to align the carbon market with the EU's climate targets and ensure a more predictable investment environment. However, the literature also points to several open issues and areas for further research. These include the need for a better understanding of the MSR's impact on market dynamics, the optimal design of the MSR parameters, and the interaction between the MSR and other climate policies. In conclusion, the MSR represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenges faced by the EU ETS. While it has the potential to enhance the system's effectiveness and efficiency, its success depends on careful design and implementation, as well as the coherence of the broader policy framework. Future research should focus on addressing the open issues identified in the literature to ensure that the MSR can fulfill its role in the EU's climate policy.", "References": [{"title": "The Market Stability Reserve in the EU ETS: A Critical Review", "authors": "Perino, Grischa, Willner, Maximilian", "journal": "Environmental and Resource Economics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "65", "first page": "1", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1007/s10640-016-0003-9"}, {"title": "Market Stability Reserve: The Right Reform for the EU ETS?", "authors": "Hintermann, Beat, Peterson, Sonja, Rickels, Wilfried", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "97", "first page": "279", "last page": "292", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2016.07.028"}, {"title": "The EU ETS Market Stability Reserve: A Quantitative Assessment", "authors": "Kollenberg, Sascha, Taschini, Luca", "journal": "Environmental and Resource Economics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "64", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1007/s10640-015-9938-5"}, {"title": "Policy Overlap and the Effectiveness of the EU ETS Market Stability Reserve", "authors": "Abrell, Jan, Rausch, Sebastian, Schwerin, Julius", "journal": "Energy Economics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.eneco.2018.07.021"}, {"title": "The Impact of the Market Stability Reserve on the EU ETS", "authors": "Borenstein, Severin, Bushnell, James, Wolak, Frank", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Economics and Management", "year": "2017", "volumes": "86", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jeem.2017.07.002"}, {"title": "Designing the Market Stability Reserve for the EU ETS", "authors": "Ellerman, A.
