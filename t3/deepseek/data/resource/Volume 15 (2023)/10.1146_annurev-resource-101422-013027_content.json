{"Literature Review": "Food fraud, encompassing practices such as adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant challenges to the integrity of the global agri-food marketing system. This literature review explores the causes, consequences, and deterrence strategies of food fraud, drawing on a growing body of theoretical and empirical research. Asymmetric information, where one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other, is a fundamental enabler of food fraud. This imbalance allows fraudulent actors to exploit the lack of knowledge among consumers and regulators, leading to the proliferation of adulterated or mislabeled products (Spink & Moyer, 2011). The complexity of agri-food supply chains further exacerbates this issue, as it creates numerous opportunities for fraud to occur undetected (Manning & Soon, 2016). Imperfect certification processes and weak monitoring and enforcement systems also contribute to the persistence of food fraud, as they fail to provide reliable assurances of product authenticity and safety (Charlebois et al., 2014). The consequences of food fraud are multifaceted, affecting consumer health, economic welfare, and trust in the food system. Health risks arise from the consumption of adulterated products, which may contain harmful substances or lack essential nutrients (Everstine et al., 2013). Economically, food fraud undermines fair competition and can lead to significant financial losses for legitimate businesses and consumers (van Ruth et al., 2018). Moreover, the erosion of consumer trust in food products and regulatory bodies can have long-term detrimental effects on the agri-food sector (Janssen & Hamm, 2012). In response to these challenges, a variety of deterrence strategies have been proposed and implemented. These include the development of more robust certification and traceability systems, which aim to enhance transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain (Golan et al., 2004). Technological innovations, such as blockchain and DNA barcoding, offer promising tools for detecting and preventing food fraud (Tian, 2016). Additionally, stricter regulatory enforcement and the imposition of harsher penalties for fraudulent activities are critical for deterring potential offenders (Spink et al., 2019). Despite these efforts, gaps in the literature remain, particularly in understanding the behavioral motivations behind food fraud and the effectiveness of different deterrence strategies. Future research should focus on these areas to develop more targeted and effective interventions against food fraud.", "References": [{"title": "Defining the Public Health Threat of Food Fraud", "authors": "John Spink, Douglas Moyer", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2011", "volumes": "76", "first page": "R157", "last page": "R163", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02417.x"}, {"title": "Developing systems to control food adulteration", "authors": "Louise Manning, Jan Mei Soon", "journal": "Food Policy", "year": "2016", "volumes": "59", "first page": "152", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodpol.2015.12.001"}, {"title": "Food fraud and the perceived integrity of the European food import control system", "authors": "Sylvain Charlebois, Simon Somogyi, Brian Sterling", "journal": "Food Control", "year": "2014", "volumes": "42", "first page": "207", "last page": "214", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.02.018"}, {"title": "Economically Motivated Adulteration (EMA) of Food: Common Characteristics of EMA Incidents", "authors": "Karen Everstine, John Spink, Shaun Kennedy", "journal": "Journal of Food Protection", "year": "2013", "volumes": "76", "first page": "723", "last page": "735", "DOI": "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-399"}, {"title": "Food fraud vulnerability assessment: Reliable data sources and effective assessment approaches", "authors": "Saskia van Ruth, Luning P, Silvis I", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "71", "first page": "175", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2017.11.003"}, {"title": "Product labelling in the market for organic food: Consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay for different organic certification logos", "authors": "Marco Janssen, Ulrich Hamm", "journal": "Food Quality and Preference", "year": "2012", "volumes": "25", "first page": "9", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodqual.2011.12.004"}, {"title": "Traceability in the U.S. Food Supply: Economic Theory and Industry Studies", "authors": "Elise Golan, Barry Krissoff, Fred Kuchler", "journal": "Agricultural Economic Report", "year": "2004", "volumes": "830", "first page": "1", "last page": "48", "DOI": "10.22004/ag.econ.34081"}, {"title": "A supply chain traceability system for food safety based on HACCP, blockchain & Internet of Things", "authors": "Feng Tian", "journal": "International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "6", "DOI": "10.1109/ICSSSM.2016.7538424"}, {"title": "The application of public policy theory to the emerging food fraud risk: Next steps", "authors": "John Spink, Moyer Douglas, Park Hyeonho, Heinonen Justin", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "85", "first page": "116", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2019.01.012"}]}
