{"Literature Review": "The management of crop residues is a critical issue in agricultural economics, environmental science, and public health. With over five billion metric tons of agricultural residues produced annually worldwide, the way these residues are managed has significant implications for crop and livestock production, air quality, and soil health. Despite the potential benefits of crop residues for enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability, a substantial portion is burned, particularly in Asian countries, leading to severe environmental and health consequences. This literature review explores the economic factors influencing the unsustainable management of crop residues, focusing on the local demand for residues, the development and dissemination of technologies for residue utilization, and the role of market and policy instruments in internalizing the social costs of residue burning. The sustainability of crop residue management is influenced by a complex interplay of economic, technological, and policy factors. Local demand for crop residues plays a crucial role in determining their management. In regions where crop residues are in high demand for uses such as animal feed, bioenergy production, or soil amendment, the incidence of residue burning is significantly lower. However, in areas where the demand for residues is low or non-existent, farmers often resort to burning as a quick and cost-effective method of disposal. The development and dissemination of technologies that can absorb excess crop residues are essential for promoting sustainable management practices. Technologies such as residue incorporation into the soil, biochar production, and the use of residues in bioenergy plants can provide viable alternatives to burning. However, the adoption of these technologies is often hindered by high initial costs, lack of awareness, and insufficient infrastructure. Market and policy instruments can play a pivotal role in internalizing the social costs of residue burning and promoting sustainable management practices. Policies such as subsidies for residue management technologies, taxes on residue burning, and the establishment of markets for crop residues can incentivize farmers to adopt more sustainable practices. Public awareness campaigns highlighting the private and societal costs of open residue burning are also crucial for changing farmer behavior. In conclusion, the sustainable management of crop residues requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the economic, technological, and policy barriers to sustainable practices. By understanding the economic rationale behind unsustainable residue management and implementing targeted interventions, it is possible to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of residue burning while enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.", "References": [{"title": "Crop residue burning in India: Causes, consequences and policy solutions", "authors": "Ravindra Khaiwal, Suman Mor, Anubha Kaushik", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Management", "year": "2019", "volumes": "231", "first page": "858", "last page": "865", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.107"}, {"title": "Agricultural residue burning in the Indo-Gangetic Plainsâ€”A study using IRS-P6 AWiFS satellite data", "authors": "Vinay K.
