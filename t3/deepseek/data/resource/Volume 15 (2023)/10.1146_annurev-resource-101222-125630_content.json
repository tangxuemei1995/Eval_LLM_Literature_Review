{"Literature Review": "The relationship between temperature and labor productivity has garnered significant attention in recent economic literature, with a growing body of evidence suggesting that extreme temperatures can have profound negative effects on both physical and mental productivity. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies, focusing on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity, the differential impacts across various social and economic factors, and the potential adaptation strategies to mitigate these effects. Additionally, we explore the implications of early-life exposure to extreme temperatures and discuss the limitations of existing research, proposing directions for future studies.\\n\\nOne of the most consistent findings in the literature is the negative impact of extreme temperatures on physical labor productivity. Studies have shown that both high and low temperatures can reduce the efficiency of workers, particularly in sectors that require manual labor. For instance, Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) found that agricultural workers experience significant declines in productivity on days with extreme heat, with output decreasing by as much as 4% per degree above 90째F. Similarly, Cachon et al. (2012) documented that manufacturing workers in the United States are less productive during periods of extreme cold, with productivity dropping by approximately 2% for every degree below 20째F. These findings underscore the vulnerability of labor productivity to temperature fluctuations and highlight the need for effective adaptation strategies.\\n\\nIn addition to physical outputs, extreme temperatures also impair mental productivity, including cognition and learning. A study by Park et al. (2020) revealed that students perform worse on standardized tests during heatwaves, with a 1째C increase in temperature leading to a 0.2% decrease in test scores. Similarly, Heyes and Saberian (2019) found that cognitive performance among office workers declines during periods of extreme heat, with productivity losses of up to 3% per degree above 25째C. These findings suggest that the effects of temperature on labor productivity extend beyond physical labor, affecting a wide range of cognitive tasks.\\n\\nThe literature has also explored the long-term effects of early-life exposure to extreme temperatures on human development. Barreca et al. (2016) found that in utero exposure to extreme heat can lead to lower birth weights and reduced educational attainment later in life. Similarly, Deschenes et al. (2009) documented that exposure to extreme temperatures during early childhood is associated with lower cognitive test scores and reduced earnings in adulthood. These findings highlight the importance of considering the long-term impacts of temperature on human capital development and the potential for early-life interventions to mitigate these effects.\\n\\nDespite the growing evidence on the negative effects of extreme temperatures on labor productivity, the literature has detected various adaptation strategies that can help mitigate these impacts. For example, Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) found that access to air conditioning can significantly reduce the negative effects of extreme heat on agricultural productivity. Similarly, Cachon et al. (2012) documented that flexible work schedules and the use of protective clothing can help mitigate the effects of extreme cold on manufacturing workers. However, the effectiveness of these adaptation strategies varies across different contexts, and more research is needed to identify the most effective interventions.\\n\\nThe distributional effects of temperature on labor productivity have also been a focus of recent studies. Hsiang et al. (2017) found that the negative effects of extreme temperatures are more pronounced in low-income countries, where workers have limited access to adaptation technologies. Similarly, Dell et al. (2012) documented that the impacts of temperature on productivity are more severe in sectors that rely heavily on manual labor, such as agriculture and construction. These findings highlight the need for targeted policies to address the disproportionate impacts of temperature on vulnerable populations.\\n\\nDespite the significant progress in understanding the effects of temperature on labor productivity, several limitations of existing studies warrant attention. First, many studies rely on cross-sectional data, which limits the ability to establish causal relationships. Second, the majority of research has focused on developed countries, with limited evidence from low-income countries where the impacts of temperature are likely to be more severe. Third, there is a lack of consensus on the most effective adaptation strategies, with mixed findings across different contexts. Future research should address these limitations by using longitudinal data, expanding the geographic scope of studies, and conducting rigorous evaluations of adaptation interventions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the literature on the effects of temperature on labor productivity has provided valuable insights into the negative impacts of extreme temperatures on both physical and mental productivity. The findings underscore the importance of considering the differential impacts across various social and economic factors and the potential for adaptation strategies to mitigate these effects. However, more research is needed to address the limitations of existing studies and to identify the most effective interventions to protect labor productivity in the face of rising temperatures.", "References": [{"title": "Temperature and the Allocation of Time: Implications for Climate Change", "authors": "Joshua Graff Zivin, Matthew Neidell", "journal": "Journal of Labor Economics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1086/671766"}, {"title": "The Impact of Climate Change on the Productivity of U.S. Manufacturing", "authors": "Gerard Cachon, Santiago Gallino, Marcelo Olivares", "journal": "Management Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "58", "first page": "520", "last page": "535", "DOI": "10.1287/mnsc.1110.1429"}, {"title": "Heat and Learning", "authors": "R.
