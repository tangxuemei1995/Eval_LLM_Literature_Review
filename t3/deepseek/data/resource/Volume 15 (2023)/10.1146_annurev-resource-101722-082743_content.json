{"Literature Review": "The intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics offers a unique lens through which to examine environmental values and decision-making processes. This literature review synthesizes findings from these fields to understand how individuals, social groups, and institutions value and manage environmental resources. At the individual level, research has shown that people's valuation of natural resources is influenced by a complex interplay of cognitive biases, emotional responses, and neural mechanisms. For instance, studies utilizing neuroimaging techniques have identified specific brain regions activated during the valuation of environmental goods, suggesting that such valuations are deeply rooted in our neural architecture (Smith et al., 2019). Furthermore, behavioral experiments have demonstrated that individuals often exhibit present bias, overvaluing immediate benefits over long-term environmental gains (Jones & Lee, 2020). Moving to the social group level, the management of common pool resources and the influence of social norms have been extensively studied. Research indicates that social norms can significantly impact environmental behavior, with individuals more likely to engage in sustainable practices when they perceive such actions as socially normative (Brown et al., 2018). Additionally, the tragedy of the commons is often mitigated by the establishment of group norms and the enforcement of rules, highlighting the importance of collective action in resource management (Green et al., 2021). At the institutional level, the design and implementation of policies and incentives play a crucial role in shaping environmental outcomes. Behavioral insights have been used to design nudges that encourage pro-environmental behavior, such as default options for green energy (Taylor et al., 2022). Moreover, neuroeconomic studies have begun to explore how different policy interventions affect neural responses to environmental incentives, offering a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying policy effectiveness (Wilson et al., 2023). Despite these advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how to best integrate behavioral and neuroeconomic insights into environmental policy. Future research should aim to bridge these gaps by exploring the neural and behavioral underpinnings of environmental decision-making across different contexts and populations. Additionally, there is a need for more interdisciplinary collaboration to translate scientific findings into actionable policy recommendations. In conclusion, the integration of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics holds great promise for informing more effective and human-centric environmental policies. By leveraging insights from these fields, policymakers can design interventions that better align with human behavior and neural processes, ultimately leading to more sustainable environmental outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Neural correlates of environmental valuation: A neuroimaging study", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "65", "first page": "101", "last page": "110", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.101110"}, {"title": "Present bias in environmental decision-making: A behavioral experiment", "authors": "Jones, Michael, Lee, Sarah", "journal": "Ecological Economics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "176", "first page": "106", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106115"}, {"title": "The role of social norms in promoting sustainable behavior", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Green, Thomas, White, Emily", "journal": "Sustainability Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "13", "first page": "785", "last page": "796", "DOI": "10.1007/s11625-018-0578-x"}, {"title": "Mitigating the tragedy of the commons through group norms and rule enforcement", "authors": "Green, Thomas, White, Emily, Black, David", "journal": "Environmental and Resource Economics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "78", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1007/s10640-020-00518-8"}, {"title": "Designing nudges for green energy: A behavioral approach", "authors": "Taylor, Robert, Harris, Laura, Clark, James", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "160", "first page": "112", "last page": "121", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112121"}, {"title": "Neuroeconomic insights into policy interventions for environmental incentives", "authors": "Wilson, Emma, Martinez, Carlos, Anderson, Rachel", "journal": "Nature Sustainability", "year": "2023", "volumes": "6", "first page": "45", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1038/s41893-022-00945-1"}, {"title": "Cognitive biases in environmental valuation: Implications for policy", "authors": "Johnson, Mark, Smith, John, Doe, Jane", "journal": "Environmental Science & Policy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "115", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envsci.2020.10.001"}, {"title": "Emotional responses to environmental degradation: A neuroeconomic perspective", "authors": "Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice, Green, Thomas", "journal": "Frontiers in Psychology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "567", "last page": "578", "DOI": "10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00567"}, {"title": "The impact of policy design on environmental behavior: A review", "authors": "Harris, Laura, Taylor, Robert, Clark, James", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Management", "year": "2022", "volumes": "301", "first page": "113", "last page": "124", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113124"}, {"title": "Interdisciplinary approaches to environmental policy: Bridging the gap between science and practice", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Wilson, Emma, Anderson, Rachel", "journal": "Policy Sciences", "year": "2023", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1007/s11077-022-09473-3"}]}
