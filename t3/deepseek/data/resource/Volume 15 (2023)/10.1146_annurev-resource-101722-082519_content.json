{"Literature Review": "The field of impact assessment in international agricultural research has undergone significant methodological evolution, particularly from 2006 to 2020. This period has been marked by a shift towards more rigorous standards of evidence, emphasizing the importance of causal inference, valid measurement, and statistical representativeness. The traditional approach, rooted in the partial equilibrium model of demand and supply for agricultural products as outlined by Griliches, has been increasingly supplemented by more sophisticated methodologies that address the complexities of modern agricultural systems. This literature review explores these advancements, focusing on their implications for research design and the lessons learned from their application. Causal inference has emerged as a cornerstone of impact assessment, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs gaining prominence. These methods allow researchers to isolate the effects of specific interventions, providing clearer insights into their effectiveness. For instance, Duflo et al. (2008) demonstrated the utility of RCTs in evaluating the impact of agricultural technologies in developing countries, highlighting their ability to generate credible evidence of causality. Similarly, the use of difference-in-differences (DiD) and instrumental variables (IV) approaches has enabled researchers to address selection bias and endogeneity, further enhancing the robustness of impact assessments. Valid measurement has also received increased attention, with a focus on developing accurate and reliable indicators of agricultural outcomes. This includes the adoption of standardized metrics for yield, income, and environmental impact, as well as the use of remote sensing and big data analytics to capture complex agricultural dynamics. Lobell et al. (2015) illustrated the potential of satellite imagery in assessing crop yields at scale, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional survey methods. Moreover, the integration of qualitative and quantitative data has provided a more nuanced understanding of the socio-economic impacts of agricultural innovations, as demonstrated by Barrett et al. (2017) in their study of technology adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa. Statistical representativeness has become another critical consideration, with researchers striving to ensure that their findings are generalizable to broader populations. This has led to the adoption of stratified sampling techniques and the use of nationally representative datasets, as well as the development of methods to account for the heterogeneity of agricultural systems. Maredia et al. (2016) emphasized the importance of scaling up impact assessments to the national level, arguing that this approach provides a more comprehensive view of the benefits and trade-offs associated with agricultural research investments. Furthermore, the concept of innovation portfolios has gained traction, recognizing that the impact of agricultural research is often the result of a combination of technologies and practices. This has necessitated the development of new analytical frameworks to assess the synergistic effects of bundled innovations, as discussed by Spielman et al. (2018). In conclusion, the rigor revolution in impact assessment of international agricultural research has led to significant methodological advancements, enhancing the credibility and relevance of findings. By adopting higher standards of evidence, researchers are better equipped to inform policy decisions and contribute to the sustainable development of agricultural systems. However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of scaling up assessments and accounting for the complexity of innovation bundles. Future research should continue to explore these issues, leveraging emerging technologies and interdisciplinary approaches to further improve the quality and impact of agricultural research.", "References": [{"title": "Using randomization in development economics research: A toolkit", "authors": "Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster, Michael Kremer", "journal": "Handbook of Development Economics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "4", "first page": "3895", "last page": "3962", "DOI": "10.1016/S1573-4471(07)04061-2"}, {"title": "Satellite-based estimates of yield variation and water stress in California agriculture", "authors": "David B.
