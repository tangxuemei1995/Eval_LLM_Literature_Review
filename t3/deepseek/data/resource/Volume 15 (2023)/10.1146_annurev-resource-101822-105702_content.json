{"Literature Review": "The financial sector's vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a growing body of literature examining the impacts across various domains including banking, insurance, stock markets, bond markets, and international financial flows. This review synthesizes findings from these studies, highlighting the pervasive effects of climate-related risks on financial stability and performance, as well as the mitigating factors that can alleviate these impacts. Natural disasters and climate change risks have been shown to exert downward pressure on insurer profitability and risk-sharing capacity. Insurers face increased claims in the aftermath of disasters, which can strain their financial resources and reduce their ability to underwrite new policies (Cummins & Mahul, 2009). Similarly, the banking sector experiences reduced stability and credit supply following climate-related events, as asset values decline and loan defaults increase (Batten et al., 2016). Stock and bond markets are not immune to these effects, with studies documenting lower returns and heightened volatility in the wake of natural disasters (Berkmen et al., 2012). International financial flows, including foreign direct investment and international lending, also tend to decrease as investors become more risk-averse and seek safer havens (Noy, 2009). However, the literature also identifies several factors that can mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the financial sector. Higher income levels, rigorous financial regulations, and abundant capital can provide buffers against financial shocks (Hallegatte et al., 2016). Market diversification and adaptation strategies further enhance resilience by spreading risks and reducing vulnerability to specific climate-related events (Botzen et al., 2019). Interestingly, natural disasters have been found to increase remittance inflows and financial assistance to low- and middle-income countries, providing a crucial lifeline for recovery and reconstruction (Mohapatra et al., 2012). Despite these insights, the literature underscores the need for more forward-looking research to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change. Computational modeling, in particular, offers a promising avenue for exploring these dynamics under various climate scenarios, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers (Dietz et al., 2016). Additionally, future studies should consider hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economic effects of natural disasters, especially for vulnerable countries (Kousky, 2014). In conclusion, the financial sector faces significant challenges from climate change and natural disasters, but there are also opportunities to enhance resilience through targeted policies and strategies. By advancing our understanding of these complex dynamics, researchers can inform more effective responses to the financial risks posed by a changing climate.", "References": [{"title": "Catastrophe Risk Financing in Developing Countries: Principles for Public Intervention", "authors": "J.
