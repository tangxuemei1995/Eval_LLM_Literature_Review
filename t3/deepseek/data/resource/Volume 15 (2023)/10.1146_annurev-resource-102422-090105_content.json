{"Literature Review": "Agroecology has emerged as a pivotal approach in addressing the multifaceted challenges of the agri-food system, aiming to foster sustainability and resilience. This literature review delves into the potential of agroecology to become the mainstream model for agricultural transformation, considering the economic and political contexts that influence its adoption. The review synthesizes findings from various studies to highlight the importance of a multiscale systems approach, the role of emerging technologies, and the necessity for comprehensive policy frameworks to support the large-scale adoption of agroecology. The transition towards agroecology necessitates a holistic understanding of the agri-food system, encompassing ecological, social, and economic dimensions. Studies have emphasized the importance of integrating local knowledge with scientific research to develop context-specific agroecological practices (Altieri et al., 2012). This integration facilitates the adaptation of agroecological principles to diverse environmental and socio-economic conditions, enhancing the resilience of farming systems to climate change and other stressors. Economic viability is a critical factor in the adoption of agroecology by farmers and other stakeholders. Research indicates that agroecological practices can improve farm profitability through reduced input costs and enhanced ecosystem services (Pretty et al., 2018). However, the transition to agroecology often requires initial investments and a shift in production practices, which can be a barrier for smallholder farmers. Policy support, including subsidies and technical assistance, is essential to overcome these barriers and promote the economic viability of agroecology. Emerging technologies, particularly in digitalization and breeding, offer new opportunities for advancing agroecology. Digital tools, such as precision agriculture technologies, can optimize resource use and increase the efficiency of agroecological practices (Walter et al., 2017). Similarly, advances in plant breeding can contribute to the development of crop varieties that are better suited to agroecological systems, enhancing their productivity and resilience. The large-scale adoption of agroecology requires a supportive policy environment that addresses the needs of diverse stakeholders across multiple scales. Multiactor approaches that involve farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers are crucial for developing and implementing effective agroecological policies (Méndez et al., 2013). These policies should be designed to promote sustainable land use, protect biodiversity, and ensure food security, while also addressing the economic and social dimensions of the agri-food system. In conclusion, agroecology holds significant promise for transforming the agri-food system towards sustainability and resilience. However, realizing this potential requires a comprehensive approach that integrates ecological, economic, and social considerations, supported by innovative technologies and robust policy frameworks. The transition to agroecology is a complex process that necessitates the collaboration of all stakeholders involved in the agri-food system, from local communities to global policymakers.", "References": [{"title": "Agroecology Scaling Up for Food Sovereignty and Resiliency", "authors": "Miguel Altieri, Clara Nicholls, Alejandro Henao, Marcos Lana", "journal": "Sustainable Agriculture Reviews", "year": "2012", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "29", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-007-5449-2_1"}, {"title": "Global assessment of agricultural system redesign for sustainable intensification", "authors": "Jules Pretty, Zareen Pervez Bharucha", "journal": "Nature Sustainability", "year": "2018", "volumes": "1", "first page": "441", "last page": "446", "DOI": "10.1038/s41893-018-0114-0"}, {"title": "Precision agriculture for sustainability and environmental protection", "authors": "Achim Walter, Robert Finger, Ruth Huber, Nina Buchmann", "journal": "Nature Sustainability", "year": "2017", "volumes": "1", "first page": "12", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1038/s41893-017-0012-1"}, {"title": "Agroecology as a transdisciplinary, participatory, and action-oriented approach", "authors": "V.
