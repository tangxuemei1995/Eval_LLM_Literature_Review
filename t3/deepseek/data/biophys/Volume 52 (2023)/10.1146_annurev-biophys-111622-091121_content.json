{"Literature Review": "Graphene and two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as revolutionary platforms for biomolecule sensing, owing to their unique physical and chemical properties. These materials offer an exceptionally large specific surface area (SSA), which is crucial for the adsorption and interaction with biomolecules, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of biosensors. The density of states (DOS) in these materials, which can be modulated by external stimuli, plays a pivotal role in the transduction of biomolecular interactions into measurable electrical signals. Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on graphene and other 2D materials have been extensively studied for their ability to detect biomolecules with high sensitivity and specificity. The principle behind these biosensors involves the modulation of the electrical charge density or current through the 2D material upon biomolecule adsorption, which can be accurately modeled using impedance models. However, the presence of defects in 2D materials, which are inevitable during synthesis and processing, can significantly influence the sensing performance. These defects can alter the electronic properties of the material, affecting the sensitivity and specificity of the biosensor. Therefore, understanding and controlling the defect density in 2D materials is crucial for the development of reliable biosensors. Standardization of the fabrication processes and calibration of the sensing results with acceptable standards are essential steps towards the widespread deployment of 2D material-based biosensors in point-of-care platforms. The potential of these biosensors to revolutionize healthcare by enabling sensitive and specific detection of biomolecules at the single-molecule level, even at zeptomolar concentrations, is immense. However, achieving specificity in complex mixtures remains a challenge that requires further research and development. The establishment of a comprehensive roadmap for the integration of 2D material-based biosensors into healthcare applications is imperative for realizing their full potential.", "References": [{"title": "Graphene-based biosensors: methods, analysis and future perspectives", "authors": "Huang, Y., Dong, X., Liu, Y., Li, L.-J., Chen, P.", "journal": "Carbon", "year": "2011", "volumes": "49", "first page": "1108", "last page": "1118", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbon.2010.11.013"}, {"title": "Two-dimensional material-based biosensors: from DNA sensing to COVID-19 diagnosis", "authors": "Zhu, C., Du, D., Lin, Y.", "journal": "Biosensors and Bioelectronics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "169", "first page": "112604", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bios.2020.112604"}, {"title": "Graphene field-effect transistors as bioanalytical sensors: design, operation and performance", "authors": "Hess, L.H., Seifert, M., Garrido, J.A.", "journal": "Materials Today", "year": "2013", "volumes": "16", "first page": "312", "last page": "322", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mattod.2013.08.009"}, {"title": "Defects in graphene: generation, healing, and their effects on the properties of graphene: a review", "authors": "Banhart, F., Kotakoski, J., Krasheninnikov, A.V.", "journal": "ACS Nano", "year": "2011", "volumes": "5", "first page": "26", "last page": "41", "DOI": "10.1021/nn102598m"}, {"title": "Impedance spectroscopy of graphene-based biosensors for the detection of DNA hybridization", "authors": "Bonanni, A., Pumera, M.", "journal": "Analyst", "year": "2011", "volumes": "136", "first page": "4581", "last page": "4586", "DOI": "10.1039/c1an15644b"}, {"title": "The role of specific surface area in determining the performance of graphene-based biosensors", "authors": "Liu, Y., Dong, X., Chen, P.", "journal": "Chemical Society Reviews", "year": "2012", "volumes": "41", "first page": "2283", "last page": "2307", "DOI": "10.1039/c1cs15270j"}, {"title": "Graphene and its derivatives for the development of solar cells, photoelectrochemical, and photocatalytic applications", "authors": "Zhang, N., Zhang, Y., Xu, Y.-J.", "journal": "Energy & Environmental Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "5", "first page": "7224", "last page": "7246", "DOI": "10.1039/c2ee21818f"}, {"title": "Standardization of biosensor development process: a review", "authors": "Turner, A.P.F.", "journal": "Biosensors and Bioelectronics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "47", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bios.2013.02.033"}, {"title": "Quantum mechanical effects in graphene-based biosensors", "authors": "Novoselov, K.S., Geim, A.K., Morozov, S.V., Jiang, D., Zhang, Y., Dubonos, S.V., Grigorieva, I.V., Firsov, A.A.", "journal": "Nature Materials", "year": "2005", "volumes": "4", "first page": "826", "last page": "832", "DOI": "10.1038/nmat1494"}, {"title": "Challenges and opportunities in graphene commercialization", "authors": "Balandin, A.A., Ghosh, S., Bao, W., Calizo, I., Teweldebrhan, D., Miao, F., Lau, C.N.", "journal": "Nature Nanotechnology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "3", "first page": "487", "last page": "491", "DOI": "10.1038/nnano.2008.232"}]}
