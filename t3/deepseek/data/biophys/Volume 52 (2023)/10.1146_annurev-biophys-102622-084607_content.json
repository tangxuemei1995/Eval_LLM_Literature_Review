{"Literature Review": "The prediction of protein structures has been a central challenge in computational biology, with significant implications for understanding biological functions and designing therapeutic interventions. The field has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly in the prediction of single protein chains, thanks to the advent of deep learning methodologies. This literature review critically assesses the methods for predicting the 3D structure of proteins and protein complexes, focusing on the contributions of community-wide blind prediction experiments such as CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) and CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions), and the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. The CASP experiments, initiated in 1994, have been instrumental in benchmarking the progress of protein structure prediction methods. These experiments have evolved over the years, incorporating more complex targets and encouraging the development of novel computational approaches. The introduction of deep learning techniques, particularly those based on neural networks, has marked a turning point in the field. AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind, represents a pinnacle of this progress, achieving unprecedented accuracy in predicting protein structures during CASP13 and CASP14. This breakthrough has been attributed to the model's ability to learn from a vast dataset of known protein structures and sequences, leveraging patterns that were previously undetectable by traditional methods. Similarly, the CAPRI experiment focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions, a more complex challenge due to the dynamic nature of protein complexes. The integration of AI methods has also begun to influence this area, with promising results in predicting the interfaces and binding affinities of protein complexes. However, challenges remain, particularly in modeling the flexibility and conformational changes of proteins upon binding. The success of AI-based methods in protein structure prediction has broader implications for computational and experimental structural biology. It has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new drugs by enabling the rapid identification of binding sites and the design of inhibitors. Moreover, these methods can complement experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, providing models that guide experimental design and interpretation. Despite these advances, several challenges need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of AI in protein structure prediction. These include the need for more diverse and comprehensive training datasets, the development of methods to predict the structures of membrane proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins, and the integration of physicochemical principles to improve the accuracy of predicted models. In conclusion, the field of protein structure prediction is undergoing a paradigm shift, driven by the integration of deep learning methodologies. The contributions of CASP and CAPRI have been pivotal in fostering this progress, providing a platform for the evaluation and comparison of prediction methods. As we move forward, the continued collaboration between computational and experimental biologists will be essential to overcome the remaining challenges and unlock the full potential of AI in structural biology.", "References": [{"title": "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold", "authors": "John Jumper, Richard Evans, Alexander Pritzel, Tim Green, Michael Figurnov, Olaf Ronneberger, Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, Russ Bates, Augustin Žídek, Anna Potapenko", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2021", "volumes": "596", "first page": "583", "last page": "589", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2"}, {"title": "Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP)—Round XIII", "authors": "Krzysztof Fidelis, John Moult, Andriy Kryshtafovych, Torsten Schwede, Anna Tramontano, David Baker, Arne Elofsson, Daniel Fischer, Michael Levitt, Gaetano T.
