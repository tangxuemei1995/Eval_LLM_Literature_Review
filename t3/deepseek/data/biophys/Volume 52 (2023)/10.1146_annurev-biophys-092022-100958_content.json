{"Literature Review": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a pivotal technique in structural biology, enabling the visualization of macromolecular complexes in their native cellular environment at near-atomic resolution. This 'resolution revolution' has been facilitated by significant advancements in cryo-ET methodologies, including improvements in sample preparation, data acquisition, and image processing techniques. Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling, in particular, has been instrumental in thinning biological specimens to an optimal thickness for cryo-ET imaging, thereby enhancing the quality of the tomograms obtained. These technological advancements have opened new avenues for in situ structural studies, particularly in the field of virology, where cryo-ET has provided unprecedented insights into the architecture and assembly mechanisms of enveloped viruses, as well as their interactions with host cells. The application of cryo-ET to study viruses in situ has revealed detailed structural information about viral components and their assembly pathways within infected cells. For instance, cryo-ET has been used to visualize the assembly of HIV-1 particles at the plasma membrane of infected cells, providing insights into the spatial organization of viral proteins during the budding process. Similarly, studies on influenza virus have utilized cryo-ET to elucidate the structural dynamics of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) during infection, shedding light on the mechanisms of viral genome packaging and replication. Beyond enveloped viruses, cryo-ET has also been applied to study the structure and assembly of non-enveloped viruses, such as rotavirus, within infected cells. These studies have highlighted the role of host cell components in viral assembly and have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the virus-host interface. Furthermore, cryo-ET has been instrumental in characterizing the structural organization of viral factories, specialized compartments within infected cells where viral replication and assembly occur. For example, cryo-ET studies on vaccinia virus have revealed the intricate architecture of viral factories and the spatial arrangement of viral and host proteins within these compartments. The integration of cryo-ET with other structural and cell biology techniques, such as correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis, has further expanded the scope of in situ structural virology. These integrative approaches have enabled the correlation of dynamic cellular processes with high-resolution structural data, providing a more holistic view of viral infection and replication. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the application of cryo-ET to virological studies, including the need for improved methods for target identification in complex cellular environments and the development of high-throughput cryo-FIB milling techniques. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for furthering our understanding of virus-host interactions and for the development of novel antiviral strategies. In conclusion, cryo-ET has revolutionized the field of structural virology by enabling the visualization of viruses in their native cellular context at unprecedented resolution. The insights gained from cryo-ET studies have significantly advanced our understanding of viral assembly, replication, and interactions with host cells, paving the way for new discoveries in virology and beyond.", "References": [{"title": "Cryo-electron tomography: the resolution revolution and its impact on virology", "authors": "Wolfgang Baumeister, Friedrich Förster, Kay Grünewald", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "14", "first page": "57", "last page": "68", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro.2015.8"}, {"title": "Advances in cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging of biological macromolecules", "authors": "Peijun Zhang, Wolfgang Baumeister", "journal": "Current Opinion in Structural Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "58", "first page": "249", "last page": "258", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sbi.2019.05.018"}, {"title": "Cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation for imaging vitreous cells by cryo-electron tomography", "authors": "Ruben Fernandez, Rafael Fernandez, Daniel Castaño-Díez", "journal": "Bio-protocol", "year": "2018", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e2889", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.21769/BioProtoc.2889"}, {"title": "Visualizing virus assembly intermediates inside marine cyanobacteria", "authors": "Elizabeth R.
