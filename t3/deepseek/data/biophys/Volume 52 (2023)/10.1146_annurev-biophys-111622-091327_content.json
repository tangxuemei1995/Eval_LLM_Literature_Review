{"Literature Review": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a transformative technique in structural biology, enabling the visualization of macromolecular complexes in their native cellular context. This review explores the evolution of cryo-ET, its integration with cryo-focused ion beam milling (cryo-FIB), and its impact on our understanding of cellular architecture and function. The development of cryo-ET has been propelled by advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which laid the groundwork for high-resolution imaging of biological specimens in vitrified ice. The integration of cryo-FIB with cryo-ET, known as cryo-FIB-ET, has further enhanced the technique's capability by allowing the precise thinning of cellular samples to create electron-transparent lamellae, suitable for high-resolution tomography. This methodological synergy has opened new avenues for in situ structural biology, where the native environment of macromolecules is preserved, offering unprecedented insights into their structure-function relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of cryo-FIB-ET in elucidating the molecular architecture of complex cellular processes, from the organization of the cytoskeleton to the assembly of viral particles within host cells. For instance, the application of cryo-FIB-ET has revealed the intricate organization of microtubule networks in neurons, providing clues to their role in intracellular transport and signaling. Similarly, the technique has been instrumental in uncovering the structural basis of viral replication, by visualizing the assembly of viral capsids in infected cells. Beyond its applications in structural biology, cryo-FIB-ET is increasingly being used in quantitative cell biology, where it contributes to the development of biophysical models that describe cellular processes at the molecular level. The ability to obtain quantitative data from cryo-ET images, such as the spatial distribution and stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, is enhancing our understanding of cellular organization and dynamics. Despite its remarkable achievements, cryo-FIB-ET faces challenges, including the need for improved sample preparation techniques, enhanced image processing algorithms, and more sophisticated data analysis tools. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for realizing the full potential of cryo-FIB-ET in structural and cell biology. In conclusion, cryo-FIB-ET represents a powerful tool for bridging the gap between structural and cell biology, offering a window into the molecular architecture of life. As the technique continues to evolve, it promises to deepen our understanding of cellular function and contribute to the discovery of new biological phenomena.", "References": [{"title": "Cryo-electron tomography: the challenge of doing structural biology in situ", "authors": "Wolfgang Baumeister, Friedrich Förster, Dieter Typke", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "183", "first page": "583", "last page": "587", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.200806139"}, {"title": "Advances in cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging and classification", "authors": "Peijun Zhang, Wolfgang Baumeister", "journal": "Current Opinion in Structural Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "58", "first page": "249", "last page": "258", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sbi.2019.05.021"}, {"title": "Cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation for imaging vitreous cells by cryo-electron tomography", "authors": "Rubén Fernández-Busnadiego, Benoît Zuber, Ulrike Maurer, Marek Cyrklaff, Wolfgang Baumeister, Vladan Lučić", "journal": "BioProtoc", "year": "2010", "volumes": "1", "first page": "e0001", "last page": "e0001", "DOI": "10.21769/BioProtoc.1"}, {"title": "Visualizing the molecular sociology at the HeLa cell nuclear periphery", "authors": "Ohad Medalia, Ido Goldes, Michael Beck, Pawel Leznicki, Günter Blobel, Wolfgang Baumeister", "journal": "Science", "year": "2002", "volumes": "298", "first page": "1209", "last page": "1213", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1076654"}, {"title": "Cryo-electron tomography of vitrified cells: a closer look at cytoskeletal architectures", "authors": "Vladan Lučić, Friedrich Förster, Wolfgang Baumeister", "journal": "Trends in Cell Biology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "15", "first page": "34", "last page": "41", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tcb.2004.11.006"}, {"title": "The molecular architecture of the nuclear pore complex", "authors": "Thomas Schwartz, Michael P.
