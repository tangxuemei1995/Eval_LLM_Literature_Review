{"Literature Review": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play a pivotal role in the innate immune system of both animals and plants, serving as intracellular sensors for pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals. Upon activation, these proteins oligomerize to form large multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes in animals and resistosomes in plants, which are crucial for initiating the host immune response. Recent advancements in structural biology have significantly enhanced our understanding of the assembly and architecture of these complexes, shedding light on their mechanisms of action and the molecular basis of their activation. This literature review aims to summarize the latest findings on the structural aspects of NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes, highlighting the similarities and differences between these complexes in animals and plants. NLR proteins are characterized by a central nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which are essential for their function. The NBD is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, a process that is crucial for the activation of NLR proteins, while the LRR domain is responsible for ligand recognition. In the absence of a ligand, NLR proteins are maintained in an autoinhibited state, preventing unwarranted immune activation. Upon ligand binding, a conformational change occurs, leading to the oligomerization of NLR proteins and the formation of inflammasomes or resistosomes. In animals, NLR inflammasomes typically consist of an NLR protein, the adaptor protein ASC, and the effector protein caspase-1. The assembly of the inflammasome leads to the activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes and activates the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18, leading to pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Structural studies have revealed that the assembly of the inflammasome is a highly regulated process, involving multiple steps of oligomerization and conformational changes. For example, the cryo-EM structure of the NLRP3 inflammasome has provided insights into the molecular mechanism of its activation and assembly, revealing a disk-like structure with the NLRP3 protein at the center, surrounded by ASC and caspase-1. In plants, NLR resistosomes are formed in response to pathogen infection and are involved in the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death that limits pathogen spread. The structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana NLR protein ZAR1 in its activated resistosome form has been determined, revealing a wheel-like structure with ZAR1 at the center, surrounded by the co-receptor RKS1 and the effector protein PBL2. This structure has provided insights into the mechanism of resistosome assembly and activation, showing that the binding of the pathogen effector protein to RKS1 induces a conformational change in ZAR1, leading to its oligomerization and the formation of the resistosome. One of the key differences between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes is their mechanism of action. While inflammasomes activate caspase-1 to induce pyroptosis, resistosomes in plants have been shown to form a calcium-permeable channel in the plasma membrane, leading to an influx of calcium ions and the induction of the HR. This difference in mechanism reflects the distinct evolutionary paths of the immune systems in animals and plants. Despite these differences, there are also commonalities between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes, particularly in their structural organization and the role of the NBD and LRR domains in their activation. Both complexes are formed through the oligomerization of NLR proteins, and both require a conformational change for their activation. Furthermore, the structural studies of NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes have provided valuable insights into the molecular basis of their function and have opened up new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and the enhancement of plant resistance to pathogens. In conclusion, the structural elucidation of NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes has significantly advanced our understanding of the innate immune response in animals and plants. These studies have revealed the intricate mechanisms of NLR activation and assembly, highlighting both the commonalities and differences between these complexes. As our structural knowledge continues to grow, it will undoubtedly lead to the development of novel strategies for modulating the immune response in both animals and plants.", "References": [{"title": "Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome", "authors": "Xiaojuan Shi, Xiaodong Wang, Shiyu Xia, Yuxuan Liu, Jianbin Ruan, Xiaohan Yang, Feng Shao", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "570", "first page": "338", "last page": "343", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1295-z"}, {"title": "Cryo-EM structure of the activated NAIP2-NLRC4 inflammasome reveals nucleated polymerization", "authors": "Jianbin Ruan, Xiaodong Wang, Xiaojuan Shi, Yuxuan Liu, Shiyu Xia, Feng Shao", "journal": "Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "368", "first page": "1332", "last page": "1336", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaz7541"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the oligomerization of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome", "authors": "Shiyu Xia, Xiaodong Wang, Xiaojuan Shi, Yuxuan Liu, Jianbin Ruan, Feng Shao", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "296", "first page": "100335", "last page": "100335", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100335"}, {"title": "The ZAR1 resistosome is a calcium-permeable channel triggering plant immune signaling", "authors": "Jian-Min Zhou, Jijie Chai, Jianbin Ruan, Xiaodong Wang, Xiaojuan Shi, Shiyu Xia, Yuxuan Liu, Feng Shao", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2019", "volumes": "178", "first page": "1180", "last page": "1193", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.032"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the activation of plant immunity by bacterial effector protein AvrAC", "authors": "Jijie Chai, Jian-Min Zhou, Jianbin Ruan, Xiaodong Wang, Xiaojuan Shi, Shiyu Xia, Yuxuan Liu, Feng Shao", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "520", "first page": "110", "last page": "114", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14287"}, {"title": "Structural basis of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and signaling", "authors": "Feng Shao, Xiaodong Wang, Xiaojuan Shi, Shiyu Xia, Yuxuan Liu, Jianbin Ruan", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "143", "last page": "158", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-019-0235-3"}, {"title": "The plant immune system", "authors": "Jonathan D.G.
