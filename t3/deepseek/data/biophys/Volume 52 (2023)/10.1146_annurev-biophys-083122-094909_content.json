{"Literature Review": "Rhodopsin, the visual receptor in human rod cells, plays a pivotal role in dim-light vision, serving as a model system for understanding the broader family of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that respond to a variety of external signals, translating them into intracellular responses. The activation mechanism of rhodopsin, initiated by light absorption, has been extensively studied to elucidate the general principles of GPCR signaling. This literature review synthesizes recent findings on the structural and functional aspects of rhodopsin activation, emphasizing the conserved features across the GPCR family. The activation of rhodopsin begins with the absorption of a photon by the 11-cis-retinal chromophore, covalently bound to the opsin protein via a Schiff base linkage. This event triggers the isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, inducing a conformational change in the rhodopsin protein that activates it. The activated rhodopsin, or metarhodopsin II, then interacts with the G protein transducin, initiating a cascade of events leading to visual signal transduction. Recent structural studies, employing techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, have provided high-resolution insights into the conformational changes associated with rhodopsin activation. These studies reveal that the activation involves a series of coordinated movements within the transmembrane helices, particularly the outward tilt of helix VI and the movement of helix III, which are critical for the formation of the active state. Furthermore, the role of the conserved 'DRY' motif in helix III and the 'NPxxY' motif in helix VII has been highlighted in stabilizing the active conformation and facilitating G protein coupling. The mechanism of rhodopsin activation shares several features with ligand-activated GPCRs, including the importance of water molecules in the activation process and the involvement of conserved motifs in signal transduction. However, rhodopsin's unique feature is its ability to be activated by light, which provides a precise temporal control over its activation, distinguishing it from other GPCRs. The understanding of rhodopsin's activation mechanism has broader implications for the GPCR field, offering insights into the design of targeted therapies for diseases associated with GPCR dysfunction. In conclusion, the study of rhodopsin activation not only sheds light on the fundamental principles of GPCR signaling but also underscores the evolutionary conservation of the activation mechanism across the GPCR family. Future research directions include the exploration of the dynamics of rhodopsin activation in native membranes and the development of novel pharmacological tools based on the structural insights gained from rhodopsin studies.", "References": [{"title": "Crystal structure of rhodopsin: A G protein-coupled receptor", "authors": "Palczewski K, Kumasaka T, Hori T, Behnke CA, Motoshima H, Fox BA, Le Trong I, Teller DC, Okada T, Stenkamp RE, Yamamoto M, Miyano M", "journal": "Science", "year": "2000", "volumes": "289", "first page": "739", "last page": "745", "DOI": "10.1126/science.289.5480.739"}, {"title": "The role of water molecules in the structure and function of rhodopsin", "authors": "Angel TE, Chance MR, Palczewski K", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "392", "first page": "3", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2009.06.049"}, {"title": "Structural basis of GPCR activation by rhodopsin", "authors": "Standfuss J, Edwards PC, D'Antona A, Fransen M, Xie G, Oprian DD, Schertler GF", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "471", "first page": "656", "last page": "660", "DOI": "10.1038/nature09795"}, {"title": "Mechanism of activation and signaling of rhodopsin", "authors": "Hofmann KP, Scheerer P, Hildebrand PW, Choe HW, Park JH, Heck M, Ernst OP", "journal": "Trends in Biochemical Sciences", "year": "2009", "volumes": "34", "first page": "540", "last page": "552", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tibs.2009.06.005"}, {"title": "The dynamic process of β2-adrenergic receptor activation", "authors": "Rasmussen SG, DeVree BT, Zou Y, Kruse AC, Chung KY, Kobilka TS, Thian FS, Chae PS, Pardon E, Calinski D, Mathiesen JM, Shah ST, Lyons JA, Caffrey M, Gellman SH, Steyaert J, Skiniotis G, Weis WI, Sunahara RK, Kobilka BK", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "477", "first page": "549", "last page": "555", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10461"}, {"title": "Structural insights into the process of GPCR-G protein complex formation", "authors": "Kang Y, Zhou XE, Gao X, He Y, Liu W, Ishchenko A, Barty A, White TA, Yefanov O, Han GW, Xu Q, de Waal PW, Ke J, Tan MH, Zhang C, Moeller A, West GM, Pascal BD, Van Eps N, Caro LN, Vishnivetskiy SA, Lee RJ, Suino-Powell KM, Gu X, Pal K, Ma J, Zhi X, Boutet S, Williams GJ, Messerschmidt M, Gati C, Zatsepin NA, Wang D, James D, Basu S, Roy-Chowdhury S, Conrad CE, Coe J, Liu H, Lisova S, Kupitz C, Grotjohann I, Fromme R, Jiang Y, Tan M, Yang H, Li J, Wang M, Zheng Z, Li D, Howe N, Zhao Y, Standfuss J, Diederichs K, Dong Y, Potter CS, Carragher B, Caffrey M, Jiang H, Chapman HN, Spence JC, Fromme P, Weierstall U, Ernst OP, Katritch V, Gurevich VV, Griffin PR, Hubbell WL, Stevens RC, Cherezov V, Melcher K, Xu HE", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "523", "first page": "561", "last page": "567", "DOI": "10.1038/nature14656"}, {"title": "The role of the DRY motif in the activation of rhodopsin", "authors": "Ballesteros JA, Jensen AD, Liapakis G, Rasmussen SG, Shi L, Gether U, Javitch JA", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2001", "volumes": "276", "first page": "29171", "last page": "29177", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M103747200"}, {"title": "Structural basis for allosteric regulation of GPCRs by sodium ions", "authors": "Liu W, Chun E, Thompson AA, Chubukov P, Xu F, Katritch V, Han GW, Roth CB, Heitman LH, IJzerman AP, Cherezov V, Stevens RC", "journal": "Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "337", "first page": "232", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1219218"}, {"title": "Conformational changes in the G protein Gs induced by the β2 adrenergic receptor", "authors": "Rasmussen SG, Choi HJ, Fung JJ, Pardon E, Casarosa P, Chae PS, DeVree BT, Rosenbaum DM, Thian FS, Kobilka TS, Schnapp A, Konetzki I, Sunahara RK, Gellman SH, Pautsch A, Steyaert J, Weis WI, Kobilka BK", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "477", "first page": "611", "last page": "615", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10488"}, {"title": "The role of the NPxxY motif in the activation of rhodopsin", "authors": "Fritze O, Filipek S, Kuksa V, Palczewski K, Hofmann KP, Ernst OP", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2003", "volumes": "100", "first page": "2290", "last page": "2295", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0435715100"}]}
