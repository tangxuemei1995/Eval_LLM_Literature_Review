{"Literature Review": "Electroporation, a technique that uses electrical fields to increase the permeability of cell membranes, has seen significant advancements over the past decade, transitioning from a laboratory tool to a clinical application. This literature review explores the recent developments in electroporation technologies, focusing on their applications from bench to clinic, including molecular biology, food sanitation, therapeutic drug uptake, gene therapy, and cancer treatment. The biophysical principles underlying electroporation are crucial for understanding how electrical fields can induce cell membrane permeabilization, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied. Research by Weaver and Chizmadzhev (1996) laid the foundational biophysical understanding of electroporation, explaining how electric pulses can create transient pores in cell membranes, allowing for the passage of molecules that would otherwise be impermeable. In the realm of molecular biology, electroporation has become a standard technique for transfection, enabling the introduction of nucleic acids into both mammalian and bacterial cells. Recent advancements have focused on improving the efficiency and specificity of transfection. For instance, the development of microfluidic devices for single-cell electroporation has allowed for precise control over the electrical field, minimizing cell damage and increasing transfection efficiency (Khine et al., 2007). In the field of food sanitation, electroporation has been explored as a non-thermal method for microbial inactivation, offering an alternative to traditional heat-based pasteurization. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of pulsed electric fields (PEF) in reducing microbial load in various food products, without compromising their nutritional and sensory qualities (Toepfl et al., 2006). Therapeutically, electroporation has been utilized to enhance drug uptake in targeted tissues, a technique known as electrochemotherapy. This approach has been particularly effective in the treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors, where the application of electric pulses increases the permeability of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents, improving treatment outcomes (Mir et al., 1991). Gene therapy represents another promising application of electroporation, with ongoing research focused on delivering therapeutic genes to target cells. The development of in vivo electroporation devices has facilitated the direct delivery of genes to tissues, offering potential treatments for genetic disorders and cancers (Heller et al., 1996). Finally, the use of electroporation for cancer treatment has evolved with the advent of pulsed field ablation (PFA), a technique that uses high-voltage electric pulses to induce cell death in tumors. PFA has shown promise in the treatment of various cancers, offering a non-thermal, minimally invasive alternative to traditional ablation techniques (Neal et al., 2019). In conclusion, the advancements in electroporation technologies over the past decade have expanded their applications from basic research to clinical practice, offering innovative solutions for molecular biology, food sanitation, drug delivery, gene therapy, and cancer treatment. The continued development of electroporation techniques, particularly in the areas of microfluidics and in vivo applications, holds great promise for the future of medicine and biotechnology.", "References": [{"title": "Theory of electroporation: A review", "authors": "Weaver, James C., Chizmadzhev, Yuri A.", "journal": "Bioelectrochemistry and Bioenergetics", "year": "1996", "volumes": "41", "first page": "135", "last page": "160", "DOI": "10.1016/S0302-4598(96)05062-3"}, {"title": "A single cell electroporation chip", "authors": "Khine, Michelle, Lau, Adrian, Ionescu-Zanetti, Cristian, Seo, Jeonggi, Lee, Luke P.", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2007", "volumes": "7", "first page": "38", "last page": "44", "DOI": "10.1039/B612568A"}, {"title": "Pulsed electric fields (PEF) for non-thermal processing of liquid foods", "authors": "Toepfl, Stefan, Heinz, Volker, Knorr, Dietrich", "journal": "European Food Research and Technology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "222", "first page": "746", "last page": "752", "DOI": "10.1007/s00217-005-0171-2"}, {"title": "Electrochemotherapy, a new antitumor treatment: first clinical trial", "authors": "Mir, Lluis M., Orlowski, Stanislas, Belehradek, Jr., Jan, Paoletti, Claude", "journal": "Comptes Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences - Series III - Sciences de la Vie", "year": "1991", "volumes": "313", "first page": "613", "last page": "618", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "In vivo gene electroinjection and expression in rat liver", "authors": "Heller, Richard, Jaroszeski, Mark, Atkin, Andrew, Moradpour, Darius, Gilbert, Richard, Wands, Jack, Nicolau, Claude", "journal": "FEBS Letters", "year": "1996", "volumes": "389", "first page": "225", "last page": "228", "DOI": "10.1016/0014-5793(96)00590-X"}, {"title": "Pulsed electric fields for cancer treatment", "authors": "Neal, Robert E., Davalos, Rafael V., Prakash, Punit", "journal": "Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment", "year": "2019", "volumes": "18", "first page": "1533033819874461", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1177/1533033819874461"}]}
