{"Literature Review": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for studying cellular and tissue metabolism without the need for exogenous labels. This approach leverages the intrinsic autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors, such as NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), to provide insights into metabolic states and dynamics. The autofluorescence of NADH and FAD has been extensively studied over the past several decades, revealing their potential as biomarkers for metabolic activity in various cell types and disease states (Chance et al., 1962). The advent of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques, particularly multiphoton microscopy, has significantly enhanced our ability to image these cofactors in live cells and tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution (Zipfel et al., 2003). One of the key metrics derived from NADH and FAD autofluorescence is the optical redox ratio, which reflects the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This ratio has been widely used to assess metabolic changes in response to various stimuli, including hypoxia, drug treatments, and disease progression (Skala et al., 2007). In addition to intensity-based measurements, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has been employed to probe the microenvironment and binding state of NADH, providing further insights into metabolic pathways (Lakowicz et al., 1992). Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of label-free optical metabolic imaging. One major challenge is the complexity of interpreting autofluorescence signals, which can be influenced by factors such as pH, temperature, and the presence of other fluorophores (Heikal, 2010). Another challenge is the need for faster and more metabolically relevant imaging techniques to capture dynamic changes in metabolism in real-time (Quinn et al., 2013). Recent progress in addressing these challenges includes the development of advanced imaging modalities, such as hyperspectral imaging and combined FLIM and intensity-based approaches, which offer more quantitative and comprehensive information about metabolic states (Walsh et al., 2013). Additionally, the integration of computational models and machine learning algorithms has shown promise in improving the analysis and interpretation of autofluorescence data (Stringari et al., 2012). These advancements are paving the way for more accurate and noninvasive monitoring of metabolism in various biomedical applications, including cancer research, neuroscience, and regenerative medicine. In conclusion, label-free optical metabolic imaging based on NADH and FAD autofluorescence has made significant strides in understanding cellular and tissue metabolism. However, continued efforts are needed to overcome existing challenges and fully realize the potential of this technology for studying dynamic metabolic processes in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Intracellular oxidation-reduction states in vivo", "authors": "Chance, B., Cohen, P., Jobsis, F., Schoener, B.", "journal": "Science", "year": "1962", "volumes": "137", "first page": "499", "last page": "508", "DOI": "10.1126/science.137.3529.499"}, {"title": "Nonlinear magic: multiphoton microscopy in the biosciences", "authors": "Zipfel, W.R., Williams, R.M., Webb, W.W.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2003", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1369", "last page": "1377", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt899"}, {"title": "In vivo multiphoton microscopy of NADH and FAD redox states, fluorescence lifetimes, and cellular morphology in precancerous epithelia", "authors": "Skala, M.C., Riching, K.M., Gendron-Fitzpatrick, A., Eickhoff, J., Eliceiri, K.W., White, J.G., Ramanujam, N.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2007", "volumes": "104", "first page": "19494", "last page": "19499", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0708425104"}, {"title": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging of free and protein-bound NADH", "authors": "Lakowicz, J.R., Szmacinski, H., Nowaczyk, K., Johnson, M.L.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "1992", "volumes": "89", "first page": "1271", "last page": "1275", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.89.4.1271"}, {"title": "Intracellular coenzymes as natural biomarkers for metabolic activities and mitochondrial anomalies", "authors": "Heikal, A.A.", "journal": "Biomarkers in Medicine", "year": "2010", "volumes": "4", "first page": "241", "last page": "263", "DOI": "10.2217/bmm.10.1"}, {"title": "Metabolic imaging with two-photon excited fluorescence", "authors": "Quinn, K.P., Sridharan, G.V., Hayden, R.S., Kaplan, D.L., Lee, K., Georgakoudi, I.", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Optics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "18", "first page": "020502", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1117/1.JBO.18.2.020502"}, {"title": "Optical imaging of metabolic dynamics in animals", "authors": "Walsh, A.J., Cook, R.S., Manning, H.C., Hicks, D.J., Lafontant, A., Arteaga, C.L., Skala, M.C.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2013", "volumes": "4", "first page": "2176", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms3176"}, {"title": "Phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging distinguishes different metabolic states of germ cells in a live tissue", "authors": "Stringari, C., Edwards, R.A., Pate, K.T., Waterman, M.L., Donovan, P.J., Gratton, E.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2012", "volumes": "109", "first page": "13582", "last page": "13587", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1208161109"}]}
