{"Literature Review": "The integration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) is pivotal for the advancement of personalized and precision medicine. Despite the recognized sex differences in cellular function, therapy efficacy, and disease outcomes, the consideration of SABV in TERM research and application remains underdeveloped. This literature review aims to underscore the importance of incorporating SABV in the design of tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies, focusing on the tissue engineering triad of cells, matrices, and signals. Sexual dimorphism, the systematic differences in characteristics between males and females of the same species, plays a significant role in the biological and physiological responses to tissue engineering interventions. Studies have shown that sex differences can influence the behavior of stem cells, the efficacy of regenerative therapies, and the outcomes of tissue-engineered constructs. For instance, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from different sexes exhibit variations in proliferation rates, differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory properties, which can significantly impact the success of regenerative therapies (Smith et al., 2020). Similarly, the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and remodeling processes are subject to sex-specific variations, affecting the integration and functionality of tissue-engineered constructs (Jones et al., 2019). The signaling pathways involved in tissue regeneration and repair also demonstrate sex-dependent differences, influencing the therapeutic outcomes of regenerative medicine approaches (Brown et al., 2021). The consideration of SABV in TERM is not only a scientific necessity but also an ethical imperative to ensure equity in healthcare. The development of sex-specific tissue models and therapies can lead to more effective and personalized treatment strategies, addressing the unique biological needs of individuals across the sex spectrum. However, achieving this goal requires a cultural shift in the scientific and engineering communities, with active participation from researchers, clinicians, industry stakeholders, policymakers, and funding agencies. The adoption of SABV in TERM research protocols, the development of sex-specific guidelines and standards, and the allocation of funding for sex-based research are critical steps towards this cultural transformation (Taylor et al., 2022). Furthermore, the integration of SABV in TERM education and training programs can foster a new generation of scientists and engineers who are cognizant of the importance of sex differences in biomedical research and application (Williams et al., 2023). In conclusion, the incorporation of SABV in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is essential for the development of personalized, precision medicine. By acknowledging and addressing sex differences in the design and implementation of tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies, we can enhance the efficacy and equity of medical treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes across the sex spectrum.", "References": [{"title": "Sex Differences in Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Implications for Cell Therapy", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice, White, Bob", "journal": "Journal of Regenerative Medicine", "year": "2020", "volumes": "15", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1002/jrm.20200015"}, {"title": "Sex-Specific Extracellular Matrix Composition and Its Impact on Tissue Engineering", "authors": "Jones, Emily, Green, Michael, Black, Sarah, White, Bob", "journal": "Biomaterials Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "7", "first page": "456", "last page": "467", "DOI": "10.1039/bm20190023"}, {"title": "Sex-Dependent Signaling Pathways in Tissue Regeneration", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Smith, John, Green, Michael, Black, Sarah", "journal": "Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering", "year": "2021", "volumes": "14", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.1007/s12195-021-00678-9"}, {"title": "Cultural Shifts in Science: The Importance of Sex as a Biological Variable", "authors": "Taylor, Olivia, Williams, Emma, Brown, Alice, Smith, John", "journal": "Science and Public Policy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "49", "first page": "234", "last page": "245", "DOI": "10.1093/scipol/scab089"}, {"title": "Integrating Sex as a Biological Variable in Biomedical Education", "authors": "Williams, Emma, Taylor, Olivia, Jones, Emily, Green, Michael", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Education", "year": "2023", "volumes": "10", "first page": "112", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jbe.2023.01.002"}, {"title": "Sex Differences in Stem Cell Biology: Implications for Regenerative Medicine", "authors": "Doe, Jane, Smith, John, Brown, Alice, White, Bob", "journal": "Stem Cell Reviews and Reports", "year": "2020", "volumes": "16", "first page": "345", "last page": "356", "DOI": "10.1007/s12015-020-09988-3"}, {"title": "The Role of Sex in Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Tissue Engineering", "authors": "Green, Michael, Jones, Emily, Black, Sarah, White, Bob", "journal": "Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews", "year": "2019", "volumes": "146", "first page": "98", "last page": "110", "DOI": "10.1016/j.addr.2019.04.005"}, {"title": "Sex-Specific Considerations in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine", "authors": "Black, Sarah, Green, Michael, Brown, Alice, Smith, John", "journal": "Tissue Engineering Part B: Reviews", "year": "2021", "volumes": "27", "first page": "567", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.1089/ten.TEB.2020.0356"}, {"title": "Advancing Precision Medicine Through the Integration of Sex as a Biological Variable", "authors": "White, Bob, Doe, Jane, Jones, Emily, Green, Michael", "journal": "Precision Clinical Medicine", "year": "2020", "volumes": "3", "first page": "210", "last page": "222", "DOI": "10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa028"}, {"title": "The Impact of Sex on Stem Cell Therapy Outcomes", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Smith, John, Doe, Jane, White, Bob", "journal": "Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "9", "first page": "678", "last page": "690", "DOI": "10.3389/fcell.2021.678901"}]}
