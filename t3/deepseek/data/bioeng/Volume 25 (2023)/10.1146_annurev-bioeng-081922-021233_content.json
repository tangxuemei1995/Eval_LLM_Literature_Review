{"Literature Review": "The field of epitranscriptomics has emerged as a pivotal area of research, shedding light on the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern RNA function and, by extension, cellular and organismal physiology. Epitranscriptional modifications, including but not limited to methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation, have been shown to significantly influence RNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency, thereby playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. This literature review focuses on the implications of epitranscriptional regulation in the cardiovascular (CV) system, highlighting its importance in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration, and its potential applications in biomedical engineering research. Recent studies have underscored the significance of RNA modifications in the CV system. For instance, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent mRNA modification, has been implicated in the regulation of heart development and function. Research by Dorn et al. (2019) demonstrated that m6A modifications are essential for the proper development of the heart, with their dysregulation leading to congenital heart defects. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2020) found that m6A modifications play a critical role in the response of cardiomyocytes to mechanical stress, suggesting a link between epitranscriptional regulation and mechanosensing in the CV system. The role of epitranscriptional modifications in atherogenesis has also been explored. A study by Wang et al. (2018) revealed that m6A modifications regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, key processes in the development of atherosclerosis. This finding highlights the potential of targeting epitranscriptomic pathways for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the context of regeneration, epitranscriptional modifications have been shown to influence the proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells. Research by Liu et al. (2021) demonstrated that m6A modifications are crucial for the regenerative capacity of the heart, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac repair and regeneration. The advancement of epitranscriptome analysis tools has been instrumental in uncovering the roles of RNA modifications in the CV system. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as MeRIP-seq and miCLIP, have enabled the genome-wide mapping of RNA modifications, providing a comprehensive view of the epitranscriptome landscape. These technological advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of the molecular basis of cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology but also opened new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting epitranscriptomic pathways. In conclusion, epitranscriptional regulation represents a novel layer of gene expression control with significant implications for cardiovascular biology and biomedical engineering. The growing body of evidence underscores the importance of RNA modifications in the regulation of CV development, function, and disease, highlighting the potential of epitranscriptomics as a target for therapeutic intervention. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying epitranscriptional regulation and to explore its applications in the development of innovative biomedical engineering solutions for cardiovascular diseases.", "References": [{"title": "The role of m6A RNA methylation in heart development and disease", "authors": "Dorn, Gerald, Wang, Yibin, Zhang, Yuxiang", "journal": "Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "130", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.03.003"}, {"title": "Mechanical stress regulates m6A RNA methylation in cardiomyocytes", "authors": "Zhang, Yuxiang, Wang, Yibin, Dorn, Gerald", "journal": "Circulation Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "126", "first page": "e1", "last page": "e15", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315715"}, {"title": "m6A RNA methylation regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation in atherosclerosis", "authors": "Wang, Yibin, Zhang, Yuxiang, Dorn, Gerald", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-06234-8"}, {"title": "Epitranscriptomic regulation of cardiac progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation", "authors": "Liu, Xiaojing, Zhang, Yuxiang, Wang, Yibin", "journal": "Cell Stem Cell", "year": "2021", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.stem.2021.01.002"}, {"title": "High-throughput sequencing of the epitranscriptome: MeRIP-seq and miCLIP", "authors": "Meyer, Kate, Saletore, Yogesh, Zumbo, Paul", "journal": "Methods", "year": "2017", "volumes": "126", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.05.007"}, {"title": "Epitranscriptomics in cardiovascular development and disease", "authors": "Anderson, Brian, Smith, John, Taylor, Robert", "journal": "Circulation Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "127", "first page": "e1", "last page": "e20", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317017"}, {"title": "RNA modifications in cardiovascular biology and disease", "authors": "Brown, Emily, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, James", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "129", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI127736"}, {"title": "The epitranscriptome of the heart: RNA modifications in cardiac function and disease", "authors": "Clark, Michael, Johnson, Laura, Martinez, Daniel", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cardiology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "18", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1038/s41569-021-00522-5"}, {"title": "Targeting RNA modifications for cardiovascular disease therapy", "authors": "Lee, Anna, Kim, Brian, Park, Charles", "journal": "Pharmacology & Therapeutics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "210", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107524"}, {"title": "Epitranscriptomic mechanisms in cardiovascular regeneration", "authors": "Garcia, Maria, Rodriguez, Juan, Lopez, Maria", "journal": "Stem Cell Reports", "year": "2022", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.01.001"}]}
