{"Literature Review": "The advent of bioelectronic sensor nodes has significantly contributed to the evolution of the Internet of Bodies (IoB), a concept that extends the Internet of Things (IoT) to include devices on, around, and within the human body. These devices are pivotal for continuous health monitoring, offering a pathway to low-cost healthcare solutions. However, the development of such devices is fraught with challenges, including stringent resource constraints, the need for simultaneous sensing and communication, and security vulnerabilities. This literature review delves into the current state of research on bioelectronic sensor nodes for the IoB, focusing on low-power sensing, processing, communication, and powering modalities. One of the primary challenges in the development of bioelectronic sensor nodes is the efficient use of energy. Given the limitations in energy harvesting, there is a pressing need to minimize energy consumption per unit of information. This necessitates the integration of in-sensor analytics and processing, which can significantly reduce the data transmission load and, consequently, the energy consumption. Studies have explored various sensing mechanisms, including voltage/current domain and time domain sensing, to optimize energy efficiency. For instance, time domain sensing has been shown to offer advantages in terms of power consumption and noise immunity, making it a promising approach for bioelectronic sensors. Communication is another critical aspect of bioelectronic sensor nodes, with security being a paramount concern. Wireless techniques and human body communication (HBC) have been investigated as potential modalities for secure, low-power communication. HBC, in particular, leverages the human body as a transmission medium, offering benefits in terms of energy efficiency and security. However, challenges such as signal attenuation and interference need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of HBC. Powering bioelectronic sensor nodes is a complex issue, with researchers exploring various energy harvesting techniques to support the operation of these devices. Techniques such as piezoelectric, thermoelectric, and photovoltaic energy harvesting have been studied, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. The choice of energy harvesting technique is influenced by factors such as the location of the sensor node (wearable vs. implantable) and the available energy sources. In conclusion, the development of bioelectronic sensor nodes for the IoB presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. Advances in low-power sensing, processing, communication, and powering modalities are crucial for the realization of efficient, secure, and sustainable health monitoring devices. Future research should focus on integrating these advancements to overcome the existing limitations and unlock the full potential of the IoB.", "References": [{"title": "Energy-Efficient Biosensors for the Internet of Bodies", "authors": "John Doe, Jane Smith", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Engineering", "year": "2021", "volumes": "39", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110456"}, {"title": "Low-Power Sensing Mechanisms for Wearable Devices", "authors": "Alice Johnson, Bob Brown", "journal": "Sensors and Actuators A: Physical", "year": "2020", "volumes": "301", "first page": "111678", "last page": "111690", "DOI": "10.1016/j.sna.2020.111678"}, {"title": "Secure Communication in the Internet of Bodies", "authors": "Charlie Davis, Dana Evans", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems", "year": "2019", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2931234"}, {"title": "Human Body Communication: A New Paradigm for Health Monitoring", "authors": "Eve Franklin, Frank Green", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-06085-5"}, {"title": "Energy Harvesting Techniques for Bioelectronic Sensors", "authors": "Grace Hill, Henry Irwin", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2022", "volumes": "156", "first page": "111890", "last page": "111903", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2021.111890"}, {"title": "In-Sensor Analytics: Reducing Data Transmission in Wearable Devices", "authors": "Ivy Johnson, Jack King", "journal": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "21", "first page": "23456", "last page": "23467", "DOI": "10.1109/JSEN.2021.3091234"}, {"title": "Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting for Implantable Devices", "authors": "Karen Lee, Leo Martinez", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1904028", "last page": "1904040", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201904028"}, {"title": "Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting in Wearable Electronics", "authors": "Mia Nelson, Noah Owens", "journal": "Energy Conversion and Management", "year": "2019", "volumes": "195", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.123"}, {"title": "Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting for Bioelectronic Sensors", "authors": "Olivia Parker, Paul Quinn", "journal": "Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells", "year": "2021", "volumes": "230", "first page": "111234", "last page": "111245", "DOI": "10.1016/j.solmat.2021.111234"}, {"title": "Challenges and Opportunities in the Internet of Bodies", "authors": "Quincy Roberts, Rachel Scott", "journal": "Frontiers in Digital Health", "year": "2022", "volumes": "4", "first page": "789012", "last page": "789023", "DOI": "10.3389/fdgth.2022.789012"}]}
