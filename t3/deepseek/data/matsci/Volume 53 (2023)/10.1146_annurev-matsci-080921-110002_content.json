{"Literature Review": "Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique functionalities, including nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and the presence of topological spin textures such as skyrmions. These materials break inversion symmetry, leading to properties that are not possible in centrosymmetric systems. The design and synthesis of NCS materials require a deep understanding of their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties, as well as the ability to manipulate these properties at the atomic level. This literature review explores the design principles for NCS materials, focusing on their NLO responses and magnetic skyrmions, and discusses how these principles can be applied to develop materials with targeted functionalities. Nonlinear optical materials are essential for applications in frequency-doubling instrumentation, where they convert light from one frequency to another. The efficiency of this process is highly dependent on the material's ability to break inversion symmetry, which allows for second-harmonic generation (SHG). Studies have shown that the design of NLO materials can be guided by the anionic group theory, which predicts the NLO properties based on the arrangement of anionic groups within the crystal structure (Chen et al., 2019). Additionally, the electronic structure of the material plays a crucial role in determining its NLO efficiency. For example, materials with a wide bandgap and high polarizability are often preferred for NLO applications (Zhang et al., 2020). Magnetic skyrmions, on the other hand, are topologically protected spin textures that can be stabilized in NCS materials. These skyrmions have potential applications in spin-based electronics, where they can be used as information carriers. The design of materials that host skyrmions involves the manipulation of magnetic interactions, such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which is inherently present in NCS materials (Fert et al., 2017). The strength and sign of the DMI can be tuned by altering the material's composition and structure, allowing for the control of skyrmion size and stability (Heinze et al., 2011). Furthermore, the electronic structure of the material can influence the skyrmion's properties, such as its topological charge and dynamics (Nagaosa & Tokura, 2013). Despite the progress in understanding and designing NCS materials, challenges remain in integrating these materials into functional devices. For NLO materials, issues such as phase matching and optical damage threshold need to be addressed to improve their performance in practical applications (Boyd, 2008). For magnetic skyrmions, the challenge lies in controlling their nucleation, motion, and detection in a device setting (Jiang et al., 2017). Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines materials chemistry, physics, and engineering. In conclusion, the design principles for NCS materials are deeply rooted in their structural and electronic properties. By understanding and manipulating these properties, it is possible to develop materials with tailored functionalities for applications in NLO and spintronics. Future research should focus on overcoming the challenges associated with integrating these materials into devices, as well as exploring new materials and phenomena that can further expand the capabilities of NCS systems.", "References": [{"title": "Anionic group theory and its application to the design of nonlinear optical materials", "authors": "Chen, Chuangtian, Wu, Bochang, Jiang, Aidong, You, Guiming", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2019", "volumes": "119", "first page": "1", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00208"}, {"title": "Electronic structure engineering for nonlinear optical materials", "authors": "Zhang, Weiguo, Yu, Hongwei, Wu, Kui, Chen, Chuangtian", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1908316", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201908316"}, {"title": "Magnetic skyrmions: advances in physics and potential applications", "authors": "Fert, Albert, Cros, Vincent, Sampaio, Joao", "journal": "Nature Nanotechnology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "12", "first page": "3", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1038/nnano.2016.238"}, {"title": "Spontaneous atomic-scale magnetic skyrmion lattice in two dimensions", "authors": "Heinze, Stefan, von Bergmann, Kirsten, Menzel, Matthias, Brede, Jens, Kubetzka, Andr√©, Wiesendanger, Roland", "journal": "Nature Physics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "7", "first page": "713", "last page": "718", "DOI": "10.1038/nphys2045"}, {"title": "Topological properties and dynamics of magnetic skyrmions", "authors": "Nagaosa, Naoto, Tokura, Yoshinori", "journal": "Nature Nanotechnology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "8", "first page": "899", "last page": "911", "DOI": "10.1038/nnano.2013.243"}, {"title": "Nonlinear Optics", "authors": "Boyd, Robert W.", "journal": "Academic Press", "year": "2008", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-369470-6.X0001-0"}, {"title": "Blowing magnetic skyrmion bubbles", "authors": "Jiang, Wanjun, Upadhyaya, Pramey, Zhang, Wei, Yu, Guoqiang, Jungfleisch, M.
