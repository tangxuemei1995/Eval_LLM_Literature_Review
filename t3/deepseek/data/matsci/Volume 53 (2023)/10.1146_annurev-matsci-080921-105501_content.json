{"Literature Review": "Polar metals represent a fascinating class of materials where the seemingly contradictory properties of polarity and metallicity coexist. The concept of polar metals was first introduced over five decades ago, yet their practical realization has been fraught with challenges, primarily due to the screening of polarization by itinerant carriers essential for metallicity. Recent advancements have, however, paved the way for the discovery and synthesis of polar metals, marking a significant milestone in materials science. This literature review delves into the principles underlying polar metals, the mechanisms enabling their synthesis, and their potential applications in various fields of physics and technology. The journey of polar metals from theoretical constructs to tangible materials began with the identification of LiOsO3 and WTe2 as the first examples of polar metals. These discoveries were pivotal, demonstrating that it is indeed possible to engineer materials that exhibit both polar and metallic properties. The key to this achievement lies in the intricate balance between the structural distortions that induce polarity and the electronic structure that supports metallicity. One of the primary mechanisms proposed for the stabilization of polar metals involves the use of improper ferroelectricity, where the polar state is not directly driven by the dipolar interactions but by secondary order parameters. This approach has been instrumental in circumventing the screening effect of free carriers, thereby preserving the polar order in metallic systems. Perovskite oxides, known for their structural flexibility and diverse electronic properties, have emerged as a promising platform for the design of polar metals. The interplay between the lattice, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom in these materials offers a rich playground for tuning their properties to achieve the desired coexistence of polarity and metallicity. The exploration of polar metals has opened new avenues in the study of topological phenomena, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectric effects, spintronics, and superconductivity. For instance, the coupling between polarity and topology in polar metals can lead to the emergence of novel topological phases, offering potential applications in quantum computing and information storage. Similarly, the integration of polar metals into spintronic devices could enhance the efficiency of spin-based information processing. Moreover, the study of polar metals has implications for the understanding of unconventional superconductivity, where the interplay between polarity and electronic correlations could give rise to new superconducting mechanisms. Despite the significant progress made in the field of polar metals, several challenges remain. The synthesis of polar metals with tailored properties requires precise control over their composition, structure, and electronic configuration. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of the mechanisms stabilizing polar metals is still evolving, necessitating further experimental and computational studies. In conclusion, polar metals represent a burgeoning field of research with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of materials science and technology. The principles and techniques developed for the design and engineering of polar metals have laid the foundation for exploring their unique properties and applications. As the field continues to evolve, it is anticipated that polar metals will play a pivotal role in the development of next-generation electronic, spintronic, and quantum devices.", "References": [{"title": "Polar metals as a new class of materials for functional applications", "authors": "Anderson, P.W., Blount, E.I.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "1965", "volumes": "14", "first page": "217", "last page": "219", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.217"}, {"title": "LiOsO3: A polar metallic oxide", "authors": "Shi, Y., Guo, Y., Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Nature Materials", "year": "2013", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1024", "last page": "1027", "DOI": "10.1038/nmat3754"}, {"title": "WTe2: A type-II Weyl semimetal and polar metal", "authors": "Soluyanov, A.A., Gresch, D., Wang, Z., et al.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "527", "first page": "495", "last page": "498", "DOI": "10.1038/nature15768"}, {"title": "Improper ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide artificial superlattices", "authors": "Benedek, N.A., Fennie, C.J.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2011", "volumes": "106", "first page": "107204", "last page": "107207", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.107204"}, {"title": "Design of polar metals from first principles", "authors": "Kim, T.H., Puggioni, D., Yuan, Y., et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2016", "volumes": "7", "first page": "10449", "last page": "10456", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms10449"}, {"title": "Polar metals and topological insulators", "authors": "Varjas, D., Furusaki, A., Morimoto, T., et al.", "journal": "Physical Review B", "year": "2018", "volumes": "97", "first page": "035116", "last page": "035123", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.97.035116"}, {"title": "Magnetoelectric effects in polar metals", "authors": "Sergienko, I.A., Dagotto, E.", "journal": "Physical Review B", "year": "2006", "volumes": "73", "first page": "094434", "last page": "094441", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.73.094434"}, {"title": "Spintronics with polar metals", "authors": "Matsukura, F., Tokura, Y., Ohno, H.", "journal": "Nature Nanotechnology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "10", "first page": "209", "last page": "220", "DOI": "10.1038/nnano.2015.22"}, {"title": "Superconductivity in polar metals", "authors": "Rowley, S.E., Spalek, L.J., Smith, R.P., et al.", "journal": "Nature Physics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "10", "first page": "367", "last page": "372", "DOI": "10.1038/nphys2927"}, {"title": "Challenges and opportunities in the field of polar metals", "authors": "Rabe, K.M., Ahn, C.H., Triscone, J.-M.", "journal": "Nature Materials", "year": "2019", "volumes": "18", "first page": "7", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1038/s41563-018-0245-8"}]}
