{"Literature Review": "Abnormal Grain Growth (AGG) represents a fascinating phenomenon in materials science, where certain grains grow significantly larger than their neighbors, leading to a heterogeneous microstructure. This process, particularly when it reaches an extreme state—where grains grow at least an order of magnitude larger than the matrix grains—has been the subject of extensive research due to its implications for material properties and performance. The mechanisms driving AGG, including the roles of grain boundary (GB) energy and mobility, have been explored through both experimental and simulation studies, offering insights into the complex interplay between these factors and the resulting microstructural outcomes. One of the key aspects of AGG is the variability in GB mobility, which has been identified as a critical factor in the growth advantage of abnormal grains. Studies have shown that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy can leave distinct morphological signatures at the abnormal/matrix interface, providing clues to the underlying mechanisms of AGG. For instance, simulations based on various formulations of the GB equation of motion have demonstrated that a certain degree of GB mobility variability is consistent with the morphological signatures observed in most reported instances of AGG, except in cases of prismatic growth. This suggests that the growth advantage of abnormal grains is not solely dependent on GB energy but is also significantly influenced by GB mobility. However, the mechanism by which this growth advantage is established and maintained as GBs advance through the matrix remains an open question. Zener pinning, a phenomenon where particles inhibit the movement of GBs, has been proposed as a potential mechanism for controlling AGG. By stabilizing the matrix grains, Zener pinning can prevent the growth of abnormal grains, thereby influencing the overall microstructure. Despite these insights, the precise conditions under which extreme AGG occurs and the factors that determine the final microstructure are still not fully understood. Further research is needed to explore the complex interactions between GB energy, mobility, and Zener pinning, as well as their combined effects on the microstructural evolution during AGG. Such studies could provide valuable guidance for the design and processing of materials with tailored microstructures and properties.", "References": [{"title": "Abnormal grain growth in metals and alloys", "authors": "Humphreys, F.
