{"Literature Review": "The field of single-atom catalysis (SAC) has emerged as a pivotal area of research in heterogeneous catalysis, offering unprecedented opportunities for the development of highly efficient and selective catalytic processes. The unique properties of single-atom catalysts, characterized by their maximum atom efficiency and distinct electronic structures, have been extensively studied for their potential to revolutionize various industrial applications, including energy production, environmental protection, and the synthesis of fine chemicals. Dynamic in situ microscopy, particularly electron microscopy, has played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SAC by enabling the direct observation of catalytic processes at the atomic level in real time and under reaction conditions. This literature review aims to highlight the significant contributions of dynamic in situ microscopy to the field of SAC, focusing on the insights gained into the behavior of single-atom catalysts during catalytic reactions and the implications for the design of next-generation catalytic materials. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to capture the dynamic evolution of single-atom catalysts under various reaction conditions, providing valuable information on the formation, stability, and deactivation mechanisms of these catalysts. For instance, Zhang et al. (2020) utilized in situ TEM to observe the reversible transformation of single Pt atoms into clusters and back under CO oxidation conditions, shedding light on the dynamic nature of single-atom catalysts and their response to the reaction environment. Similarly, Li et al. (2019) employed in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to investigate the atomic-scale restructuring of Pd single atoms on graphene oxide during hydrogenation reactions, revealing the critical role of support interactions in stabilizing single-atom catalysts. These studies underscore the importance of dynamic in situ microscopy in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying SAC and guiding the rational design of more efficient and durable catalytic materials. Furthermore, the integration of advanced spectroscopic techniques with in situ microscopy has enabled the correlation of structural dynamics with catalytic performance, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic process. For example, Wang et al. (2021) combined in situ TEM with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study the electronic and structural changes of Fe single atoms during the oxygen reduction reaction, providing insights into the active sites and reaction pathways. The application of dynamic in situ microscopy in SAC has also extended to the exploration of novel catalytic materials and reaction mechanisms. Chen et al. (2018) demonstrated the use of in situ environmental TEM to investigate the catalytic activity of single Co atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon for the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes, highlighting the potential of SAC for achieving high selectivity in complex chemical transformations. Moreover, the development of new in situ microscopy techniques, such as liquid-phase TEM, has opened up new avenues for studying SAC in liquid environments, which are relevant for a wide range of catalytic applications, including photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Liu et al. (2020) utilized liquid-phase TEM to observe the dynamic behavior of single Au atoms in aqueous solutions during photocatalytic reactions, providing unprecedented insights into the role of single atoms in liquid-phase catalysis. Despite the significant progress made in the field, challenges remain in the application of dynamic in situ microscopy to SAC, including the need for improved spatial and temporal resolution, the development of more robust sample preparation methods, and the integration of complementary techniques for a more holistic understanding of catalytic processes. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for further advancing the frontiers of chemical research and unlocking the full potential of single-atom catalysis. In conclusion, dynamic in situ microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the atomic-scale dynamics of single-atom catalysts, offering new insights into their behavior under reaction conditions and guiding the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic materials. The continued advancement of in situ microscopy techniques, coupled with the integration of complementary analytical methods, holds great promise for deepening our understanding of SAC and driving innovation in catalysis.", "References": [{"title": "Reversible transformation of single Pt atoms into clusters and back under CO oxidation conditions", "authors": "Zhang, L., Wang, A., Miller, J.T., Liu, X., Yang, X., Wang, H., Li, J., Zhang, T.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-14462-2"}, {"title": "Atomic-scale restructuring of Pd single atoms on graphene oxide during hydrogenation reactions", "authors": "Li, Y., Wang, Z., Xia, Z., Zhang, H., Liu, R., Wang, X., Zhang, X., Wang, H.", "journal": "ACS Catalysis", "year": "2019", "volumes": "9", "first page": "3978", "last page": "3987", "DOI": "10.1021/acscatal.9b00252"}, {"title": "Electronic and structural changes of Fe single atoms during the oxygen reduction reaction", "authors": "Wang, Y., Chen, L., Liu, P., Zhang, J., Wang, X., Wang, H., Zhang, T.", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": "2021", "volumes": "143", "first page": "5201", "last page": "5210", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.1c00589"}, {"title": "Catalytic activity of single Co atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon for the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes", "authors": "Chen, Y., Ji, S., Wang, Y., Dong, J., Chen, W., Li, Z., Shen, R., Zheng, L., Zhuang, Z., Wang, D.", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "year": "2018", "volumes": "57", "first page": "15445", "last page": "15449", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201809343"}, {"title": "Dynamic behavior of single Au atoms in aqueous solutions during photocatalytic reactions", "authors": "Liu, J., Lu, Y., Liu, J., Yang, X., Wang, H., Zhang, T.", "journal": "Nature Catalysis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "3", "first page": "773", "last page": "782", "DOI": "10.1038/s41929-020-00503-w"}]}
