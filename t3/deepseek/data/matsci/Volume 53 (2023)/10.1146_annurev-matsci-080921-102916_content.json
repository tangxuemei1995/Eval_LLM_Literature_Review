{"Literature Review": "The field of soft robotics has emerged as a promising avenue to bridge the gap between artificial and biological systems, leveraging the inherent properties of soft, actuatable materials to achieve physical intelligence. This intelligence is characterized by traits such as passive adaptability and morphological computation, which are naturally found in living organisms. However, the development of soft robots faces significant challenges, particularly in the selection of materials that can provide high-performance and energy-efficient actuation. Electrically controllable materials have been identified as key components in overcoming these challenges, offering the potential for soft machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent. This literature review focuses on the progress in the development of electroprogrammable materials for soft robotic actuation, with an emphasis on thermomechanical, electrostatic, and electrochemical strategies that are directly controlled by electric currents and fields. Thermomechanical actuation involves materials that change shape or size in response to temperature changes, which can be induced by electric currents. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) and polymers (SMPs) are prominent examples of such materials, offering high force and displacement capabilities. However, their relatively slow response times and energy inefficiency have prompted research into alternative materials and mechanisms. Electrostatic actuation, on the other hand, relies on the attraction or repulsion between charged surfaces to produce motion. Dielectric elastomers (DEs) have been widely studied for their large strains, high energy density, and fast response times. Despite these advantages, DEs require high operating voltages, which poses challenges for integration into soft robotic systems. Electrochemical actuation strategies exploit the movement of ions within a material in response to an electric field, leading to changes in volume or shape. Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) and conducting polymers are notable examples, offering the potential for low-voltage operation and compatibility with aqueous environments. However, issues related to durability and scalability remain to be addressed. Recent advancements in material science and fabrication techniques have led to the development of multifunctional materials that combine actuation, sensing, and even energy storage capabilities. These materials hold the promise of enabling true bioinspired autonomy in soft robots, by integrating multiple functionalities into a single, cohesive system. Looking ahead, the design and fabrication of next-generation robotic materials will require a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from materials science, robotics, and biology. The ultimate goal is to create soft machines that can seamlessly interact with their environment, adapt to changing conditions, and perform complex tasks with minimal external control. In conclusion, electrically controllable materials are at the forefront of soft robotics research, offering a pathway to achieving machines that are both physically and computationally intelligent. By continuing to explore and innovate in the development of these materials, the field of soft robotics can move closer to realizing the vision of bioinspired autonomy.", "References": [{"title": "Soft Robotics: A Perspective—Current Trends and Prospects for the Future", "authors": "George M.
