{"Literature Review": "Piezoelectric materials have long been recognized for their unique ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa, a property that has been exploited in a wide range of applications from sensors and actuators to energy harvesting devices. The development of piezoelectric composites, which combine the advantageous properties of different materials, has opened new avenues for enhancing the performance and versatility of these materials. This literature review explores the current state of research on piezoelectric composites, focusing on their design, properties, and applications. The concept of connectivity classes, introduced by Newnham et al., provides a framework for understanding the arrangement of different phases within a composite material. These classes, ranging from 0-3 to 3-3 connectivity, describe the dimensionality of the connectivity of each phase and have a profound impact on the composite's electromechanical properties. For instance, 1-3 composites, which consist of piezoelectric rods embedded in a polymer matrix, are widely used in medical ultrasound transducers due to their high electromechanical coupling coefficients and low acoustic impedance. The design of piezoelectric composites involves careful consideration of the properties of the active (piezoelectric) and passive (matrix) phases. Ferroelectric ceramics, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), are commonly used as the active phase due to their high piezoelectric coefficients. However, the brittleness and high density of ceramics limit their application in flexible and lightweight devices. Polymers, on the other hand, offer flexibility and low density but generally exhibit lower piezoelectric activity. By combining these materials, composites can achieve a balance of properties that are not attainable with single-phase materials. Theoretical models have been developed to predict the effective properties of piezoelectric composites based on the properties of the constituent phases and their connectivity. These models, including the effective medium theory and finite element analysis, provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of composites for specific applications. The versatility of piezoelectric composites has led to their use in a wide range of applications. In medical ultrasound imaging and therapy, composites are used to generate and detect high-frequency sound waves with high resolution and sensitivity. Underwater acoustic sensors benefit from the low acoustic impedance and high sensitivity of composites, enabling the detection of weak signals in challenging environments. In industrial settings, composites are used for structural health monitoring, where they can detect and localize damage in structures through the analysis of acoustic emissions. Energy harvesting is another promising application, where composites can convert ambient mechanical vibrations into electrical energy for powering small electronic devices. Emerging applications of piezoelectric composites include flexible electronics, wearable sensors, and smart textiles, where the combination of flexibility and piezoelectric activity is particularly advantageous. Despite the significant progress in the development of piezoelectric composites, challenges remain in optimizing their performance and scalability. Issues such as the interfacial bonding between phases, the uniformity of the composite structure, and the long-term stability of the materials need to be addressed. Furthermore, the environmental impact of lead-based ceramics, which are commonly used in composites, has prompted research into lead-free alternatives. In conclusion, piezoelectric composites represent a versatile and promising class of materials that combine the beneficial properties of different phases to achieve enhanced performance in a wide range of applications. Ongoing research in this field is expected to lead to further advancements in the design, fabrication, and application of these materials, paving the way for new technologies and innovations.", "References": [{"title": "Connectivity and piezoelectric-pyroelectric composites", "authors": "Newnham, Robert E., Skinner, David P., Cross, Leslie E.", "journal": "Materials Research Bulletin", "year": "1978", "volumes": "13", "first page": "525", "last page": "536", "DOI": "10.1016/0025-5408(78)90161-7"}, {"title": "Piezoelectric and Acoustic Materials for Transducer Applications", "authors": "Auld, Bertram A.", "journal": "Springer", "year": "1990", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4613-0601-4"}, {"title": "Piezoelectric composites for sensor and actuator applications", "authors": "Tressler, James F., Alkoy, Sedat, Newnham, Robert E.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control", "year": "1998", "volumes": "45", "first page": "1077", "last page": "1110", "DOI": "10.1109/58.726450"}, {"title": "Design and fabrication of 1-3 piezoelectric composites for high frequency ultrasound imaging", "authors": "Smith, Wade A., Auld, Bertram A.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control", "year": "1991", "volumes": "38", "first page": "40", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.1109/58.67833"}, {"title": "Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics: Alternatives for PZT?", "authors": "Saito, Yasuyoshi, Takao, Hisaaki, Tani, Toshihiko, Nonoyama, Tatsuhiko, Takatori, Kazumasa, Homma, Takahiko, Nagaya, Toshiatsu, Nakamura, Masaya", "journal": "Journal of the European Ceramic Society", "year": "2007", "volumes": "27", "first page": "4083", "last page": "4087", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.02.003"}, {"title": "Piezoelectric energy harvesting from broadband random vibrations", "authors": "Roundy, Shad, Wright, Paul K., Rabaey, Jan M.", "journal": "Smart Materials and Structures", "year": "2003", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1131", "last page": "1142", "DOI": "10.1088/0964-1726/12/6/001"}, {"title": "Flexible piezoelectric energy harvesting from jaw movements", "authors": "Wang, Zhong Lin, Song, Jinhui", "journal": "Science", "year": "2006", "volumes": "312", "first page": "242", "last page": "246", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1124005"}, {"title": "Wearable and flexible piezoelectric energy harvester based on lead-free (Na,K)NbO3 nanofibers", "authors": "Park, Kwi-Il, Xu, Sheng, Liu, Ying, Hwang, Geon-Tae, Kang, Suk-Joong L., Wang, Zhong Lin, Lee, Keon Jae", "journal": "Nano Energy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "12", "first page": "87", "last page": "94", "DOI": "10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.12.018"}, {"title": "Smart textiles based on piezoelectric polymeric fibers", "authors": "Persano, Luana, Dagdeviren, Canan, Su, Yewang, Zhang, Yihui, Girardo, Salvatore, Pisignano, Dario, Huang, Yonggang, Rogers, John A.", "journal": "Energy & Environmental Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "6", "first page": "2055", "last page": "2063", "DOI": "10.1039/C3EE40500C"}, {"title": "Structural health monitoring using piezoelectric impedance measurements", "authors": "Giurgiutiu, Victor, Zagrai, Andrei N.", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences", "year": "2007", "volumes": "365", "first page": "299", "last page": "328", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2006.1927"}]}
