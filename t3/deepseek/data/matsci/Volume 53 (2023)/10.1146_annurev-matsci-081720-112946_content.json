{"Literature Review": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have been extensively studied for their role in crystal morphology engineering, primarily in the context of solution growth. These additives function by selectively binding to specific crystal faces through stereo-chemical recognition, thereby influencing the growth kinetics and final morphology of the crystals. The application of TMAs in melt crystallization, however, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities, primarily due to the differences in the thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic parameters between solution and melt growth. In solution crystallization, the driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which is a measure of the deviation from equilibrium. In contrast, melt crystallization is driven by undercooling, the degree to which the temperature is below the melting point of the substance. This fundamental difference can significantly impact the effectiveness and behavior of TMAs in melt crystallization processes. One of the key aspects of TMAs in melt crystallization is their ability to influence the growth kinetics and morphology of crystals under varying degrees of undercooling. At low undercooling, where the driving force for crystallization is small and diffusion rates are relatively high, TMAs can exert a pronounced influence on the growth of well-faceted single crystals. This scenario is somewhat analogous to solution growth, where the stereochemical richness of TMAs can be effectively utilized to control crystal morphology. However, under conditions of high undercooling, the crystallization driving force is significantly larger, leading to the rapid growth of crystal ensembles, often in the form of spherulites. In such cases, the stereochemical information imparted by TMAs can be masked, necessitating the development of new optical tools and techniques to understand and control the influence of TMAs on the emerging crystals. The role of TMAs in enantioselective surface recognition and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes in melt-grown crystals is another area of significant interest. In solution growth, TMAs have been successfully used to induce chiral symmetry breaking and to control the handedness of chiral crystals. Extending this capability to melt crystallization requires a deep understanding of the interactions between TMAs and the growing crystal surfaces under the specific thermodynamic and kinetic conditions of melt growth. Recent studies have demonstrated that TMAs can indeed influence the chirality and polarity of melt-grown crystals, although the mechanisms involved may differ from those in solution growth. For instance, the formation of twisted crystals, which exhibit a helical morphology, has been observed in the presence of certain TMAs during melt crystallization. This phenomenon is thought to arise from the interplay between the chiral nature of the TMAs and the growth kinetics of the crystals under specific undercooling conditions. The ability to control the formation of twisted crystals using TMAs opens up new possibilities for the design and fabrication of chiral materials with tailored optical and mechanical properties. Despite the promising potential of TMAs in melt crystallization, several challenges remain to be addressed. One of the primary challenges is the limited understanding of the interactions between TMAs and the growing crystal surfaces under the dynamic conditions of melt growth. Unlike solution growth, where the solute concentration and supersaturation can be precisely controlled, melt crystallization involves complex thermal gradients and rapid changes in the local environment, which can affect the behavior of TMAs. Additionally, the high viscosity of melts can hinder the diffusion of TMAs to the crystal surfaces, potentially limiting their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, further research is needed to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing the interactions between TMAs and melt-grown crystals. Advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ microscopy and spectroscopy, can provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes occurring at the crystal-melt interface. Moreover, computational modeling and simulation can aid in the rational design of TMAs with optimized properties for specific melt crystallization applications. In conclusion, the use of tailor-made additives in melt crystallization offers exciting opportunities for the control of crystal morphology, chirality, and polarity. While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of TMAs in solution growth, their application in melt crystallization is still in its infancy. Addressing the challenges associated with melt growth and developing new strategies for the effective use of TMAs will be crucial for unlocking their full potential in the design and fabrication of advanced crystalline materials.", "References": [{"title": "Crystal Engineering: From Molecules and Crystals to Materials", "authors": "Gautam R.
