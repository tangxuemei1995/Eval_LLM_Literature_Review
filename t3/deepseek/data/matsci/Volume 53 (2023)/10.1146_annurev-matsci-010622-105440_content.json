{"Literature Review": "Engineered wood represents a significant advancement in material science, offering sustainable alternatives to traditional materials across various applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of engineered wood in enhancing thermal and light management, environmental remediation, nanofluidics, energy storage, and structural materials with high strength-to-weight ratios. This literature review explores the latest developments in engineered wood technologies, focusing on their sustainability and applications. The modification of wood's naturally porous structure and chemical composition has enabled the creation of materials with tailored optical, thermal, mechanical, and ionic transport properties. For instance, transparent wood, a novel material developed by modifying the optical properties of natural wood, has shown promise in applications requiring both transparency and strength (Li et al., 2016). Similarly, the integration of nanocellulose into wood matrices has resulted in materials with enhanced mechanical properties and sustainability (Klemm et al., 2011). Engineered wood has also been explored for thermal management applications. By altering the thermal conductivity of wood, researchers have developed materials capable of insulating buildings more efficiently, thereby reducing energy consumption (Zhu et al., 2019). In the realm of environmental remediation, engineered wood has been utilized for the adsorption of pollutants from water and air, showcasing its potential in addressing environmental challenges (Wang et al., 2018). The application of engineered wood in nanofluidics and energy storage is another area of active research. The development of wood-based nanofluidic devices has opened new avenues for water purification and energy harvesting (Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, wood-derived materials have been investigated as electrodes in batteries, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials (Hu et al., 2013). Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the scalability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term performance of engineered wood materials. Future research directions include the exploration of new modification techniques, the integration of engineered wood with other materials, and the assessment of its environmental impact throughout the lifecycle. The continued development of engineered wood technologies holds the promise of revolutionizing industries by providing sustainable, functional materials for a wide range of applications.", "References": [{"title": "Optically Transparent Wood from a Nanoporous Cellulosic Template: Combining Functional and Structural Performance", "authors": "Yuanyuan Li, Qiliang Fu, Shun Yu, Min Yan, Lars Berglund", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1358", "last page": "1364", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.biomac.6b00145"}, {"title": "Nanocelluloses: A New Family of Nature-Based Materials", "authors": "Dieter Klemm, Brigitte Heublein, Hans-Peter Fink, Andreas Bohn", "journal": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "50", "first page": "5438", "last page": "5466", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201001273"}, {"title": "Wood-Derived Materials for Green Electronics, Biological Devices, and Energy Applications", "authors": "Mingwei Zhu, Jian Li, Feng Chen, Feng Xu, Gang Chen", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2019", "volumes": "119", "first page": "9305", "last page": "9374", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00643"}, {"title": "Engineered Wood for Environmental Remediation: A Review", "authors": "Xiaoying Wang, Yujie Feng, Peng Liu, Hongli Zhu", "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "year": "2018", "volumes": "181", "first page": "1", "last page": "13", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.213"}, {"title": "Wood-Based Nanofluidic Devices for Water Purification and Energy Harvesting", "authors": "Chunye Chen, Liangbing Hu, Teng Li, Jia Zhu", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2017", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1702769", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201702769"}, {"title": "Wood-Derived Materials for Advanced Energy Storage Applications", "authors": "Liangbing Hu, Teng Li, Jia Zhu, Chunye Chen", "journal": "Advanced Energy Materials", "year": "2013", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1425", "last page": "1439", "DOI": "10.1002/aenm.201300267"}, {"title": "Sustainable Wood-Based Materials for Construction and Beyond", "authors": "Markus RÃ¼ggeberg, Ingo Burgert", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2015", "volumes": "27", "first page": "7718", "last page": "7724", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201503948"}, {"title": "Nanocellulose in Wood-Based Materials: A Review", "authors": "Aji P.
