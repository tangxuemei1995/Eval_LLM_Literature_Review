{"Literature Review": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for the dynamic control of electronic and magnetic properties in various material systems. This method leverages the application of an electric field to modulate the carrier density at the surface of a material, leading to significant changes in its physical properties. The versatility of ionic gating is demonstrated through its application in transition metal oxides, magnetic thin-film heterostructures, and van der Waals 2D materials, each offering unique opportunities for property manipulation and device innovation. Transition metal oxides, known for their rich electronic phase diagrams, have been extensively studied under ionic gating. For instance, the reversible control of metal-insulator transitions in VO2 and the induction of superconductivity in SrTiO3 have been achieved, showcasing the potential of ionic gating in exploring new electronic states (Aetukuri et al., 2013; Ueno et al., 2008). Magnetic thin-film heterostructures also benefit from ionic gating, with studies demonstrating the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the induction of magnetic phase transitions in materials such as Co and Fe (Matsukura et al., 2015; Bauer et al., 2012). These findings highlight the potential of ionic gating in the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices. Van der Waals 2D materials, with their atomically thin nature and strong electrostatic tunability, represent another promising platform for ionic gating. The ability to control the electronic properties of graphene, MoS2, and other 2D materials through ionic gating has opened new avenues for the design of flexible and transparent electronic devices (Radisavljevic et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2012). Moreover, the application of ionic gating in neuromorphic computing is gaining attention, with research focusing on the emulation of synaptic plasticity and the development of artificial neural networks based on ionic gating-controlled devices (Zhu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the scalability, stability, and integration of ionic gating-based devices into existing technologies. Future research directions include the exploration of new electrolyte materials, the development of more robust gating architectures, and the investigation of the long-term effects of ionic gating on material properties. In conclusion, ionic gating offers a versatile and energy-efficient approach to the manipulation of electronic and magnetic properties, with significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic, spintronic, and neuromorphic devices.", "References": [{"title": "Control of the metal–insulator transition in vanadium dioxide by modifying orbital occupancy", "authors": "Nagarajan B.
