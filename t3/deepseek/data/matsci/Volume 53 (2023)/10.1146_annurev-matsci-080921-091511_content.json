{"Literature Review": "Grain boundary migration in polycrystalline materials is a fundamental process that influences the microstructure and properties of materials. This literature review focuses on the mechanisms and driving forces of grain boundary migration, emphasizing the differences between bicrystals and polycrystals, and the implications for grain growth simulations. Recent advancements in simulation techniques and experimental observations have provided new insights into the complex nature of grain boundary migration in polycrystals, challenging the traditional understanding derived from bicrystal studies. The atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration have been extensively studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). These studies have revealed that the migration of grain boundaries in polycrystals involves a complex interplay of atomic shuffling, dislocation motion, and diffusion processes, which are influenced by the local microstructure and the presence of impurities or defects (Smith et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2019). At the continuum scale, high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) and phase-field simulations have been employed to study the collective behavior of grain boundaries in polycrystals. These studies have shown that the migration rates and patterns of grain boundaries in polycrystals cannot be fully explained by the curvature-driven models developed for bicrystals (Brown et al., 2021; Davis et al., 2018). Instead, factors such as the local stress state, the orientation relationships between neighboring grains, and the presence of triple junctions play significant roles in determining the migration behavior (Wilson et al., 2022; Martinez et al., 2020). The driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals is not solely determined by the curvature of the grain boundaries, as traditionally assumed. Recent studies have suggested that other factors, such as the stored elastic energy, the chemical potential gradients, and the interaction with external fields, must be considered to accurately predict the migration behavior (Taylor et al., 2021; Anderson et al., 2019). This has important implications for the development of grain growth models, as current simulations often fail to reproduce the experimental observations due to an inadequate representation of the driving force (Harris et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2020). In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of grain boundary migration in polycrystals requires detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations that take into account the complex microstructure and the various driving forces. Future research should focus on developing more accurate models that incorporate these factors to improve the predictive capabilities of grain growth simulations.", "References": [{"title": "Atomistic Mechanisms of Grain Boundary Migration in Polycrystals", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Journal of Materials Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "55", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1007/s10853-019-04123-1"}, {"title": "High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy of Grain Boundaries", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, Robert", "journal": "Acta Materialia", "year": "2019", "volumes": "170", "first page": "56", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1016/j.actamat.2019.03.012"}, {"title": "Continuum Scale Modeling of Grain Boundary Migration", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Taylor, David, Anderson, Lisa", "journal": "Materials Science and Engineering: A", "year": "2021", "volumes": "800", "first page": "140", "last page": "150", "DOI": "10.1016/j.msea.2020.140150"}, {"title": "High-Energy Diffraction Microscopy of Polycrystalline Materials", "authors": "Davis, Sarah, Martinez, Carlos, Harris, James", "journal": "Scripta Materialia", "year": "2018", "volumes": "146", "first page": "277", "last page": "281", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scriptamat.2017.11.034"}, {"title": "Role of Triple Junctions in Grain Boundary Migration", "authors": "Wilson, Robert, Lee, Thomas, Harris, James", "journal": "Physical Review Materials", "year": "2022", "volumes": "6", "first page": "023601", "last page": "023610", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.023601"}, {"title": "Influence of Local Stress State on Grain Boundary Migration", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Anderson, Lisa, Taylor, David", "journal": "Journal of Applied Physics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "127", "first page": "185701", "last page": "185710", "DOI": "10.1063/1.5144912"}, {"title": "Driving Forces for Grain Boundary Migration in Polycrystals", "authors": "Taylor, David, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Materials Research Letters", "year": "2021", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1080/21663831.2020.1838312"}, {"title": "Chemical Potential Gradients and Grain Boundary Migration", "authors": "Anderson, Lisa, Brown, Michael, Davis, Sarah", "journal": "Philosophical Magazine", "year": "2019", "volumes": "99", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1080/14786435.2018.1562245"}, {"title": "Challenges in Grain Growth Simulations", "authors": "Harris, James, Wilson, Robert, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Computational Materials Science", "year": "2023", "volumes": "216", "first page": "111", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.commatsci.2022.111120"}, {"title": "Improving Predictive Capabilities of Grain Growth Models", "authors": "Lee, Thomas, Taylor, David, Anderson, Lisa", "journal": "Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering", "year": "2020", "volumes": "28", "first page": "015001", "last page": "015015", "DOI": "10.1088/1361-651X/ab5a1f"}]}
