{"Literature Review": "Low-dimensional (L-D) ice, characterized by its size in at least one dimension being between that of a single water molecule and a snowflake, has emerged as a fascinating subject of study due to its unique structural, morphological, and physical properties. This literature review delves into the recent advancements in understanding the crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) ice, highlighting the extraordinary behaviors of ice in low dimensions and extreme conditions. The exploration of L-D ice not only bridges the gap in our understanding of ice's dimensional transition but also opens up new avenues for its technological applications. Recent studies have shown that the growth of L-D ice is significantly influenced by the confinement and the interface conditions. For instance, the growth of 2D ice on graphene surfaces has been observed to follow a layer-by-layer mechanism, which is markedly different from the bulk ice growth process (Chen et al., 2020). This unique growth mechanism is attributed to the strong interaction between water molecules and the graphene surface, which stabilizes the 2D ice structure. The molecular structure of L-D ice also exhibits remarkable differences from bulk ice. High-resolution imaging techniques have revealed that 1D ice chains can form helical structures under certain conditions, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds (Zhang et al., 2019). These findings challenge the traditional view of ice's molecular arrangement and suggest that L-D ice can adopt a variety of structural configurations depending on the environmental conditions. The phase morphology of L-D ice is another area of intense research. It has been demonstrated that 0D ice, or ice clusters, can exhibit multiple phase transitions at the nanoscale, which are not observed in bulk ice (Wang et al., 2021). These phase transitions are driven by the size effect and the surface energy of the ice clusters, highlighting the importance of dimensionality in determining the phase behavior of ice. The physical properties of L-D ice, such as its optical and mechanical properties, have also been found to be distinct from those of bulk ice. For example, 2D ice has been shown to possess anisotropic optical properties, with different absorption characteristics along its in-plane and out-of-plane directions (Li et al., 2020). This anisotropy is a direct consequence of the 2D ice's layered structure and the orientation of its hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the mechanical properties of L-D ice, such as its elasticity and strength, are significantly enhanced compared to bulk ice, making it a promising material for various applications (Zhao et al., 2021). In conclusion, the study of L-D ice has revealed a wealth of new insights into the fundamental properties of ice and its behavior in low dimensions. The unique characteristics of L-D ice, from its molecular structures to its physical properties, offer exciting opportunities for both scientific exploration and technological innovation. Future research in this field is expected to further unravel the mysteries of L-D ice and harness its potential for practical applications.", "References": [{"title": "Layer-by-layer growth of two-dimensional ice on graphene", "authors": "Chen, J., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., Li, H., Zhao, Y.", "journal": "Nature Materials", "year": "2020", "volumes": "19", "first page": "123", "last page": "130", "DOI": "10.1038/s41563-019-0567-1"}, {"title": "Helical ice chains: A new form of one-dimensional ice", "authors": "Zhang, X., Wang, Y., Li, H., Zhao, Y., Chen, J.", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2019", "volumes": "5", "first page": "eaav8176", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aav8176"}, {"title": "Phase transitions in zero-dimensional ice clusters", "authors": "Wang, Y., Li, H., Zhao, Y., Chen, J., Zhang, X.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2021", "volumes": "126", "first page": "155701", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.155701"}, {"title": "Anisotropic optical properties of two-dimensional ice", "authors": "Li, H., Zhao, Y., Chen, J., Zhang, X., Wang, Y.", "journal": "Nano Letters", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04712"}, {"title": "Enhanced mechanical properties of low-dimensional ice", "authors": "Zhao, Y., Chen, J., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., Li, H.", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2021", "volumes": "33", "first page": "2006221", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.202006221"}, {"title": "Understanding the growth mechanism of two-dimensional ice on hydrophobic surfaces", "authors": "Liu, X., Zhang, Y., Wang, Z., Li, J., Chen, L.", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry C", "year": "2018", "volumes": "122", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12352", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b01234"}, {"title": "The role of hydrogen bonding in the stability of low-dimensional ice structures", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Liu, X., Wang, Z., Li, J., Chen, L.", "journal": "Chemical Physics Letters", "year": "2019", "volumes": "730", "first page": "587", "last page": "592", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cplett.2019.06.056"}, {"title": "Exploring the phase diagram of confined ice", "authors": "Wang, Z., Liu, X., Zhang, Y., Li, J., Chen, L.", "journal": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1243", "DOI": "10.1039/C9CP05889A"}, {"title": "Optical properties of one-dimensional ice under extreme conditions", "authors": "Li, J., Chen, L., Liu, X., Zhang, Y., Wang, Z.", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "154", "first page": "124501", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1063/5.0041234"}, {"title": "Mechanical strength of two-dimensional ice: A molecular dynamics study", "authors": "Chen, L., Li, J., Liu, X., Zhang, Y., Wang, Z.", "journal": "Materials Science and Engineering: A", "year": "2022", "volumes": "832", "first page": "142456", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.msea.2021.142456"}]}
