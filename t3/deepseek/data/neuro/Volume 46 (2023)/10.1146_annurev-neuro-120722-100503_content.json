{"Literature Review": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues plays a pivotal role in the cerebral cortex's processing of sensory information, particularly in the domains of spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception. This literature review delves into the mechanisms and significance of vestibulo-visual integration, highlighting recent findings and identifying gaps in our understanding. The vestibular system, traditionally associated with balance and spatial orientation, has been increasingly recognized for its contributions to higher cognitive functions, including sensory perception and decision-making. Recent studies employing novel experimental approaches in rodents have shed light on the physiological and behavioral implications of vestibular signals, emphasizing their integration with visual information to enhance the cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. One of the key findings is that vestibulo-visual integration facilitates a continuous update on the status of self-motion, which the cortex utilizes for sensory perception and predictions essential for rapid, navigation-related decision-making. This process is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and ensuring accurate spatial navigation. The cerebral cortex's ability to integrate vestibular and visual cues is supported by a network of cortical circuits that process and combine these sensory inputs. Research has identified specific cortical areas, such as the posterior parietal cortex and the medial superior temporal area, as critical nodes in the vestibulo-visual integration network. These areas are involved in processing spatial information and coordinating movements based on sensory inputs. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the integration of vestibular and visual cues enhances perceptual stability and accuracy, particularly in conditions of sensory conflict or ambiguity. This multisensory integration mechanism allows for a more robust and reliable perception of the environment, which is essential for effective navigation and interaction with the surroundings. Despite these advances, several knowledge gaps remain. The precise neural mechanisms underlying vestibulo-visual integration, including the specific cortical circuits and synaptic processes involved, are not fully understood. Additionally, the extent to which these integrated signals influence higher cognitive functions, such as memory and decision-making, warrants further investigation. Future research should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and explore the potential implications for understanding and treating disorders related to sensory integration and spatial navigation. In conclusion, the integration of vestibular and visual cues is a fundamental process that underpins the cerebral cortex's ability to navigate and perceive the environment accurately. By continuously updating the status of self-motion and combining sensory inputs, the cortex ensures perceptual stability and facilitates rapid, informed decision-making. As research in this field progresses, it will be crucial to address the remaining knowledge gaps and further explore the complex interplay between vestibular and visual systems in the brain.", "References": [{"title": "Vestibular contributions to high-level sensorimotor functions", "authors": "Dora E.
