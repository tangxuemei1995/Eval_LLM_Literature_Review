{"Literature Review": "Context-dependent learning is a fundamental aspect of cognition, enabling organisms to adapt their behavior based on the surrounding environment. This process involves the creation, updating, and expression of memories in a manner that is contingent upon the context. Recent computational modeling advances have highlighted a previously overlooked challenge in context-dependent learning: the inherent uncertainty of context in naturalistic conditions, which necessitates contextual inference. This literature review explores the computational and neural bases of context-dependent learning, focusing on the role of contextual inference and its implications for understanding continual learning in the brain.\n\nAt the heart of context-dependent learning is the ability to infer the current context from ambiguous sensory inputs. Bayesian inference provides a mathematical framework for understanding how the brain might achieve this, by updating beliefs about the context based on prior knowledge and new evidence. Studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in contextual inference, integrating information from various sources to guide decision-making and behavior. The PFC's ability to represent and manipulate abstract information makes it ideally suited for this task, allowing for flexible adaptation to changing contexts.\n\nThe hippocampus is another key player in context-dependent learning, particularly in the formation and retrieval of context-specific memories. Research has demonstrated that the hippocampus encodes contextual information in a way that supports the discrimination between different contexts, facilitating the appropriate retrieval of memories. This process is thought to involve pattern separation and completion mechanisms, which enable the hippocampus to distinguish between similar contexts and retrieve the correct memory based on partial cues.\n\nMotor cortices also contribute to context-dependent learning, by translating contextual information into appropriate motor responses. Studies have shown that the motor cortex can adapt its activity based on the context, enabling the execution of context-specific behaviors. This adaptability is crucial for learning new motor skills and for modifying existing ones in response to changes in the environment.\n\nThe thalamus, often considered a relay station for sensory information, has also been implicated in context-dependent learning. Recent findings suggest that the thalamus plays a role in modulating the flow of information between different brain regions, based on the context. This modulation is thought to facilitate the integration of sensory information with contextual cues, supporting the inference of the current context.\n\nContextual inference is not only essential for understanding context-dependent learning but also for continual learning in the brain. Continual learning refers to the ability to learn new information without forgetting previously learned information, a challenge that is particularly relevant in dynamic environments. Theoretical models suggest that contextual inference could provide a mechanism for continual learning, by allowing the brain to dynamically update its representations of the world based on new information, while preserving old knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, the computational and neural bases of context-dependent learning involve a complex interplay between multiple brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, motor cortices, and thalamus. Contextual inference emerges as a core component of this process, enabling the brain to navigate the uncertainty inherent in naturalistic conditions. This theory-driven perspective not only organizes a wide range of experimental observations into a coherent framework but also highlights the importance of contextual inference in understanding continual learning in the brain.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the prefrontal cortex in context-dependent learning", "authors": "Miller Earl K, Cohen Jonathan D", "journal": "Annual Review of Neuroscience", "year": "2001", "volumes": "24", "first page": "167", "last page": "202", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.167"}, {"title": "Hippocampal contributions to context-dependent learning", "authors": "Smith David M, Bulkin David A", "journal": "Hippocampus", "year": "2014", "volumes": "24", "first page": "775", "last page": "784", "DOI": "10.1002/hipo.22279"}, {"title": "Motor cortex plasticity in context-dependent learning", "authors": "Rioult-Pedotti Mengia S, Friedman Daniel, Donoghue John P", "journal": "Nature Neuroscience", "year": "2000", "volumes": "3", "first page": "230", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1038/72944"}, {"title": "Thalamic modulation of cortical activity in context-dependent learning", "authors": "Saalmann Yuri B, Kastner Sabine", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2011", "volumes": "71", "first page": "750", "last page": "761", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2011.06.028"}, {"title": "Bayesian inference in context-dependent learning", "authors": "Knill David C, Pouget Alexandre", "journal": "Trends in Cognitive Sciences", "year": "2004", "volumes": "8", "first page": "219", "last page": "226", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tics.2004.03.002"}, {"title": "Continual learning in the brain: The role of contextual inference", "authors": "McClelland James L, McNaughton Bruce L, O'Reilly Randall C", "journal": "Psychological Review", "year": "1995", "volumes": "102", "first page": "419", "last page": "457", "DOI": "10.1037/0033-295X.102.3.419"}, {"title": "Pattern separation and completion in the hippocampus", "authors": "Yassa Michael A, Stark Craig E L", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2011", "volumes": "12", "first page": "182", "last page": "193", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn2964"}, {"title": "The neural basis of decision making in context-dependent learning", "authors": "Gold Joshua I, Shadlen Michael N", "journal": "Annual Review of Neuroscience", "year": "2007", "volumes": "30", "first page": "535", "last page": "574", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.neuro.29.051605.113038"}, {"title": "Adaptive coding of context in the motor cortex", "authors": "Churchland Mark M, Shenoy Krishna V", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2007", "volumes": "56", "first page": "541", "last page": "551", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.010"}, {"title": "The thalamus as a modulator of cortical activity in learning", "authors": "Sherman S Murray, Guillery R W", "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "year": "2002", "volumes": "357", "first page": "1705", "last page": "1719", "DOI": "10.1098/rstb.2002.1161"}]}
