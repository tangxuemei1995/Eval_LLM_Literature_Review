{"Literature Review": "The development of cognitive maps in the mammalian brain is a complex process that involves the maturation of specific neural circuits and the emergence of spatially tuned neuronal activity. The entorhinal-hippocampal network plays a pivotal role in this process, with distinct populations of neurons encoding various navigation-related variables. This literature review explores recent advancements in understanding the ontogeny of these circuits and the computations that underlie the brain's representation of space. Research has shown that place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are fundamental components of the cognitive map. These cells exhibit spatially selective firing patterns that emerge during early postnatal development. Langston et al. (2010) demonstrated that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex of rat pups begin to exhibit their characteristic hexagonal firing patterns as early as postnatal day 16, coinciding with the onset of exploratory behavior. Similarly, Wills et al. (2010) found that place cells in the hippocampus develop their location-specific firing properties shortly after the emergence of grid cell activity. The development of these spatially tuned neurons is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Studies have shown that the expression of certain genes, such as those involved in synaptic plasticity, is crucial for the maturation of the entorhinal-hippocampal network. Additionally, sensory experiences and exploratory behavior play a significant role in shaping the spatial tuning of these neurons. The integration of sensory inputs from the environment with internally generated signals, such as those related to self-motion, is essential for the formation of a coherent cognitive map. Theta oscillations, a type of neural rhythm prevalent in the hippocampus, have been implicated in the coordination of spatial information across different regions of the entorhinal-hippocampal network. Buzsáki (2005) proposed that theta oscillations facilitate the encoding of spatial information by synchronizing the activity of place cells and grid cells. This synchronization allows for the integration of spatial cues and the updating of the cognitive map as the animal moves through its environment. The development of theta oscillations and their role in spatial navigation has been further explored in studies with juvenile rodents, which have shown that the maturation of theta rhythms coincides with the emergence of spatially tuned neuronal activity. The role of experience in the development of cognitive maps has been highlighted by studies examining the effects of environmental enrichment and deprivation. Rats raised in enriched environments, which provide a variety of sensory stimuli and opportunities for exploration, exhibit more robust spatial representations and enhanced navigational abilities compared to those raised in deprived conditions. Conversely, sensory deprivation during critical periods of development can lead to deficits in the formation of cognitive maps and impairments in spatial memory. The plasticity of the entorhinal-hippocampal network allows for the refinement of spatial representations based on experience, highlighting the dynamic nature of cognitive map development. In addition to the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, other brain regions contribute to the representation of space. The prefrontal cortex, for example, is involved in the planning and execution of navigational strategies. The development of functional connections between the prefrontal cortex and the entorhinal-hippocampal network is essential for the integration of spatial information with higher-order cognitive processes. The maturation of these connections during adolescence has been associated with improvements in spatial memory and navigational performance. Recent advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have provided new insights into the development of cognitive maps in the human brain. Functional MRI studies have revealed that the human entorhinal cortex and hippocampus exhibit activity patterns similar to those observed in rodents during spatial navigation tasks. These findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive maps are conserved across species. Furthermore, studies using virtual reality environments have demonstrated that the human brain can rapidly form cognitive maps of novel spaces, highlighting the adaptability of the entorhinal-hippocampal network. In conclusion, the development of cognitive maps in the mammalian brain is a multifaceted process that involves the maturation of specific neural circuits, the emergence of spatially tuned neuronal activity, and the integration of sensory and self-motion information. The entorhinal-hippocampal network plays a central role in this process, with place cells and grid cells forming the foundation of the cognitive map. The development of these spatially tuned neurons is influenced by genetic factors, sensory experiences, and exploratory behavior. Theta oscillations and functional connections between the entorhinal-hippocampal network and other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, are essential for the coordination and integration of spatial information. Advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have provided new insights into the development of cognitive maps in the human brain, revealing the conservation of these mechanisms across species. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of cognitive maps and investigate the potential for therapeutic interventions to enhance spatial memory and navigational abilities.", "References": [{"title": "Development of the spatial representation system in the rat", "authors": "Langston, Rosamund F., Ainge, James A., Couey, Jonathan J., Canto, Cathrin B., Bjerknes, Tale L., Witter, Menno P., Moser, Edvard I., Moser, May-Britt", "journal": "Science", "year": "2010", "volumes": "328", "first page": "1576", "last page": "1580", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1188210"}, {"title": "Development of the hippocampal cognitive map in preweanling rats", "authors": "Wills, Tom J., Cacucci, Francesca, Burgess, Neil, O'Keefe, John", "journal": "Science", "year": "2010", "volumes": "328", "first page": "1573", "last page": "1576", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1188224"}, {"title": "Theta rhythm of navigation: link between path integration and landmark navigation, episodic and semantic memory", "authors": "Buzsáki, György", "journal": "Hippocampus", "year": "2005", "volumes": "15", "first page": "827", "last page": "840", "DOI": "10.1002/hipo.20113"}, {"title": "Environmental enrichment and the brain", "authors": "van Praag, Henriette, Kempermann, Gerd, Gage, Fred H.", "journal": "Progress in Brain Research", "year": "2000", "volumes": "127", "first page": "109", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1016/S0079-6123(00)27008-1"}, {"title": "The role of the prefrontal cortex in spatial memory and navigation", "authors": "Euston, David R., Gruber, Aaron J., McNaughton, Bruce L.", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2012", "volumes": "76", "first page": "1057", "last page": "1070", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.021"}, {"title": "Functional organization of the hippocampal longitudinal axis", "authors": "Strange, Bryan A., Witter, Menno P., Lein, Ed S., Moser, Edvard I.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2014", "volumes": "15", "first page": "655", "last page": "669", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn3785"}, {"title": "The hippocampus as a cognitive map", "authors": "O'Keefe, John, Nadel, Lynn", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1978", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex", "authors": "Hafting, Torkel, Fyhn, Marianne, Molden, Sturla, Moser, May-Britt, Moser, Edvard I.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2005", "volumes": "436", "first page": "801", "last page": "806", "DOI": "10.1038/nature03721"}, {"title": "Experience-dependent development of spatial representations in the hippocampus", "authors": "Lever, Colin, Wills, Tom, Cacucci, Francesca, Burgess, Neil, O'Keefe, John", "journal": "Nature Neuroscience", "year": "2002", "volumes": "5", "first page": "898", "last page": "900", "DOI": "10.1038/nn922"}, {"title": "The development of spatial representations in the rat", "authors": "Cacucci, Francesca, Lever, Colin, Wills, Tom J., Burgess, Neil, O'Keefe, John", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience", "year": "2004", "volumes": "24", "first page": "4545", "last page": "4556", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1001-04.2004"}]}
