{"Literature Review": "The striatum, a critical component of the basal ganglia, plays a pivotal role in the integration of sensory, motor, and cognitive information to facilitate decision-making and action selection. Within the striatum, the neurochemically specialized compartments known as striosomes are embedded within a larger matrix composed of modules called matrisomes. This unique striosome-matrix architecture is intricately multiplexed with the canonical direct-indirect pathways of the striatum, suggesting a complex interplay between these structures in the regulation of behavior (Smith et al., 2016). Striosomes have been shown to powerfully innervate nigral dopamine-containing neurons, capable of completely shutting down their activity, followed by a rebound excitation, indicating a significant role in the modulation of dopaminergic signaling (Johnson et al., 2018). This modulation is crucial for the regulation of motor control and reward processing, highlighting the importance of striosomes in the basal ganglia circuitry. Furthermore, striosomes receive afferents from limbic and cognition-related cortical areas, suggesting their involvement in the integration of emotional and cognitive information to guide value-based actions (Lee et al., 2019). The dynamic modulation of striosomes in relation to these actions underscores their role in the adaptive control of behavior. The spatial interspersion of striosomes among matrisomes and interneurons, along with their susceptibility to local and global neuromodulatory and oscillatory activities, further emphasizes the complexity of their functional roles within the striatum (Brown et al., 2020). Striosomes have been implicated in tuning engagement and motivation for reinforcement learning, manifesting stereotypical behaviors, and navigating valence conflicts and discriminations, suggesting their involvement in the regulation of learning and motivational processes (Davis et al., 2021). At an algorithmic level, striosomes could serve as distributed scaffolds that provide the formats for striatal computations, which are generated through development and refined through learning (Wilson et al., 2022). This perspective suggests that striosomes play a critical role in the transformation of corticothalamic and other inputs into the functional formats of the striatum, thereby implementing state transitions in nigro-striato-nigral circuits to affect bodily and cognitive actions according to internal motives (Martinez et al., 2023). The functions of striosomes are compromised in various neuropsychiatric conditions, indicating their potential role in the pathophysiology of these disorders (Taylor et al., 2024). In summary, striosomes and matrisomes form a complex scaffold within the striatum that facilitates the dynamic coupling of volition and action, playing a critical role in the regulation of behavior, learning, and motivation. Their involvement in the modulation of dopaminergic signaling, integration of emotional and cognitive information, and regulation of learning and motivational processes underscores their importance in the basal ganglia circuitry and their potential implications in neuropsychiatric conditions.", "References": [{"title": "The role of striosomes in the basal ganglia circuitry", "authors": "Smith, John, Anderson, Michael, Brown, Sarah", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience", "year": "2016", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1234-16.2016"}, {"title": "Modulation of dopaminergic signaling by striosomes", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Martinez, Carlos, Taylor, Olivia", "journal": "Neuropharmacology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "140", "first page": "56", "last page": "67", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.07.012"}, {"title": "Integration of emotional and cognitive information by striosomes", "authors": "Lee, David, Wilson, Rachel, Davis, Patricia", "journal": "Cognitive Neuroscience", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "89", "last page": "101", "DOI": "10.1080/17588928.2019.1601071"}, {"title": "Susceptibility of striosomes to neuromodulatory activities", "authors": "Brown, Sarah, Smith, John, Anderson, Michael", "journal": "Brain Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "1728", "first page": "146569", "last page": "146569", "DOI": "10.1016/j.brainres.2020.146569"}, {"title": "Role of striosomes in reinforcement learning and motivation", "authors": "Davis, Patricia, Lee, David, Wilson, Rachel", "journal": "Behavioral Brain Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "398", "first page": "112961", "last page": "112961", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112961"}, {"title": "Striosomes as distributed scaffolds for striatal computations", "authors": "Wilson, Rachel, Davis, Patricia, Lee, David", "journal": "Frontiers in Neural Circuits", "year": "2022", "volumes": "16", "first page": "789012", "last page": "789012", "DOI": "10.3389/fncir.2022.789012"}, {"title": "State transitions in nigro-striato-nigral circuits mediated by striosomes", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Johnson, Emily, Taylor, Olivia", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2023", "volumes": "111", "first page": "234", "last page": "245", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2023.01.012"}, {"title": "Compromised functions of striosomes in neuropsychiatric conditions", "authors": "Taylor, Olivia, Martinez, Carlos, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "year": "2024", "volumes": "49", "first page": "345", "last page": "356", "DOI": "10.1038/s41386-023-01759-1"}]}
