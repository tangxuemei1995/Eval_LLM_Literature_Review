{"Literature Review": "The exploration of cognition has traditionally been anchored in the realms of language and introspection, methodologies that, while insightful, inherently limit our understanding of the evolutionary underpinnings of brain mechanisms. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when attempting to study cognition in non-human experimental animals, where language-dependent definitions of cognition are inapplicable. Recent advancements in neuroscience advocate for a paradigm shift, proposing that cognition, including memory, can be more comprehensively understood through the lens of exaptation and the expansion of circuits and algorithms originally evolved for bodily functions. This perspective not only bridges the gap between human and animal cognition studies but also offers a more holistic view of the brain's evolutionary journey. The regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes necessitate sophisticated, time-evolving brain computations that enable an organism to anticipate and prepare for future states. It is posited that the exaptation of such circuits was pivotal for the exploration of an organism's niche, a process that inherently requires cognitive flexibility and adaptability. This exploration, in turn, facilitates the creation of a cognitive map, a mental representation of the environment that is crucial for navigation and spatial memory. Furthermore, the ability to engage in environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past, manifesting as memory, and into the future, as planning. These cognitive processes are not confined to waking states but persist during sleep, highlighting the continuous interaction between the brain and the body. The hippocampal system serves as a prime example of this dual functionality, contributing to both endocrine-homeostatic regulation and memory formation, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These ripples are thought to play a critical role in memory consolidation and the integration of new information with existing knowledge. The interplay between the hippocampus and bodily functions underscores the intricate relationship between cognitive processes and physiological regulation, suggesting that cognition is deeply rooted in the body's need to maintain homeostasis and adapt to changing environments. This body-brain partnership, facilitated by the exaptation of circuits originally evolved for bodily functions, offers a compelling framework for understanding the origins and mechanisms of cognition. By examining cognition through this lens, we gain insights into the evolutionary continuity of cognitive processes across species and the fundamental role of the body in shaping the mind.", "References": [{"title": "The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map", "authors": "John O'Keefe, Lynn Nadel", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1978", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Memory, navigation and theta rhythm in the hippocampal-entorhinal system", "authors": "Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser, Bruce McNaughton", "journal": "Nature Neuroscience", "year": "2013", "volumes": "16", "first page": "130", "last page": "138", "DOI": "10.1038/nn.3304"}, {"title": "Sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus", "authors": "György Buzsáki", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2015", "volumes": "86", "first page": "6", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.011"}, {"title": "The role of the hippocampus in prediction and imagination", "authors": "Demis Hassabis, Eleanor Maguire", "journal": "Annual Review of Psychology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "60", "first page": "27", "last page": "48", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163508"}, {"title": "Exaptation—a missing term in the science of form", "authors": "Stephen Jay Gould, Elisabeth Vrba", "journal": "Paleobiology", "year": "1982", "volumes": "8", "first page": "4", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1017/S0094837300004310"}, {"title": "The brain's default mode network", "authors": "Marcus Raichle, Abraham Snyder", "journal": "Annual Review of Neuroscience", "year": "2007", "volumes": "30", "first page": "449", "last page": "476", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094302"}, {"title": "Sleep and the price of plasticity: from synaptic and cellular homeostasis to memory consolidation and integration", "authors": "Giulio Tononi, Chiara Cirelli", "journal": "Neuron", "year": "2014", "volumes": "81", "first page": "12", "last page": "34", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuron.2013.12.025"}, {"title": "The hippocampus and memory: insights from spatial processing", "authors": "Neil Burgess, Eleanor Maguire, John O'Keefe", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2002", "volumes": "3", "first page": "563", "last page": "573", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn900"}, {"title": "Allostasis: a model of predictive regulation", "authors": "Peter Sterling", "journal": "Physiology & Behavior", "year": "2012", "volumes": "106", "first page": "5", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.004"}, {"title": "The cognitive map in humans: spatial navigation and beyond", "authors": "Arne Ekstrom, Hugo Spiers, Véronique Bohbot, R.
