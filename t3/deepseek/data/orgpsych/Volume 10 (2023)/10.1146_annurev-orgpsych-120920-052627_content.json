{"Literature Review": "The concept of organizational justice, which encompasses fairness in the workplace, has been extensively studied in the fields of organizational psychology and behavior. However, the intersection of organizational justice with race and ethnicity remains underexplored, leading to fragmented findings and a lack of comprehensive theory. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on racioethnic differences in perceptions and experiences of organizational justice, highlighting the nuanced ways in which race influences workplace fairness. Organizational justice is typically divided into three main types: distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice. Distributive justice refers to the fairness of outcomes or resource allocation, procedural justice to the fairness of the processes used to determine outcomes, and interactional justice to the fairness of interpersonal treatment during the execution of procedures. Research indicates that perceptions of these justice types can significantly vary across different racioethnic groups. For instance, studies have shown that minority employees often perceive lower levels of distributive and procedural justice compared to their majority counterparts, which can be attributed to systemic biases and discrimination in organizational practices and policies. Interactional justice, which involves the quality of interpersonal treatment, also shows disparities, with minority employees reporting less respectful and fair treatment from supervisors and colleagues. These disparities in justice perceptions can have profound implications for workplace outcomes, including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Moreover, the impact of racioethnic differences on organizational justice is not uniform but varies depending on the specific type of justice and the context in which it is experienced. For example, the magnitude of differences in procedural justice perceptions may be more pronounced in organizations with opaque decision-making processes, where minority employees might feel particularly excluded or marginalized. Similarly, the effects of interactional justice disparities might be more severe in workplaces with a history of racial tensions or discrimination. Despite the growing body of research on this topic, several gaps remain. First, there is a need for more longitudinal studies to understand how perceptions of organizational justice evolve over time among different racioethnic groups. Second, future research should explore the role of intersectionality, considering how race interacts with other identities such as gender, class, and sexual orientation to shape justice perceptions. Third, there is a paucity of research on effective interventions to mitigate racioethnic disparities in organizational justice, which is crucial for developing evidence-based practices that promote fairness and inclusion in the workplace. In conclusion, while the literature suggests that justice is not colorblind and that racioethnic differences significantly influence perceptions of fairness in the workplace, much remains to be understood about the mechanisms underlying these disparities and how they can be addressed. By adopting a more nuanced and intersectional approach to studying organizational justice, researchers and practitioners can better understand and tackle the complex challenges posed by racioethnic differences in the workplace.", "References": [{"title": "Perceived organizational support and police performance: The moderating influence of socioemotional needs", "authors": "Eisenberger, Robert, Huntington, Robin, Hutchison, Sowa, Debora", "journal": "Journal of Applied Psychology", "year": "1986", "volumes": "71", "first page": "500", "last page": "507", "DOI": "10.1037/0021-9010.71.3.500"}, {"title": "Justice at the millennium: A meta-analytic review of 25 years of organizational justice research", "authors": "Colquitt, Jason A., Conlon, Donald E., Wesson, Michael J., Porter, Christopher O.
