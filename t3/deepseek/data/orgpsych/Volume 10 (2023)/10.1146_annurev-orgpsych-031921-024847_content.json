{"Literature Review": "The concepts of decent work and meaningful work have emerged as critical areas of interest within the fields of organizational psychology, sociology, and labor studies, reflecting the evolving nature of work and its impact on individuals and society. Decent work, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO), encompasses opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace, and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men (ILO, 1999). On the other hand, meaningful work refers to work that is personally significant and fulfilling, providing a sense of purpose and contributing to one's identity and self-realization (Rosso, Dekas, & Wrzesniewski, 2010). The distinction between decent work and meaningful work lies in their foundational premises; decent work is considered a basic right and necessity, whereas meaningful work is an aspirational goal that enhances the quality of work life. Recent scholarship has sought to explore the intersection between these two constructs, particularly through the lens of the Psychology of Working Theory (PWT), which posits that work can fulfill basic human needs for survival, social connection, and self-determination, thereby contributing to both decent and meaningful work (Duffy, Blustein, Diemer, & Autin, 2016). The PWT framework suggests that societal, organizational, and individual factors collectively influence access to decent and meaningful work, with societal context providing the foundational layer that shapes organizational conditions and individual practices. Research has shown that societal factors such as economic policies, labor laws, and cultural norms significantly impact the availability of decent work opportunities (Blustein, Olle, Connors-Kellgren, & Diamonti, 2016). At the organizational level, job design, leadership styles, and workplace policies play a crucial role in creating conditions that promote both decent and meaningful work (Grant, 2007). For instance, job characteristics such as autonomy, task significance, and feedback have been linked to increased perceptions of meaningfulness at work (Hackman & Oldham, 1976). Individual practices, including personal resilience, career adaptability, and proactive career behaviors, further enable individuals to navigate their work environments in ways that enhance their experience of work (Savickas & Porfeli, 2012). The integration of decent work and meaningful work within the PWT framework highlights the importance of need satisfaction as a connecting mechanism. According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the fulfillment of basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is essential for optimal functioning and well-being (Deci & Ryan, 2000). In the context of work, need satisfaction can bridge the gap between decent work conditions and the experience of meaningfulness, suggesting that when individuals' basic needs are met, they are more likely to find their work meaningful (Van den Broeck, Vansteenkiste, De Witte, & Lens, 2008). Future research directions in this area include broadening the scope of scholarship to encompass diverse cultural and economic contexts, employing interdisciplinary approaches to understand the complex interplay between macro-level and psychological factors, and developing interventions aimed at improving the quality of work life. Such efforts could contribute to a more holistic understanding of work and its implications for individuals, organizations, and society, ultimately fostering environments where both decent and meaningful work are accessible to all.", "References": [{"title": "Decent Work", "authors": "International Labour Organization", "journal": "Report of the Director-General", "year": "1999", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "On the meaning of work: A theoretical integration and review", "authors": "Rosso, Brent D., Dekas, Kathryn H., Wrzesniewski, Amy", "journal": "Research in Organizational Behavior", "year": "2010", "volumes": "30", "first page": "91", "last page": "127", "DOI": "10.1016/j.riob.2010.09.001"}, {"title": "The Psychology of Working Theory", "authors": "Duffy, Ryan D., Blustein, David L., Diemer, Matthew A., Autin, Kelsey L.", "journal": "Journal of Counseling Psychology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "63", "first page": "127", "last page": "148", "DOI": "10.1037/cou0000140"}, {"title": "Decent work: A psychological perspective", "authors": "Blustein, David L., Olle, Caroline, Connors-Kellgren, Alice, Diamonti, A.
