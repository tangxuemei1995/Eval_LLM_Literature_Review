{"Literature Review": "The evolution of the workplace into more virtual and hybrid environments has necessitated a reevaluation of leadership theories and practices. Traditional leadership functions, such as setting direction, aligning people, motivating and inspiring, and producing change, have been foundational in face-to-face settings (Kotter, 1990). However, the shift towards virtual work environments has introduced new dynamics that challenge these traditional functions and require leaders to adapt their strategies to effectively lead from a distance. This literature review synthesizes current research on virtual leadership, focusing on the adaptation of traditional leadership functions and the emergence of new functions specific to virtual settings. The review also explores the implications of these changes for leaders, followers, and organizations, and identifies future research directions. One of the key findings from the literature is that certain traditional leadership functions have a more pronounced impact on follower need satisfaction in virtual settings. For instance, the function of setting direction becomes crucial in virtual environments where the lack of physical presence can lead to ambiguity and misalignment (Avolio, Kahai, & Dodge, 2001). Similarly, the function of motivating and inspiring takes on added importance as leaders must find new ways to engage and energize followers who may feel isolated or disconnected (Hertel, Geister, & Konradt, 2005). Another significant adaptation is the need for leaders to facilitate the use of technology, a function that has emerged as particularly relevant in virtual leadership. This involves not only selecting appropriate technologies to support virtual work but also ensuring that team members are proficient in using these technologies and that they are integrated effectively into work processes (Zigurs, 2003). The literature also highlights the challenges leaders face in hybrid work environments, where they must navigate the complexities of managing both in-person and remote team members. This requires a nuanced understanding of the different needs and dynamics of each group and the ability to foster cohesion and collaboration across the divide (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006). Furthermore, the review identifies several promising areas for future research, including the need to examine the effects of leadership along the full spectrum of virtuality and to explore the unique challenges and opportunities presented by hybrid work environments. Additionally, there is a call for research to investigate the long-term impacts of virtual leadership on organizational outcomes and to develop more comprehensive models that integrate the various dimensions of virtual leadership (Bell & Kozlowski, 2002). In conclusion, the shift towards virtual and hybrid work environments has significant implications for leadership theory and practice. Leaders must adapt their strategies to meet the unique challenges of these settings, particularly in terms of setting direction, motivating and inspiring followers, and facilitating the use of technology. At the same time, there is a need for further research to deepen our understanding of virtual leadership and to guide the development of effective leadership practices in this evolving context.", "References": [{"title": "A force for change: How leadership differs from management", "authors": "John P.
