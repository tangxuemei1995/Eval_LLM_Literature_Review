{"Literature Review": "The dynamic interplay between actors (individuals or teams) and their contexts has been a focal point in creativity and innovation research. This literature review synthesizes recent advancements and identifies future directions based on the typology introduced in 2014, which categorizes the interaction between actors and contexts into four quadrants. These quadrants provide a structured framework for understanding how different types of interactions influence creativity and innovation. Recent studies have explored the nuanced ways in which individual and team characteristics interact with contextual factors to foster or hinder creative outcomes. For instance, research by Amabile and Pratt (2016) highlights the role of intrinsic motivation and supportive environments in enhancing individual creativity. Similarly, Hülsheger, Anderson, and Salgado (2009) emphasize the importance of team diversity and psychological safety in promoting team innovation. The person-context interaction quadrant has been particularly fruitful, with studies examining how individual traits such as openness to experience and cognitive flexibility interact with organizational culture and leadership styles. For example, Zhou and Hoever (2014) found that transformational leadership can amplify the creative potential of individuals by providing a vision and intellectual stimulation. On the other hand, the team-context interaction quadrant has seen significant attention, with research focusing on how team dynamics and external pressures influence innovation. West and Anderson (1996) demonstrated that team autonomy and external demands are critical factors in determining the success of innovative projects. The person-situation and team-situation interaction quadrants, though less explored, offer promising avenues for future research. These quadrants consider the transient and situational factors that can impact creativity, such as time pressure and resource availability. For instance, Baer and Oldham (2006) found that moderate levels of time pressure can enhance creativity by increasing focus and urgency, while excessive pressure can lead to burnout and reduced creative output. Building on these findings, recent studies have begun to integrate multiple quadrants to provide a more holistic understanding of creativity and innovation. For example, Anderson, Potočnik, and Zhou (2014) propose a multi-level framework that considers the interplay between individual, team, and organizational factors. This approach underscores the complexity of creativity and the need for interdisciplinary research. Despite these advancements, several gaps remain. First, there is a need for more longitudinal studies to understand how the interplay between actors and contexts evolves over time. Second, the role of digital technologies and virtual environments in shaping creativity and innovation warrants further exploration. Third, cultural differences in the perception and expression of creativity are underexplored, highlighting the need for cross-cultural studies. Finally, the integration of neuroscientific methods can provide deeper insights into the cognitive processes underlying creativity. In conclusion, the dynamic interplay between actors and contexts is a rich and evolving area of research. By revisiting and updating the eight research recommendations proposed in 2014, this literature review identifies four desirable directions for future research: longitudinal studies, digital and virtual environments, cross-cultural perspectives, and neuroscientific methods. These directions have the potential to accelerate theoretical breakthroughs and inform practical strategies for fostering creativity and innovation in organizations.", "References": [{"title": "The dynamic componential model of creativity and innovation in organizations: Making progress, making meaning", "authors": "Teresa M.
