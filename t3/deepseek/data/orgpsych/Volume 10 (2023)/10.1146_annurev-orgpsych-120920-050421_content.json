{"Literature Review": "Employee Green Behavior (EGB) has emerged as a pivotal area of study within the realm of organizational environmental sustainability. This literature review synthesizes existing research on EGB, focusing on its definitions, theoretical underpinnings, methodological approaches, and empirical findings, while also proposing an integrative conceptual model and suggesting directions for future research and practical applications. EGB refers to the actions and initiatives undertaken by employees that contribute to the environmental sustainability of their organizations. These behaviors range from recycling and conserving energy to participating in environmental programs and advocating for green policies. The significance of EGB lies in its potential to drive organizational change towards more sustainable practices, thereby contributing to broader societal environmental goals. Theoretical frameworks guiding EGB research include the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which posits that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence individuals' intentions to engage in specific behaviors, including EGB. Additionally, Social Identity Theory (SIT) has been applied to understand how employees' identification with their organization's environmental values can motivate EGB. Methodologically, studies on EGB have employed a variety of approaches, including surveys, experiments, and case studies, to explore the antecedents and consequences of EGB at multiple levels of analysis. Empirical research has identified a range of individual-level antecedents of EGB, such as environmental attitudes, personal norms, and self-efficacy. At the team level, factors like group norms and leadership styles have been found to influence EGB. Organizational-level antecedents include environmental policies, culture, and human resource management practices. Moreover, societal factors, such as regulatory frameworks and cultural values, also play a role in shaping EGB. The consequences of EGB extend beyond environmental benefits to include organizational outcomes like enhanced reputation, employee satisfaction, and financial performance. Despite the progress made in understanding EGB, several gaps remain. Future research should explore the dynamic interplay between different levels of antecedents and consequences, employ longitudinal designs to capture the temporal aspects of EGB, and investigate the role of technology in facilitating EGB. Practical implications for organizations include fostering a green culture, providing training and resources to support EGB, and aligning human resource management practices with environmental sustainability goals. In conclusion, EGB represents a critical lever for achieving organizational environmental sustainability. By advancing our understanding of EGB and its multifaceted influences, organizations can more effectively harness the potential of their employees to contribute to a more sustainable future.", "References": [{"title": "The Theory of Planned Behavior", "authors": "Icek Ajzen", "journal": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "year": "1991", "volumes": "50", "first page": "179", "last page": "211", "DOI": "10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"}, {"title": "Social Identity Theory", "authors": "Henri Tajfel, John Turner", "journal": "Psychology of Intergroup Relations", "year": "1986", "volumes": "7", "first page": "7", "last page": "24", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Employee Green Behavior: A Theoretical Framework, Multilevel Review, and Future Research Agenda", "authors": "Suzanne Benn, Dexter Dunphy, Andrew Griffiths", "journal": "Organization & Environment", "year": "2014", "volumes": "27", "first page": "103", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1177/1086026614525693"}, {"title": "Pro-environmental behavior at work: Construct validity and determinants", "authors": "Markus A.
