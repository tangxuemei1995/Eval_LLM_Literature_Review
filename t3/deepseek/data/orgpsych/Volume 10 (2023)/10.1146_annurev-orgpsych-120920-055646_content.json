{"Literature Review": "The psychology of entrepreneurship has garnered significant attention over the past decade, with researchers delving into the intricate dynamics that drive entrepreneurial actions and processes. This literature review synthesizes recent findings, focusing on the interplay between action and process within the entrepreneurial context. We employ the action theory process model of entrepreneurship as a guiding framework, exploring theories of action and adopting a process perspective to understand the antecedents of entrepreneurial actions. Theories of action, such as effectuation/causation, bricolage, the theory of planned behavior, and action theory, provide foundational insights into how entrepreneurs make decisions and navigate uncertainty. Effectuation, as proposed by Sarasvathy (2001), emphasizes a flexible, means-oriented approach to decision-making, contrasting with the goal-oriented causation approach. Bricolage, introduced by Baker and Nelson (2005), highlights the resourcefulness of entrepreneurs in leveraging available resources creatively. The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) offers a framework for understanding how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence entrepreneurial intentions and actions. Action theory (Frese & Zapf, 1994) further elucidates the cognitive processes underlying goal-directed behaviors in entrepreneurship. From a process perspective, the antecedents of entrepreneurial actions—cognition, motivation, and emotion—are examined in terms of their development and recursive relationships over time. Cognitive processes, such as opportunity recognition and decision-making, are crucial in shaping entrepreneurial actions (Baron, 2006). Motivation, encompassing both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, drives entrepreneurs to initiate and persist in their ventures (Shane et al., 2003). Emotions, including passion and fear, play a dual role in influencing entrepreneurial behavior, both as drivers and as outcomes of the entrepreneurial process (Cardon et al., 2012). The dynamic nature of these antecedents and their interactions with actions underscore the complexity of the entrepreneurial journey. Recursive relationships between actions and their antecedents highlight the iterative and evolving nature of entrepreneurship, where actions influence cognition, motivation, and emotion, which in turn shape subsequent actions (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). This review concludes that the action theory process model serves as a valuable framework for explaining the psychological dynamics of entrepreneurship, offering a comprehensive lens through which to view the interplay between action and process. Future research directions include exploring the longitudinal development of entrepreneurial actions and their antecedents, as well as the role of context in shaping these dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Effectuation: Elements of Entrepreneurial Expertise", "authors": "Sarasvathy Saras D.", "journal": "Edward Elgar Publishing", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Creating Something from Nothing: Resource Construction through Entrepreneurial Bricolage", "authors": "Baker Ted, Nelson Reed E.", "journal": "Administrative Science Quarterly", "year": "2005", "volumes": "50", "first page": "329", "last page": "366", "DOI": "10.2189/asqu.2005.50.3.329"}, {"title": "The Theory of Planned Behavior", "authors": "Ajzen Icek", "journal": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "year": "1991", "volumes": "50", "first page": "179", "last page": "211", "DOI": "10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"}, {"title": "Action as the Core of Work Psychology: A German Approach", "authors": "Frese Michael, Zapf Dieter", "journal": "Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology", "year": "1994", "volumes": "4", "first page": "271", "last page": "340", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Opportunity Recognition as Pattern Recognition: How Entrepreneurs 'Connect the Dots' to Identify New Business Opportunities", "authors": "Baron Robert A.", "journal": "Academy of Management Perspectives", "year": "2006", "volumes": "20", "first page": "104", "last page": "119", "DOI": "10.5465/amp.2006.19873412"}, {"title": "Entrepreneurial Motivation", "authors": "Shane Scott, Locke Edwin A., Collins Christopher J.", "journal": "Human Resource Management Review", "year": "2003", "volumes": "13", "first page": "257", "last page": "279", "DOI": "10.1016/S1053-4822(03)00017-2"}, {"title": "The Nature and Experience of Entrepreneurial Passion", "authors": "Cardon Melissa S., Wincent Joseph, Singh Jagdip, Drnovsek Matej", "journal": "Academy of Management Review", "year": "2012", "volumes": "37", "first page": "511", "last page": "532", "DOI": "10.5465/amr.2010.0366"}, {"title": "Entrepreneurial Action and the Role of Uncertainty in the Theory of the Entrepreneur", "authors": "McMullen Jeffery S., Shepherd Dean A.", "journal": "Academy of Management Review", "year": "2006", "volumes": "31", "first page": "132", "last page": "152", "DOI": "10.5465/amr.2006.19379628"}]}
