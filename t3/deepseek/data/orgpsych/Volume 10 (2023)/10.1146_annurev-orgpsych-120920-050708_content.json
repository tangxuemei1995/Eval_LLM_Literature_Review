{"Literature Review": "The concept of noise, defined as unwanted variance in judgments, has been a critical yet often overlooked aspect of decision-making processes. This literature review explores the evolution of understanding and addressing noise in workplace judgments, particularly within the context of personnel selection, drawing on a century of research to highlight effective strategies for noise reduction. The seminal work of Thorndike (1920) laid the groundwork for recognizing the impact of noise in judgment, emphasizing the variability in human assessments that can lead to inconsistent and unreliable decisions. Building on this foundation, Schmidt and Hunter (1977) demonstrated the significant role of structured processes in reducing noise, advocating for the decomposition of judgment components, the establishment of clear standards, and the consistent application of these standards. The importance of aggregating independent judgments to mitigate noise was further underscored by Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein (2021), who argued that combining multiple perspectives can dilute individual biases and errors, leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes. The advent of algorithmic decision-making has introduced new opportunities for noise reduction, with Grove, Zald, Lebow, Snitz, and Nelson (2000) showing that algorithms can outperform human judgment in consistency and accuracy by eliminating subjective variability. However, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in decision-making processes has been met with caution, as highlighted by Dietvorst, Simmons, and Massey (2015), who found that these technologies, in their current form, can introduce new sources of noise if not carefully designed and implemented. The strategic integration of structured processes, independent judgment aggregation, and algorithmic assistance offers a promising path forward for reducing noise in workplace judgments. This approach is supported by the work of Highhouse (2008), who emphasized the value of combining human and algorithmic inputs to leverage the strengths of each while minimizing their respective weaknesses. Furthermore, the role of forecasting in strategic decision-making has been explored by Tetlock and Gardner (2015), who demonstrated that structured forecasting techniques can significantly reduce noise by focusing on probabilistic reasoning and evidence-based predictions. The lessons learned from a century of selection research provide valuable insights for improving judgment accuracy across various domains, highlighting the importance of addressing noise as a critical source of error. As organizations continue to navigate the complexities of decision-making in an increasingly uncertain and data-driven world, the principles of noise reduction offer a robust framework for enhancing the quality and reliability of workplace judgments.", "References": [{"title": "A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings", "authors": "Edward L.
