{"Literature Review": "The concept of mental health in the workplace has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated mental health issues among employees globally. Mental health, as defined by the World Health Organization, is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to their community (WHO, 2001). In the workplace, mental health encompasses not only the absence of mental illness but also the presence of positive psychological states that enable employees to thrive (Keyes, 2002). The costs of employee mental illness to organizations are substantial, including decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher healthcare costs (Goetzel et al., 2004). Moreover, the societal costs of mental illness, including lost economic output and increased burden on healthcare systems, are immense (Trautmann, Rehm, & Wittchen, 2016). The workplace plays a crucial role in promoting positive mental health, preventing mental illness, and intervening to address mental health challenges. Research has shown that organizational factors such as job design, leadership style, and workplace culture can significantly impact employee mental health (Bond et al., 2006). Preventive measures, such as stress management programs and mental health awareness training, can reduce the incidence of mental illness among employees (LaMontagne et al., 2007). Interventions, including employee assistance programs and cognitive-behavioral therapy, have been effective in treating mental health issues and facilitating return to work (van der Klink et al., 2001). Accommodations for employees experiencing mental health challenges, such as flexible work arrangements and modified duties, are essential for supporting their recovery and maintaining their employment (MacDonald-Wilson et al., 2002). Future research should focus on the long-term effectiveness of workplace mental health interventions, the role of technology in delivering mental health support, and the impact of organizational policies on employee mental health outcomes. Practical implications include the need for organizations to adopt a comprehensive approach to mental health that integrates prevention, intervention, and accommodation strategies, and to foster a workplace culture that supports mental well-being.", "References": [{"title": "The World Health Report 2001 - Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The mental health continuum: From languishing to flourishing in life", "authors": "Corey L.M.
