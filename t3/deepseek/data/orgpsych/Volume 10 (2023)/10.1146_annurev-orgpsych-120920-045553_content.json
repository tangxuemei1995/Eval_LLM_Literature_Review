{"Literature Review": "The relationship between leadership and creativity has been a focal point of research in organizational studies, emphasizing the critical role leaders play in fostering an environment conducive to innovation. Leadership, particularly in its transformational form, has been shown to significantly impact followers' creative performance by inspiring and motivating them to transcend their own self-interests for the sake of the organization (Bass & Avolio, 1994). Transformational leaders achieve this by providing a vision that encourages followers to challenge the status quo and think outside the box, thereby enhancing their creative capabilities. Moreover, the concept of leader thinking skills has emerged as a pivotal factor in influencing follower creativity. Leaders who exhibit complex thinking and problem-solving abilities are better equipped to guide their followers through the intricacies of creative processes, thereby enhancing their creative outcomes (Mumford et al., 2002). This is further supported by the notion that leaders who engage in creative problem-solving themselves set a precedent for their followers, encouraging a culture of innovation within the organization. The importance of leader development in cultivating these thinking skills cannot be overstated. Effective leader development programs focus on enhancing leaders' abilities to think critically and creatively, which in turn, positively affects their followers' creative performance (Day, 2000). Such programs often include training in cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, and the ability to manage complex information, all of which are essential for fostering creativity. Additionally, the role of leaders in establishing the conditions that allow for creative problem-solving at various organizational levels has been highlighted. This involves creating a supportive environment that encourages risk-taking and values diverse perspectives, which are crucial for innovation (Amabile, 1998). Leaders must also be adept at managing the dynamics of creative teams, ensuring that all members feel valued and motivated to contribute their best ideas. The impact of leadership on creativity is not limited to individual followers but extends to teams and the organization as a whole. Leaders who effectively manage team dynamics and foster a collaborative environment can significantly enhance the creative output of their teams (West, 2002). This is particularly important in complex projects that require the integration of diverse skills and perspectives. Furthermore, the assessment of leadership effectiveness in promoting creativity has evolved to include measures of both leader behaviors and the creative outcomes of their followers. This holistic approach to leader assessment provides valuable insights into the specific leadership practices that are most effective in fostering creativity (Zhou & George, 2003). In conclusion, the literature underscores the multifaceted role of leadership in enhancing follower creative performance. Leaders who possess advanced thinking skills, engage in creative problem-solving, and create a supportive environment for innovation are more likely to inspire their followers to achieve higher levels of creativity. As organizations continue to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the development of such leadership capabilities will be crucial for sustaining competitive advantage through innovation.", "References": [{"title": "Improving Organizational Effectiveness through Transformational Leadership", "authors": "Bernard Bass, Bruce Avolio", "journal": "Sage Publications", "year": "1994", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Leadership skills for a changing world: Solving complex social problems", "authors": "Michael Mumford, Ginamarie Scott, Blaine Gaddis, Jill Strange", "journal": "The Leadership Quarterly", "year": "2002", "volumes": "13", "first page": "23", "last page": "35", "DOI": "10.1016/S1048-9843(01)00103-4"}, {"title": "Leadership development: A review in context", "authors": "David Day", "journal": "The Leadership Quarterly", "year": "2000", "volumes": "11", "first page": "581", "last page": "613", "DOI": "10.1016/S1048-9843(00)00061-8"}, {"title": "How to kill creativity", "authors": "Teresa Amabile", "journal": "Harvard Business Review", "year": "1998", "volumes": "76", "first page": "76", "last page": "87", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Sparkling fountains or stagnant ponds: An integrative model of creativity and innovation implementation in work groups", "authors": "Michael West", "journal": "Applied Psychology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "51", "first page": "355", "last page": "387", "DOI": "10.1111/1464-0597.00951"}, {"title": "Awakening employee creativity: The role of leader emotional intelligence", "authors": "Jing Zhou, Jennifer George", "journal": "The Leadership Quarterly", "year": "2003", "volumes": "14", "first page": "545", "last page": "568", "DOI": "10.1016/S1048-9843(03)00051-1"}]}
