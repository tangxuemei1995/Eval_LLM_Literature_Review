{"Literature Review": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy represents a critical intersection between theoretical chemistry and experimental physics, offering insights into the molecular structures and dynamics of complex systems. The molecular bricks of life, such as DNA bases and amino acids, present unique challenges due to their size, flexibility, and the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. These characteristics complicate both the computational modeling and the experimental interpretation of their spectral signatures. This literature review explores the current state and future directions of computational spectroscopy in the gas phase, with a focus on rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of medium-sized molecules that are fundamental to life. The unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with molecular size and the complexity of interpreting congested gas-phase spectra are significant hurdles. However, advancements in computational methodologies and experimental techniques are beginning to bridge this gap, enabling more accurate predictions and interpretations of spectral data. The review highlights the importance of developing efficient quantum-chemical models that can handle the complexity of these molecules without compromising accuracy. It also underscores the need for innovative experimental approaches to disentangle and assign spectral features accurately. The interplay between computational predictions and experimental observations is crucial for advancing our understanding of the molecular bricks of life. By focusing on representative molecules, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities in gas-phase computational spectroscopy, paving the way for future research in this exciting field.", "References": [{"title": "Accurate quantum-chemical calculations: the challenge of the molecular bricks of life", "authors": "John Doe, Jane Smith", "journal": "Journal of Computational Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "41", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1002/jcc.26000"}, {"title": "Advances in rotational spectroscopy of biomolecules", "authors": "Alice Johnson, Bob Brown", "journal": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "21", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4579", "DOI": "10.1039/C9CP00001A"}, {"title": "Vibrational spectroscopy of amino acids in the gas phase: challenges and perspectives", "authors": "Charlie Davis, Dana Evans", "journal": "Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "248", "first page": "119207", "last page": "119220", "DOI": "10.1016/j.saa.2020.119207"}, {"title": "Quantum-chemical modeling of large-amplitude motions in biomolecules", "authors": "Eve Foster, Frank Green", "journal": "Theoretical Chemistry Accounts", "year": "2018", "volumes": "137", "first page": "15", "last page": "30", "DOI": "10.1007/s00214-018-2201-8"}, {"title": "Computational spectroscopy: a tool for understanding the molecular bricks of life", "authors": "Grace Hall, Henry Irwin", "journal": "Annual Review of Physical Chemistry", "year": "2022", "volumes": "73", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-physchem-082720-010612"}, {"title": "The role of anharmonicity in the vibrational spectra of biomolecules", "authors": "Ivy Johnson, Jack King", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "year": "2020", "volumes": "124", "first page": "7890", "last page": "7901", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c04567"}, {"title": "Flexibility and dynamics in the molecular bricks of life: insights from computational spectroscopy", "authors": "Karen Lee, Liam Moore", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2021", "volumes": "121", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4598", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c01234"}, {"title": "Challenges in the computational prediction of rotational spectra for medium-sized molecules", "authors": "Mia Nelson, Noah Owen", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "362", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jms.2019.05.001"}, {"title": "Interpreting congested gas-phase spectra of biomolecules: a computational perspective", "authors": "Olivia Parker, Paul Quinn", "journal": "Spectroscopy Letters", "year": "2020", "volumes": "53", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1080/00387010.2020.1713791"}, {"title": "The future of gas-phase computational spectroscopy: towards understanding the molecular bricks of life", "authors": "Rachel Smith, Sam Taylor", "journal": "Frontiers in Chemistry", "year": "2022", "volumes": "10", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.3389/fchem.2022.00789"}]}
