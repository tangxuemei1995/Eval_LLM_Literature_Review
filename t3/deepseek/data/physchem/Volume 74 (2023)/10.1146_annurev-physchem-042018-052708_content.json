{"Literature Review": "The formation of stable glasses (SGs) through physical vapor deposition (PVD) has emerged as a fascinating area of research, offering insights into the interplay between surface dynamics and bulk glass properties. This literature review synthesizes current understanding of surface-mediated SG formation, focusing on the roles of deposition parameters, chemical structure, and surface dynamics in determining the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of SGs. The unique properties of SGs, such as their enhanced density, stability, and anisotropic packing structures, are closely linked to the conditions under which they are formed. Specifically, the deposition temperature (Tdep) and rate are critical factors that influence the molecular packing and orientation at the surface, which in turn dictate the bulk properties of the resulting glass. Studies have shown that SGs formed at Tdep just below the conventional glass transition temperature (Tg) exhibit the highest stability, attributed to the optimal balance between surface mobility and molecular packing (Ediger, 2017). The chemical structure and composition of the glass former also play pivotal roles in SG formation. For instance, molecules with anisotropic shapes or specific functional groups can lead to oriented packing and enhanced surface diffusion, facilitating the formation of SGs with unique properties (Zhang et al., 2019). The surface of a glass former is characterized by enhanced mobility and a lower effective Tg compared to the bulk, which accelerates the aging process at the interface and contributes to the formation of SGs (Kearns et al., 2010). This surface-mediated equilibration process is crucial for achieving the high stability and density observed in SGs. Moreover, the structural anisotropy of SGs, resulting from the oriented packing of molecules at the surface, has been extensively studied using techniques such as X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations (Swallen et al., 2007). These studies have revealed that the anisotropic structures of SGs are directly related to the deposition conditions and the molecular characteristics of the glass former. Despite significant advances in understanding the surface-mediated formation of SGs, several key gaps remain in our knowledge. For example, the detailed mechanisms by which surface dynamics influence the bulk properties of SGs are not fully understood. Additionally, the role of surface chemistry and the interactions between different glass formers in the PVD process warrant further investigation (Yu et al., 2016). Future research should also explore the potential applications of SGs in various fields, taking advantage of their unique properties such as enhanced stability and anisotropic structures. In conclusion, the surface-mediated formation of SGs through PVD is a complex process influenced by deposition parameters, chemical structure, and surface dynamics. The resulting SGs exhibit remarkable thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as anisotropic packing structures, making them of great interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. However, further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process and to explore the potential of SGs in novel applications.", "References": [{"title": "Perspective: Highly stable vapor-deposited glasses", "authors": "Mark D.
