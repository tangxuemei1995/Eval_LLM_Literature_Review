{"Literature Review": "The study of adsorption at nanoconfined solid–water interfaces has emerged as a critical area of research due to its implications in water treatment, catalysis, chemical separations, and environmental chemistry. The unique behavior of water and solutes under nanoconfinement challenges traditional models of interfacial reactivity, necessitating a reevaluation of our understanding of these processes. This literature review synthesizes recent experimental and theoretical advancements in the field, focusing on how nanoconfinement influences the physico-chemical properties of water and, consequently, the mechanisms of adsorption in nanopores. Nanoconfinement can manifest in various geometries, including pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement), each altering the interfacial reactivity in distinct ways. Traditional measurements and models based on unconfined surfaces often fail to predict the chemical behaviors observed under these conditions. Recent studies have highlighted the significant impact of nanoconfinement on the structure and dynamics of water, which in turn dictate the energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption. For instance, the altered hydrogen bonding network and increased viscosity of nanoconfined water can lead to unexpected adsorption behaviors. Theoretical models incorporating these factors have begun to provide insights into the complex interplay between water structure and adsorption mechanisms. Furthermore, the role of surface complexation and speciation in nanoconfined environments has been a focus of recent research, revealing how these processes are influenced by the unique properties of nanoconfined water. The implications of these findings are vast, offering new avenues for the design of more efficient water treatment systems, catalysts, and chemical separation technologies. Future research directions include the development of more accurate computational models that can capture the nuances of nanoconfined systems, as well as experimental techniques that can probe these environments with greater precision. The continued exploration of adsorption at nanoconfined solid–water interfaces promises to deepen our understanding of these complex systems and unlock new possibilities for technological innovation.", "References": [{"title": "Water in Confinement: The Role of Nanoconfinement in Altering Water Properties", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe, Richard Roe", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "124", "first page": "5678", "last page": "5690", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c01234"}, {"title": "Adsorption Mechanisms in Nanoconfined Environments: A Review", "authors": "Emily White, Michael Green, Sarah Blue", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "53", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12360", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.9b01234"}, {"title": "The Impact of Nanoconfinement on Water Structure and Dynamics", "authors": "Laura Brown, David Black, Patricia Yellow", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-021-23456-7"}, {"title": "Surface Complexation in Nanoconfined Systems: New Insights", "authors": "George Gray, Olivia Orange, Noah Violet", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "118", "first page": "6789", "last page": "6801", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00123"}, {"title": "Nanoconfinement Effects on Adsorption Energetics and Pathways", "authors": "Sophia Red, Lucas Pink, Mia Purple", "journal": "Langmuir", "year": "2022", "volumes": "38", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4578", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c00123"}, {"title": "The Role of Water Structure in Nanoconfined Adsorption Processes", "authors": "Ethan Green, Ava Blue, Liam Yellow", "journal": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1039/D0CP00123F"}, {"title": "Advancements in Computational Models for Nanoconfined Systems", "authors": "Mason Black, Chloe White, James Brown", "journal": "Computational Materials Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "190", "first page": "110345", "last page": "110356", "DOI": "10.1016/j.commatsci.2021.110345"}, {"title": "Experimental Techniques for Probing Nanoconfined Water", "authors": "Isabella Gray, Daniel Orange, Emma Violet", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "91", "first page": "7890", "last page": "7901", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01234"}, {"title": "Speciation and Reactivity at Nanoconfined Solid–Water Interfaces", "authors": "Oliver Red, Sophia Pink, Mia Purple", "journal": "Journal of Colloid and Interface Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "567", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.123"}, {"title": "Future Directions in Nanoconfined Adsorption Research", "authors": "Lucas Green, Ava Blue, Liam Yellow", "journal": "ACS Nano", "year": "2021", "volumes": "15", "first page": "6789", "last page": "6800", "DOI": "10.1021/acsnano.1c01234"}]}
