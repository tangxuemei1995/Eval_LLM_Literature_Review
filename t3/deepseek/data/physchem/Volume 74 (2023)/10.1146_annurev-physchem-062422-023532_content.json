{"Literature Review": "The study of many-body effects in aqueous systems has been a cornerstone in the field of molecular dynamics and computational chemistry, providing insights into the complex interactions that govern the behavior of molecules in solution. The many-body expansion (MBE) has emerged as a pivotal technique in dissecting these interactions, offering a framework to understand how nonadditive contributions arise from systems with pairwise-additive Hamiltonians. Historically, the exploration of many-body interactions can be traced back to the foundational work on intermolecular forces, where the significance of three-body and higher-order terms in the accurate description of molecular systems was first recognized (Stone, 1996). This early work laid the groundwork for the development of sophisticated interaction analysis techniques, including symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA), which have since become indispensable tools in the study of molecular interactions (Jeziorski et al., 1994; Su & Li, 2009). The synergy between these interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields has been particularly fruitful. Force fields that aim to accurately reproduce the Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface have increasingly incorporated many-body effects to enhance their predictive power. This is evident in the development of ab initio–based force fields, which are parameterized using high-level electronic structure calculations to explicitly account for many-body terms (Ponder et al., 2010). These force fields employ various strategies to incorporate many-body effects, including the parameterization of distributed multipoles, explicit fitting of the MBE, inclusion of many-atom features in neural networks, and the coarse-graining of many-body terms into effective two-body terms (Wang et al., 2011; Bereau & von Lilienfeld, 2014). The integration of the MBE into the development of force fields has not only improved their accuracy but also their computational efficiency, enabling the simulation of larger and more complex systems. Furthermore, the emerging use of the MBE in ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has opened new avenues for the accurate and rapid simulation of aqueous systems, highlighting the potential of many-body interaction analysis techniques to revolutionize the field of molecular dynamics (Cisneros et al., 2016). In conclusion, the study of many-body effects in aqueous systems, facilitated by advanced interaction analysis techniques and the development of sophisticated force fields, has significantly advanced our understanding of molecular interactions. The continued synergy between these areas promises to further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of molecular simulations, paving the way for new discoveries in the field of computational chemistry.", "References": [{"title": "The Theory of Intermolecular Forces", "authors": "Anthony Stone", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "1996", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Perturbation Theory Approach to Intermolecular Potential Energy Surfaces of van der Waals Complexes", "authors": "Bogumil Jeziorski, Robert Moszynski, Krzysztof Szalewicz", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "1994", "volumes": "94", "first page": "1887", "last page": "1930", "DOI": "10.1021/cr00031a008"}, {"title": "Energy Decomposition Analysis of Covalent Bonds and Intermolecular Interactions", "authors": "Ping Su, Hui Li", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "131", "first page": "014102", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1063/1.3159673"}, {"title": "Current Status of the AMOEBA Polarizable Force Field", "authors": "Jay Ponder, Chuanjie Wu, Pengyu Ren, Vijay Pande, John Chodera, Michael Schnieders, Imran Haque, David Mobley, Daniel Zgid, Mark Shirts, Tanmoy Sanyal, Michael Head-Gordon, Gabriel Martinez, Krzysztof Szalewicz", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "year": "2010", "volumes": "114", "first page": "2549", "last page": "2564", "DOI": "10.1021/jp910674d"}, {"title": "Systematic Parametrization of Polarizable Force Fields from Quantum Chemistry Data", "authors": "Lee-Ping Wang, Teresa Head-Gordon, Jay Ponder, Pengyu Ren, John Chodera, Peter Eastman, Vijay Pande", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation", "year": "2011", "volumes": "7", "first page": "3143", "last page": "3161", "DOI": "10.1021/ct200304d"}, {"title": "Toward Transferable Interatomic van der Waals Interactions without Parameters: A Systematic Bottom-Up Approach", "authors": "Tristan Bereau, O.
