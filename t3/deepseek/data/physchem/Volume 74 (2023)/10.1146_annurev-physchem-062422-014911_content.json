{"Literature Review": "The study of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures has unveiled a plethora of applications ranging from enhanced spectroscopies to photocatalysis and photothermal therapy. The core of these applications lies in the ability of LSPRs to confine light at subwavelength scales, significantly enhancing light-matter interactions. However, the dissipation of surface plasmons into electronic and vibrational excitations, a process known as photothermalization, sets a fundamental limit to this confinement. Understanding the mechanisms underlying photothermalization is crucial for optimizing plasmonic systems for various applications, especially under continuous, low-intensity illumination such as sunlight. Recent research has provided valuable insights into the physics and dynamics of photothermalization, particularly in distinguishing between steady-state behavior and ultrafast processes. This literature review aims to synthesize these findings, focusing on the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures and their implications for steady-state applications. The photothermalization process begins with the absorption of photons by metallic nanostructures, leading to the excitation of LSPRs. These excitations decay primarily through two pathways: the generation of nonthermal (hot) electrons and the excitation of phonons (lattice vibrations). The initial stages of this decay occur on ultrafast timescales (femtoseconds to picoseconds), where nonthermal electrons are generated with energies significantly above the Fermi level. These hot electrons can either thermalize among themselves, leading to an increase in the electron temperature, or transfer their energy to the lattice, increasing the phonon temperature. The efficiency and dynamics of these processes are influenced by the material properties, size, and shape of the nanostructures, as well as the wavelength and intensity of the incident light. In the steady-state regime, which is relevant for applications under continuous illumination, the system reaches a balance between the absorbed optical power and the heat dissipated to the environment. This balance is characterized by a steady-state temperature increase of the nanostructure, which can be measured using techniques such as Raman thermometry. Understanding the steady-state behavior is essential for designing plasmonic systems for photothermal applications, where the goal is to maximize the temperature increase for a given light intensity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering both the electronic and thermal properties of the nanostructures in predicting their steady-state temperature. For instance, the thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium plays a crucial role in determining the heat dissipation rate and, consequently, the steady-state temperature. Moreover, the interplay between the generation of hot electrons and their subsequent thermalization has been shown to affect the overall efficiency of photothermalization. In the context of photocatalysis, the generation of hot electrons offers an additional pathway for driving chemical reactions. However, the efficiency of this process depends on the ability to extract these electrons before they thermalize. Strategies to enhance hot electron extraction include the use of hybrid nanostructures, where the metallic component is coupled with a semiconductor or a molecular adsorbate. These hybrid systems can facilitate the transfer of hot electrons to the adjacent material, where they can participate in chemical reactions. In conclusion, the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures involve complex interactions between electronic and thermal processes. Recent advances in understanding these mechanisms, particularly in the steady-state regime, have provided valuable insights for optimizing plasmonic systems for applications such as photothermal therapy and photocatalysis. Future research should focus on further elucidating the role of material properties and nanostructure design in controlling the photothermalization process, as well as exploring new strategies for enhancing the efficiency of hot electron generation and extraction.", "References": [{"title": "Plasmon-induced hot carrier science and technology", "authors": "Peter Nordlander, Naomi J.
