{"Literature Review": "The advent of whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized genomic research, offering unprecedented insights into the genetic basis of diseases and traits. However, this technological advancement brings forth complex ethical, legal, and social implications, particularly concerning the return of results (RoR) to research participants. The literature underscores the importance of RoR in demonstrating respect for participant autonomy, fostering trust, and ensuring reciprocity in the research process (Green et al., 2013). Despite these benefits, the implementation of RoR practices remains inconsistent, highlighting a gap between ethical guidelines and research practices. Ethical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), recommend the return of findings associated with actionable conditions to participants, emphasizing the potential health benefits and the principle of beneficence (Kalia et al., 2017). However, the scope of what constitutes 'actionable' findings is subject to debate, with some advocating for a broader interpretation that includes findings with potential future relevance (Wolf et al., 2012). The legal landscape further complicates RoR practices. In the United States, entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide participants with their raw genomic data upon request, raising questions about the interpretation and utility of such data for individuals (Clayton et al., 2010). The ethical and legal considerations surrounding RoR are compounded by the challenges of variant interpretation, the potential for psychological harm, and the need for genetic counseling (Biesecker et al., 2018). Moreover, the literature highlights the importance of participant preferences in shaping RoR policies, with studies indicating a strong desire among participants to receive a wide range of findings, including those of uncertain significance (Bollinger et al., 2013). The integration of RoR into genomic research necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, involving ethicists, legal experts, genetic counselors, and researchers, to navigate the complex ethical and legal landscape and to develop policies that respect participant autonomy while minimizing potential harms (Jarvik et al., 2014). As genomic research continues to evolve, the establishment of standardized RoR practices that balance the benefits and risks of returning results will be crucial in fostering trust and ensuring the ethical conduct of research (McGuire et al., 2013). In conclusion, the literature calls for a paradigm shift towards a new normal in genomic research, where the return of interpreted results and raw data to participants is considered an integral part of the research process, guided by ethical principles, legal requirements, and participant preferences.", "References": [{"title": "ACMG recommendations for reporting of incidental findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing", "authors": "Green, Robert C., Berg, Jonathan S., Grody, Wayne W., Kalia, Sarah S., Korf, Bruce R., Martin, Christa L., McGuire, Amy L., Nussbaum, Robert L., O'Daniel, Julianne M., Ormond, Kelly E., Rehm, Heidi L., Watson, Michael S., Williams, Marc S., Biesecker, Leslie G.", "journal": "Genetics in Medicine", "year": "2013", "volumes": "15", "first page": "565", "last page": "574", "DOI": "10.1038/gim.2013.73"}, {"title": "Recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, 2016 update (ACMG SF v2.0): a policy statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics", "authors": "Kalia, Sarah S., Adelman, Karen, Bale, Sherri J., Chung, Wendy K., Eng, Christine, Evans, James P., Herman, Gail E., Hufnagel, Sarah B., Klein, Teri E., Korf, Bruce R., McKelvey, Kent D., Ormond, Kelly E., Richards, C.
