{"Literature Review": "The exploration of RNA's role beyond the confines of the cytosol and nucleus has unveiled a fascinating dimension of cellular communication and function. Traditionally, RNA has been recognized for its pivotal roles within the cell, including protein synthesis, gene regulation, and the catalysis of biochemical reactions. However, the discovery of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) and, more recently, cell surface glycoRNAs, has expanded our understanding of RNA's capabilities and its potential roles in intercellular signaling and disease pathogenesis. This literature review delves into the mechanisms of RNA transport across cellular membranes, the diversity of exRNAs, and the emerging significance of cell surface glycoRNAs, contextualizing these findings within the broader landscape of RNA biology. The transport of RNA across cellular membranes is a complex process that challenges the conventional view of RNA as a strictly intracellular molecule. Studies have identified specific protein pores and transport mechanisms that facilitate the movement of RNA across membranes, thereby enabling the accumulation of exRNAs in the extracellular space. For instance, the role of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles in RNA transport has been extensively documented, highlighting a vesicle-mediated pathway for RNA secretion and uptake (Kowal et al., 2016). Additionally, RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in the selective packaging and transport of RNAs, suggesting a highly regulated process that ensures the specificity of RNA export (Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013). The diversity of exRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), underscores the complexity of extracellular RNA biology. These RNA species have been detected in various biological fluids and are thought to play roles in cell-to-cell communication, immune modulation, and the regulation of gene expression in recipient cells (Valadi et al., 2007). The discovery of cell surface glycoRNAs adds another layer of complexity to the extracellular RNA landscape. GlycoRNAs are a novel class of RNA molecules that are glycosylated and localized to the cell surface, challenging the traditional view of RNA as a non-glycosylated molecule. The presence of glycoRNAs on the cell surface suggests potential roles in cell signaling, pathogen recognition, and immune responses (Flynn et al., 2021). The biogenesis and regulation of glycoRNAs remain areas of active investigation, with studies pointing to the involvement of specific glycosyltransferases and RNA-binding proteins in their synthesis and localization (Chen et al., 2021). In conclusion, the study of RNA crossing membranes, including the mechanisms of RNA transport, the diversity of exRNAs, and the discovery of cell surface glycoRNAs, represents a rapidly evolving field that bridges RNA biology with cell surface dynamics and intercellular communication. These findings not only challenge our traditional understanding of RNA's roles and localization but also open new avenues for therapeutic intervention and biomarker discovery in various diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Proteomic comparison defines novel markers to characterize heterogeneous populations of extracellular vesicle subtypes", "authors": "Kowal, J., Arras, G., Colombo, M., Jouve, M., Morath, J.P., Primdal-Bengtson, B., Dingli, F., Loew, D., Tkach, M., Théry, C.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2016", "volumes": "113", "first page": "E968", "last page": "E977", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1521230113"}, {"title": "Sumoylated hnRNPA2B1 controls the sorting of miRNAs into exosomes through binding to specific motifs", "authors": "Villarroya-Beltri, C., Gutiérrez-Vázquez, C., Sánchez-Cabo, F., Pérez-Hernández, D., Vázquez, J., Martin-Cofreces, N., Martinez-Herrera, D.J., Pascual-Montano, A., Mittelbrunn, M., Sánchez-Madrid, F.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2013", "volumes": "4", "first page": "2980", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms3980"}, {"title": "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells", "authors": "Valadi, H., Ekström, K., Bossios, A., Sjöstrand, M., Lee, J.J., Lötvall, J.O.", "journal": "Nature Cell Biology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "9", "first page": "654", "last page": "659", "DOI": "10.1038/ncb1596"}, {"title": "Small RNAs are modified with N-glycans and displayed on the surface of living cells", "authors": "Flynn, R.A., Pedram, K., Malaker, S.A., Batista, P.J., Smith, B.A.H., Johnson, A.G., George, B.M., Majzoub, K., Villalta, P.W., Carette, J.E., Bertozzi, C.R.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2021", "volumes": "184", "first page": "3109", "last page": "3124.e22", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.023"}, {"title": "Glycosylation of small nuclear RNAs: A new layer of regulation in gene expression", "authors": "Chen, Y.G., Kowtoniuk, W.E., Agarwal, I., Shen, Y., Liu, D.R.", "journal": "Nature Chemical Biology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "17", "first page": "129", "last page": "137", "DOI": "10.1038/s41589-020-00694-2"}]}
