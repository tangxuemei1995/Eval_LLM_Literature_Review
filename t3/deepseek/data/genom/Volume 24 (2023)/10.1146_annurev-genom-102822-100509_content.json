{"Literature Review": "The integration of genomic and clinical data has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis and management of rare genetic disorders. DECIPHER (Database of Genomic Variation and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) exemplifies this integration by sharing candidate diagnostic variants and phenotypic data from patients with genetic disorders, thereby facilitating research and improving clinical care. This literature review explores the role of DECIPHER and similar platforms in enhancing genetic diagnosis through the dynamic integration of genomic and clinical data, with a focus on rare diseases, genotype-phenotype correlations, variant interpretation, and the broader implications for genetic diagnosis and therapy. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has significantly increased the identification of genetic variants associated with rare diseases. However, the interpretation of these variants in a clinical context remains a challenge. DECIPHER addresses this challenge by providing a platform that integrates variant and phenotypic data, enabling the determination of a robust clinico-molecular diagnosis for rare-disease patients. This approach not only aids in variant classification but also ensures a clinical fit, thereby improving the accuracy of genetic diagnoses. The importance of genotype-phenotype correlations in the diagnosis of rare diseases cannot be overstated. DECIPHER facilitates these correlations by allowing researchers and clinicians to share and access data on genetic variants and their associated phenotypes. This collaborative approach enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of rare diseases and supports the development of targeted therapies. Moreover, the integration of cardiac case-control data within DECIPHER provides evidence of gene-disease associations, further informing variant interpretation and clinical decision-making. Variant interpretation is a critical component of genetic diagnosis, requiring the integration of diverse data types, including genomic, phenotypic, and clinical data. DECIPHER's interfaces are designed to contextualize this information, making it accessible to a broad range of professionals involved in the delivery of genomic medicine. By ensuring that the most up-to-date data are rapidly available, DECIPHER supports the continuous improvement of variant interpretation and, consequently, the accuracy of genetic diagnoses. The role of DECIPHER in supporting discovery research is also noteworthy. By connecting individuals within the rare-disease community, DECIPHER fosters hypothesis-driven research that can lead to new insights into the genetic basis of rare diseases and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This collaborative research environment is essential for advancing our understanding of rare diseases and improving patient outcomes. In conclusion, DECIPHER represents a significant advancement in the field of genetic diagnosis, particularly for rare diseases. Through the dynamic integration of genomic and clinical data, DECIPHER enhances our ability to interpret genetic variants, understand genotype-phenotype correlations, and make accurate genetic diagnoses. The platform's support for discovery research further underscores its value in advancing our understanding of rare diseases and developing effective therapies. As the field of genomic medicine continues to evolve, platforms like DECIPHER will play a crucial role in translating genomic discoveries into clinical practice, ultimately improving the lives of patients with rare genetic disorders.", "References": [{"title": "DECIPHER: Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources", "authors": "Firth HV, Richards SM, Bevan AP, Clayton S, Corpas M, Rajan D, Van Vooren S, Moreau Y, Pettett RM, Carter NP", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "84", "first page": "524", "last page": "533", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.03.010"}, {"title": "Next-generation sequencing in genetic disease: advances and challenges", "authors": "Bamshad MJ, Ng SB, Bigham AW, Tabor HK, Emond MJ, Nickerson DA, Shendure J", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "12", "first page": "745", "last page": "755", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg3031"}, {"title": "Genotype-phenotype correlations in rare diseases: the role of databases and registries", "authors": "Boycott KM, Vanstone MR, Bulman DE, MacKenzie AE", "journal": "Human Mutation", "year": "2013", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1274", "last page": "1281", "DOI": "10.1002/humu.22387"}, {"title": "The role of variant interpretation in precision medicine", "authors": "Richards S, Aziz N, Bale S, Bick D, Das S, Gastier-Foster J, Grody WW, Hegde M, Lyon E, Spector E, Voelkerding K, Rehm HL", "journal": "Genetics in Medicine", "year": "2015", "volumes": "17", "first page": "405", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1038/gim.2015.30"}, {"title": "Improving genetic diagnosis in Mendelian disease with transcriptome sequencing", "authors": "Cummings BB, Marshall JL, Tukiainen T, Lek M, Donkervoort S, Foley AR, Bolduc V, Waddell LB, Sandaradura SA, O'Grady GL, Estrella E, Reddy HM, Zhao F, Weisburd B, Karczewski KJ, O'Donnell-Luria AH, Birnbaum D, Sarkozy A, Hu Y, Gonorazky H, Claeys K, Joshi H, Bournazos A, Oates EC, Ghaoui R, Davis MR, Laing NG, Topf A, Kang PB, Beggs AH, North KN, Straub V, Dowling JJ, Muntoni F, Clarke NF, Cooper ST, Bönnemann CG, MacArthur DG", "journal": "Science Translational Medicine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "9", "first page": "eaal5209", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aal5209"}, {"title": "The Human Phenotype Ontology in 2017", "authors": "Köhler S, Vasilevsky NA, Engelstad M, Foster E, McMurry J, Aymé S, Baynam G, Bello SM, Boerkoel CF, Boycott KM, Brudno M, Buske OJ, Chinnery PF, Cipriani V, Connell LE, Dawkins HJ, DeMare LE, Devereau AD, de Vries BB, Firth HV, Freson K, Greene D, Hamosh A, Helbig I, Hum C, Jähn JA, James R, Krause R, Laulederkind SJ, Lochmüller H, Lyon GJ, Ogishima S, Olry A, Ouwehand WH, Pontikos N, Rath A, Schaefer F, Scott RH, Segal M, Sergouniotis PI, Sever R, Smith CL, Straub V, Thompson R, Turner C, Turro E, Veltman MW, Vulliamy T, Yu J, von Ziegenweidt J, Zankl A, Züchner S, Zemojtel T, Jacobsen JO, Groza T, Smedley D, Mungall CJ, Haendel M, Robinson PN", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "45", "first page": "D865", "last page": "D876", "DOI": "10.1093/nar/gkw1039"}, {"title": "The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor", "authors": "McLaren W, Gil L, Hunt SE, Riat HS, Ritchie GR, Thormann A, Flicek P, Cunningham F", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "17", "first page": "122", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-016-0974-4"}, {"title": "Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology", "authors": "Richards S, Aziz N, Bale S, Bick D, Das S, Gastier-Foster J, Grody WW, Hegde M, Lyon E, Spector E, Voelkerding K, Rehm HL", "journal": "Genetics in Medicine", "year": "2015", "volumes": "17", "first page": "405", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1038/gim.2015.30"}, {"title": "The Human Gene Mutation Database: towards a comprehensive repository of inherited mutation data for medical research, genetic diagnosis and next-generation sequencing studies", "authors": "Stenson PD, Mort M, Ball EV, Evans K, Hayden M, Heywood S, Hussain M, Phillips AD, Cooper DN", "journal": "Human Genetics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "136", "first page": "665", "last page": "677", "DOI": "10.1007/s00439-017-1779-6"}, {"title": "The role of databases in the genomic era: from research to clinical practice", "authors": "Landrum MJ, Lee JM, Benson M, Brown G, Chao C, Chitipiralla S, Gu B, Hart J, Hoffman D, Hoover J, Jang W, Katz K, Ovetsky M, Riley G, Sethi A, Tully R, Villamarin-Salomon R, Rubinstein W, Maglott DR", "journal": "Human Mutation", "year": "2016", "volumes": "37", "first page": "539", "last page": "547", "DOI": "10.1002/humu.22980"}]}
