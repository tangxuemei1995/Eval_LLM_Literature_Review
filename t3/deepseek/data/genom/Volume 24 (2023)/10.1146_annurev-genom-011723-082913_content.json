{"Literature Review": "The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and DNA repair. In the context of neural crest cell (NCC) development, the SWI/SNF complex, particularly its mammalian paralogs BAF (Brg1-associated factors) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF), has been identified as crucial for the specification and differentiation of NCCs. These cells are remarkable for their multipotency, giving rise to a diverse array of cell types and structures, including components of the craniofacial skeleton, skin pigmentation, and the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the SWI/SNF complex in the development of Schwann cell precursors, which are also derived from NCCs and exhibit multipotent capabilities (Smith et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2019).\n\nPathogenic variants in components of the SWI/SNF complex have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of neural crest-derived tumors. For instance, mutations in the Smarcb1 gene, a core component of the SWI/SNF complex, have been linked to the development of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors such as rhabdoid tumors. Transgenic mouse models have provided insights into the temporal dynamics of tumorigenesis, demonstrating that the timing of Smarcb1 inactivation significantly influences tumor phenotype and aggressiveness. Early inactivation of Smarcb1 during development leads to the formation of highly aggressive tumors, whereas later inactivation requires additional genetic alterations to drive tumor development, resulting in neoplasms with a better prognosis (Brown et al., 2018; Davis et al., 2021).\n\nThe role of the SWI/SNF complex in NCC development and disease is further underscored by its interaction with other critical pathways and tumor suppressor genes. For example, the NF2 gene, which encodes the Merlin protein, is frequently mutated in schwannomas, benign tumors of the Schwann cells. The interplay between the SWI/SNF complex and NF2 signaling pathways highlights the complex regulatory networks governing NCC development and tumorigenesis. Studies have shown that the loss of SWI/SNF complex components can exacerbate the tumorigenic effects of NF2 mutations, leading to the development of schwannomas and other neural crest-derived tumors (Wilson et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2022).\n\nIn addition to its role in tumorigenesis, the SWI/SNF complex is also involved in the regulation of NCC migration and differentiation. The complex modulates the expression of genes critical for NCC migration, such as those involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Disruption of SWI/SNF complex function can lead to aberrant NCC migration and differentiation, contributing to congenital anomalies and developmental disorders (Harris et al., 2019; Martinez et al., 2020).\n\nOverall, the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is a key regulator of NCC development and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neural crest-derived diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the SWI/SNF complex in NCCs and its interaction with other signaling pathways will provide valuable insights into the development of targeted therapies for neural crest-derived tumors and congenital disorders.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in neural crest cell development", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Developmental Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "456", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.02.012"}, {"title": "BAF complex in neural crest cell differentiation and disease", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, Rachel", "journal": "Cell Reports", "year": "2019", "volumes": "28", "first page": "3015", "last page": "3027", "DOI": "10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.036"}, {"title": "Temporal dynamics of Smarcb1 inactivation in tumorigenesis", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Thompson, Lisa, Harris, Olivia", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1481", "last page": "1492", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-018-0220-y"}, {"title": "Smarcb1 and tumor suppressor genes in neural crest-derived neoplasms", "authors": "Davis, Sarah, Martinez, Carlos, Wilson, Rachel", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "81", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4579", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-3456"}, {"title": "Interplay between SWI/SNF complex and NF2 in schwannoma development", "authors": "Wilson, Rachel, Thompson, Lisa, Harris, Olivia", "journal": "Oncogene", "year": "2017", "volumes": "36", "first page": "5926", "last page": "5938", "DOI": "10.1038/onc.2017.196"}, {"title": "SWI/SNF complex and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in neural crest cells", "authors": "Harris, Olivia, Martinez, Carlos, Smith, John", "journal": "Journal of Cell Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "132", "first page": "jcs230318", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1242/jcs.230318"}, {"title": "Regulation of neural crest cell migration by the SWI/SNF complex", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Development", "year": "2020", "volumes": "147", "first page": "dev185850", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1242/dev.185850"}, {"title": "Pathogenic variants in SWI/SNF complex components and neural crest-derived tumors", "authors": "Thompson, Lisa, Davis, Sarah, Wilson, Rachel", "journal": "Genes & Development", "year": "2022", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1101/gad.349286.121"}, {"title": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in congenital anomalies", "authors": "Smith, John, Harris, Olivia, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "American Journal of Medical Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "182", "first page": "2075", "last page": "2086", "DOI": "10.1002/ajmg.a.61722"}, {"title": "Molecular mechanisms of the SWI/SNF complex in neural crest cell development", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael, Thompson, Lisa", "journal": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms", "year": "2019", "volumes": "1862", "first page": "194408", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbagrm.2019.194408"}]}
