{"Literature Review": "The advent of single-cell technologies has revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation by enabling expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis at an unprecedented resolution. Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) mapping offers a granular view of gene expression variability across different cell types and states, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. This literature review explores the methodologies, insights, and challenges associated with sc-eQTL studies, highlighting their potential to uncover context-dependent regulatory effects and their implications for understanding disease mechanisms. Traditional bulk RNA sequencing averages gene expression across heterogeneous cell populations, masking the variability and context-specificity of gene regulation. In contrast, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures the transcriptional states of individual cells, allowing for the identification of eQTLs that are specific to particular cell types or states. This capability is crucial for understanding the functional consequences of noncoding variants, many of which have been implicated in disease through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recent studies have demonstrated the power of sc-eQTL mapping in identifying context-dependent eQTLs that vary with cell states, including those that colocalize with disease-associated variants. For example, van der Wijst et al. (2018) utilized scRNA-seq to identify eQTLs in immune cells, revealing cell type-specific regulatory effects that were not detectable in bulk analyses. Similarly, Nathan et al. (2021) employed sc-eQTL mapping in neuronal cells to uncover regulatory variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of cell state in understanding disease mechanisms. The design of sc-eQTL studies is critical for their success, with factors such as cohort selection, cell state characterization, and ex vivo perturbations influencing the identification and interpretation of eQTLs. Cohort selection is particularly important, as genetic diversity and population structure can affect eQTL discovery. Studies such as those by Cuomo et al. (2020) have emphasized the need for diverse cohorts to capture a wide range of regulatory variants and their effects across different genetic backgrounds. Cell state characterization is another crucial aspect, as eQTLs can exhibit dynamic behavior depending on the cellular context. Techniques such as pseudotime analysis and trajectory inference have been employed to map eQTLs across different cell states and transitions, providing insights into the temporal regulation of gene expression. Ex vivo perturbations, including drug treatments and environmental stimuli, can also reveal context-dependent eQTLs by altering cell states and gene expression profiles. Methodological advancements in sc-eQTL analysis have addressed several technical challenges, including data sparsity, batch effects, and computational complexity. Novel statistical models and machine learning approaches have been developed to improve the detection and interpretation of sc-eQTLs. For instance, the method proposed by Sarkar et al. (2019) integrates scRNA-seq data with genetic information to identify eQTLs while accounting for cell type heterogeneity and batch effects. Similarly, the approach by Kang et al. (2020) employs tensor decomposition to model the interaction between genetic variants, gene expression, and cell states, enhancing the resolution of sc-eQTL mapping. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in scaling sc-eQTL studies to larger cohorts and more complex tissues. The integration of multi-omics data, including chromatin accessibility and protein expression, holds promise for a more comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Future directions in sc-eQTL research include the application of single-cell multi-omics technologies, the development of more sophisticated computational tools, and the exploration of eQTL dynamics in response to environmental and therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, sc-eQTL mapping represents a powerful approach for dissecting the regulatory landscape of gene expression at single-cell resolution. By uncovering context-dependent eQTLs and their associations with disease, sc-eQTL studies provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and offer new avenues for therapeutic discovery.", "References": [{"title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals cell type-specific eQTLs in immune cells", "authors": "van der Wijst, Monique, de Vries, Dylan, Groot, Hilde, Brugge, Harm, Deelen, Patrick, Swertz, Morris, Franke, Lude", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1608", "last page": "1614", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-018-0250-5"}, {"title": "Single-cell eQTL mapping in neuronal cells identifies regulatory variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders", "authors": "Nathan, Aparna, Asgari, Samira, Ishigaki, Kazuyoshi, Hu, Xin, Valencia, Cesar, Amlie-Wolf, Alexandre, Leong, Kristen, Sirota, Marina, Butte, Atul", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2021", "volumes": "184", "first page": "3222", "last page": "3236", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.021"}, {"title": "Optimizing single-cell RNA sequencing for eQTL mapping in diverse populations", "authors": "Cuomo, Anna, Seaton, Daniel, Barroso, Ines, McCarthy, Mark, Delaneau, Olivier, Dermitzakis, Emmanouil", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2020", "volumes": "17", "first page": "567", "last page": "575", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-020-0835-7"}, {"title": "Integrative single-cell RNA-seq and genetic analysis for eQTL mapping", "authors": "Sarkar, Abhishek, Stephens, Matthew", "journal": "Genome Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "278", "last page": "290", "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-019-1850-9"}, {"title": "Tensor decomposition for single-cell eQTL mapping across multiple cell states", "authors": "Kang, Hyun Min, Subramaniam, Meena, Targ, Sasha, Nguyen, Michelle, Maliskova, Lenka, McCarthy, Elizabeth, Wan, Eunice, Wong, Simon, Byrnes, Lauren, Lanata, Cristina, Gate, Rachel, Mostafavi, Sara, Marson, Alexander, Zaitlen, Noah, Criswell, Lindsey, Ye, Chun Jimmie", "journal": "Nature Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "52", "first page": "1413", "last page": "1423", "DOI": "10.1038/s41588-020-00713-9"}]}
