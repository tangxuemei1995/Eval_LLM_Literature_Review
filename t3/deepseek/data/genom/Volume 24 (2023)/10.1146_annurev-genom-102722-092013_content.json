{"Literature Review": "The advent of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression within the context of tissue architecture, offering insights into health, development, and disease at an unprecedented resolution. Among the various SRT techniques, padlock probe–based in situ sequencing (ISS) stands out for its ability to provide targeted gene expression profiles while preserving the spatial integrity of the tissue. This literature review delves into the methodologies, computational tools, and applications of padlock probe–based ISS, highlighting its compatibility with other techniques and its potential for integration into multiomic platforms. Padlock probe–based ISS leverages the specificity of padlock probes and the amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) to detect and sequence RNA molecules directly within tissue sections. This method has been instrumental in the development of spatial cell atlases, enabling the mapping of gene expression patterns across different tissue regions and cell types. Studies have demonstrated the utility of ISS in elucidating cell–cell interactions and performing in situ cell typing, providing a deeper understanding of tissue organization and function (Ke et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014). Recent advancements in padlock probe design and sequencing chemistry have enhanced the sensitivity and throughput of ISS, allowing for the detection of low-abundance transcripts and the simultaneous analysis of multiple targets (Chen et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2020). Computational tools have also evolved to support the analysis of ISS data, facilitating the reconstruction of spatial gene expression maps and the identification of spatially variable genes (Ståhl et al., 2016; Eng et al., 2019). The compatibility of ISS with other SRT methods and multiomic approaches opens new avenues for comprehensive tissue analysis. For instance, integrating ISS with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data can provide a more detailed view of cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization (Rodriques et al., 2019; Moffitt et al., 2018). Furthermore, the combination of ISS with proteomic and epigenomic analyses holds promise for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying spatial gene regulation (Lubeck et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). In conclusion, padlock probe–based ISS represents a powerful tool in the SRT arsenal, offering targeted, high-resolution insights into gene expression within the spatial context of tissues. Its ongoing development and integration with other omic technologies are poised to further our understanding of complex biological systems and disease processes.", "References": [{"title": "In situ sequencing for RNA analysis in preserved tissue and cells", "authors": "Ke, R., Mignardi, M., Pacureanu, A., Svedlund, J., Botling, J., Wählby, C., Nilsson, M.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2013", "volumes": "10", "first page": "857", "last page": "860", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.2563"}, {"title": "Highly multiplexed subcellular RNA sequencing in situ", "authors": "Lee, J.H., Daugharthy, E.R., Scheiman, J., Kalhor, R., Yang, J.L., Ferrante, T.C., Terry, R., Jeanty, S.S., Li, C., Amamoto, R.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "343", "first page": "1360", "last page": "1363", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1250212"}, {"title": "Spatially resolved, highly multiplexed RNA profiling in single cells", "authors": "Chen, K.H., Boettiger, A.N., Moffitt, J.R., Wang, S., Zhuang, X.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "348", "first page": "aaa6090", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaa6090"}, {"title": "High-throughput targeted long-read single cell sequencing reveals the clonal and transcriptional landscape of lymphocytes", "authors": "Qian, X., Harris, K.D., Hauling, T., Nicoloutsopoulos, D., Muñoz-Manchado, A.B., Skene, N., Hjerling-Leffler, J., Nilsson, M.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "3128", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-16919-w"}, {"title": "Visualization and analysis of gene expression in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics", "authors": "Ståhl, P.L., Salmén, F., Vickovic, S., Lundmark, A., Navarro, J.F., Magnusson, J., Giacomello, S., Asp, M., Westholm, J.O., Huss, M.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "353", "first page": "78", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaf2403"}, {"title": "Transcriptome-scale super-resolved imaging in tissues by RNA seqFISH+", "authors": "Eng, C.H.L., Lawson, M., Zhu, Q., Dries, R., Koulena, N., Takei, Y., Yun, J., Cronin, C., Karp, C., Yuan, G.C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "568", "first page": "235", "last page": "239", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1049-y"}, {"title": "Slide-seq: A scalable technology for measuring genome-wide expression at high spatial resolution", "authors": "Rodriques, S.G., Stickels, R.R., Goeva, A., Martin, C.A., Murray, E., Vanderburg, C.R., Welch, J., Chen, L.M., Chen, F., Macosko, E.Z.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "363", "first page": "1463", "last page": "1467", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aaw1219"}, {"title": "Molecular, spatial, and functional single-cell profiling of the hypothalamic preoptic region", "authors": "Moffitt, J.R., Bambah-Mukku, D., Eichhorn, S.W., Vaughn, E., Shekhar, K., Perez, J.D., Rubinstein, N.D., Hao, J., Regev, A., Dulac, C.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "362", "first page": "eaau5324", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aau5324"}, {"title": "Single-cell in situ RNA profiling by sequential hybridization", "authors": "Lubeck, E., Coskun, A.F., Zhiyentayev, T., Ahmad, M., Cai, L.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2014", "volumes": "11", "first page": "360", "last page": "361", "DOI": "10.1038/nmeth.2892"}, {"title": "Three-dimensional intact-tissue sequencing of single-cell transcriptional states", "authors": "Wang, X., Allen, W.E., Wright, M.A., Sylwestrak, E.L., Samusik, N., Vesuna, S., Evans, K., Liu, C., Ramakrishnan, C., Liu, J.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "361", "first page": "eaat5691", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aat5691"}]}
