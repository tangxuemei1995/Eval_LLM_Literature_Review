{"Literature Review": "The axial length of the eye is a fundamental determinant of visual acuity, with deviations from the norm leading to significant visual impairments. Microphthalmia and high myopia represent two extremes of axial length abnormalities, each associated with distinct genetic and phenotypic profiles. This literature review explores the genetic determinants of axial length, focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying microphthalmia and high myopia, and the potential for shared genetic pathways in these conditions. Microphthalmia, characterized by an axial length of less than 19 mm in infancy or less than 21 mm in adulthood, is a congenital condition often resulting from disruptions in eye development during the first trimester of pregnancy. Research has identified over 90 genes implicated in microphthalmia, highlighting the genetic complexity of this condition (Slavotinek et al., 2016). These genes are involved in various aspects of eye development, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. On the other end of the spectrum, high myopia, defined by an axial length of 26.5 mm or more, is associated with excessive eye growth and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several hundred loci associated with myopia, underscoring the polygenic nature of this condition (Tedja et al., 2018). Despite the identification of numerous genes associated with microphthalmia and myopia, the diagnostic yield remains low, suggesting that many genetic contributors remain undiscovered. Recent advances in genetic research have begun to unravel the molecular pathways that regulate eye size, revealing potential overlaps between the mechanisms underlying microphthalmia and high myopia. For instance, mutations in the PAX6 gene, a key regulator of eye development, have been associated with both microphthalmia and myopia, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these conditions (Hanson et al., 1994). Additionally, studies have implicated the Wnt signaling pathway in the regulation of axial length, with alterations in this pathway contributing to both under- and overgrowth of the eye (Liu et al., 2013). Understanding the genetic determinants of axial length has important implications for the diagnosis and management of microphthalmia and high myopia. Improved knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations can enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform genetic counseling for affected families. Furthermore, dissecting the gene-environment interactions in myopia may lead to the development of targeted interventions to prevent or slow the progression of this condition. Finally, the identification of shared molecular pathways in microphthalmia and high myopia opens up new avenues for therapeutic research, with the potential for postnatal treatments that modulate eye growth. In conclusion, the genetic regulation of axial length is a complex process involving numerous genes and molecular pathways. While significant progress has been made in identifying the genetic contributors to microphthalmia and high myopia, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms underlying these conditions. Future research should focus on elucidating the shared and distinct genetic pathways in microphthalmia and high myopia, with the aim of improving diagnostic yields, understanding gene-environment interactions, and developing novel therapies for these visually debilitating conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Genetics of microphthalmia, anophthalmia and coloboma in humans", "authors": "Anne Slavotinek, Maria Kousi, Sarah E.
