{"Literature Review": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as pivotal players in the tumor microenvironment (TME), facilitating a complex network of intercellular communication that significantly influences cancer progression. These vesicles, encompassing exosomes and microvesicles, are secreted by tumor cells and carry a diverse array of bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can modulate the behavior of recipient cells within the TME (Kalluri, 2016). The cargo of tumor-derived EVs has been shown to include membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, as well as various RNA species and double-stranded DNA fragments, which can be transferred to stromal cells, inducing phenotypic changes that promote tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (Peinado et al., 2017).\n\nOne of the critical roles of tumor-derived EVs is their contribution to the formation of the premetastatic niche, a process that prepares distant sites for the colonization of circulating tumor cells. Through the transfer of specific EV cargoes, such as integrins and miRNAs, tumor-derived EVs can modify the extracellular matrix and recruit bone marrow-derived cells to these sites, thereby facilitating metastatic spread (Hoshino et al., 2015). Additionally, tumor-derived EVs have been implicated in immune evasion, a hallmark of cancer, by delivering immunosuppressive molecules to immune cells, thereby dampening the antitumor immune response (Whiteside, 2016).\n\nThe impact of tumor-derived EVs on cell migration and tumor invasion is another area of intense research. EVs can transfer oncogenic proteins and miRNAs to recipient cells, enhancing their migratory and invasive capabilities. For instance, the transfer of miR-21 and miR-29a via EVs has been shown to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in recipient cells, a key process in tumor invasion and metastasis (Zhang et al., 2015). Furthermore, tumor-derived EVs can interact with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-infiltrating cells, modulating their functions to support tumor progression (Luga et al., 2012).\n\nThe heterogeneity of tumor-derived EVs, both in terms of their number and content, has been linked to the tumor of origin, disease stage, and response to therapy. This variability has opened new avenues for the use of EVs as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification. Liquid biopsies, which involve the analysis of EVs in bodily fluids, offer a non-invasive method for the detection and monitoring of cancer, providing insights into tumor dynamics and therapeutic responses (Melo et al., 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, tumor-derived EVs are multifunctional entities that play a crucial role in the TME, influencing cancer progression through various mechanisms. Their ability to transfer bioactive molecules to recipient cells and modulate the TME highlights their potential as therapeutic targets and biomarkers. As research in this field continues to evolve, the development of EV-based liquid biopsies and therapeutic strategies holds promise for improving cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.", "References": [{"title": "The biology and function of exosomes in cancer", "authors": "Raghu Kalluri", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2016", "volumes": "126", "first page": "1208", "last page": "1215", "DOI": "10.1172/JCI81135"}, {"title": "Pre-metastatic niches: organ-specific homes for metastases", "authors": "Hector Peinado, Haiying Zhang, Irina R.
