{"Literature Review": "Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye, in genetically predisposed individuals. The disease is characterized by a chronic inflammatory response in the small intestine, leading to villous atrophy and malabsorption. The immunopathogenesis of CD is closely linked to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, particularly the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, which are present in the vast majority of patients. These HLA molecules play a crucial role in presenting gluten-derived peptides to CD4+ T cells, initiating an immune response that leads to the production of autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and the development of intestinal damage. The role of HLA-DQ molecules in CD is well-documented, with studies showing that these molecules have a high affinity for deamidated gluten peptides, which are generated by the action of TG2 on gluten. This posttranslational modification enhances the immunogenicity of gluten peptides, facilitating their presentation to T cells and the subsequent activation of both the adaptive and innate immune responses. The adaptive immune response in CD is characterized by the activation of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and interleukin-21 (IL-21), contributing to the inflammatory milieu and tissue damage. Additionally, B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CD through the production of autoantibodies against TG2. These autoantibodies are highly specific for CD and are used as diagnostic markers. The generation of TG2-specific autoantibodies is thought to be driven by the formation of complexes between TG2 and gluten peptides, which are then presented to B cells by HLA-DQ molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The innate immune system also contributes to the pathogenesis of CD, with evidence suggesting that gluten peptides can directly activate innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of additional immune cells to the gut mucosa. This innate immune response may play a role in the initial stages of the disease, before the activation of the adaptive immune response. Despite the significant advances in our understanding of the immunobiology of CD, many questions remain unanswered. For example, the mechanisms by which gluten peptides cross the intestinal barrier and reach the lamina propria are not fully understood. Additionally, the factors that determine why only a subset of individuals with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 develop CD are still unclear. Environmental factors, such as infections and the composition of the gut microbiota, have been proposed to play a role in the development of CD, but their exact contributions are still under investigation. In conclusion, CD is a multifactorial disease that results from the interplay between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. The HLA system, particularly the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CD by presenting gluten peptides to T cells and initiating an immune response that leads to intestinal damage. The production of autoantibodies against TG2 is a hallmark of CD and provides a link between the adaptive immune response and the development of autoimmunity. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex immunobiology of CD and to develop new therapeutic strategies for this common and debilitating disease.", "References": [{"title": "Celiac disease: from pathogenesis to novel therapies", "authors": "Ludvigsson, J.F., Leffler, D.A., Bai, J.C., Biagi, F., Fasano, A., Green, P.H., Hadjivassiliou, M., Kaukinen, K., Kelly, C.P., Leonard, J.N.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "142", "first page": "317", "last page": "332", "DOI": "10.1053/j.gastro.2011.11.003"}, {"title": "The immunobiology of gluten sensitivity beyond the intestinal tract", "authors": "Sapone, A., Bai, J.C., Ciacci, C., Dolinsek, J., Green, P.H., Hadjivassiliou, M., Kaukinen, K., Rostami, K., Sanders, D.S., Schumann, M.", "journal": "European Journal of Internal Medicine", "year": "2012", "volumes": "23", "first page": "8", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ejim.2011.08.003"}, {"title": "Celiac disease and autoimmunity: review and controversies", "authors": "Fasano, A., Catassi, C.", "journal": "Current Allergy and Asthma Reports", "year": "2012", "volumes": "12", "first page": "508", "last page": "516", "DOI": "10.1007/s11882-012-0293-0"}, {"title": "The role of HLA-DQ8 in the pathogenesis of celiac disease", "authors": "Sollid, L.M., Qiao, S.W., Anderson, R.P., Gianfrani, C., Koning, F.", "journal": "Immunogenetics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "64", "first page": "455", "last page": "460", "DOI": "10.1007/s00251-012-0609-1"}, {"title": "Innate immunity and celiac disease", "authors": "Meresse, B., Malamut, G., Cerf-Bensussan, N.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Gastroenterology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "28", "first page": "559", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1097/MOG.0b013e3283577daf"}, {"title": "Celiac disease: role of the epithelial barrier", "authors": "Schumann, M., Richter, J.F., Wedell, I., Moos, V., Zimmermann-Kordmann, M., Schneider, T., Daum, S., Zeitz, M., Fromm, M., Schulzke, J.D.", "journal": "Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "3", "first page": "150", "last page": "162", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jcmgh.2016.12.006"}, {"title": "The role of transglutaminase 2 in the pathogenesis of celiac disease", "authors": "Dieterich, W., Ehnis, T., Bauer, M., Donner, P., Volta, U., Riecken, E.O., Schuppan, D.", "journal": "Journal of Autoimmunity", "year": "1997", "volumes": "10", "first page": "435", "last page": "440", "DOI": "10.1006/jaut.1997.0150"}, {"title": "Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review", "authors": "Lebwohl, B., Sanders, D.S., Green, P.H.", "journal": "BMC Medicine", "year": "2018", "volumes": "16", "first page": "142", "last page": "142", "DOI": "10.1186/s12916-018-1133-4"}, {"title": "The interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of celiac disease", "authors": "Jabri, B., Sollid, L.M.", "journal": "Mucosal Immunology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "2", "first page": "368", "last page": "378", "DOI": "10.1038/mi.2009.23"}, {"title": "Environmental factors in the development of celiac disease", "authors": "Verdu, E.F., Galipeau, H.J., Jabri, B.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "148", "first page": "1175", "last page": "1186", "DOI": "10.1053/j.gastro.2015.02.043"}]}
