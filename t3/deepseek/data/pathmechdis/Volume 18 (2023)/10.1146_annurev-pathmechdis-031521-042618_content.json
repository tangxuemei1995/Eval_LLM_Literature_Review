{"Literature Review": "Mastocytosis represents a complex and heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in various tissues. The disease spectrum ranges from cutaneous forms, which primarily affect the skin, to systemic mastocytosis (SM), which involves multiple organ systems. The classification of SM into indolent, smoldering, aggressive forms, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and mast cell leukemia underscores the diversity in clinical presentation and prognosis associated with these conditions (Valent et al., 2017). Central to the pathogenesis of mastocytosis is the gain-of-function mutation in the KIT gene, particularly the KIT D816V mutation, which is found in the majority of SM patients. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the KIT receptor, promoting mast cell proliferation and survival (Arock et al., 2015). Beyond KIT mutations, additional genetic alterations and the presence of comorbidities further influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Pardanani, 2016). The clinical manifestations of mastocytosis are not only a consequence of mast cell infiltration but also result from the release of mast cell mediators, which can lead to symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis (Theoharides et al., 2012). Diagnosis of mastocytosis relies on a combination of clinical, histological, and molecular criteria, with serum tryptase levels serving as a useful biomarker for disease burden and monitoring (Sperr et al., 2014). Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mastocytosis have paved the way for the development of targeted therapies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as midostaurin, have shown efficacy in patients with advanced SM, including those harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Gotlib et al., 2016). Additionally, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting mast cell mediator release or targeting specific signaling pathways are under investigation, offering hope for improved management of this challenging disease (Ustun et al., 2018). The integration of genetic profiling into clinical practice holds promise for personalized treatment approaches, potentially improving prognostication and therapeutic outcomes for patients with mastocytosis (Reiter et al., 2019). As research continues to unravel the complexities of mastocytosis, emerging concepts in diagnosis and therapy are expected to enhance our ability to effectively manage this condition, ultimately improving the quality of life for affected individuals.", "References": [{"title": "Standards and standardization in mastocytosis: consensus statements on diagnostics, treatment recommendations and response criteria", "authors": "Peter Valent, Cem Akin, Karin Hartmann, Andreas Reiter, Jason Gotlib, Dean D.
