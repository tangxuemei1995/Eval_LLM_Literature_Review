{"Literature Review": "The liver is a central organ in the regulation of metabolism, detoxification, and homeostasis, with hepatocytes playing a pivotal role in these processes. The concept of metabolic zonation refers to the spatial and temporal distribution of metabolic functions across the liver lobule, enabling the efficient execution of complex, multistep metabolic processes. This review explores the current understanding of spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its implications for liver pathophysiology. Spatial zonation within the liver lobule divides hepatocytes into periportal, midlobular, and pericentral zones, each specialized for distinct metabolic tasks. Periportal hepatocytes are primarily involved in gluconeogenesis, ureagenesis, and oxidative energy metabolism, while pericentral hepatocytes specialize in glycolysis, lipogenesis, and xenobiotic detoxification. This spatial organization is crucial for the sequential processing of metabolites and the efficient allocation of metabolic tasks to the appropriate microenvironment. Temporal zonation, on the other hand, aligns liver metabolism with the body's circadian rhythms, ensuring that metabolic processes are synchronized with feeding and fasting cycles. The circadian clock regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, detoxification, and other liver functions, thereby optimizing metabolic efficiency and energy utilization. Disruption of this spatiotemporal organization can lead to metabolic dysregulation and contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases. For instance, impaired metabolic zonation has been associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Recent advances in technology, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have provided new insights into the gene expression networks that control liver zonation and how their deregulation may underlie various liver pathologies. These studies have highlighted the role of signaling pathways, such as the WNT/β-catenin pathway, in establishing and maintaining liver zonation. Furthermore, research into liver monogenic diseases has revealed how mutations in specific genes can disrupt metabolic zonation and lead to liver dysfunction. The field of chronopharmacology has also benefited from understanding liver zonation, as the timing of drug administration can be optimized based on the circadian regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation is a fundamental aspect of liver physiology, with significant implications for liver pathobiology. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate liver zonation and how they are disrupted in disease states is crucial for developing targeted therapies for liver disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic zonation of the liver: The oxygen gradient revisited", "authors": "Jungermann K, Kietzmann T", "journal": "Redox Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "11", "first page": "622", "last page": "630", "DOI": "10.1016/j.redox.2016.12.012"}, {"title": "Liver zonation occurs through a β-catenin-dependent, c-Myc-independent mechanism", "authors": "Benhamouche S, Decaens T, Godard C, Chambrey R, Rickman DS, Moinard C, Vasseur-Cognet M, Kuo CJ, Kahn A, Perret C, Colnot S", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "130", "first page": "1119", "last page": "1131", "DOI": "10.1053/j.gastro.2006.01.004"}, {"title": "The circadian clock and liver function in health and disease", "authors": "Zhang R, Lahens NF, Ballance HI, Hughes ME, Hogenesch JB", "journal": "Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "11", "first page": "507", "last page": "515", "DOI": "10.1038/nrgastro.2014.72"}, {"title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the landscape of intrahepatic zonation and intercellular heterogeneity in the liver", "authors": "Halpern KB, Shenhav R, Matcovitch-Natan O, Toth B, Lemze D, Golan M, Massasa EE, Baydatch S, Landen S, Moor AE, Brandis A, Giladi A, Stokar-Avihail A, David E, Amit I, Itzkovitz S", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2017", "volumes": "67", "first page": "322", "last page": "333", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2017.06.007"}, {"title": "Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver development, homeostasis, and pathobiology", "authors": "Thompson MD, Monga SP", "journal": "Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease", "year": "2007", "volumes": "2", "first page": "85", "last page": "101", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.091942"}, {"title": "Chronopharmacology: new insights and therapeutic implications", "authors": "Smolensky MH, Lemmer B, Reinberg AE", "journal": "Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "47", "first page": "593", "last page": "628", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.47.120505.105237"}, {"title": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a review", "authors": "Younossi ZM, Koenig AB, Abdelatif D, Fazel Y, Henry L, Wymer M", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2016", "volumes": "315", "first page": "2443", "last page": "2454", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2016.5374"}, {"title": "The role of the liver in glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mellitus", "authors": "Roden M, Bernroider E", "journal": "Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice", "year": "2002", "volumes": "57", "first page": "S27", "last page": "S34", "DOI": "10.1016/S0168-8227(02)00043-6"}, {"title": "Spatial transcriptomics: paving the way for tissue-level systems biology", "authors": "Ståhl PL, Salmén F, Vickovic S, Lundmark A, Navarro JF, Magnusson J, Giacomello S, Asp M, Westholm JO, Huss M, Mollbrink A, Linnarsson S, Codeluppi S, Borg Å, Pontén F, Costea PI, Sahlén P, Mulder J, Bergmann O, Lundeberg J, Frisén J", "journal": "Current Opinion in Biotechnology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "39", "first page": "194", "last page": "200", "DOI": "10.1016/j.copbio.2016.04.004"}, {"title": "Monogenic diseases that affect the liver", "authors": "Balistreri WF, Bezerra JA, Jansen P, Karpen SJ, Shneider BL, Suchy FJ", "journal": "Clinical Liver Disease", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1", "last page": "5", "DOI": "10.1002/cld.484"}]}
