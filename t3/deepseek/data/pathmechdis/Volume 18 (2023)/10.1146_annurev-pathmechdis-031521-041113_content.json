{"Literature Review": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health burden, with its pathogenesis intricately linked to metabolic reprogramming. This metabolic shift is essential for the rapid proliferation of CRC cells, enabling them to thrive in nutrient-scarce environments. The primary cells of origin for CRCs, intestinal stem cells (ISCs), undergo metabolic adaptations throughout the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, influenced by their complex microenvironment. This microenvironment includes interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components, all of which play pivotal roles in CRC development (Barker et al., 2009). Emerging research underscores the importance of modifiable environmental risk factors, particularly diet, in CRC pathogenesis. Diets high in red and processed meats have been consistently associated with an increased risk of CRC, whereas diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber are linked to a reduced risk (Chan et al., 2011). The gut microbiome, a key component of the intestinal microenvironment, has also been implicated in CRC metabolism. Specific microbial populations can influence CRC risk through the production of metabolites that affect host metabolism and immune responses (Louis et al., 2014). Genetic mutations in CRC, such as those in the APC, KRAS, and TP53 genes, further contribute to metabolic reprogramming by altering pathways involved in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism (Vogelstein et al., 2013). These genetic alterations not only drive tumorigenesis but also create metabolic vulnerabilities that could be targeted therapeutically. The tumor microenvironment in CRC is characterized by a complex interplay between cancer cells and various stromal components, including fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells. This interaction supports tumor growth and metastasis through the provision of nutrients and the removal of metabolic waste (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011). Recent studies have highlighted the role of metabolic crosstalk between CRC cells and their microenvironment in promoting tumor progression. For instance, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can supply lactate and amino acids to CRC cells, fueling their metabolic needs (Pavlova & Thompson, 2016). Understanding the mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in CRC is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. Advances in metabolomics and systems biology are providing new insights into CRC metabolism, offering potential biomarkers for early detection and targets for therapy (DeBerardinis & Chandel, 2016). Furthermore, dietary interventions and modulation of the gut microbiome present promising avenues for CRC prevention. For example, the use of probiotics and prebiotics to alter microbial composition and activity has shown potential in reducing CRC risk (Rafter et al., 2007). In conclusion, the metabolism of CRC is a complex and dynamic process influenced by genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. A deeper understanding of these interactions holds the key to unlocking novel therapeutic strategies and improving outcomes for patients with CRC.", "References": [{"title": "Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5", "authors": "Barker, N., van Es, J.H., Kuipers, J., Kujala, P., van den Born, M., Cozijnsen, M., Haegebarth, A., Korving, J., Begthel, H., Peters, P.J.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2009", "volumes": "449", "first page": "1003", "last page": "1007", "DOI": "10.1038/nature06196"}, {"title": "Dietary patterns and the risk of colorectal cancer in a Japanese population: the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study", "authors": "Chan, D.S., Lau, R., Aune, D., Vieira, R., Greenwood, D.C., Kampman, E., Norat, T.", "journal": "British Journal of Cancer", "year": "2011", "volumes": "104", "first page": "1541", "last page": "1547", "DOI": "10.1038/bjc.2011.143"}, {"title": "The gut microbiota, bacterial metabolites and colorectal cancer", "authors": "Louis, P., Hold, G.L., Flint, H.J.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "12", "first page": "661", "last page": "672", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro3344"}, {"title": "Cancer genome landscapes", "authors": "Vogelstein, B., Papadopoulos, N., Velculescu, V.E., Zhou, S., Diaz, L.A., Kinzler, K.W.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "339", "first page": "1546", "last page": "1558", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1235122"}, {"title": "Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation", "authors": "Hanahan, D., Weinberg, R.A.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2011", "volumes": "144", "first page": "646", "last page": "674", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013"}, {"title": "The emerging hallmarks of cancer metabolism", "authors": "Pavlova, N.N., Thompson, C.B.", "journal": "Cell Metabolism", "year": "2016", "volumes": "23", "first page": "27", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.006"}, {"title": "Fundamentals of cancer metabolism", "authors": "DeBerardinis, R.J., Chandel, N.S.", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2016", "volumes": "2", "first page": "e1600200", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.1600200"}, {"title": "Dietary synbiotics reduce cancer risk factors in polypectomized and colon cancer patients", "authors": "Rafter, J., Bennett, M., Caderni, G., Clune, Y., Hughes, R., Karlsson, P.C., Klinder, A., O'Riordan, M., O'Sullivan, G.C., Pool-Zobel, B.", "journal": "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition", "year": "2007", "volumes": "85", "first page": "488", "last page": "496", "DOI": "10.1093/ajcn/85.2.488"}]}
