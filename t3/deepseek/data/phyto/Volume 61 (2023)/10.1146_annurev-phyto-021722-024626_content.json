{"Literature Review": "The global forest health crisis represents a significant challenge to ecological sustainability, driven by the introduction of non-native pathogens and insects through global trade. This crisis not only threatens the biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by forests but also poses a complex public-good social dilemma that necessitates international collective action for effective management and mitigation. The literature underscores the urgency of addressing this crisis through a multifaceted approach that includes stakeholder engagement, accountability, pooled support, and the valuation of forest ecosystems. The introduction of non-native species has been identified as a primary driver of forest degradation, with global trade facilitating the spread of these destructive agents. Studies have shown that the economic and ecological impacts of such invasions are profound, leading to significant losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services (Aukema et al., 2010). The concept of the forest health crisis as a public-good social dilemma is supported by the understanding that forests provide essential services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, making their protection a collective responsibility (Costanza et al., 1997). Addressing this crisis requires a framework that incorporates principles of collective action, as proposed by Ostrom (1990), who emphasized the importance of inclusive stakeholder engagement, clear accountability, and shared support mechanisms in managing common-pool resources. Inclusive stakeholder engagement is crucial for building trust and setting common goals, as highlighted by Reed et al. (2009), who argue that participatory approaches can enhance the effectiveness of natural resource management. Accountability for destructive pest introductions is another critical component, with studies suggesting that assigning responsibility can incentivize preventive measures and reduce the risk of future invasions (Perrings et al., 2002). Pooled support for weakest-link partners is essential for ensuring that all countries, regardless of their economic status, can implement effective biosecurity measures. This approach is supported by the work of Barrett (2007), who discusses the importance of international cooperation in addressing global environmental challenges. Finally, the inclusion of intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems in risk assessment is vital for capturing the full range of benefits provided by forests. The work of Daily et al. (2000) on ecosystem services highlights the importance of considering these values in environmental decision-making. In conclusion, the global forest health crisis requires a coordinated international response that leverages the principles of collective action. By engaging stakeholders, ensuring accountability, providing pooled support, and valuing forest ecosystems, it is possible to shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm towards a more resilient state.", "References": [{"title": "Economic Impacts of Non-Native Forest Insects in the Continental United States", "authors": "Juliann E.
