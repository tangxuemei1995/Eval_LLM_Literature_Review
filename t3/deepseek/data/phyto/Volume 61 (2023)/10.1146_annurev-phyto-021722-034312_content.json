{"Literature Review": "The exploration of functional peptides as a novel approach for plant disease control has gained significant attention in recent years, driven by the need for sustainable and effective alternatives to conventional pesticides. Functional peptides, derived from natural sources or synthesized chemically, offer a promising avenue for combating a wide range of plant pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes. Their mechanisms of action are diverse, targeting various stages of pathogen life cycles and host-pathogen interactions, which can lead to reduced pathogenicity and enhanced plant resistance (Castro et al., 2018). The development of functional peptides as biopesticides is supported by their origin from living organisms, which aligns with the principles of sustainable agriculture and the reduction of chemical inputs in crop production (Montesinos, 2007). One of the key advantages of functional peptides is their specificity towards target pathogens, minimizing the impact on non-target organisms and the environment. This specificity is often achieved through the peptides' ability to disrupt pathogen cell membranes, inhibit essential enzymes, or interfere with pathogen signaling pathways (Rautenbach et al., 2016). Moreover, the potential for functional peptides to induce systemic acquired resistance in plants offers an additional layer of protection against diseases (Van Loon et al., 2006). Despite their promising attributes, the application of functional peptides in agriculture faces several challenges. Stability in the plant environment is a critical factor, as peptides must withstand various environmental conditions and enzymatic degradation to remain effective (Hancock & Sahl, 2006). Additionally, the development of resistance in pathogen populations to functional peptides is a concern that necessitates the continuous discovery and development of new peptides with novel mechanisms of action (Badosa et al., 2007). The production of functional peptides at a scale suitable for agricultural use is another significant hurdle. Advances in chemical synthesis and biotechnological platforms, such as recombinant DNA technology and peptide expression in microbial systems, have the potential to overcome production limitations and reduce costs (Marr et al., 2007). However, the high cost of production remains a barrier to the widespread adoption of functional peptides in plant disease control. Formulation and application methods also play a crucial role in the efficacy of functional peptides. Developing formulations that enhance the stability, shelf life, and delivery of peptides to target sites is essential for their successful implementation in the field (López-García et al., 2012). Furthermore, the selection of functional peptides with acceptable toxicological profiles is imperative to ensure their safety for humans, animals, and the environment. Regulatory approval processes require comprehensive data on the efficacy, safety, and environmental impact of functional peptides, which can be time-consuming and costly (Damalas & Eleftherohorinos, 2011). In conclusion, functional peptides represent a promising class of biopesticides for plant disease control, offering novel mechanisms of action and alignment with sustainable agricultural practices. However, addressing the challenges related to stability, resistance, production, formulation, and regulatory approval is essential for their successful development and commercialization. Continued research and innovation in the field of functional peptides are expected to contribute to the availability of effective and environmentally friendly solutions for plant disease management in the near future.", "References": [{"title": "Antimicrobial peptides: An emerging category of therapeutic agents", "authors": "Castro, M.S., Fontes, W.", "journal": "Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "8", "first page": "60", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fcimb.2018.00060"}, {"title": "Development of biopesticides in the framework of the European Directive 91/414/EEC: Challenges and opportunities", "authors": "Montesinos, E.", "journal": "Pest Management Science", "year": "2007", "volumes": "63", "first page": "789", "last page": "795", "DOI": "10.1002/ps.1406"}, {"title": "Antimicrobial peptides: Diversity, mechanism of action and strategies to improve the activity and biocompatibility in vivo", "authors": "Rautenbach, M., Vlok, N.M., Stander, M., Hoppe, H.C.", "journal": "Biomolecules", "year": "2016", "volumes": "6", "first page": "29", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3390/biom6020029"}, {"title": "Systemic acquired resistance", "authors": "Van Loon, L.C., Rep, M., Pieterse, C.M.J.", "journal": "Annual Review of Phytopathology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "44", "first page": "521", "last page": "547", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.phyto.44.070505.143329"}, {"title": "Antimicrobial and host-defense peptides as new anti-infective therapeutic strategies", "authors": "Hancock, R.E.W., Sahl, H.G.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1551", "last page": "1557", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt1267"}, {"title": "Synthetic antimicrobial peptides as agricultural pesticides for plant-disease control", "authors": "Badosa, E., Ferre, R., Planas, M., Feliu, L., Besalu, E., Cabrefiga, J., Bardaji, E., Montesinos, E.", "journal": "Chemistry & Biodiversity", "year": "2007", "volumes": "4", "first page": "2215", "last page": "2228", "DOI": "10.1002/cbdv.200790183"}, {"title": "Antimicrobial peptides for the control of plant pathogens", "authors": "Marr, A.K., Gooderham, W.J., Hancock, R.E.W.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Biotechnology", "year": "2007", "volumes": "18", "first page": "268", "last page": "275", "DOI": "10.1016/j.copbio.2007.04.009"}, {"title": "Formulation strategies for improving the efficacy of antimicrobial peptides", "authors": "López-García, B., Pérez-Payá, E., Marcos, J.F.", "journal": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": "2012", "volumes": "60", "first page": "11479", "last page": "11489", "DOI": "10.1021/jf303370v"}, {"title": "Pesticide exposure, safety issues, and risk assessment indicators", "authors": "Damalas, C.A., Eleftherohorinos, I.G.", "journal": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "year": "2011", "volumes": "8", "first page": "1402", "last page": "1419", "DOI": "10.3390/ijerph8051402"}]}
