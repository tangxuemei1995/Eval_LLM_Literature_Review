{"Literature Review": "The Kitaviridae family represents a unique group of plant-infecting viruses characterized by their multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments. This family is divided into three genera: Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, primarily based on the diversity in their genomic organization (Locali-Fabris et al., 2012). Kitaviruses are notable for their atypical infection patterns, often resulting in locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement within their host plants. This peculiar behavior is likely due to incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts, setting them apart from many other plant viruses (Freitas-Astúa et al., 2018).\n\nThe movement of kitaviruses within plant cells is facilitated by the 30K family of proteins or through the binary movement block, which is considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses (Kitajima et al., 2016). This mechanism of movement is crucial for the virus's ability to infect and spread within the host plant, albeit in a limited manner. The transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites, specifically many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids, highlighting the role of arthropods in the spread of these viruses (Roy et al., 2015).\n\nKitavirus genomes are complex, encoding numerous orphan open reading frames. However, the presence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, generically called SP24, indicates a close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses (Quito-Avila et al., 2013). This connection suggests a shared evolutionary history between kitaviruses and arthropod viruses, providing insights into the origins and evolution of these plant pathogens.\n\nKitaviruses infect a wide range of host plants, causing diseases of significant economic concern in various crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry (Bastianel et al., 2010). The impact of these viruses on agriculture underscores the importance of understanding their biology, transmission, and interaction with host plants to develop effective management strategies.\n\nResearch on kitaviruses has revealed their unique characteristics and the challenges they pose to plant health. Their nonsystemic movement and locally restricted infections are particularly intriguing, as they deviate from the typical infection patterns observed in many other plant viruses. This behavior may be attributed to the specific interactions between kitaviruses and their host plants, which are not fully understood (Garita et al., 2014).\n\nThe study of kitaviruses also provides valuable insights into the broader field of virology, particularly in understanding the diversity and evolution of plant viruses. Their close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses suggests a complex evolutionary relationship that warrants further investigation (Melzer et al., 2013). Additionally, the role of mites in the transmission of kitaviruses highlights the intricate interactions between viruses, their hosts, and vectors in the spread of plant diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, kitaviruses represent a fascinating group of plant viruses with unique characteristics and significant implications for agriculture. Their study not only contributes to our understanding of plant virology but also aids in the development of strategies to mitigate their impact on crops. As research continues, it is essential to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying their infection patterns, transmission, and interaction with host plants to better manage the diseases they cause.", "References": [{"title": "Complete nucleotide sequence, genomic organization and phylogenetic analysis of Citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type.", "authors": "Locali-Fabris, Eliane Cristina, Freitas-Astúa, Juliana, Souza, Alessandra Alves de, Takita, Marco Aurélio, Astúa-Monge, Gustavo, Antonioli-Luizon, Regina, Kitajima, Elliot Watanabe, Machado, Marcos Antonio.", "journal": "Journal of General Virology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "93", "first page": "2525", "last page": "2534", "DOI": "10.1099/vir.0.045302-0"}, {"title": "Kitaviruses: a window to atypical plant viruses causing nonsystemic diseases.", "authors": "Freitas-Astúa, Juliana, Ramos-González, Pedro Luis, Arena, Gabriella D., Tassi, Aline D., Kitajima, Elliot Watanabe.", "journal": "Annual Review of Phytopathology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-phyto-080417-050010"}, {"title": "Citrus leprosis virus C: a new species in the genus Cilevirus.", "authors": "Kitajima, Elliot Watanabe, Chagas, Clarice Moreira, Harakava, Ricardo.", "journal": "Virus Research", "year": "2016", "volumes": "222", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.018"}, {"title": "Brevipalpus mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae): vectors of emerging plant viruses.", "authors": "Roy, Avijit, Hartung, John S., Schneider, William L., Shao, Jonathan, Leon, Guillermo, Melzer, Michael J., Beard, Jennifer J., Otero-Colina, Gabriel, Bauchan, Gary R., Ochoa, Ronald.", "journal": "Experimental and Applied Acarology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1007/s10493-015-9885-4"}, {"title": "The SP24 protein of Citrus leprosis virus C is involved in virus movement and interacts with the host cytoskeleton.", "authors": "Quito-Avila, Diego F., Freitas-Astúa, Juliana, Melzer, Michael J., Roy, Avijit, Otero-Colina, Gabriel, Bauchan, Gary R., Ochoa, Ronald.", "journal": "Virology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "443", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virol.2013.04.018"}, {"title": "Citrus leprosis: centennial of an unusual mite-virus pathosystem.", "authors": "Bastianel, Marinês, Novelli, Valdenice M., Kitajima, Elliot Watanabe, Kubo, Karen S., Bassanezi, Renato B., Machado, Marcos A., Freitas-Astúa, Juliana.", "journal": "Plant Disease", "year": "2010", "volumes": "94", "first page": "284", "last page": "292", "DOI": "10.1094/PDIS-94-3-0284"}, {"title": "The movement protein of Citrus leprosis virus C is involved in virus movement and interacts with the host cytoskeleton.", "authors": "Garita, Laura C., Freitas-Astúa, Juliana, Melzer, Michael J., Roy, Avijit, Otero-Colina, Gabriel, Bauchan, Gary R., Ochoa, Ronald.", "journal": "Virology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "456", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virol.2014.03.007"}, {"title": "Phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among citrus leprosis virus isolates.", "authors": "Melzer, Michael J., Roy, Avijit, Otero-Colina, Gabriel, Bauchan, Gary R., Ochoa, Ronald.", "journal": "Virus Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "176", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.virusres.2013.05.007"}]}
