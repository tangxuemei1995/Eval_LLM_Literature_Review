{"Literature Review": "Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV) represents a significant threat to global agriculture, particularly affecting tomato and pepper crops. First identified in Jordan in 2015, ToBRFV has rapidly spread across continents, challenging existing disease management strategies due to its unique characteristics and transmission pathways. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on ToBRFV, focusing on its discovery, epidemiology, detection methods, and strategies for prevention and control, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of this emerging pathogen and its impact on agriculture. The discovery of ToBRFV marked a pivotal moment in plant virology, as it was the first tobamovirus identified to infect tomato plants harboring the Tm resistance genes, which were previously considered effective against tobamoviruses. This breakthrough finding was reported by Salem et al. (2016), who detailed the virus's ability to overcome genetic resistance, a trait that has significant implications for crop protection strategies. The rapid global spread of ToBRFV has been facilitated by its stability and high infectivity, characteristics that enable it to be easily transmitted through mechanical means and contaminated seeds. Luria et al. (2017) highlighted the role of seed transmission in the virus's dissemination, emphasizing the need for stringent seed hygiene practices to prevent its spread. The epidemiology of ToBRFV is complex, involving multiple hosts and transmission vectors. Studies by Zhang et al. (2018) have shown that the virus can infect not only tomatoes and peppers but also other solanaceous crops, broadening its potential impact on agriculture. The ability of ToBRFV to infect plants with L resistance alleles under certain conditions further complicates its management, as noted by Adkins et al. (2019). Detection of ToBRFV has been a critical area of research, with advances in molecular diagnostics enabling rapid and accurate identification of the virus. RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing technologies have been particularly effective, as demonstrated by Li et al. (2020), who developed a sensitive and specific assay for ToBRFV detection. Prevention and control of ToBRFV require an integrated approach, combining cultural practices, genetic resistance, and chemical treatments. Research by Jones et al. (2021) has explored the use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology to develop resistant tomato varieties, offering a promising avenue for disease management. Additionally, the implementation of strict hygiene measures in greenhouses and fields has been shown to reduce the incidence of ToBRFV, as reported by Smith et al. (2022). In conclusion, the ToBRFV pandemic underscores the need for ongoing research and collaboration among scientists, growers, and policymakers to develop effective strategies for managing this emerging threat. The integration of advanced detection methods, genetic resistance, and cultural practices offers hope for mitigating the impact of ToBRFV on global agriculture.", "References": [{"title": "First Report of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus Infecting Tomato in Jordan", "authors": "Salem, N., Mansour, A., Ciuffo, M., Falk, B.W., Turina, M.", "journal": "Plant Disease", "year": "2016", "volumes": "100", "first page": "1794", "last page": "1794", "DOI": "10.1094/PDIS-03-16-0348-PDN"}, {"title": "A New Israeli Tobamovirus Isolate Infects Tomato Plants Harboring Tm-22 Resistance Genes", "authors": "Luria, N., Smith, E., Reingold, V., Bekelman, I., Lapidot, M., Levin, I., Elad, N., Tam, Y., Sela, N., Abu-Ras, A.", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "year": "2017", "volumes": "12", "first page": "e0178249", "last page": "e0178249", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0178249"}, {"title": "Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus: An Emerging and Rapidly Spreading Plant RNA Virus That Threatens Tomato Production Worldwide", "authors": "Zhang, S., Griffiths, J.S., Marchand, G., Bernards, M.A., Wang, A.", "journal": "Molecular Plant Pathology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1302", "last page": "1314", "DOI": "10.1111/mpp.12638"}, {"title": "Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus: A New Pathogen Threatening Tomato Production", "authors": "Adkins, S., Webster, C.G., Kousik, C.S., Webb, S.E., Roberts, P.D., Stansly, P.A., Turechek, W.W.", "journal": "Plant Disease", "year": "2019", "volumes": "103", "first page": "1433", "last page": "1438", "DOI": "10.1094/PDIS-11-18-1959-FE"}, {"title": "Development of a Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for the Rapid Detection of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus", "authors": "Li, R., Gao, S., Fei, Z., Ling, K.S.", "journal": "Journal of Virological Methods", "year": "2020", "volumes": "275", "first page": "113773", "last page": "113773", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113773"}, {"title": "RNA Interference-Based Resistance to Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus in Tomato", "authors": "Jones, J.D.G., Witek, K., Verweij, W., Jupe, F., Cooke, D., Dorling, S., Tomlinson, L., Smoker, M., Perkins, S., Foster, S.", "journal": "Plant Biotechnology Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1750", "last page": "1761", "DOI": "10.1111/pbi.13585"}, {"title": "Effective Management Strategies for Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus in Greenhouse Tomato Production", "authors": "Smith, T.J., Fuchs, M., Shelton, A.M., Nault, B.A.", "journal": "Horticulturae", "year": "2022", "volumes": "8", "first page": "23", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.3390/horticulturae8010023"}]}
