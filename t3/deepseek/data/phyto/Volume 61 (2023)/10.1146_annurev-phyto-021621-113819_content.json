{"Literature Review": "The coevolution of viruses and host resistance is a complex process that has shaped the genetic diversity of plants and their pathogens. This literature review explores the foundational work of Francis O. Holmes on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its implications for understanding host-pathogen coevolution within geographic centers of plant diversity, as initially proposed by Nikolai Vavilov and further elaborated by T. Harper Goodspeed's taxonomy of the genus Nicotiana. Holmes's hypothesis that the origin of host resistance to viruses is due to their coevolution at a geographic center has been pivotal in plant pathology. His work in the 1950s demonstrated that genetic resistance to TMV, particularly through dominant R-genes, was concentrated in South America for Nicotiana and other solanaceous plants, such as Capsicum, potato, and tomato. This finding underscored the importance of geographic centers of diversity in the evolution of host resistance mechanisms. However, the case of eggplant (Solanum melongena) presented an exception to Holmes's hypothesis, as its crop wild relatives (CWRs) were found in northeast Africa, a region distant from the identified center for TMV–R-gene coevolution. The acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s and advancements in evolutionary taxonomy have since provided insights into the distribution of CWRs and the evolutionary history of host-pathogen interactions. Holmes's contributions predated and paralleled the work of H.H. Flor, including the experimental proof of the gene-for-gene interaction, the identification of R-genes, and the strategic deployment of dominant host genes to mitigate virus-associated yield losses in crops. This review highlights the significance of geographic centers of plant diversity in the coevolution of viruses and host resistance, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach that integrates plant pathology, evolutionary biology, and geology to understand the complex dynamics of host-pathogen interactions.", "References": [{"title": "The origin of cultivated plants", "authors": "Nikolai Vavilov", "journal": "Chronica Botanica", "year": "1951", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1", "last page": "366", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The genus Nicotiana: origins, relationships and evolution of its species in the light of their distribution, morphology and cytogenetics", "authors": "T.
