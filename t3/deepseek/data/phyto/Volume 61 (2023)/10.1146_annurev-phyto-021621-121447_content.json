{"Literature Review": "The exploration of plant-associated microbiota has unveiled a complex interplay between host genetics and microbial communities, offering a novel avenue for enhancing crop sustainability and productivity. The microbiota inhabiting the plant–soil continuum plays a pivotal role in plant health, nutrient acquisition, and stress tolerance, making it a critical component of agricultural ecosystems. Recent studies have highlighted the host plant as a significant determinant of the taxonomic composition and functional attributes of these microbial communities, suggesting a heritable component to microbiota recruitment (Bulgarelli et al., 2012; Lundberg et al., 2012). This heritability is influenced by the evolutionary processes of plant domestication and crop diversification, which have shaped the genetic determinants of microbiota assembly (Pérez-Jaramillo et al., 2016). The domestication process, in particular, has been shown to alter the composition of root-associated microbiota, with modern crops harboring a less diverse microbial community compared to their wild relatives (Pérez-Jaramillo et al., 2017). This reduction in microbial diversity may reflect a selection for microbial functions that support the growth, development, and health of domesticated plants. The magnitude of microbiota heritability is also modulated by environmental factors, indicating a genotype-by-environment interaction in the assembly of plant-associated microbial communities (Wagner et al., 2016). Recent advances in crop genomics have facilitated the identification of host genetic loci associated with microbiota-based quantitative traits, offering insights into the genetic architecture of host–microbiota interactions (Horton et al., 2014). These studies have demonstrated that host–microbiota interactions can be treated as an external quantitative trait, with potential applications in crop breeding programs. Reductionist approaches, such as the use of synthetic microbial communities, have further elucidated the causal relationships between microbiota composition and plant phenotypes, providing a mechanistic understanding of how specific microbial taxa influence plant health and productivity (Bai et al., 2015). The integration of microbiota manipulation into crop selection programs represents a promising strategy for harnessing the beneficial effects of plant-associated microbes. However, the deployment of microbiota-based breeding strategies requires a detailed understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that govern microbiota assembly and function. Advances in crop genomics, coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, are likely to accelerate the application of plant–microbiota interactions in agriculture, paving the way for the development of crops with enhanced resilience and productivity (Busby et al., 2017). Despite the potential of microbiota engineering for sustainable crop production, challenges remain in translating laboratory findings to field applications. The complexity of plant–microbiota interactions, coupled with the variability of environmental conditions, necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to integrate microbiota research into agricultural practices. Future research should focus on elucidating the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying host–microbiota interactions, as well as developing strategies to manipulate these interactions for crop improvement. The integration of microbiota engineering into crop breeding programs holds great promise for addressing the challenges of global food security and environmental sustainability.", "References": [{"title": "Revealing structure and assembly cues for Arabidopsis root-inhabiting bacterial microbiota", "authors": "Bulgarelli, Davide, Rott, Matthias, Schlaeppi, Klaus, Ver Loren van Themaat, Emiel, Ahmadinejad, Nahal, Assenza, Federica, Rauf, Philipp, Huettel, Bruno, Reinhardt, Richard, Schmelzer, Elmon", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2012", "volumes": "488", "first page": "91", "last page": "95", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11336"}, {"title": "Defining the core Arabidopsis thaliana root microbiome", "authors": "Lundberg, Derek S., Lebeis, Sarah L., Paredes, Sur Herrera, Yourstone, Scott, Gehring, Jase, Malfatti, Stephanie, Tremblay, Julien, Engelbrektson, Anna, Kunin, Victor, Del Rio, Tijana Glavina", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2012", "volumes": "488", "first page": "86", "last page": "90", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11237"}, {"title": "Impact of plant domestication on rhizosphere microbiome assembly and functions", "authors": "Pérez-Jaramillo, Juan E., Mendes, Rodrigo, Raaijmakers, Jos M.", "journal": "Plant Molecular Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "90", "first page": "635", "last page": "644", "DOI": "10.1007/s11103-015-0337-7"}, {"title": "Linking rhizosphere microbiome composition of wild and domesticated Phaseolus vulgaris to genotypic and root phenotypic traits", "authors": "Pérez-Jaramillo, Juan E., Carrión, Víctor J., Bosse, Mirte, Ferrão, Luiz Felipe V., de Hollander, Mattias, Garcia, Antonio A.F., Ramírez, Camilo A., Mendes, Rodrigo, Raaijmakers, Jos M.", "journal": "The ISME Journal", "year": "2017", "volumes": "11", "first page": "2244", "last page": "2257", "DOI": "10.1038/ismej.2017.85"}, {"title": "Host genotype and age shape the leaf and root microbiomes of a wild perennial plant", "authors": "Wagner, Maggie R., Lundberg, Derek S., del Rio, Tijana Glavina, Tringe, Susannah G., Dangl, Jeffery L., Mitchell-Olds, Thomas", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2016", "volumes": "7", "first page": "12151", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms12151"}, {"title": "Genome-wide association study of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbial community", "authors": "Horton, Matthew W., Bodenhausen, Natacha, Beilsmith, Kathleen, Meng, Dazhe, Muegge, Brian D., Subramanian, Sathish, Vetter, Michael M., Vilhjálmsson, Bjarni J., Nordborg, Magnus, Gordon, Jeffrey I.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2014", "volumes": "5", "first page": "5320", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms6320"}, {"title": "Functional overlap of the Arabidopsis leaf and root microbiota", "authors": "Bai, Yang, Müller, Daniel B., Srinivas, Girish, Garrido-Oter, Ruben, Potthoff, Eva, Rott, Matthias, Dombrowski, Nina, Münch, Philipp C., Spaepen, Stijn, Remus-Emsermann, Mitja", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2015", "volumes": "528", "first page": "364", "last page": "369", "DOI": "10.1038/nature16192"}, {"title": "Research priorities for harnessing plant microbiomes in sustainable agriculture", "authors": "Busby, Posy E., Soman, Chinmay, Wagner, Maggie R., Friesen, Maren L., Kremer, James, Bennett, Alison, Morsy, Mustafa, Eisen, Jonathan A., Leach, Jan E., Dangl, Jeffery L.", "journal": "PLoS Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "15", "first page": "e2001793", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.2001793"}]}
