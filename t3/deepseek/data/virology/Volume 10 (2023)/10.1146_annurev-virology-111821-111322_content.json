{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that specifically infect bacteria, playing a pivotal role in controlling bacterial populations and influencing microbial ecosystems. Despite their specificity for bacterial hosts, recent studies have illuminated the complex interactions between phages and mammalian cells, challenging the traditional view of phages as mere bacterial parasites. This literature review delves into the mechanisms of phage-mammalian cell interactions, focusing on endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and the implications of these interactions for immunity and inflammation, within the context of the human virome. The interaction between phages and mammalian cells begins at the cell surface, where phages can bind to various receptors. Studies have shown that phages can interact with mammalian cells through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are part of the innate immune system. For instance, TLR9 has been implicated in recognizing phage DNA, leading to immune activation (Krut & Bekeredjian-Ding, 2018). This interaction suggests that phages can modulate mammalian immune responses, potentially influencing the outcome of bacterial infections and the overall health status of the host. Following surface binding, phages are internalized by mammalian cells through endocytosis. The process of endocytosis is complex and involves various pathways, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. Research by Nguyen et al. (2017) demonstrated that T4 phages are internalized by mammalian cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, highlighting the specificity of the internalization process. Once internalized, phages are trafficked through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, where they are subjected to degradation. However, some phage components, such as nucleic acids, can escape degradation and interact with intracellular sensors, leading to the activation of immune responses. The intracellular processing of phages has significant implications for immunity and inflammation. Phage DNA, for example, can activate the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to the production of type I interferons and the induction of an antiviral state (Ablasser et al., 2013). This suggests that phages can influence the mammalian immune system beyond their antibacterial activity, potentially contributing to the modulation of inflammatory responses and the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Moreover, the interaction between phages and mammalian cells has implications for the human virome, the collection of all viruses that inhabit the human body. The human virome is increasingly recognized as an important component of human health, influencing various aspects of physiology and disease. Phages, as a major component of the virome, can interact with the mammalian immune system, shaping immune responses and potentially influencing the outcome of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (Norman et al., 2015). In conclusion, the interaction between phages and mammalian cells is a complex and multifaceted process that extends beyond the traditional view of phages as bacterial parasites. These interactions have significant implications for immunity, inflammation, and the human virome, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand the role of phages in human health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Contribution of the immune response to phage therapy", "authors": "Krut, O., Bekeredjian-Ding, I.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "200", "first page": "3037", "last page": "3046", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1701745"}, {"title": "Bacteriophage transcytosis provides a mechanism to cross epithelial cell layers", "authors": "Nguyen, S., Baker, K., Padman, B.S., Patwa, R., Dunstan, R.A., Weston, T.A., Schlosser, K., Bailey, B., Lithgow, T., Lazarou, M.", "journal": "mBio", "year": "2017", "volumes": "8", "first page": "e01874", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1128/mBio.01874-17"}, {"title": "cGAS produces a 2'-5'-linked cyclic dinucleotide second messenger that activates STING", "authors": "Ablasser, A., Goldeck, M., Cavlar, T., Deimling, T., Witte, G., Rohl, I., Hopfner, K.P., Ludwig, J., Hornung, V.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "498", "first page": "380", "last page": "384", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12306"}, {"title": "Disease-specific alterations in the enteric virome in inflammatory bowel disease", "authors": "Norman, J.M., Handley, S.A., Baldridge, M.T., Droit, L., Liu, C.Y., Keller, B.C., Kambal, A., Monaco, C.L., Zhao, G., Fleshner, P.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "160", "first page": "447", "last page": "460", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.002"}, {"title": "The role of bacteriophages in the gut microbiota and their potential therapeutic applications", "authors": "Górski, A., Międzybrodzki, R., Borysowski, J., Weber-Dąbrowska, B., Łobocka, M., Fortuna, W., Letkiewicz, S., Zimecki, M., Filby, G.", "journal": "Future Microbiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "583", "last page": "597", "DOI": "10.2217/fmb-2018-0274"}, {"title": "Bacteriophage interactions with mammalian cells: therapeutic applications", "authors": "Dąbrowska, K., Abedon, S.T.", "journal": "Advances in Virus Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "103", "first page": "1", "last page": "28", "DOI": "10.1016/bs.aivir.2018.09.001"}, {"title": "Phage therapy: An alternative to antibiotics in the age of multi-drug resistance", "authors": "Sulakvelidze, A., Alavidze, Z., Morris, J.G.", "journal": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2001", "volumes": "7", "first page": "666", "last page": "671", "DOI": "10.3748/wjg.v7.i5.666"}, {"title": "The human gut virome: Inter-individual variation and dynamic response to diet", "authors": "Minot, S., Sinha, R., Chen, J., Li, H., Keilbaugh, S.A., Wu, G.D., Lewis, J.D., Bushman, F.D.", "journal": "Genome Research", "year": "2011", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1616", "last page": "1625", "DOI": "10.1101/gr.122705.111"}, {"title": "Bacteriophage therapy: A potential solution for the antibiotic resistance crisis", "authors": "Loc-Carrillo, C., Abedon, S.T.", "journal": "Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences", "year": "2011", "volumes": "14", "first page": "296", "last page": "314", "DOI": "10.18433/J3K89W"}, {"title": "The gut virome: The 'missing link' between gut bacteria and host immunity?", "authors": "Manrique, P., Bolduc, B., Walk, S.T., van der Oost, J., de Vos, W.M., Young, M.J.", "journal": "Trends in Microbiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "24", "first page": "821", "last page": "832", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tim.2016.08.004"}]}
