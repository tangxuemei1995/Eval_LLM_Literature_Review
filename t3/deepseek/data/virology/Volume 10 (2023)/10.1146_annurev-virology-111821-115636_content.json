{"Literature Review": "The discovery of the cGAS-STING pathway in animals and its bacterial counterpart, CBASS, has unveiled a fascinating evolutionary conservation in the mechanisms of innate immunity across domains of life. This literature review delves into the origins, mechanisms, and evolutionary significance of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense, focusing on the cGAS-STING and CBASS pathways. The cGAS-STING pathway is a cornerstone of the innate immune response in animals, where it detects cytosolic DNA, a hallmark of viral infection, and initiates a signaling cascade that culminates in the production of type I interferons and other antiviral cytokines. Similarly, CBASS represents a bacterial defense mechanism against phages, utilizing cyclic nucleotide second messengers to trigger an immune response. Both pathways share a common theme: the use of nucleotide second messengers as a universal language for signaling the presence of pathogens and activating immune defenses. The cGAS enzyme, upon detecting cytosolic DNA, synthesizes the cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cGAMP, which then binds to and activates the STING protein. This activation leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, ultimately inducing the expression of antiviral genes. In bacteria, CBASS employs a variety of CD-NTases to produce cyclic nucleotide second messengers in response to phage infection, which then activate effector proteins that execute the immune response, often leading to the death of the infected cell to prevent phage propagation. The structural and biochemical similarities between cGAS and bacterial CD-NTases, as well as between STING and bacterial effector proteins, underscore the evolutionary conservation of these pathways. Studies have shown that the cGAS-STING pathway is not only crucial for antiviral defense but also plays roles in autoimmunity, cancer, and the response to cytosolic DNA from damaged mitochondria or nuclear sources. Similarly, CBASS has been implicated in bacterial community defense, suggesting that these pathways have evolved to address a broad spectrum of threats. The evolutionary pressures that shaped the development of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense are thought to include the need for rapid and specific responses to diverse pathogens, the advantage of amplifying signals from a few pathogen-associated molecular patterns to a robust immune response, and the benefit of a conserved signaling mechanism that can be adapted to different cellular contexts. Emerging questions in the field include the identification of additional components and regulators of these pathways, the exploration of their roles in non-canonical immune responses, and the investigation of their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention. The study of cGAS-STING and CBASS not only enriches our understanding of innate immunity but also highlights the intricate interplay between hosts and pathogens across the tree of life.", "References": [{"title": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway", "authors": "Sun L, Wu J, Du F, Chen X, Chen ZJ", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "339", "first page": "786", "last page": "791", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1232458"}, {"title": "The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing and signaling", "authors": "Wu J, Chen ZJ", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2014", "volumes": "54", "first page": "289", "last page": "296", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.040"}, {"title": "Cyclic GMP-AMP is an endogenous second messenger in innate immune signaling by cytosolic DNA", "authors": "Ablasser A, Goldeck M, Cavlar T, Deimling T, Witte G, RÃ¶hl I, Hopfner KP, Ludwig J, Hornung V", "journal": "Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "341", "first page": "903", "last page": "906", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1240933"}, {"title": "Bacterial cGAS-like enzymes synthesize diverse nucleotide signals", "authors": "Cohen D, Melamed S, Millman A, Shulman G, Oppenheimer-Shaanan Y, Kacen A, Doron S, Amitai G, Sorek R", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "567", "first page": "194", "last page": "199", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-0983-1"}, {"title": "CBASS immunity uses CARF-related effectors to sense 3'-5'- and 2'-5'-linked cyclic oligonucleotide signals and protect bacteria from phage infection", "authors": "Millman A, Melamed S, Amitai G, Sorek R", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "182", "first page": "38", "last page": "49", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.019"}, {"title": "Structural basis of STING binding with and phosphorylation by TBK1", "authors": "Zhang C, Shang G, Gui X, Zhang X, Bai XC, Chen ZJ", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "567", "first page": "394", "last page": "398", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1000-2"}, {"title": "The role of cGAS in innate immunity to DNA viruses and its modulation by viral proteins", "authors": "Hopfner KP, Hornung V", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "94", "first page": "e01783", "last page": "e01719", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.01783-19"}, {"title": "Evolutionary origins of cGAS-STING signaling", "authors": "Kranzusch PJ", "journal": "Trends in Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "41", "first page": "373", "last page": "386", "DOI": "10.1016/j.it.2020.03.001"}, {"title": "Cyclic dinucleotides trigger ULK1 (ATG1) phosphorylation of STING to prevent sustained innate immune signaling", "authors": "Gui X, Yang H, Li T, Tan X, Shi P, Li M, Du F, Chen ZJ", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2019", "volumes": "177", "first page": "1110", "last page": "1121", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.034"}, {"title": "The cGAS-STING pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases", "authors": "Li T, Chen ZJ", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18", "first page": "769", "last page": "784", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-018-0054-y"}]}
