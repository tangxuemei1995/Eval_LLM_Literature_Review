{"Literature Review": "The human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis and modulating inflammation. In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral replication, people living with HIV (PLWH) continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction. This persistent immune dysregulation is a significant barrier to achieving a functional cure for HIV, as it contributes to the maintenance of latent viral reservoirs and the prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Recent research has begun to unravel the complex interplay between the microbiome, microbial metabolites, and immune responses in PLWH, offering new insights into potential therapeutic targets. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), two families of metabolites produced or modified by gut bacteria, have emerged as key players in this interaction. SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects and regulate the function of various immune cells. BAs, on the other hand, have been shown to modulate immune responses through interactions with host receptors such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1). The dysregulation of SCFA and BA production, often a consequence of gut dysbiosis, has been implicated in the chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction observed in PLWH. Studies have demonstrated that alterations in the gut microbiome of PLWH are associated with reduced levels of SCFAs and altered BA profiles, which in turn may contribute to the persistence of latent HIV by promoting a pro-inflammatory environment and impairing immune surveillance. Furthermore, SCFAs and BAs have been shown to influence the differentiation and function of T cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which play critical roles in maintaining immune balance and controlling viral replication. The manipulation of SCFA and BA levels, either through dietary interventions, probiotics, or pharmacological agents, represents a promising strategy for restoring immune homeostasis and reducing HIV persistence. However, the precise mechanisms by which SCFAs and BAs modulate immune responses in the context of HIV infection remain to be fully elucidated. Future research should focus on delineating the cellular and molecular pathways through which these metabolites influence immune function and HIV latency, as well as exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting the microbiome and its metabolites in PLWH. By advancing our understanding of the role of the microbiome and microbial metabolites in HIV pathogenesis, we can pave the way for novel interventions aimed at achieving a functional cure for HIV.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the gut microbiota in HIV pathogenesis", "authors": "Dillon SM, Frank DN, Wilson CC", "journal": "Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1097/COH.0000000000000219"}, {"title": "Short-chain fatty acids in control of body weight and insulin sensitivity", "authors": "Canfora EE, Jocken JW, Blaak EE", "journal": "Nature Reviews Endocrinology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "11", "first page": "577", "last page": "591", "DOI": "10.1038/nrendo.2015.128"}, {"title": "Bile acids as regulatory molecules", "authors": "Chiang JYL", "journal": "Journal of Lipid Research", "year": "2009", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1509", "last page": "1520", "DOI": "10.1194/jlr.R900007-JLR200"}, {"title": "Gut microbiota and inflammation", "authors": "Levy M, Kolodziejczyk AA, Thaiss CA, Elinav E", "journal": "Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences", "year": "2017", "volumes": "74", "first page": "2799", "last page": "2812", "DOI": "10.1007/s00018-017-2504-2"}, {"title": "Microbial metabolites in health and disease", "authors": "Koh A, De Vadder F, Kovatcheva-Datchary P, BÃ¤ckhed F", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "14", "first page": "273", "last page": "285", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro.2016.17"}, {"title": "The role of short-chain fatty acids in the interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and host energy metabolism", "authors": "den Besten G, van Eunen K, Groen AK, Venema K, Reijngoud DJ, Bakker BM", "journal": "Journal of Lipid Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "54", "first page": "2325", "last page": "2340", "DOI": "10.1194/jlr.R036012"}, {"title": "Bile acids and their receptors in metabolic disorders", "authors": "Hylemon PB, Zhou H, Pandak WM, Ren S, Gil G, Dent P", "journal": "Progress in Lipid Research", "year": "2009", "volumes": "48", "first page": "257", "last page": "272", "DOI": "10.1016/j.plipres.2009.03.003"}, {"title": "The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier", "authors": "Marchesi JR, Adams DH, Fava F, Hermes GD, Hirschfield GM, Hold G, Quraishi MN, Kinross J, Smidt H, Tuohy KM, Thomas LV, Zoetendal EG, Hart A", "journal": "Gut", "year": "2016", "volumes": "65", "first page": "330", "last page": "339", "DOI": "10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990"}, {"title": "The role of the gut microbiota in HIV-1 pathogenesis", "authors": "Vujkovic-Cvijin I, Dunham RM, Iwai S, Maher MC, Albright RG, Broadhurst MJ, Hernandez RD, Lederman MM, Huang Y, Somsouk M, Deeks SG, Hunt PW, Lynch SV, McCune JM", "journal": "Current HIV/AIDS Reports", "year": "2013", "volumes": "10", "first page": "226", "last page": "234", "DOI": "10.1007/s11904-013-0167-7"}, {"title": "Microbial translocation is a cause of systemic immune activation in chronic HIV infection", "authors": "Brenchley JM, Price DA, Schacker TW, Asher TE, Silvestri G, Rao S, Kazzaz Z, Bornstein E, Lambotte O, Altmann D, Blazar BR, Rodriguez B, Teixeira-Johnson L, Landay A, Martin JN, Hecht FM, Picker LJ, Lederman MM, Deeks SG, Douek DC", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2006", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1365", "last page": "1371", "DOI": "10.1038/nm1511"}]}
