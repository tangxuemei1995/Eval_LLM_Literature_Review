{"Literature Review": "The emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens has become a global health crisis, prompting the exploration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Among these, phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to target and kill bacteria, has gained attention for its potential to treat infections that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Despite its promise, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria poses a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of phage therapy. This literature review explores strategies to mitigate bacterial resistance in phage therapy, focusing on minimizing the evolution of resistance and steering the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of phage therapy in personalized medicine, particularly in treating intractable infections. For example, Dedrick et al. (2019) demonstrated the successful use of phage therapy in a patient with a disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus infection, showcasing the potential of phages to target specific bacterial strains. However, the ability of bacteria to evolve resistance to phages, similar to their resistance to antibiotics, remains a significant hurdle. To address this, researchers have proposed two main strategies. The first strategy involves minimizing the ability of bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance. This can be achieved through the use of phage cocktails, which consist of multiple phages targeting different bacterial receptors, thereby reducing the likelihood of resistance development. Chan et al. (2016) demonstrated the efficacy of phage cocktails in reducing the emergence of resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, highlighting the importance of using a diverse range of phages. Additionally, the use of phages in combination with antibiotics has been shown to enhance bacterial killing and reduce resistance development. Torres-Barceló and Hochberg (2016) reviewed the synergistic effects of phage-antibiotic combinations, suggesting that this approach could be a promising strategy to overcome resistance. The second strategy focuses on steering the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. This involves exploiting evolutionary trade-offs, where resistance to phages comes at a cost to bacterial fitness or virulence. For instance, studies have shown that phage-resistant mutants often exhibit reduced virulence or increased susceptibility to antibiotics, making them less problematic in clinical settings. Levin and Bull (2004) discussed the concept of 'lethal mutagenesis' in phage therapy, where the high mutation rates induced by phages can lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations in bacteria, ultimately reducing their fitness. Furthermore, the use of engineered phages that target essential bacterial genes or pathways can drive the evolution of resistance in a direction that compromises bacterial survival. Lu and Koeris (2011) explored the potential of genetically modified phages to enhance the efficacy of phage therapy and limit resistance development. Future research directions in phage therapy should focus on understanding the mechanisms of phage resistance and developing innovative strategies to counteract it. This includes the exploration of phage-encoded anti-resistance mechanisms, such as the CRISPR-Cas system, which can be used to target and eliminate resistant bacteria. Additionally, the development of predictive models to assess the risk of resistance evolution and the optimization of phage delivery methods could further enhance the effectiveness of phage therapy. In conclusion, while the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria presents a significant challenge, the development of strategies to minimize resistance and steer bacterial evolution toward favorable outcomes holds promise for the future of phage therapy. By leveraging the unique properties of phages and their interactions with bacteria, it may be possible to outsmart evolved bacterial resistance and provide effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections.", "References": [{"title": "Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus", "authors": "Rebekah M.
