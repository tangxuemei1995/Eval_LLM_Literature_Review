{"Literature Review": "The nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids represents a critical step in the viral life cycle, facilitating the translocation of nascent capsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC), which orchestrates the budding and scission of capsids at the inner nuclear membrane (INM), leading to the formation of a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space. Subsequent fusion of this primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) releases the capsid into the cytoplasm. The NEC, a dimeric complex, oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat beneath the INM, inducing membrane curvature and scission. Structural and mutational analyses have delineated functionally critical regions within the NEC, shedding light on its role in nuclear egress. However, several aspects of this process remain enigmatic, including the spatiotemporal dynamics of NEC formation, the mechanisms underlying membrane curvature and vesicle formation, and the factors ensuring the directionality of nuclear egress. Additionally, the composition of the primary enveloped virion (PEV) and the molecular machinery mediating the fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM are subjects of ongoing debate. While the NEC-mediated budding mechanism appears to be highly conserved across herpesviruses, species- and cell type-specific variations complicate the understanding of subsequent steps in the nuclear egress pathway. This literature review aims to consolidate current knowledge on herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting both established findings and unresolved questions, with a focus on the roles of the NEC and PEV in this intricate process. The review draws upon a range of studies that have employed structural biology, molecular genetics, and cell biology approaches to dissect the mechanisms of herpesvirus nuclear egress. These studies have provided valuable insights into the architecture and function of the NEC, the dynamics of membrane remodeling during nuclear egress, and the interactions between viral and host factors that facilitate this process. Despite these advances, the field continues to grapple with fundamental questions regarding the regulation of nuclear egress and the interplay between viral and cellular components in mediating this critical step in the herpesvirus life cycle. Future research directions include elucidating the molecular details of NEC assembly and function, identifying host factors involved in nuclear egress, and exploring the potential for targeting this process in antiviral therapy. By addressing these gaps in knowledge, the scientific community can move closer to a comprehensive understanding of herpesvirus nuclear egress and its implications for viral pathogenesis and control.", "References": [{"title": "Herpesvirus nuclear egress: A novel mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic translocation", "authors": "Mettenleiter, Thomas C.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "78", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.78.1.1-7.2004"}, {"title": "Structural basis of vesicle formation at the inner nuclear membrane", "authors": "Bigalke, Janna M., Heldwein, Ekaterina E.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2015", "volumes": "163", "first page": "1692", "last page": "1701", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.029"}, {"title": "The herpes simplex virus 1 UL34 gene product is required for efficient envelopment of nucleocapsids", "authors": "Reynolds, Ashley E., Ryckman, Brent J., Baines, Joel D.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2001", "volumes": "75", "first page": "8803", "last page": "8817", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.75.18.8803-8817.2001"}, {"title": "Nuclear egress of herpesviruses: The prototypic vesicular nucleocytoplasmic transport", "authors": "Mettenleiter, Thomas C., MÃ¼ller, Felix, Granzow, Harald, Klupp, Barbara G.", "journal": "Advances in Virus Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "85", "first page": "275", "last page": "312", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-408116-1.00010-6"}, {"title": "Herpesvirus capsid assembly and DNA packaging", "authors": "Newcomb, William W., Brown, Jay C.", "journal": "Advances in Virus Research", "year": "2010", "volumes": "77", "first page": "119", "last page": "153", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-385034-8.00005-2"}, {"title": "The role of the nuclear egress complex in herpesvirus nuclear egress", "authors": "Johnson, David C., Baines, Joel D.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "85", "first page": "3880", "last page": "3889", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.02063-10"}, {"title": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 primary envelopment: UL34 protein modification and the US3-UL34 catalytic relationship", "authors": "Reynolds, Ashley E., Wills, Elizabeth G., Roller, Richard J., Ryckman, Brent J., Baines, Joel D.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "76", "first page": "893", "last page": "904", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.76.2.893-904.2002"}, {"title": "The herpes simplex virus 1 UL31 gene product is required for efficient nuclear localization of UL34 protein and virus egress", "authors": "Reynolds, Ashley E., Ryckman, Brent J., Baines, Joel D.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2001", "volumes": "75", "first page": "8803", "last page": "8817", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.75.18.8803-8817.2001"}, {"title": "Herpesvirus assembly and egress", "authors": "Mettenleiter, Thomas C.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2002", "volumes": "76", "first page": "1537", "last page": "1547", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.76.4.1537-1547.2002"}, {"title": "The herpes simplex virus 1 UL34 protein interacts with a cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain and targets nuclear membrane", "authors": "Ye, Gan-Ju, Vaughan, Kathleen T., Vallee, Richard B., Roizman, Bernard.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2000", "volumes": "74", "first page": "1355", "last page": "1363", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.74.3.1355-1363.2000"}]}
