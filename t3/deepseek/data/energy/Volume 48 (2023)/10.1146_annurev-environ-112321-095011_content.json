{"Literature Review": "The Anthropocene epoch, characterized by significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, presents unprecedented challenges that necessitate a reevaluation of humanity's relationship with the planet. This literature review explores the role of futures-thinking in navigating these challenges, emphasizing the importance of imagination, scenario planning, and anticipation in fostering transformative change. Over the past seven decades, futures-thinking has evolved as a critical tool for understanding complex issues, identifying underlying causes, and envisioning pathways toward more sustainable and equitable futures (Miller, 2007). The ability to imagine multiple futures is not merely an academic exercise but a practical approach to breaking free from unhelpful social addictions and resolving conflicts (Slaughter, 2008). Recent advancements in futures-thinking have focused on stimulating imagination to generate novel options and strategies for addressing the multifaceted challenges of the Anthropocene (Inayatullah, 2008). This approach has been instrumental in bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds to forge a common understanding of critical issues and to collaboratively explore potential solutions (Bishop & Hines, 2012). However, the societal uptake of futures-thinking is constrained by cognitive, cultural, and institutional barriers. Cognitive limitations, such as the difficulty in processing complex and uncertain information, can hinder the ability to engage with futures-thinking (Taleb, 2007). Cultural norms and values that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability can also impede the adoption of futures-oriented approaches (Hofstede, 2011). Institutional inertia and resistance to change further complicate the integration of futures-thinking into policy and decision-making processes (North, 1990). Despite these challenges, none are insurmountable. By understanding and addressing these constraints, it is possible to enhance the societal capacity for futures-thinking and to leverage it as a powerful tool for transformation in the Anthropocene (Meadows, 2008). The role of education in fostering futures literacy, the development of participatory methods for scenario planning, and the creation of supportive institutional frameworks are key areas for future research and action (Dator, 2009). As humanity faces the complex and interconnected challenges of the Anthropocene, futures-thinking offers a pathway to not only anticipate and adapt to change but to actively shape a more desirable future (Polak, 1973).", "References": [{"title": "Futures Thinking: A Bibliography", "authors": "Richard A.
