{"Literature Review": "The transition toward zero-carbon cities is increasingly recognized as a pivotal strategy in combating climate change while simultaneously advancing well-being, health, social equity, and climate resilience (WHER outcomes). This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the nexus between urban decarbonization strategies and WHER outcomes, highlighting the potential co-benefits and challenges inherent in this transition. The review is structured around the key themes of health, well-being, equity, and resilience, drawing on a transboundary urban metabolism framework that encompasses seven critical infrastructure and food provisioning systems. Health co-benefits of decarbonization are well-documented, with studies indicating significant reductions in air pollution-related diseases and improvements in public health outcomes as a result of cleaner energy sources and reduced vehicular emissions (Patz et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2009). These health improvements are often accompanied by economic savings, further underscoring the value of decarbonization efforts. However, the evidence for well-being co-benefits is more limited, with some studies suggesting that while urban green spaces and active transportation options can enhance quality of life, the overall impact on well-being is complex and context-dependent (Hartig et al., 2014). The relationship between decarbonization and climate resilience is similarly uncertain, with research indicating that while certain strategies, such as green infrastructure, can enhance urban resilience to climate impacts, others may inadvertently increase vulnerability (Rosenzweig et al., 2018). Equity considerations are critical in the design and implementation of decarbonization strategies, as there is a risk that these efforts could exacerbate existing social inequalities if not carefully managed (Bulkeley et al., 2014). Intentional design is therefore necessary to ensure that decarbonization advances distributional, procedural, and recognitional equity. The review identifies key knowledge gaps, including the need for fine-scale data across all seven sectors and scales, and the development of next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models to better understand and optimize the co-benefits of zero-carbon urban transitions. In conclusion, while the evidence base for co-beneficial decarbonization is strong in some areas, significant research is needed to fully realize the potential of zero-carbon urban transitions to advance WHER outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Impact of regional climate change on human health", "authors": "Jonathan A.
