{"Literature Review": "The management and disposal of nuclear waste, particularly highly radioactive waste such as spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level waste (HLW), present significant challenges within the United States. Despite decades of effort and substantial financial investment, the U.S. has yet to establish a successful nuclear waste management and disposal program. This literature review explores the legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste from present and future reactors, including advanced reactor technologies, and identifies critical elements that have impeded progress. It also discusses the implications of expanding spent fuel inventories due to the development of advanced nuclear reactors and their fuel cycles, and offers recommendations for a successful nuclear waste program. The U.S. nuclear waste management program has been shaped by a complex legal and regulatory framework, including the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982, which established a comprehensive program for the disposal of SNF and HLW. However, the program has faced numerous setbacks, including the cancellation of the Yucca Mountain repository project, which was designated as the nation's sole repository for SNF and HLW. The NWPA also introduced the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste, which has been a source of litigation and financial liability for the federal government due to its failure to begin accepting waste by the contractual deadline of 1998. Advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), are being promoted as a key component of the future U.S. energy mix. These reactors are expected to generate SNF with different characteristics than those of current reactors, potentially complicating waste management and disposal efforts. The concept of retrievability, which allows for the retrieval of disposed waste for a certain period, has been proposed as a means to address uncertainties associated with the long-term behavior of SNF and HLW in a geological repository. However, the implementation of retrievability raises additional legal and regulatory challenges, including the need for amendments to existing laws and regulations. The development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, including reprocessing and recycling of SNF, has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the volume and radiotoxicity of nuclear waste. However, these technologies also present regulatory and non-proliferation challenges that must be addressed. The U.S. legal and regulatory framework for nuclear waste management must evolve to accommodate the development of advanced reactors and fuel cycles, while ensuring the safe and secure disposal of nuclear waste. This includes the need for clear and consistent policies, the establishment of a new repository site selection process, and the development of regulations that address the unique characteristics of SNF from advanced reactors. In conclusion, the U.S. nuclear waste management program faces significant challenges that require a comprehensive and forward-looking approach. The legal and regulatory framework must be updated to address the complexities of advanced reactor technologies and fuel cycles, while ensuring the safe and secure disposal of nuclear waste. This will require the collaboration of government, industry, and other stakeholders to develop and implement effective solutions.", "References": [{"title": "The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982: A Look Back", "authors": "James E.
