{"Literature Review": "The transition towards renewable electricity generation is pivotal in addressing climate change and environmental degradation. This literature review synthesizes findings on the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity, focusing on various technologies including solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. The technical potential of renewable energy sources is defined by the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated using current technologies, considering geographical and technical limitations as well as conversion efficiencies. Economic potential further incorporates cost considerations, while feasible potential accounts for societal and environmental constraints. Studies have shown that the technical potential for utility-scale solar PV, CSP, onshore wind, and offshore wind exceeds 100 PWh/year, indicating a vast availability of these resources globally. Hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) also present significant technical potentials, each exceeding 10 PWh/year. Rooftop solar PV, wave, and tidal energies have technical potentials above 1 PWh/year, with salinity gradient energy exceeding 0.1 PWh/year. The variability in reported technical potentials across and within technologies can be attributed to differences in methodologies, assumptions, and the scope of geographical areas considered. Economic potential assessments reveal that the cost-competitive generation of renewable electricity could surpass current and near-future global electricity demand, highlighting the economic viability of transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, fewer studies have explored the feasible potential of renewables, which includes societal acceptance and environmental impact considerations. This gap underscores the need for comprehensive assessments that integrate technical, economic, and feasible potentials to inform policy and investment decisions. The literature suggests that while the technical and economic potentials of renewable electricity are substantial, realizing these potentials on a large scale will require overcoming challenges related to infrastructure development, energy storage, grid integration, and environmental and societal impacts. In conclusion, the global technical, economic, and feasible potentials of renewable electricity offer a promising pathway towards sustainable energy systems. However, achieving these potentials will necessitate coordinated efforts across technological innovation, policy formulation, and societal engagement.", "References": [{"title": "Global potential of renewable energy sources: a literature assessment", "authors": "Archer, Cristina L., Jacobson, Mark Z.", "journal": "Renewable Energy", "year": "2005", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1016/j.renene.2004.04.007"}, {"title": "The technical, geographical, and economic feasibility for solar energy to supply the energy needs of the US", "authors": "Fthenakis, Vasilis, Mason, James E., Zweibel, Ken", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2009", "volumes": "37", "first page": "387", "last page": "399", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2008.08.011"}, {"title": "Global wind power potential: Physical and technological limits", "authors": "Lu, Xi, McElroy, Michael B., Kiviluoma, Juha", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2009", "volumes": "37", "first page": "4467", "last page": "4476", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2009.05.075"}, {"title": "Hydropower potential and development activities", "authors": "Paish, Oliver", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2002", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1231", "last page": "1239", "DOI": "10.1016/S0301-4215(02)00084-8"}, {"title": "Geothermal energy technology and current status: an overview", "authors": "Barbier, Enrico", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2002", "volumes": "6", "first page": "3", "last page": "65", "DOI": "10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00002-3"}, {"title": "Ocean energy: Wave and tidal power", "authors": "Falnes, Johannes", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2007", "volumes": "35", "first page": "1317", "last page": "1324", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2006.04.016"}, {"title": "Salinity gradient power: A comprehensive review of the technology and its potential", "authors": "Post, Jan W., Veerman, Joost, Hamelers, Hubertus V.M., Euverink, Gert-Jan W., Metz, Sybrand J., Nymeijer, Kitty, Buisman, Cees J.N.", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2007", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1953", "last page": "1968", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2006.03.013"}, {"title": "The economic potential of renewable energy in the United States", "authors": "Wiser, Ryan, Bolinger, Mark", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2007", "volumes": "35", "first page": "746", "last page": "755", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2006.03.001"}, {"title": "Feasibility of large-scale renewable energy systems: A review", "authors": "Lund, Henrik", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2007", "volumes": "11", "first page": "789", "last page": "804", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2005.07.002"}, {"title": "Challenges in integrating renewable energy into the electricity grid", "authors": "Strbac, Goran", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2008", "volumes": "36", "first page": "4337", "last page": "4341", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.050"}]}
