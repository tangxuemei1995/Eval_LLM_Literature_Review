{"Literature Review": "The global initiative to protect 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030, known as 30×30, represents a critical juncture in the history of conservation strategies, particularly in the context of climate change. This ambitious target underscores the urgency of integrating climate change considerations into conservation planning, a necessity that has been increasingly recognized over the past two decades. The foundation for Climate Change–Integrated Conservation Strategies was laid in 2002 by a group of prominent climate change biologists, who highlighted the imperative of adapting conservation efforts to the realities of a changing climate (Hannah et al., 2002). This early work set the stage for a burgeoning field of research focused on understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. The first estimates of extinction risk due to climate change, published in 2004, further emphasized the critical need for adaptation strategies in conservation planning (Thomas et al., 2004). Since then, the field has evolved to incorporate a range of concepts and approaches aimed at facilitating species' adaptation to climate change. Among these, the concept of the velocity of climate change has provided a valuable framework for understanding the rate at which species must move to track suitable climates (Loarie et al., 2009). Assisted migration, or the human-assisted movement of species to areas where they are more likely to survive in the face of climate change, has emerged as a controversial yet potentially necessary strategy (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2008). Regional modeling of biodiversity change has become a cornerstone of conservation planning, enabling the identification of areas that are likely to serve as refugia for species under future climate scenarios (Bellard et al., 2012). Expanding protected areas to facilitate species range movements and managing productive landscapes to support species migration are now considered standard practices in climate change adaptation planning (Heller & Zavaleta, 2009). However, the literature and practice of regional coordination of conservation efforts remain underdeveloped. Ensuring that species on the move are managed consistently across their range is a critical challenge that requires improved theory and practice (Lawler et al., 2013). As the world moves towards the 30×30 target, the focus of conservation for climate change has predominantly been on warming scenarios. Yet, the failure to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions means that achieving the Paris Agreement targets will likely involve both exceeding these targets and subsequently cooling back to them. Managing this double transition presents a second critical challenge for climate change biology (Parmesan & Yohe, 2003). In conclusion, as the global community strives to meet the 30×30 goal, the integration of climate change considerations into conservation strategies remains a paramount concern. The development of robust regional coordination mechanisms and the management of the double transition associated with climate change are essential priorities for the future of conservation biology.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change-integrated conservation strategies", "authors": "Lee Hannah, Guy Midgley, Sandy Andelman, Miguel Araújo, Greg Hughes, Enrique Martinez-Meyer, Richard Pearson, Paul Williams", "journal": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "year": "2002", "volumes": "11", "first page": "485", "last page": "495", "DOI": "10.1046/j.1466-822X.2002.00306.x"}, {"title": "Extinction risk from climate change", "authors": "Chris D.
