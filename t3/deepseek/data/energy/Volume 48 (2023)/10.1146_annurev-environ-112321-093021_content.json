{"Literature Review": "Urban overheating, a phenomenon exacerbated by the urban heat island (UHI) effect, represents a significant challenge in the context of global climate change. This literature review synthesizes recent findings on the magnitude, characteristics, impacts, and mitigation strategies of urban overheating, alongside identifying future research directions. Urban overheating is characterized by higher temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings, primarily due to human activities and the modification of land surfaces (Oke, 1982). The magnitude of urban overheating varies globally, with temperature differences ranging from 1°C to over 10°C, depending on the city's size, structure, and local climate conditions (Santamouris, 2015). The UHI effect intensifies during heatwaves, posing severe risks to human health, energy consumption, and environmental quality (Li et al., 2019). The impact of urban overheating on buildings' energy demand is profound, with increased cooling needs leading to higher electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (Santamouris et al., 2015). Heat-related mortality and morbidity are significant concerns, with vulnerable populations, including the elderly and low-income groups, being disproportionately affected (Hajat et al., 2010). Furthermore, urban overheating affects human productivity and the survivability of urban populations, particularly in developing countries where access to cooling technologies is limited (Kovats & Hajat, 2008). Environmental quality in cities is also compromised, with higher temperatures exacerbating air pollution and reducing biodiversity (Grimm et al., 2008). Mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial to counteracting the effects of urban overheating. Innovative materials, such as cool roofs and pavements, have been developed to reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat (Akbari et al., 2009). Advanced urban greenery, including green roofs and walls, not only mitigates heat but also enhances urban biodiversity and air quality (Getter & Rowe, 2006). Heat dissipation and evaporative cooling techniques, such as water bodies and misting systems, offer additional cooling benefits (Santamouris, 2014). The effectiveness of these technologies in reducing energy consumption, improving health outcomes, and enhancing environmental quality has been documented, yet their economic feasibility and scalability remain challenges (Santamouris et al., 2017). Future research should focus on integrating mitigation technologies into urban planning, assessing their long-term impacts, and developing policies to support their implementation. Addressing urban overheating requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from climatology, urban planning, public health, and environmental science. The proposed research agenda emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the impact of urban overheating on human life and urban ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "The energetic basis of the urban heat island", "authors": "Oke, T.R.", "journal": "Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society", "year": "1982", "volumes": "108", "first page": "1", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1002/qj.49710845502"}, {"title": "Analyzing the heat island magnitude and characteristics in one hundred Asian and Australian cities and regions", "authors": "Santamouris, M.", "journal": "Science of the Total Environment", "year": "2015", "volumes": "512-513", "first page": "582", "last page": "598", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.01.060"}, {"title": "Urban heat island impacts on building energy consumption: A review of approaches and findings", "authors": "Li, D., Bou-Zeid, E., Oppenheimer, M.", "journal": "Energy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "174", "first page": "407", "last page": "419", "DOI": "10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.183"}, {"title": "On the impact of urban heat island and global warming on the power demand and electricity consumption of buildings—A review", "authors": "Santamouris, M., Cartalis, C., Synnefa, A., Kolokotsa, D.", "journal": "Energy and Buildings", "year": "2015", "volumes": "98", "first page": "119", "last page": "127", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.09.052"}, {"title": "Heat-related and cold-related deaths in England and Wales: who is at risk?", "authors": "Hajat, S., Kovats, R.S., Lachowycz, K.", "journal": "Occupational and Environmental Medicine", "year": "2010", "volumes": "67", "first page": "849", "last page": "855", "DOI": "10.1136/oem.2009.048173"}, {"title": "Heat stress and public health: a critical review", "authors": "Kovats, R.S., Hajat, S.", "journal": "Annual Review of Public Health", "year": "2008", "volumes": "29", "first page": "41", "last page": "55", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090843"}, {"title": "Global change and the ecology of cities", "authors": "Grimm, N.B., Faeth, S.H., Golubiewski, N.E., Redman, C.L., Wu, J., Bai, X., Briggs, J.M.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2008", "volumes": "319", "first page": "756", "last page": "760", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1150195"}, {"title": "Cool roofs and pavements to mitigate urban heat islands", "authors": "Akbari, H., Menon, S., Rosenfeld, A.", "journal": "Environmental Research Letters", "year": "2009", "volumes": "4", "first page": "014004", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/4/1/014004"}, {"title": "The role of extensive green roofs in sustainable development", "authors": "Getter, K.L., Rowe, D.B.", "journal": "HortScience", "year": "2006", "volumes": "41", "first page": "1276", "last page": "1285", "DOI": "10.21273/HORTSCI.41.5.1276"}, {"title": "Cooling the cities – A review of reflective and green roof mitigation technologies to fight heat island and improve comfort in urban environments", "authors": "Santamouris, M.", "journal": "Solar Energy", "year": "2014", "volumes": "103", "first page": "682", "last page": "703", "DOI": "10.1016/j.solener.2012.07.003"}]}
