{"Literature Review": "The concept of energy justice has emerged as a critical framework for addressing the inequities inherent in energy systems. It encompasses distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice, aiming to ensure fair distribution of energy resources, inclusive decision-making processes, and acknowledgment of diverse energy needs and impacts, respectively. The development and application of metrics for energy justice are pivotal for translating these principles into actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners. This literature review explores the evolution of energy justice metrics, their application in decision-making, and the challenges associated with their implementation. Distributive justice in energy systems focuses on the equitable allocation of energy resources and the mitigation of adverse impacts. Metrics such as the Energy Equity Gap and the Energy Poverty Index have been developed to quantify disparities in energy access and affordability. These metrics highlight the disproportionate energy burdens faced by low-income and marginalized communities, providing a basis for targeted interventions (Bouzarovski & Petrova, 2015; Sovacool & Dworkin, 2015). Procedural justice emphasizes the importance of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes in energy policy and project development. Metrics assessing stakeholder engagement, transparency, and representation have been proposed to evaluate the fairness of these processes. Studies have shown that inclusive decision-making can lead to more equitable and sustainable energy outcomes, underscoring the value of these metrics (Heffron & McCauley, 2017; Jenkins et al., 2016). Recognition justice addresses the need to acknowledge and respect the diverse energy needs, values, and impacts of different communities. Metrics such as the Cultural Impact Assessment and the Social Acceptance Index have been utilized to gauge the extent to which energy policies and projects consider and address these factors. These metrics are crucial for ensuring that energy solutions are culturally appropriate and socially acceptable (Walker & Day, 2012; McCauley et al., 2019). The integration of these metrics into decision-making frameworks presents several challenges. One major issue is the trade-off between comprehensiveness and practicality. While comprehensive metrics can provide a holistic view of energy justice, they may be too complex for practical application. Conversely, simpler metrics may overlook critical dimensions of justice (Jenkins et al., 2018). Another challenge is the lack of standardized methodologies for measuring energy justice, leading to inconsistencies in application and interpretation. Efforts to develop standardized frameworks and guidelines are essential for enhancing the reliability and comparability of energy justice metrics (Heffron et al., 2020). Furthermore, the dynamic nature of energy systems and societal values necessitates the continuous evolution of energy justice metrics. Emerging issues such as the transition to renewable energy, the digitalization of energy systems, and the impacts of climate change require the development of new metrics and the adaptation of existing ones. Collaborative research and stakeholder engagement are key to ensuring that energy justice metrics remain relevant and effective (Sovacool et al., 2017; Bouzarovski et al., 2018). In conclusion, metrics for decision-making in energy justice are indispensable tools for addressing the inequities in energy systems. They provide a means to quantify and evaluate the fairness of energy policies and projects, guiding efforts towards more equitable and sustainable energy futures. However, the development and application of these metrics are fraught with challenges, including the need for standardization, the balance between comprehensiveness and practicality, and the adaptation to emerging issues. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research, collaboration, and innovation in the field of energy justice.", "References": [{"title": "A global perspective on domestic energy deprivation: Overcoming the energy poverty–fuel poverty binary", "authors": "Stefan Bouzarovski, Saska Petrova", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "10", "first page": "31", "last page": "40", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2015.06.007"}, {"title": "Global Energy Justice: Problems, Principles, and Practices", "authors": "Benjamin K.
