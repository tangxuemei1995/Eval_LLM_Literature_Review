{"Literature Review": "The concept of deforestation-free commodity supply chains has gained significant traction since the early 2000s, as evidenced by the proliferation of zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs) from private companies, public-private coalitions, and governments. These commitments aim to sever the link between agricultural commodity production and deforestation, particularly in tropical regions where the majority of deforestation occurs. Despite these efforts, high rates of deforestation persist, raising questions about the effectiveness of ZDCs in achieving their intended outcomes. This literature review explores the current state of deforestation-free commodity supply chains, examining both the successes and limitations of ZDCs, and discusses the broader policy context necessary for their success. One of the key successes of ZDCs has been their contribution to reducing deforestation in specific regions and for certain commodities. For example, the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Amazon has been credited with preventing hundreds of thousands of hectares of deforestation since its implementation in 2006 (Gibbs et al., 2015). Similarly, the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) has shown potential in reducing deforestation associated with palm oil production, although its impact has been more mixed due to challenges in implementation and enforcement (Austin et al., 2017). These examples highlight the potential of ZDCs to contribute to deforestation reduction when they are well-designed and effectively implemented. However, the overall impact of ZDCs on global deforestation rates remains limited. A significant challenge is that current supply chain initiatives only cover a small share of tropical deforestation. Many ZDCs focus on specific commodities or regions, leaving large areas of forest at risk. For instance, while the Soy Moratorium has been successful in the Brazilian Amazon, it does not address deforestation associated with soy production in other regions, such as the Cerrado (Lambin et al., 2018). Similarly, the IPOP has had limited impact on deforestation in Indonesia due to its narrow focus on palm oil and the exclusion of other drivers of deforestation, such as pulp and paper production (Pirard et al., 2015). Another limitation of ZDCs is the issue of leakage, where deforestation is displaced to areas outside the scope of the commitment. For example, the implementation of ZDCs in one region may lead to increased deforestation in neighboring regions or countries, as producers shift their activities to avoid compliance (Meyfroidt et al., 2018). This highlights the need for ZDCs to cover entire biomes and supply bases to prevent leakage and ensure that deforestation is not simply displaced. In addition to these challenges, the success of ZDCs depends on their integration into broader policy mixes aimed at reducing deforestation. Government-led initiatives, such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), play a crucial role in creating an enabling environment for ZDCs by addressing underlying drivers of deforestation and providing incentives for sustainable land use (Angelsen et al., 2018). Similarly, company-led ZDCs need to be complemented by efforts to improve monitoring, traceability, and transparency in supply chains, as well as by initiatives to support smallholder producers and ensure their inclusion in deforestation-free supply chains (Gardner et al., 2019). Despite these challenges, ZDCs have spurred progress in several areas. They have raised awareness of the link between commodity production and deforestation, leading to increased demand for deforestation-free products among consumers and investors (Henders et al., 2018). ZDCs have also driven improvements in monitoring and traceability, with the development of tools such as satellite imagery and blockchain technology to track the origin of commodities and verify compliance with ZDCs (Godar et al., 2016). These advancements have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of ZDCs by providing greater transparency and accountability in supply chains. In conclusion, while ZDCs have shown promise in reducing deforestation in specific contexts, their overall impact remains limited due to challenges in coverage, leakage, and implementation. To be more impactful, ZDCs need to cover entire biomes and supply bases, and be integrated into broader policy mixes that address the underlying drivers of deforestation. Additionally, efforts to improve monitoring, traceability, and transparency, as well as to support smallholder producers, are essential for the success of deforestation-free commodity supply chains. As the demand for sustainable products continues to grow, there is an opportunity to strengthen ZDCs and make deforestation-free supply chains a reality.", "References": [{"title": "Brazil's Soy Moratorium", "authors": "Holly K.
