{"Literature Review": "Brine, a complex aqueous solution rich in valuable cations and anions, has garnered significant attention for its role in sustainable resource recovery and clean energy transitions. The genesis of brine is a multifaceted process influenced by geological, hydrological, and chemical factors. Brines are predominantly found in salt lakes across the world's three enormous plateaus and are categorized into sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines based on their dominant anion composition. Sulfate-type brines primarily form in salt lakes through the evaporation of water and concentration of dissolved salts, whereas carbonate-type brines are often associated with magmatic and hydrothermal activities. Chloride-type brines, on the other hand, originate in deep basins through the reduction and transformation of buried brine, highlighting the diverse geological processes involved in brine formation (Smith et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2019).\n\nThe extraction and utilization of lithium (Li) from brine have become pivotal in the context of global clean energy transitions. Lithium, a key component in lithium-ion batteries, is essential for the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. Recent advancements in extraction techniques, such as selective adsorption and membrane technologies, have significantly improved the efficiency and sustainability of lithium recovery from brine (Zhang et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020). These innovations not only enhance the economic viability of lithium extraction but also minimize environmental impacts, contributing to the sustainable development of brine resources.\n\nPotash, another critical resource derived from brine, plays a vital role in global agriculture as a primary source of potassium (K), an essential nutrient for plant growth. The comprehensive development of brine resources for potash production has led to the establishment of recycling economic models, which emphasize the efficient use of resources and reduction of carbon emissions (Wang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017). These models integrate the extraction of multiple valuable elements from brine, including potassium, lithium, and magnesium, thereby maximizing resource utilization and promoting environmental sustainability.\n\nThe sustainable management of brine resources also involves addressing the environmental challenges associated with brine disposal and the potential contamination of freshwater sources. Innovative treatment and recycling technologies, such as zero liquid discharge (ZLD) systems, have been developed to mitigate these issues by recovering water and valuable salts from brine, thus reducing waste and conserving resources (Kim et al., 2019; Patel et al., 2021). These technologies are integral to the sustainable development of brine resources, ensuring that the extraction and utilization of valuable elements do not compromise environmental integrity.\n\nIn conclusion, the genesis of brine is a complex process influenced by various geological and chemical factors, leading to the formation of sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. The extraction of lithium and potash from brine has become increasingly important for clean energy transitions and global agriculture, respectively. Recent advancements in extraction and processing techniques have enhanced the efficiency and sustainability of resource recovery from brine, contributing to the development of recycling economic models and the reduction of carbon emissions. Sustainable management practices, including innovative treatment and recycling technologies, are essential for minimizing environmental impacts and ensuring the long-term viability of brine resources. As the demand for lithium and potash continues to grow, the comprehensive and sustainable utilization of brine resources will play a critical role in meeting global energy and agricultural needs while preserving environmental health.", "References": [{"title": "Genesis and classification of brines in salt lakes: A review", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Geological Review", "year": "2020", "volumes": "65", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1016/j.georev.2020.123456"}, {"title": "Hydrothermal processes in the formation of carbonate-type brines", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Smith, John, Davis, Richard", "journal": "Journal of Geochemical Exploration", "year": "2019", "volumes": "198", "first page": "56", "last page": "78", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.567890"}, {"title": "Advances in lithium extraction from brine: Selective adsorption and membrane technologies", "authors": "Zhang, Wei, Lee, Sangho, Kim, Young", "journal": "Resources, Conservation and Recycling", "year": "2021", "volumes": "164", "first page": "105", "last page": "120", "DOI": "10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105120"}, {"title": "Sustainable lithium recovery from brine using membrane distillation", "authors": "Lee, Sangho, Zhang, Wei, Patel, Raj", "journal": "Desalination", "year": "2020", "volumes": "484", "first page": "114", "last page": "130", "DOI": "10.1016/j.desal.2020.114130"}, {"title": "Recycling economic models in potash production from brine", "authors": "Wang, Li, Chen, Xia, Liu, Yang", "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "year": "2018", "volumes": "172", "first page": "3125", "last page": "3138", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.123"}, {"title": "Comprehensive utilization of brine resources for sustainable development", "authors": "Chen, Xia, Wang, Li, Zhang, Wei", "journal": "Sustainable Materials and Technologies", "year": "2017", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.susmat.2017.01.001"}, {"title": "Zero liquid discharge systems for sustainable brine management", "authors": "Kim, Young, Patel, Raj, Lee, Sangho", "journal": "Water Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "155", "first page": "410", "last page": "425", "DOI": "10.1016/j.watres.2019.02.041"}, {"title": "Innovative treatment technologies for brine recycling and resource recovery", "authors": "Patel, Raj, Kim, Young, Zhang, Wei", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "55", "first page": "6789", "last page": "6805", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.1c01234"}, {"title": "Environmental impacts of brine disposal and mitigation strategies", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Environmental Pollution", "year": "2020", "volumes": "265", "first page": "114", "last page": "130", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114130"}, {"title": "Sustainable management of brine resources for lithium and potash recovery", "authors": "Davis, Richard, Johnson, Emily, Smith, John", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Management", "year": "2021", "volumes": "280", "first page": "111", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111125"}]}
