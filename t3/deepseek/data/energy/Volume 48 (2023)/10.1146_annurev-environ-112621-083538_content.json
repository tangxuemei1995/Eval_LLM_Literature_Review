{"Literature Review": "The attribution of extreme weather events to climate change has emerged as a critical area of research, bridging the gap between scientific understanding and real-world experiences. This literature review synthesizes findings from recent studies to explore the methodologies, challenges, and implications of attributing extreme events to anthropogenic climate change, with a particular focus on the Global South and the ethical dimensions of vulnerability and policy-making. Attribution science has evolved significantly over the past decade, enabling researchers to quantify the influence of human activities on the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has incorporated these findings into its assessment reports, highlighting the role of attribution studies in understanding present-day impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2021). However, the integration of highly conditional attribution methods with probabilistic assessments remains a complex challenge, necessitating further research to refine these methodologies (Stott et al., 2016). One of the key advancements in attribution science is the development of probabilistic event attribution (PEA), which assesses how climate change alters the probability of extreme events. Studies employing PEA have demonstrated that human-induced climate change has increased the likelihood of events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and droughts (Otto et al., 2018). Despite these advancements, the application of attribution science in the Global South is hindered by data scarcity and limited research capacity, raising ethical questions about the equitable distribution of scientific resources and the need for localized studies (Huggel et al., 2019). The ethical dimensions of attribution science are particularly pertinent in the context of policy-making and adaptation strategies. Attribution studies can inform decisions on loss and damage, but their application must consider the vulnerabilities of affected communities (James et al., 2019). The role of vulnerability in shaping the impacts of extreme events underscores the importance of integrating social and environmental factors into attribution research (Eriksen et al., 2021). Furthermore, the discourse on attribution methods has highlighted the need for a unified approach that reconciles differences between various methodologies. While the IPCC has made strides in assessing these methods collectively, the academic debate continues to emphasize the importance of individual attribution studies in addressing specific societal questions (Shepherd, 2016). The development of attribution science also raises questions about the extent to which existing studies provide sufficient information for policy-making. While attribution studies have enhanced our understanding of climate change impacts, there is a growing recognition of the need for more comprehensive assessments that consider the interplay between climate change, vulnerability, and adaptation (van Oldenborgh et al., 2017). In conclusion, the attribution of extreme weather events to climate change has provided valuable insights into the impacts of human activities on the climate system. However, challenges remain in refining attribution methodologies, addressing data gaps in the Global South, and integrating vulnerability considerations into policy-making. Future research must continue to bridge these gaps, ensuring that attribution science contributes to equitable and effective climate adaptation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis.
