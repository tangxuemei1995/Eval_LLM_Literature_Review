{"Literature Review": "The transition towards green technologies is pivotal for addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. However, this transition harbors the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities if not managed with a keen focus on environmental justice. This literature review explores the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, emphasizing the disparities in access, the necessity for integrated policy design, and the role of enabling technologies in ensuring equitable adoption. Disparities in access to green technologies between countries and among different demographic groups within countries are well-documented. For instance, Sovacool (2021) highlights how the energy transition risks burdening those excluded from efficient new technologies with the costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure, thereby exacerbating inequalities. This underscores the importance of carefully managing the transition to ensure it does not deepen existing disparities. The energy transition creates new interdependencies between sectors, such as buildings, the power sector, and transportation, necessitating integrated design of policies and infrastructure. As noted by Jenkins et al. (2018), the success of the energy transition hinges on the ability to design policies that are coherent across different sectors, ensuring that advancements in one area do not inadvertently create challenges in another. Equitable adoption of new technologies is contingent on broadening access to enabling technologies such as the Internet and payment systems. According to Unwin (2019), digital inclusion is a critical factor in ensuring that the benefits of green technologies are accessible to all, particularly marginalized communities. This highlights the need for policies that not only promote the development of green technologies but also ensure that the necessary infrastructure for their adoption is in place. Decisionmakers must focus on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services without replicating current inefficiencies. For example, equitable access to mobility should not be limited to motorized personal vehicles but should include a range of sustainable transportation options. As argued by Banister (2018), a modal shift towards more sustainable forms of transportation is essential for achieving environmental justice in the context of the energy transition. Data at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are crucial for designing equitable technology deployment strategies and evaluating their success. As highlighted by Bulkeley and Betsill (2020), the lack of detailed data on the distributional impacts of green technologies can hinder efforts to ensure that the benefits of the energy transition are equitably distributed. This calls for increased investment in data collection and analysis to inform more equitable policy decisions. In conclusion, the transition towards green technologies offers a unique opportunity to address climate change and promote sustainable development. However, realizing this potential requires a concerted effort to ensure that the transition is managed in a way that promotes environmental justice. This includes addressing disparities in access to green technologies, designing integrated policies that account for the interdependencies between different sectors, broadening access to enabling technologies, focusing on new technologies that remove disparities in access to services, and investing in data collection and analysis to inform equitable policy decisions.", "References": [{"title": "The history and politics of energy transitions", "authors": "Benjamin K.
