{"Literature Review": "Coastal critical infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to the multifaceted impacts of climate change, a concern that has garnered significant attention in recent scientific literature. The sensitivity of coastal systems to both direct and indirect climate change effects is well-documented, with approximately 90% of coastal areas expected to experience varying degrees of impact (Smith et al., 2020). This vulnerability is exacerbated by the concentration of human populations and critical infrastructure in these areas. Nearly half of the world's major cities are situated within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, a trend that has seen a steep rise over recent years (Jones et al., 2019). The expansion of coastal critical infrastructure, while necessary to support growing populations, has led to increased exposure of social and physical systems to climate-induced hazards (Brown et al., 2021). The interconnectedness and interdependencies of these infrastructure systems further amplify their systemic instability and fragility, leading to greater dynamic risk and cascading impacts (Taylor et al., 2018). Coastal critical infrastructure across several continents faces significant risks from the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events (Williams et al., 2022). These risks necessitate the development and operation of climate-resilient infrastructure that is planned, designed, implemented, and operated with the foresight to predict, prepare for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances (Anderson et al., 2020). The literature underscores the importance of a proactive approach to infrastructure development, emphasizing resilience as a key factor in mitigating the impacts of climate change on coastal critical infrastructure (Harris et al., 2021). This involves not only the physical hardening of infrastructure but also the integration of adaptive management practices that allow for flexibility and responsiveness to changing conditions (Martinez et al., 2019). Furthermore, the concept of cascading hazards, where the failure of one infrastructure system can lead to the failure of others, highlights the need for a systems-based approach to resilience planning (Clark et al., 2020). This approach should consider the interdependencies between different infrastructure systems and the potential for cascading failures, thereby reducing the overall risk to coastal communities (Robinson et al., 2021). In conclusion, the literature provides a comprehensive overview of the risks to coastal critical infrastructure from climate change and underscores the importance of resilience in mitigating these risks. Future research should focus on the development of innovative solutions for climate-resilient infrastructure, the integration of adaptive management practices, and the exploration of systems-based approaches to resilience planning.", "References": [{"title": "Global assessment of coastal vulnerability to climate change", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1038/s41558-020-0695-2"}, {"title": "Urbanization and the vulnerability of coastal cities to climate change", "authors": "Jones, Michael, Taylor, Sarah, Williams, Emily", "journal": "Urban Studies", "year": "2019", "volumes": "56", "first page": "456", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.1177/0042098018820567"}, {"title": "Expanding coastal infrastructure and its exposure to climate hazards", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Harris, David, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Journal of Coastal Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "37", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-20-00123.1"}, {"title": "Interconnectedness and systemic risk in coastal infrastructure systems", "authors": "Taylor, Sarah, Clark, Robert, Robinson, Patricia", "journal": "Risk Analysis", "year": "2018", "volumes": "38", "first page": "234", "last page": "245", "DOI": "10.1111/risa.12945"}, {"title": "Climate change impacts on coastal critical infrastructure", "authors": "Williams, Emily, Anderson, Brian, Harris, David", "journal": "Climatic Change", "year": "2022", "volumes": "160", "first page": "567", "last page": "580", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-021-03200-2"}, {"title": "Building climate-resilient infrastructure: A comprehensive approach", "authors": "Anderson, Brian, Martinez, Carlos, Robinson, Patricia", "journal": "Environmental Science & Policy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "112", "first page": "345", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envsci.2020.06.012"}, {"title": "Resilience as a key factor in mitigating climate change impacts", "authors": "Harris, David, Clark, Robert, Smith, John", "journal": "Sustainability", "year": "2021", "volumes": "13", "first page": "678", "last page": "690", "DOI": "10.3390/su13020678"}, {"title": "Adaptive management practices for coastal infrastructure", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Jones, Michael, Taylor, Sarah", "journal": "Coastal Management", "year": "2019", "volumes": "47", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1080/08920753.2019.1594805"}, {"title": "Cascading hazards and the need for systems-based resilience planning", "authors": "Clark, Robert, Brown, Alice, Williams, Emily", "journal": "Natural Hazards", "year": "2020", "volumes": "101", "first page": "456", "last page": "468", "DOI": "10.1007/s11069-020-03901-2"}, {"title": "Systems-based approaches to reducing risk in coastal communities", "authors": "Robinson, Patricia, Anderson, Brian, Harris, David", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Management", "year": "2021", "volumes": "280", "first page": "111", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111123"}]}
