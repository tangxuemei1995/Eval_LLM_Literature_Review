{"Literature Review": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both a store and a sink for carbon. This literature review explores the expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of transitions in SOC, focusing on its role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, the effectiveness of climate policy measures, and the requirements for transitions at various scales. The Century and Millennial models have been instrumental in understanding SOC dynamics, offering insights into decomposition, litter, and root turnover processes. These models, alongside soil mapping techniques, have helped elucidate the geographic variation in SOC related to climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth. The desirability of recovering from SOC deficits has been mainstreamed into climate policy, yet the effectiveness of proposed measures remains contested. Process-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions following land use change. However, the requirements for transitions at plot and landscape scales remain uncertain. Expectations of policy-induced SOC transitions must align with national cross-sectoral carbon accounting and be managed realistically with land users and commodity supply chains. This review synthesizes current knowledge on SOC as a carbon store and sink, highlighting the need for integrated approaches that consider biophysical, socioeconomic, and policy dimensions to enhance soil health and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.", "References": [{"title": "Soil carbon sequestration impacts on global climate change and food security", "authors": "Rattan Lal", "journal": "Science", "year": "2004", "volumes": "304", "first page": "1623", "last page": "1627", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1097396"}, {"title": "The role of soil organic matter in maintaining soil quality in continuous cropping systems", "authors": "David C.
