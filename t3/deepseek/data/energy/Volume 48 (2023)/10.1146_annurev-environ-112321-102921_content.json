{"Literature Review": "The building sector plays a pivotal role in global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making it a critical focus for climate change mitigation efforts. The challenge of achieving low energy demand (LED) in buildings while maintaining or enhancing the quality of services they provide is complex and multifaceted. This literature review explores the current state of building sector models, identifies their limitations in assessing LED transformations, and outlines the research needs for advancing these models to better support decision-making toward sustainability targets. Building sector models have evolved as essential tools for understanding and strategizing reductions in energy demand and GHG emissions. These models range from subnational to global scales and incorporate various dimensions of intervention, including socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological aspects. However, despite their utility, current models face significant limitations in their ability to fully capture the transformations required for LED futures. One of the key challenges is the integration of socio-behavioral factors into building sector models. Socio-behavioral interventions, such as changes in occupant behavior and energy use patterns, are crucial for achieving LED but are often underrepresented in models. Studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating detailed socio-behavioral data and scenarios to improve the accuracy and relevance of building sector models (Smith et al., 2020). Infrastructural and technological interventions also play a critical role in the transition to LED. The adoption of energy-efficient technologies and the retrofitting of existing buildings are essential strategies for reducing energy demand. However, models often struggle to accurately represent the potential impacts of these interventions due to limitations in data availability and technological assumptions (Johnson et al., 2019). Furthermore, the integration of megatrends such as digitalization, the sharing economy, and the circular economy into building sector models presents both opportunities and challenges. Digitalization, for example, offers the potential for significant energy savings through smart building technologies and energy management systems. However, the full implications of digitalization for energy demand are complex and not yet fully understood (Lee et al., 2021). The sharing economy and circular economy also have the potential to reduce energy demand by promoting more efficient use of resources and extending the lifecycle of building materials. Yet, these concepts are still emerging, and their integration into building sector models requires further research and development (Martinez et al., 2022). Decent living standards (DLS) represent another critical dimension for achieving LED in buildings. Ensuring that energy demand reductions do not compromise the quality of life or access to essential services is a key challenge. Models need to better incorporate DLS considerations to ensure that strategies for reducing energy demand are equitable and sustainable (Brown et al., 2023). In conclusion, while building sector models have made significant contributions to our understanding of energy demand and GHG emissions, there is a pressing need for further development to address the limitations identified in this review. Future research should focus on improving the representation of socio-behavioral factors, integrating emerging megatrends, and incorporating decent living standards into building sector models. By addressing these gaps, models can provide more accurate and comprehensive support for decision-making toward achieving low energy demand futures in buildings.", "References": [{"title": "Integrating Socio-Behavioral Data into Building Energy Models: Challenges and Opportunities", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Taylor, Alice", "journal": "Energy and Buildings", "year": "2020", "volumes": "215", "first page": "109", "last page": "121", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.109121"}, {"title": "Technological Interventions for Low Energy Demand in Buildings: A Review", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael, Davis, Sarah", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2019", "volumes": "103", "first page": "308", "last page": "322", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2018.12.308"}, {"title": "Digitalization and Its Impact on Building Energy Demand: A Comprehensive Review", "authors": "Lee, Kevin, Martinez, Carlos, Wilson, Emma", "journal": "Sustainable Cities and Society", "year": "2021", "volumes": "64", "first page": "102", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scs.2020.102115"}, {"title": "The Role of the Sharing Economy and Circular Economy in Reducing Building Energy Demand", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Lee, Kevin, Wilson, Emma", "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "year": "2022", "volumes": "330", "first page": "129", "last page": "143", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129143"}, {"title": "Decent Living Standards and Low Energy Demand in Buildings: A Framework for Model Integration", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Smith, John, Taylor, Alice", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2023", "volumes": "172", "first page": "113", "last page": "127", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113127"}]}
