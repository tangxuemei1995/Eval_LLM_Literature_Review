{"Literature Review": "The exploration of liquid surface tension in microrobotics has unveiled a plethora of opportunities for innovation in the manipulation and control of micro-scale objects. Surface tension, a fundamental physical property of liquids, becomes significantly influential at the submillimeter scale, enabling a variety of applications in microrobotics. This literature review delves into the exploitation of surface tension and capillary forces in microrobotics, focusing on the underlying physics, application fields, and the integration of sensing and control schemes to overcome inherent uncertainties.The physics of surface tension and capillary forces has been extensively studied, providing a solid foundation for their application in microrobotics. Surface tension arises from the cohesive forces between liquid molecules, leading to phenomena such as wetting, surface texturation, and the formation of menisci. These phenomena have been harnessed in various microrobotic applications, including capillary picking, self-alignment, sealing, and the creation of capillary bearings. The ability to control liquid menisci through various stimuli, such as light and magnetic fields, has further expanded the potential applications of surface tension in microrobotics.Despite the promising applications, the exploitation of surface tension in microrobotics faces challenges due to uncertainties in open-loop control systems. Two major sources of variability have been identified: contact-angle hysteresis and the variability in the volume of liquid involved. Contact-angle hysteresis, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles, can lead to unpredictable behavior in capillary forces. Similarly, variations in the volume of liquid can affect the stability and reliability of microrobotic operations. To address these challenges, the integration of sensors and advanced control schemes is essential for the development of robust capillary microrobotic systems.Recent research has focused on the development of sensing and control strategies to mitigate the effects of these uncertainties. For instance, real-time feedback control systems have been proposed to dynamically adjust the stimuli applied to liquid menisci, compensating for variations in contact angle and liquid volume. Additionally, the use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors has been explored for precise measurement and control of capillary forces. These advancements have led to the creation of more reliable and efficient microrobotic systems capable of performing complex tasks with high precision.The application of surface tension in microrobotics spans various fields, including actuation, picking, and sealing. In actuation, capillary forces have been used to drive the movement of micro-scale components, offering a simple and effective alternative to traditional actuation mechanisms. In picking applications, surface tension enables the gentle and precise manipulation of micro-objects, minimizing the risk of damage. Capillary sealing, on the other hand, utilizes the cohesive properties of liquids to create leak-proof seals in microfluidic devices.In conclusion, the exploitation of liquid surface tension in microrobotics presents a promising avenue for the development of innovative micro-scale manipulation and control systems. While challenges related to uncertainties in open-loop control systems remain, the integration of advanced sensing and control schemes offers a pathway to overcoming these obstacles. As research in this field continues to evolve, the potential applications of surface tension in microrobotics are expected to expand, paving the way for new technological advancements.", "References": [{"title": "Capillary forces in microassembly: Modeling, simulation, experiments, and case study", "authors": "Pierre Lambert, Alain Delchambre", "journal": "Microelectronics Journal", "year": "2005", "volumes": "36", "first page": "673", "last page": "677", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mejo.2005.04.021"}, {"title": "Surface tension driven self-assembly of microchips on hydrophobic receptor sites with water using a hydrophobic/hydrophilic layer", "authors": "Srinivas A.
