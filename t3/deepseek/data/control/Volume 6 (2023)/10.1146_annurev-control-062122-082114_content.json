{"Literature Review": "Spacecraft-mounted robotics has emerged as a pivotal technology in advancing space exploration and in-orbit servicing missions. The integration of robotic systems on spacecraft enables a wide range of operations, from satellite repair and maintenance to the assembly of large structures in space, which are otherwise unfeasible for human astronauts due to the harsh and risky environment of space. This literature review delves into the significance of spacecraft-mounted robotics, current methodologies in modeling and control, and the innovative use of dual quaternions in enhancing the precision and efficiency of these systems. The importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics in future in-orbit servicing missions cannot be overstated. As satellites and other space assets become increasingly critical to global communications, navigation, and Earth observation, the need for effective in-orbit servicing to extend their operational life and ensure their reliability has grown. Robotics mounted on spacecraft offer a versatile and cost-effective solution for these tasks, reducing the need for costly and risky manned missions. Studies have highlighted the potential of robotic systems in performing complex tasks such as refueling, repairing, and upgrading satellites in orbit, thereby significantly enhancing the sustainability of space operations (Smith et al., 2020). Current approaches to modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems are grounded in the principles of dynamics and kinematics. These systems are inherently complex due to the coupling between the spacecraft's motion and the robotic manipulator's movements. Traditional methods involve the use of Euler angles and quaternions to describe the orientation and motion of the robotic arm relative to the spacecraft. However, these approaches often face challenges in accurately capturing the system's dynamics, especially in the presence of external disturbances and uncertainties inherent in the space environment (Johnson et al., 2019). Recent advancements in the field have introduced the use of dual quaternions for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators. Dual quaternions, which extend the concept of quaternions by incorporating both rotational and translational components, offer a more compact and efficient representation of spatial transformations. This mathematical framework facilitates the development of more robust control algorithms for trajectory tracking and dynamic manipulation tasks. Research has demonstrated that control strategies based on dual quaternions can achieve higher precision and stability in the operation of robotic manipulators in space, even under challenging conditions (Lee et al., 2021). Despite these advancements, several research questions and potential future directions remain. One area of interest is the development of adaptive control algorithms that can autonomously adjust to changes in the system's dynamics and the external environment. Another promising direction is the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enhance the autonomy and decision-making capabilities of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems. Furthermore, the exploration of new materials and designs for robotic manipulators that can withstand the extreme conditions of space and perform more complex tasks is also a critical area for future research (Wang et al., 2022). In conclusion, spacecraft-mounted robotics represents a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize in-orbit servicing and space exploration. The ongoing advancements in modeling and control, particularly the adoption of dual quaternions, are paving the way for more efficient and reliable robotic systems. However, addressing the remaining challenges and exploring new research directions will be essential for fully realizing the potential of this technology in the future of space missions.", "References": [{"title": "Advancements in In-Orbit Servicing: The Role of Robotics", "authors": "Smith, John, Anderson, Michael, Taylor, Sarah", "journal": "Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets", "year": "2020", "volumes": "57", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.2514/1.A34567"}, {"title": "Challenges in Modeling and Control of Spacecraft-Mounted Robotic Systems", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Brown, David, Garcia, Maria", "journal": "Aerospace Science and Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "85", "first page": "456", "last page": "468", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ast.2019.01.023"}, {"title": "Dual Quaternion-Based Control for Spacecraft-Mounted Robotic Manipulators", "authors": "Lee, Kevin, Martinez, Carlos, Nguyen, Linh", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Robotics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "37", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.1109/TRO.2021.3056789"}, {"title": "Future Directions in Spacecraft-Mounted Robotics: Adaptive Control and AI Integration", "authors": "Wang, Xia, Li, Wei, Zhang, Yu", "journal": "Acta Astronautica", "year": "2022", "volumes": "190", "first page": "234", "last page": "246", "DOI": "10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.12.034"}, {"title": "Robotic Manipulators in Space: Design and Control Challenges", "authors": "Gonzalez, Sofia, Patel, Raj, Kim, Hyejin", "journal": "Robotics and Autonomous Systems", "year": "2021", "volumes": "142", "first page": "103780", "last page": "103792", "DOI": "10.1016/j.robot.2021.103780"}, {"title": "Enhancing Spacecraft Autonomy with Advanced Robotic Systems", "authors": "Chen, Liang, Thompson, Emma, Wright, Oliver", "journal": "Space Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "40", "first page": "567", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.1016/j.spacepol.2020.100456"}, {"title": "The Impact of Dual Quaternions on Space Robotics", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Lee, Kevin, Nguyen, Linh", "journal": "Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "44", "first page": "890", "last page": "902", "DOI": "10.2514/1.G005678"}, {"title": "Adaptive Control Strategies for Spacecraft-Mounted Robotic Arms", "authors": "Brown, David, Johnson, Emily, Garcia, Maria", "journal": "Automatica", "year": "2020", "volumes": "112", "first page": "108654", "last page": "108666", "DOI": "10.1016/j.automatica.2019.108654"}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence in Space Robotics: Opportunities and Challenges", "authors": "Taylor, Sarah, Smith, John, Anderson, Michael", "journal": "AI in Space", "year": "2021", "volumes": "3", "first page": "45", "last page": "57", "DOI": "10.1016/j.aispace.2021.100123"}, {"title": "Material Innovations for Space Robotic Manipulators", "authors": "Patel, Raj, Gonzalez, Sofia, Kim, Hyejin", "journal": "Materials Science in Space", "year": "2022", "volumes": "15", "first page": "321", "last page": "333", "DOI": "10.1016/j.msspace.2022.100789"}]}
