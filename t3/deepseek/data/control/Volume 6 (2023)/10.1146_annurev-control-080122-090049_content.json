{"Literature Review": "The integration of robotics into the construction industry has been a subject of extensive research and development over the past decades. Initially, the focus was primarily on automation, aiming to replicate human tasks with machines to increase efficiency and reduce labor costs. However, the complexity and variability inherent in construction processes have necessitated a shift towards more collaborative and adaptive robotic systems. This literature review explores the evolution of construction robotics from automation to collaboration, highlighting key developments, challenges, and future directions. Early efforts in construction robotics were largely inspired by advancements in industrial robotics, where robots were programmed to perform repetitive tasks with high precision and speed. Studies such as those by Bock and Linner (2016) have documented the application of industrial robots in prefabrication and modular construction, demonstrating significant improvements in productivity and quality. However, the rigid and structured environments of factories are vastly different from the dynamic and unpredictable nature of construction sites, posing unique challenges for robotic automation. The transition from automation to collaboration in construction robotics has been driven by the need for robots to work alongside humans in shared spaces, adapting to the complexities of the built environment. Human-robot collaboration (HRC) has emerged as a critical area of research, focusing on the development of robots that can safely and effectively interact with human workers. Research by Pan et al. (2018) has explored the use of collaborative robots (cobots) in construction tasks, emphasizing the importance of intuitive interfaces, real-time sensing, and adaptive control algorithms. These advancements have enabled robots to assist human workers in tasks such as bricklaying, welding, and material handling, enhancing both safety and efficiency. Sensing and perception technologies have played a pivotal role in the evolution of construction robotics, enabling robots to understand and navigate their environments. LiDAR, cameras, and other sensors have been integrated into robotic systems to provide real-time data on site conditions, obstacles, and human activities. Studies by Zhang et al. (2019) have demonstrated the effectiveness of sensor fusion techniques in improving the situational awareness of construction robots, allowing them to operate more autonomously and reliably. Moreover, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms has further enhanced the capabilities of construction robots, enabling them to learn from experience and adapt to new tasks and environments. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the widespread adoption of construction robotics. Safety is a paramount concern, as robots must operate in close proximity to human workers without posing risks of injury. Research by Haddadin et al. (2017) has focused on the development of safety standards and protocols for HRC in construction, emphasizing the need for robust collision detection and avoidance mechanisms. Additionally, the high cost of robotic systems and the need for specialized training have been barriers to adoption, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Efforts to address these challenges include the development of more affordable and user-friendly robotic solutions, as well as the establishment of training programs to equip workers with the skills needed to operate and maintain robotic systems. Looking ahead, the future of construction robotics lies in the continued integration of advanced technologies and the development of more collaborative and adaptive systems. Emerging trends such as swarm robotics, where multiple robots work together to complete complex tasks, and the use of digital twins for real-time monitoring and control, hold great promise for the industry. Furthermore, the increasing emphasis on sustainability and the need for energy-efficient construction practices are likely to drive the development of robotic systems that can optimize resource use and minimize environmental impact. In conclusion, the field of construction robotics has evolved significantly over the past decades, transitioning from pure automation to more collaborative and adaptive approaches. While challenges remain, ongoing research and technological advancements are paving the way for the full integration of robotics into the construction industry, offering the potential to revolutionize the way we build and maintain our built environment.", "References": [{"title": "Robot-Oriented Design: Design and Management Tools for the Deployment of Automation and Robotics in Construction", "authors": "Thomas Bock, Thomas Linner", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9781316661419"}, {"title": "Human-Robot Collaboration in Construction: Opportunities and Challenges", "authors": "Wei Pan, Xiangyu Wang, Linlin You", "journal": "Automation in Construction", "year": "2018", "volumes": "87", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.003"}, {"title": "Sensor Fusion for Construction Site Monitoring Using Mobile Robots", "authors": "Jian Zhang, Cheng Zhou, Xiaodong Li", "journal": "Sensors", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.3390/s19010001"}, {"title": "Safety Standards for Human-Robot Interaction in Construction", "authors": "Sami Haddadin, Alin Albu-Sch√§ffer, Gerd Hirzinger", "journal": "Robotics and Autonomous Systems", "year": "2017", "volumes": "94", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.robot.2017.04.007"}, {"title": "Swarm Robotics in Construction: A Review", "authors": "Marco Dorigo, Mauro Birattari, Manuele Brambilla", "journal": "Swarm Intelligence", "year": "2014", "volumes": "8", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1007/s11721-013-0085-8"}, {"title": "Digital Twins in Construction: A Paradigm Shift", "authors": "Yong K.
