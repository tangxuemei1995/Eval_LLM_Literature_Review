{"Literature Review": "Soft robotics represents a transformative shift in the design and functionality of robotic systems, offering unparalleled adaptability and safety in human-robot interactions. The inherent flexibility and compliance of soft materials enable these robots to perform complex, bioinspired motions that are challenging for their rigid counterparts. However, the fabrication of soft robots introduces unique challenges, particularly in the integration of multifunctional and multimaterial components. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, emerges as a pivotal technology in addressing these challenges, enabling the customization and personalization of soft robotic systems. This literature review explores the advancements in 3D printing technologies for soft robotics, focusing on pneumatic, electrically activated, magnetically driven, and 4D-printed soft actuators, as well as the integration of soft actuators and sensors. The discussion also highlights the challenges and future prospects of realizing multimaterial, multiscale, and multifunctional 3D-printed soft robots. Pneumatic soft actuators, which rely on air pressure for movement, have been extensively studied due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Recent advancements in 3D printing have facilitated the fabrication of complex pneumatic networks within soft materials, enabling precise control over actuation. For instance, a study by Mosadegh et al. (2014) demonstrated the use of 3D printing to create pneumatic actuators capable of complex, biomimetic motions. Electrically activated soft actuators, such as those based on dielectric elastomers, offer high energy density and fast response times. Additive manufacturing has enabled the integration of conductive materials within soft matrices, paving the way for the development of soft robots with embedded electronic functionalities. A notable example is the work by Keplinger et al. (2013), who developed a 3D-printed, electrically activated soft actuator with integrated sensing capabilities. Magnetically driven soft actuators utilize magnetic fields to induce deformation in soft materials. The precise control offered by magnetic actuation, combined with the design freedom of 3D printing, has led to the development of soft robots capable of navigating complex environments. Kim et al. (2019) showcased the potential of this approach by fabricating a magnetically actuated soft robot with programmable locomotion. 4D printing, an extension of 3D printing, involves the use of smart materials that can change shape or properties in response to external stimuli. This technology holds great promise for the development of soft robots with adaptive functionalities. Tibbits (2014) introduced the concept of 4D printing and demonstrated its application in creating self-assembling structures. The integration of soft actuators and sensors is crucial for the development of autonomous soft robots. Additive manufacturing enables the co-fabrication of these components, leading to seamless integration and enhanced performance. A study by Truby et al. (2018) highlighted the potential of 3D printing in creating soft robots with embedded sensing and actuation capabilities. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of 3D-printed soft robotics. The development of multimaterial 3D printing technologies is essential for the fabrication of soft robots with diverse functionalities. Additionally, achieving multiscale resolution in 3D printing is critical for the precise control of soft robotic systems. Finally, the integration of multifunctional components within a single soft robot presents a significant challenge, requiring innovative approaches in materials science and manufacturing. In conclusion, additive manufacturing offers a versatile and powerful platform for the development of soft robotic systems. By enabling the customization and integration of multifunctional components, 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize the field of soft robotics. However, realizing this potential will require continued advancements in materials science, manufacturing technologies, and design methodologies.", "References": [{"title": "Pneumatic Networks for Soft Robotics that Actuate Rapidly", "authors": "Bobak Mosadegh, Panagiotis Polygerinos, Christoph Keplinger, Sophia Wennstedt, Robert F.
