{"Literature Review": "The field of physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from a focus on hardware development to the exploration of sophisticated algorithms that facilitate more natural and effective communication between humans and robots. This literature review delves into the progression of pHRI, highlighting key developments and discussing the future direction of embodied communication in human–robot collaboration. Early research in pHRI was predominantly concerned with the design of compliant and sensorized hardware, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and robot arms, which allowed for safe and effective physical interaction between humans and robots (Hogan, 1985). These foundational studies laid the groundwork for the development of hardware capable of supporting complex collaborative tasks. As hardware capabilities advanced, the focus shifted towards the development of algorithms that could interpret and regulate pHRI, enabling more fluent and expressive interactions. Initial algorithmic approaches were based on physical analogies, such as admittance control, which models the interaction between a robot and its environment as a mechanical system (Colgate & Hogan, 1988). These methods were effective for task-specific interactions but lacked the flexibility required for versatile human–robot collaboration. The advent of more powerful computing resources facilitated the exploration of computational methods based on higher-level reasoning, which leverage multimodal communication channels to enhance the interaction between humans and robots (Kheddar et al., 2017). These approaches have enabled robots to interpret human intentions more accurately and to respond in a manner that is more aligned with human expectations. Despite these advancements, existing algorithmic approaches are largely limited to specific tasks and do not generalize well to a wide range of collaborative scenarios. This limitation underscores the need for the development of emergent embodied dialogue—a bidirectional, multimodal communication framework that can be learned through continuous interaction (Argall & Billard, 2010). Emergent embodied dialogue represents a promising frontier in pHRI, offering the potential for more natural and intuitive human–robot collaboration. The integration of machine learning techniques with pHRI systems is one avenue through which this goal can be achieved, enabling robots to adapt their behavior based on the context of the interaction and the preferences of the human user (Calinon et al., 2010). Furthermore, the incorporation of social cues and non-verbal communication into pHRI systems can enhance the expressiveness of robots, making them more effective collaborators (Breazeal, 2003). The development of standardized protocols and interfaces for pHRI is another critical area of research, as it can facilitate the integration of different robotic systems and promote interoperability (Goodrich & Schultz, 2007). In conclusion, the field of pHRI has made significant strides in enabling physical interaction between humans and robots, but there is still much work to be done in achieving truly versatile and intuitive collaboration. The exploration of emergent embodied dialogue, along with the integration of machine learning and social communication cues, represents a promising direction for future research in this area.", "References": [{"title": "Impedance Control: An Approach to Manipulation", "authors": "Neville Hogan", "journal": "Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control", "year": "1985", "volumes": "107", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1115/1.3140702"}, {"title": "Robust Control of Dynamically Interacting Systems", "authors": "J.
