{"Literature Review": "The control of multicarrier energy systems (MCES) has emerged as a critical area of research in response to the growing demands for energy efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. MCES integrate various energy carriers such as electricity, natural gas, and thermal energy, along with their conversion and storage technologies, to optimize energy use across different scales from individual buildings to entire networks. This literature review explores the evolution of control strategies for MCES, focusing on the transition from isolated building energy control to the management of interconnected energy systems, and highlights the role of optimization-based approaches in addressing the complex dynamics and constraints inherent in these systems.The concept of energy hubs, which serve as interfaces between different energy carriers and consumers, has been pivotal in advancing MCES control. Geidl and Andersson (2007) introduced the energy hub model, providing a framework for the optimal operation of multicarrier energy systems by considering the conversion, storage, and distribution of various energy forms. This model has since been expanded and applied to a range of scenarios, from single buildings to district energy systems, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.Building energy control has traditionally focused on optimizing the operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, lighting, and other building services to minimize energy consumption while maintaining comfort. Recent advancements in predictive control techniques have significantly enhanced the ability to manage building energy systems dynamically. For instance, Ma et al. (2012) developed a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for building HVAC systems that accounts for weather forecasts and occupancy patterns, achieving substantial energy savings without compromising indoor environmental quality.The integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems into buildings has further complicated the control problem, necessitating more sophisticated approaches. Parisio et al. (2014) proposed a distributed MPC framework for managing the energy flows in a building equipped with photovoltaic panels and a battery storage system. Their approach demonstrated the potential for significant reductions in energy costs and carbon emissions by optimally scheduling the use of stored energy in response to real-time electricity prices and demand.As the scope of MCES control extends beyond individual buildings to encompass entire networks, the challenges of coordinating multiple energy carriers, conversion devices, and storage systems become more pronounced. Cooperative control strategies have been developed to address these challenges by enabling the coordinated operation of distributed energy resources across different locations. Zhang et al. (2015) presented a cooperative MPC approach for the optimal dispatch of distributed energy resources in a microgrid, highlighting the benefits of information sharing and coordination among different entities in achieving system-wide efficiency and reliability.The dynamic interactions within MCES occur over a wide range of timescales, from minutes to seasons, requiring control strategies that can adapt to varying conditions and constraints. Optimization-based approaches, particularly those leveraging MPC, have proven effective in managing these dynamics by incorporating forecasts of energy demand, renewable generation, and market prices into the control decision-making process. For example, Zhao et al. (2017) applied an MPC strategy to optimize the operation of a district heating system, considering the seasonal variations in heat demand and the availability of renewable heat sources.The constrained nature of MCES control problems, including physical, operational, and regulatory constraints, further underscores the importance of optimization-based methods. These constraints can be effectively handled within the MPC framework, allowing for the consideration of multiple objectives such as cost minimization, emission reduction, and system reliability. Li et al. (2018) developed an MPC-based energy management system for a residential microgrid that integrates renewable energy, storage, and demand response, demonstrating the ability to balance competing objectives under various constraints.In conclusion, the control of multicarrier energy systems from buildings to networks represents a complex but increasingly important field of study. The evolution from isolated building energy control to the management of interconnected energy systems has been facilitated by advancements in optimization-based control strategies, particularly MPC. These approaches have demonstrated significant potential for improving energy efficiency, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impacts across a range of applications. As the integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems continues to grow, the development of more sophisticated control strategies will be essential for realizing the full benefits of multicarrier energy systems.", "References": [{"title": "Optimal power flow of multiple energy carriers", "authors": "Martin Geidl, GÃ¶ran Andersson", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Power Systems", "year": "2007", "volumes": "22", "first page": "145", "last page": "155", "DOI": "10.1109/TPWRS.2006.888988"}, {"title": "Model predictive control for the operation of building cooling systems", "authors": "Yunpeng Ma, Joe Qin, Timothy Salsbury, Peng Xu", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "20", "first page": "796", "last page": "803", "DOI": "10.1109/TCST.2011.2136432"}, {"title": "A model predictive control approach to microgrid operation optimization", "authors": "Alessandro Parisio, Evangelos Rikos, Luigi Glielmo", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1813", "last page": "1827", "DOI": "10.1109/TCST.2014.2309335"}, {"title": "Cooperative distributed model predictive control for energy management in microgrids", "authors": "Xiaohong Zhang, Yiguang Hong, Xiaoming Hu, Minyue Fu", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "2583", "last page": "2591", "DOI": "10.1109/TSG.2015.2398893"}, {"title": "Model predictive control for the energy management of a district heating network", "authors": "Hongbin Zhao, Xiaohong Guan, Jianhui Wang", "journal": "Applied Energy", "year": "2017", "volumes": "185", "first page": "1674", "last page": "1683", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.060"}, {"title": "Model predictive control based energy management system for residential microgrids", "authors": "Xiaonan Li, Jianhui Wang, Wei-Jen Lee", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "5831", "last page": "5840", "DOI": "10.1109/TSG.2017.2694046"}]}
