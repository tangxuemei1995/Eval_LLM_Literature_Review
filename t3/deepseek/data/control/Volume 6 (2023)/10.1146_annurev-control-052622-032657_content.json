{"Literature Review": "The transition from traditional fossil fuel-based power systems to low-inertia systems dominated by renewable energy resources and power electronics presents significant control challenges and necessitates a reevaluation of existing modeling and control strategies. This literature review explores the evolving landscape of low-inertia power systems, focusing on the control of grid-connected power converters, frequency dynamics, and system-level services from a control perspective. The shift towards low-inertia systems, characterized by a reduced presence of synchronous generators, introduces complexities in maintaining system stability and reliability. The integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, which are interfaced with the grid through power electronics, has led to a decrease in the overall system inertia. This reduction in inertia poses challenges for frequency regulation and system stability, as traditional control mechanisms designed for high-inertia systems may not be directly applicable or effective. Research by Kundur et al. (1994) laid the foundational understanding of power system stability, emphasizing the role of inertia in frequency regulation. However, the dynamics of low-inertia systems require novel approaches to control and modeling. The modeling of low-inertia systems has been a focal point of recent research, with studies such as those by Milano et al. (2018) proposing advanced models that account for the unique characteristics of these systems. These models aim to accurately represent the behavior of power electronics-dominated grids, facilitating the development of effective control strategies. The control of grid-connected power converters is another critical area of investigation. Grid-forming control strategies, which enable power converters to emulate the behavior of synchronous generators, have been identified as a promising solution to enhance the stability of low-inertia systems. Research by Rodriguez et al. (2013) and Blaabjerg et al. (2016) has contributed significantly to the development of grid-forming control techniques, highlighting their potential to provide essential system services such as frequency and voltage regulation. Frequency dynamics in low-inertia systems have also been extensively studied, with research indicating that the reduced inertia leads to faster frequency deviations following disturbances. This necessitates the development of advanced frequency control strategies that can respond more rapidly to changes in system conditions. Studies by Ulbig et al. (2014) and D'Arco et al. (2015) have explored the implications of low inertia on frequency stability and proposed control solutions to mitigate the associated risks. System-level services, from a control perspective, are crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of low-inertia power systems. The concept of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs), which aggregate distributed energy resources to provide grid services, has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing system flexibility and resilience. Research by Zhang et al. (2017) and Morstyn et al. (2018) has demonstrated the potential of DVPPs to support frequency regulation and other ancillary services in low-inertia systems. In conclusion, the transition to low-inertia power systems requires a paradigm shift in control and modeling approaches. The integration of advanced modeling techniques, grid-forming control strategies, and system-level services such as DVPPs is essential for addressing the challenges posed by the reduced inertia and ensuring the stability and reliability of future power systems. The system-theoretic mindset is crucial for bridging the gap between different research communities and understanding the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls in large-scale low-inertia power systems.", "References": [{"title": "Power System Stability and Control", "authors": "Prabha Kundur, Neal J.
