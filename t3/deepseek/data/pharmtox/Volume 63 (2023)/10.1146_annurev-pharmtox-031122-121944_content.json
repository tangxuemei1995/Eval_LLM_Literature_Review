{"Literature Review": "The G protein–coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), also known as GPR30, has emerged as a significant player in the complex landscape of estrogen signaling. Unlike the classical estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), which function primarily as nuclear transcription factors, GPER is a seven-transmembrane receptor that mediates rapid, non-genomic estrogen signaling. This receptor has been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. The pharmacology of GPER is complex, with a variety of natural and synthetic ligands capable of modulating its activity. These ligands include estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and GPER-selective agonists and antagonists. The diverse signaling pathways activated by GPER contribute to its multifaceted roles in health and disease. In cancer, GPER has been shown to promote tumor growth and metastasis in certain contexts, while in others, it may exert protective effects. For example, GPER activation has been associated with increased proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in the progression of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Conversely, GPER has also been reported to induce apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, highlighting its context-dependent functions. In cardiovascular diseases, GPER has been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone, blood pressure, and cardiac function. Activation of GPER has been shown to promote vasodilation and reduce blood pressure, suggesting a protective role in hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Additionally, GPER has been found to modulate immune responses, with evidence suggesting that it can influence the activity of immune cells and the production of cytokines. This immunomodulatory role of GPER may have implications for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. In the context of metabolism, GPER has been shown to regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, with potential implications for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. The therapeutic potential of GPER-targeted compounds is an area of active research, with several GPER-selective agonists and antagonists currently under investigation. These compounds hold promise for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. However, the complex pharmacology of GPER and its diverse roles in different physiological systems present challenges for the development of targeted therapies. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of GPER signaling and to identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for modulating its activity. In conclusion, GPER represents a critical component of estrogen signaling with significant implications for health and disease. Its diverse roles in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders highlight its potential as a therapeutic target. However, the complexity of GPER pharmacology and its context-dependent functions underscore the need for continued research to fully understand its mechanisms and to develop effective GPER-targeted therapies.", "References": [{"title": "GPR30: A G protein-coupled receptor for estrogen", "authors": "Eric R.
