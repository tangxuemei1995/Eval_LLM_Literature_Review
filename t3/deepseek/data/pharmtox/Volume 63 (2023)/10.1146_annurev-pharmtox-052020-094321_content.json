{"Literature Review": "The global response to HIV/AIDS has been one of the most significant public health achievements in modern history. Since the identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS in the early 1980s, the development and widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have transformed HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition. This literature review explores the journey towards universal antiretroviral treatment, highlighting the successes, ongoing challenges, and future directions in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The introduction of combination ART in the mid-1990s marked a turning point in the HIV epidemic, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH) (Palella et al., 1998). The effectiveness of ART in suppressing viral replication has been well-documented, with studies showing that sustained viral suppression prevents the progression to AIDS and reduces the risk of HIV transmission (Cohen et al., 2011). The global health community has set ambitious targets, such as the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, aiming for 90% of PLWH to know their status, 90% of those diagnosed to receive ART, and 90% of those on ART to achieve viral suppression by 2020 (UNAIDS, 2014). Despite significant progress, achieving these targets remains challenging, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of HIV is highest. Barriers to universal ART access include late diagnosis, stigma, healthcare system inefficiencies, and the high cost of medications (Bekker et al., 2018). Pediatric and adolescent populations face unique challenges, including limited access to pediatric formulations and the need for specialized care (Penazzato et al., 2014). As the population of PLWH ages, there is an increasing need to address the complex interplay between HIV, ART, and age-related comorbidities (Guaraldi et al., 2011). The development of long-acting antiretrovirals offers promising new options for both treatment and prevention, potentially improving adherence and reducing the burden of daily medication (Margolis et al., 2017). In conclusion, while remarkable progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, achieving universal antiretroviral treatment requires continued innovation, investment, and commitment from the global health community.", "References": [{"title": "Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection.
