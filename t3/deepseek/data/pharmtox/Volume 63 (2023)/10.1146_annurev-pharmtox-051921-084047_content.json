{"Literature Review": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) represent a novel class of endogenous lipid mediators derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which play a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation and the modulation of pain and itch. These mediators, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, have been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects in various preclinical models of disease. The synthesis of SPMs occurs during the acute phase or the resolution phase of inflammation, highlighting their importance in the natural resolution process of inflammatory responses. Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of SPMs in the management of pain and itch, offering a new avenue for the development of resolution pharmacology-based treatments. The analgesic effects of exogenous SPMs have been extensively studied in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain, revealing their ability to significantly reduce pain behaviors. Moreover, the production of endogenous SPMs has been observed in response to sham surgery and neuromodulation techniques, such as vagus nerve stimulation, further underscoring their role in pain resolution. SPMs exert their beneficial actions through the activation of multiple G proteinâ€“coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. The impairment of SPM receptor signaling has been linked to the failure of pain resolution, suggesting that these receptors are critical for the analgesic effects of SPMs. In addition to their role in pain control, emerging evidence points to the involvement of SPMs in the modulation of itch, a common and often debilitating symptom associated with various dermatological and systemic diseases. The pharmacological targeting of SPMs or their receptors holds promise for the development of novel therapeutics for pain and itch, offering a resolution pharmacology approach that could complement or even replace traditional anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatments. The exploration of SPMs in the context of neuroimmune modulation and their interaction with nociceptive sensory neurons and TRP channels opens new perspectives for understanding the mechanisms underlying pain and itch and for the design of targeted therapies. In conclusion, SPMs represent a promising class of mediators for the control of pain and itch, with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of these conditions through the lens of resolution pharmacology.", "References": [{"title": "Resolvins and protectins in inflammation resolution", "authors": "Charles N.
