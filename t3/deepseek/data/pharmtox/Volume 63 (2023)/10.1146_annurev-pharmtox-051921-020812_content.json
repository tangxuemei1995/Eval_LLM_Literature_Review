{"Literature Review": "Air pollution, a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter (PM), including ultrafine particles (UFPs) and PM2.5, has been increasingly recognized as a significant environmental risk factor for both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases across the lifespan. Epidemiological studies have consistently shown associations between exposure to air pollution and a range of neurological outcomes, from cognitive deficits in children to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in the elderly. This literature review aims to synthesize current understanding of the mechanisms underlying air pollution-related neurotoxicity, focusing on the roles of inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, as well as brain metal dyshomeostasis. The review also highlights the importance of identifying specific contaminants within air pollution that contribute to these adverse neurological outcomes, to inform public health interventions and policy development. Recent epidemiological research has demonstrated that exposure to high levels of air pollution during critical periods of brain development is associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). For instance, a study by Volk et al. (2011) found that children living in areas with high traffic-related air pollution were more likely to develop ASD compared to those in less polluted areas. Similarly, exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy has been linked to reduced cognitive function and behavioral problems in children, as reported by Guxens et al. (2018). These findings are supported by experimental studies in animal models, which have shown that prenatal exposure to air pollution can lead to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and alterations in brain structure and function. In addition to its effects on neurodevelopment, air pollution has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term exposure to air pollution, particularly PM2.5 and UFPs, has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. A study by Chen et al. (2017) found that individuals living in areas with high levels of PM2.5 had a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those in less polluted areas. Similarly, Ritz et al. (2016) reported that exposure to traffic-related air pollution was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. These epidemiological findings are corroborated by experimental studies showing that exposure to air pollution can lead to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and the accumulation of pathological proteins such as amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein in the brain. The mechanisms underlying air pollution-related neurotoxicity are complex and multifactorial, involving inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, as well as brain metal dyshomeostasis. Air pollution can induce neuroinflammation through the activation of microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This inflammatory response can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing the entry of toxic substances into the brain and exacerbating neuronal damage. Oxidative stress, resulting from the generation of ROS and the depletion of antioxidant defenses, can lead to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA damage, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and death. Additionally, air pollution can disrupt the homeostasis of essential metals such as iron, copper, and zinc in the brain, leading to metal dyshomeostasis and further exacerbating neurotoxicity. Future research is needed to identify the specific contaminants within air pollution that are responsible for these adverse neurological outcomes. While PM2.5 and UFPs have been implicated in neurotoxicity, the relative contributions of different components of air pollution, such as organic compounds, metals, and gases, remain poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms by which these contaminants exert their neurotoxic effects is critical for developing targeted interventions to protect public health. In conclusion, air pollution is a significant environmental risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, with effects that span the entire lifespan. The mechanisms underlying air pollution-related neurotoxicity involve inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, as well as brain metal dyshomeostasis. Identifying the specific contaminants responsible for these adverse neurological outcomes is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases and disorders and for developing effective public health interventions.", "References": [{"title": "Residential proximity to freeways and autism in the CHARGE study", "authors": "Heather E.
