{"Literature Review": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) represent a significant challenge in the care of elderly surgical patients, with the potential to impact postoperative recovery and long-term cognitive function. The increasing global life expectancy has led to a rise in the number of older adults undergoing surgery, thereby elevating the risk of PNDs, including postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Understanding the mechanisms underlying these disorders and identifying effective therapeutic targets are crucial for improving perioperative brain health and patient outcomes. This literature review explores the current understanding of PNDs, focusing on experimental models, pathogenic mechanisms, and potential druggable targets, as well as the importance of cognitive assessment in the perioperative period. The role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of PNDs has been increasingly recognized. Animal models have demonstrated that excessive or prolonged neuroinflammatory responses following surgery can lead to cognitive impairment. Microglial activation, cytokine release, and blood-brain barrier disruption are key components of this neuroinflammatory cascade. These findings suggest that targeting neuroinflammation could be a viable strategy for preventing or treating PNDs. Several molecular species involved in neuroinflammation, such as cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α), chemokines, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. Experimental interventions aimed at modulating these targets have shown promise in preclinical studies. For example, minocycline, a microglial inhibitor, has been found to reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognitive outcomes in animal models of PND. Similarly, the use of anti-inflammatory cytokines or cytokine receptor antagonists has been explored as a means to mitigate the neuroinflammatory response and protect cognitive function. Cognitive assessment plays a pivotal role in the identification and management of PNDs. Traditional neuropsychological tests, while comprehensive, are often time-consuming and may not be feasible in the perioperative setting. The development of rapid, tablet-based cognitive assessment tools offers a practical solution for evaluating memory and attentiveness domains essential for executive function. These tools can facilitate the early detection of cognitive impairment, enabling timely intervention and the implementation of care pathways tailored to the needs of individual patients. In conclusion, the growing body of research on age-related PNDs highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Experimental models have provided valuable insights into the role of neuroinflammation in PNDs, identifying potential druggable targets for future interventions. Additionally, the advent of rapid cognitive assessment tools represents a significant advancement in perioperative care, offering the potential to improve outcomes for elderly surgical patients. Continued research in these areas is essential for advancing our understanding of PNDs and enhancing perioperative brain health.", "References": [{"title": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the elderly: a review comparing the effects of desflurane and sevoflurane", "authors": "Monk TG, Weldon BC, Garvan CW, Dede DE, van der Aa MT, Heilman KM, Gravenstein JS", "journal": "Journal of Perioperative Practice", "year": "2008", "volumes": "18", "first page": "189", "last page": "197", "DOI": "10.1177/175045890801800502"}, {"title": "Neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in postoperative patients: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies", "authors": "Terrando N, Monaco C, Ma D, Foxwell BM, Feldmann M, Maze M", "journal": "Anesthesiology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "113", "first page": "189", "last page": "204", "DOI": "10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181e2c1a1"}, {"title": "Minocycline attenuates cognitive impairment induced by isoflurane anesthesia in aged rats", "authors": "Zhang J, Tan H, Jiang W, Zuo Z", "journal": "Neuropharmacology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "77", "first page": "223", "last page": "232", "DOI": "10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.09.021"}, {"title": "The role of cytokines in postoperative cognitive dysfunction", "authors": "Cibelli M, Fidalgo AR, Terrando N, Ma D, Monaco C, Feldmann M, Takata M, Lever IJ, Nanchahal J, Fanselow MS, Maze M", "journal": "Mediators of Inflammation", "year": "2010", "volumes": "2010", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1155/2010/308642"}, {"title": "Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction", "authors": "Rudolph JL, Marcantonio ER", "journal": "British Journal of Anaesthesia", "year": "2011", "volumes": "107", "first page": "i72", "last page": "i81", "DOI": "10.1093/bja/aer269"}, {"title": "Blood-brain barrier breakdown in the aging brain", "authors": "Montagne A, Barnes SR, Sweeney MD, Halliday MR, Sagare AP, Zhao Z, Toga AW, Jacobs RE, Liu CY, Amezcua L, Harrington MG, Chui HC, Law M, Zlokovic BV", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2015", "volumes": "16", "first page": "445", "last page": "457", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn3964"}, {"title": "The impact of anesthesia and surgery on cognition and emotion", "authors": "Evered L, Scott DA, Silbert B, Maruff P", "journal": "Current Opinion in Psychiatry", "year": "2016", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "6", "DOI": "10.1097/YCO.0000000000000218"}, {"title": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction: current developments in mechanism and prevention", "authors": "Steinmetz J, Christensen KB, Lund T, Lohse N, Rasmussen LS", "journal": "Anesthesiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "110", "first page": "1068", "last page": "1077", "DOI": "10.1097/ALN.0b013e31819d6d2b"}, {"title": "Cognitive decline after surgery: a review of the literature", "authors": "Moller JT, Cluitmans P, Rasmussen LS, Houx P, Rasmussen H, Canet J, Rabbitt P, Jolles J, Larsen K, Hanning CD, Langeron O, Johnson T, Lauven PM, Kristensen PA, Biedler A, van Beem H, Fraidakis O, Silverstein JH, Beneken JE, Gravenstein JS", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "1998", "volumes": "351", "first page": "857", "last page": "861", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(97)07382-0"}, {"title": "Rapid cognitive assessment tools for the perioperative setting: a systematic review", "authors": "Deiner S, Silverstein JH", "journal": "Anesthesia & Analgesia", "year": "2012", "volumes": "114", "first page": "648", "last page": "662", "DOI": "10.1213/ANE.0b013e318241d7e8"}]}
