{"Literature Review": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) represent a significant and evolving challenge in the realm of new psychoactive substances (NPSs), with their pharmacological and toxicological profiles drawing considerable attention from the scientific and medical communities. SCs are designed to mimic the effects of natural cannabinoids found in cannabis by interacting with the endocannabinoid system, yet they often produce more potent and unpredictable effects. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs, highlighting their mechanisms of action, therapeutic potentials, and the public health concerns associated with their recreational use. SCs exert their effects primarily through the activation of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, which are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The activation of these receptors by SCs can lead to a range of psychoactive effects, including euphoria, relaxation, and altered perception, which are often more intense than those produced by natural cannabis (Pertwee, 2008). However, the high potency and efficacy of SCs at these receptors also contribute to their increased risk of adverse effects, including severe psychiatric symptoms, cardiovascular complications, and, in some cases, fatal outcomes (Tait et al., 2016). The therapeutic potential of SCs has been explored in various medical conditions, including chronic pain, nausea, and multiple sclerosis, due to their ability to modulate the endocannabinoid system. However, the lack of selectivity and the unpredictable nature of SCs have limited their development as therapeutic agents (Di Marzo et al., 2004). On the other hand, the recreational use of SCs has surged, driven by their potent psychoactive effects and the perception of reduced legal risks compared to natural cannabis. This has led to a significant increase in SC-related intoxications and deaths, posing a major public health challenge (Winstock & Barratt, 2013). The toxicology of SCs is complex and not fully understood, but it is clear that their high potency and efficacy at cannabinoid receptors play a central role in their toxic effects. Acute intoxication with SCs can result in a range of symptoms, including tachycardia, hypertension, hallucinations, and seizures, while chronic use has been associated with dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and long-term psychiatric disorders (Seely et al., 2012). The variability in the chemical structures of SCs and the lack of quality control in their production further complicate the assessment of their toxicological profiles and the management of SC-related intoxications (Fantegrossi et al., 2014). In conclusion, SCs represent a complex and evolving challenge in the fields of pharmacology and toxicology. While they offer potential therapeutic benefits, their potent psychoactive effects and associated risks have led to significant public health concerns. A better understanding of the pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics of SCs is essential for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies, as well as for informing policy decisions aimed at reducing the harms associated with their use.", "References": [{"title": "The diverse CB1 and CB2 receptor pharmacology of three plant cannabinoids: delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and delta9-tetrahydrocannabivarin", "authors": "Roger G.
