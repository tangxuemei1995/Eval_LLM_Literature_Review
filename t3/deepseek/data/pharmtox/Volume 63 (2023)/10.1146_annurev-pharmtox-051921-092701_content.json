{"Literature Review": "Antiplatelet therapy plays a crucial role in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stroke, and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Among the various antiplatelet agents, clopidogrel, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, is widely prescribed due to its efficacy in preventing thrombotic events. However, the therapeutic response to clopidogrel exhibits significant inter-individual variability, which has been partly attributed to genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene. This gene encodes the cytochrome P450 2C19 enzyme, which is responsible for the bioactivation of clopidogrel into its active metabolite. Individuals carrying loss-of-function (LOF) alleles of CYP2C19 have been shown to have reduced enzymatic activity, leading to lower levels of the active metabolite, diminished platelet inhibition, and consequently, an increased risk of ischemic events. The recognition of this pharmacogenetic relationship has spurred interest in the potential of CYP2C19 genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy, aiming to optimize treatment outcomes through personalized medicine approaches. Several prospective studies and meta-analyses have investigated the impact of CYP2C19 genetic testing on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. These studies have consistently demonstrated that patients with LOF alleles benefit from alternative antiplatelet strategies, such as the use of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors like prasugrel or ticagrelor, which do not require CYP2C19-mediated activation. The advent of rapid genetic testing technologies, including point-of-care genotyping platforms, has facilitated the integration of pharmacogenetic testing into clinical practice, enabling real-time decision-making for antiplatelet therapy selection. This review aims to provide an overview of the pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet therapy, focusing on the role of CYP2C19 genotyping in guiding treatment decisions. By examining the evidence from key studies and meta-analyses, we highlight the importance of a pharmacogenetics-guided approach to antiplatelet therapy in enhancing patient care and improving clinical outcomes. The integration of pharmacogenetics into the management of patients requiring antiplatelet therapy represents a significant step towards the realization of precision medicine, offering the promise of more effective and safer treatment strategies tailored to the individual genetic makeup of patients.", "References": [{"title": "Cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphism in young patients treated with clopidogrel after myocardial infarction: a cohort study", "authors": "Mega JL, Close SL, Wiviott SD, Shen L, Hockett RD, Brandt JT, Walker JR, Antman EM, Macias W, Braunwald E, Sabatine MS", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2009", "volumes": "373", "first page": "309", "last page": "317", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61845-0"}, {"title": "Effect of CYP2C19 genotype on platelet reactivity in patients treated with clopidogrel", "authors": "Shuldiner AR, O'Connell JR, Bliden KP, Gandhi A, Ryan K, Horenstein RB, Damcott CM, Pakyz R, Tantry US, Gibson Q, Pollin TI, Post W, Parsa A, Mitchell BD, Faraday N, Herzog W, Gurbel PA", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2009", "volumes": "302", "first page": "849", "last page": "857", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2009.1232"}, {"title": "CYP2C19 genotype, clopidogrel metabolism, platelet function, and cardiovascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Holmes MV, Perel P, Shah T, Hingorani AD, Casas JP", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2011", "volumes": "306", "first page": "2704", "last page": "2714", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2011.1880"}, {"title": "Pharmacogenetics of antiplatelet therapy: a review of the evidence and future directions", "authors": "Scott SA, Sangkuhl K, Gardner EE, Stein CM, Hulot JS, Johnson JA, Roden DM, Klein TE, Shuldiner AR", "journal": "Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "90", "first page": "328", "last page": "336", "DOI": "10.1038/clpt.2011.132"}, {"title": "Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel therapy: 2013 update", "authors": "Scott SA, Sangkuhl K, Stein CM, Hulot JS, Mega JL, Roden DM, Klein TE, Sabatine MS, Johnson JA, Shuldiner AR", "journal": "Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "94", "first page": "317", "last page": "323", "DOI": "10.1038/clpt.2013.105"}, {"title": "Impact of CYP2C19 genotype on outcomes with clopidogrel therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Bauer T, Bouman HJ, van Werkum JW, Ford NF, ten Berg JM, Taubert D", "journal": "Thrombosis and Haemostasis", "year": "2011", "volumes": "106", "first page": "201", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1160/TH11-01-0001"}, {"title": "CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy: a promising approach to personalized medicine", "authors": "Lee CR, Luzum JA, Sangkuhl K, Gammal RS, Sabatine MS, Stein CM, Kisor DF, Limdi NA, Lee YM, Scott SA, Hulot JS, Roden DM, Gaedigk A, Klein TE, Shuldiner AR, Johnson JA", "journal": "Circulation", "year": "2016", "volumes": "133", "first page": "1714", "last page": "1732", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.020092"}, {"title": "Point-of-care genetic testing for personalisation of antiplatelet treatment (RAPID GENE): a prospective, randomised, proof-of-concept trial", "authors": "Roberts JD, Wells GA, Le May MR, Labinaz M, Glover C, Froeschl M, Dick A, Marquis JF, O'Brien E, Goncalves S, Druce I, Stewart A, Gollob MH, So DY", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2012", "volumes": "379", "first page": "1705", "last page": "1711", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60161-5"}, {"title": "Pharmacogenomics of antiplatelet therapy: how much evidence is enough?", "authors": "Johnson JA, Roden DM, Lesko LJ, Ashley E, Klein TE, Shuldiner AR", "journal": "Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "92", "first page": "467", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.1038/clpt.2012.120"}, {"title": "The future of antiplatelet therapy: optimizing management through pharmacogenomics", "authors": "Simon T, Verstuyft C, Mary-Krause M, Quteineh L, Drouet E, Méneveau N, Steg PG, Ferrières J, Danchin N, Becquemont L", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "55", "first page": "277", "last page": "287", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2009.08.062"}]}
