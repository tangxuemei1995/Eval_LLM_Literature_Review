{"Literature Review": "ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels play a pivotal role in linking cellular metabolic state to electrical activity across various tissues, a function critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis. These channels are composed of four pore-forming Kir6 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits, forming a complex that is sensitive to intracellular ATP and ADP levels. The diversity in subunit composition, particularly between Kir6.1/Kir6.2 and SUR1/SUR2, underpins the tissue-specific functions of KATP channels and their involvement in a spectrum of monogenic diseases. This literature review explores the physiological roles of KATP channels, their pathological implications, and the pharmacological landscape targeting these channels for therapeutic interventions. KATP channels are integral to the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, where the Kir6.2/SUR1 combination predominates. Mutations in these subunits can lead to congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) or neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), conditions characterized by dysregulated insulin secretion. CHI results from loss-of-function mutations that cause excessive insulin release, whereas NDM is associated with gain-of-function mutations that suppress insulin secretion. The therapeutic management of these conditions has been revolutionized by the use of sulfonylureas, which inhibit KATP channels to stimulate insulin secretion in NDM patients. However, the challenge of off-target effects due to the widespread expression of KATP channels necessitates the development of more selective therapeutic agents. Beyond the pancreas, KATP channels are crucial in cardiovascular physiology, where Kir6.1/SUR2B channels regulate vascular tone and cardiac function. Mutations in these subunits can lead to Cantú syndrome, a condition characterized by hypertrichosis, osteochondrodysplasia, and cardiomegaly, among other features. The complexity of KATP channel pharmacology is highlighted by the differential effects of channel openers and inhibitors across tissues, underscoring the need for tissue-specific therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in drug design and delivery, including the use of gene therapy and small molecule modulators with enhanced selectivity, offer promising avenues for the treatment of KATP-dependent pathologies. Moreover, the exploration of allosteric modulators and the structural elucidation of KATP channels at atomic resolution provide insights into the mechanisms of drug action and the potential for rational drug design. In conclusion, KATP channels represent a critical nexus between metabolism and electrical signaling, with broad implications for health and disease. The development of personalized therapeutics targeting these channels holds great promise for the treatment of monogenic disorders such as CHI, NDM, and Cantú syndrome, as well as for the management of more common conditions associated with KATP channel dysfunction. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular determinants of KATP channel function and pharmacology, paving the way for the development of novel, selective, and effective therapeutic agents.", "References": [{"title": "Molecular basis of Kir6.2 mutations associated with neonatal diabetes or neonatal diabetes plus neurological features", "authors": "Frances M.
