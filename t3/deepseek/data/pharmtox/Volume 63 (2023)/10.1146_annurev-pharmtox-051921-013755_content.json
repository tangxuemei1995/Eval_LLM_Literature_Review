{"Literature Review": "Lysosomes, traditionally known as the cell's recycling center, have emerged as critical players in a myriad of cellular processes beyond mere degradation. These include material digestion, cellular clearance, recycling, exocytosis, wound repair, Ca2+ signaling, nutrient signaling, and gene expression regulation (Settembre et al., 2013). The discovery of lysosomal ion channels and transporters has significantly expanded our understanding of lysosomal function and its regulation. Among these, TPCs (two-pore channels), TMEM175, TRPMLs (transient receptor potential mucolipins), CLN7, and CLC-7 have been identified as key players in maintaining lysosomal ion homeostasis (Wang et al., 2012; Cang et al., 2013; Jentsch, 2007). These channels facilitate the permeability of the lysosomal membrane to major ions such as K+, Na+, H+, Ca2+, and Clâˆ’, thereby influencing lysosomal pH, membrane potential, and ion signaling (Xu & Ren, 2015). The regulation of these channels is complex, involving factors such as luminal H+, membrane voltage, cytosolic ATP, and extracellular growth factors, highlighting the lysosome's role as a signaling hub (Perera & Zoncu, 2016). Genetic mutations in these channels and transporters have been linked to a range of diseases, including lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring their physiological importance (Platt et al., 2012; Medina et al., 2015). Recent advances in human genetics and the development of channel activators have opened new avenues for therapeutic intervention, suggesting that lysosomal ion channels could be promising targets for the treatment of human diseases (Grimm et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2012). The druggability of these channels, however, remains a subject of ongoing research, with studies exploring their potential as targets for small molecules and biologics (Zhang et al., 2016). As our understanding of lysosomal ion channels continues to evolve, so too does the potential for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating their activity to treat disease.", "References": [{"title": "A gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function", "authors": "Carmine Settembre, Annamaria Di Malta, Vinicia Assunta Polito, Moises Garcia Arencibia, Francesco Vetrini, Serkan Erdin, Serpil Uckac Erdin, Tuong Huynh, Diego Medina, Pasqualina Colella, Marco Sardiello, David C.
