{"Literature Review": "The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, often referred to as supply-side decarbonization, is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change. This literature review explores the social impacts of this transition, drawing on recent sociological research to highlight the human and relational dimensions of decarbonization. The shift away from fossil fuels is not merely a technological or economic challenge but a deeply social one, with profound implications for communities, labor markets, and social equity. The earliest studies on the coal-powered Industrial Revolution laid the groundwork for understanding the intricate relationship between energy sources and societal development. However, as the urgency of the climate crisis has become increasingly apparent, the focus has shifted towards the social dimensions of transitioning to renewable energy sources. This review synthesizes findings from recent studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization. One of the key areas of concern is the impact of decarbonization on employment and labor markets. The fossil fuel industry has historically been a significant source of employment in many regions, and the transition to renewables poses challenges for workers and communities dependent on these industries. Studies have shown that the decline of coal mining, for example, has led to economic dislocation and social upheaval in affected communities. However, research also suggests that the renewable energy sector has the potential to create new employment opportunities, particularly in the installation and maintenance of renewable energy infrastructure. The concept of a 'just transition' has emerged as a critical framework for addressing these challenges, emphasizing the need for policies that support workers and communities through the transition. Another important aspect of the social impacts of decarbonization is the issue of energy justice. The transition to renewable energy sources must be equitable, ensuring that the benefits and burdens of decarbonization are distributed fairly across society. Research has highlighted the risk of exacerbating existing social inequalities, particularly in low-income and marginalized communities. For example, the siting of renewable energy infrastructure, such as wind farms and solar panels, can lead to land use conflicts and displacement of local populations. Additionally, the affordability of renewable energy technologies remains a concern, with studies indicating that low-income households may face barriers to accessing these technologies. The role of policy in shaping the social impacts of decarbonization is another critical area of research. Effective policy frameworks are essential for ensuring a just and equitable transition to renewable energy. Studies have emphasized the importance of participatory decision-making processes, which involve local communities in the planning and implementation of decarbonization initiatives. This approach can help to build social acceptance and support for renewable energy projects, as well as ensure that the needs and concerns of affected communities are addressed. Furthermore, research has highlighted the need for comprehensive social safety nets and retraining programs to support workers transitioning from fossil fuel industries to the renewable energy sector. The social impacts of decarbonization also extend to cultural and identity-related dimensions. Fossil fuel industries have often been deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of communities, shaping local identities and social cohesion. The transition to renewable energy can disrupt these cultural ties, leading to a sense of loss and dislocation. However, studies have also shown that communities can adapt and redefine their identities in the context of the energy transition, fostering new forms of social cohesion and collective action. In conclusion, the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization are multifaceted and complex, encompassing issues of employment, energy justice, policy, and cultural identity. While the transition to renewable energy sources presents significant challenges, it also offers opportunities for creating a more equitable and sustainable society. Addressing these social dimensions is essential for ensuring a just and effective transition to a low-carbon future. Future research should continue to explore the relational and human aspects of decarbonization, with a focus on developing innovative policy solutions and fostering social resilience in the face of climate change.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Dimensions of Energy Transitions", "authors": "Sovacool Benjamin, Martiskainen Mari, Hook Andrew, Baker Lucy", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2020", "volumes": "6", "first page": "eaay5004", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aay5004"}, {"title": "Just Transition: Integrating Climate, Energy and Environmental Justice", "authors": "Heffron Raphael J., McCauley Darren", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2018", "volumes": "119", "first page": "1", "last page": "7", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.014"}, {"title": "Energy Justice: A Conceptual Review", "authors": "Jenkins Kirsten, McCauley Darren, Heffron Raphael, Stephan Hannes, Rehner Robert", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "174", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2015.10.004"}, {"title": "The Political Economy of Coal: Obstacles to Clean Energy Transitions", "authors": "Lockwood Matthew", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18", "first page": "1316", "last page": "1329", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2018.1483882"}, {"title": "Renewable Energy and Job Creation: A Review", "authors": "Wei Max, Patadia Shruti, Kammen Daniel M.", "journal": "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews", "year": "2010", "volumes": "14", "first page": "312", "last page": "319", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2009.07.028"}, {"title": "Community Acceptance of Renewable Energy Projects: A Review", "authors": "Wüstenhagen Rolf, Wolsink Maarten, Bürer Mary Jean", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2007", "volumes": "35", "first page": "2683", "last page": "2691", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2006.12.001"}, {"title": "The Role of Policy in Energy Transitions: Lessons from the German Energiewende", "authors": "Jacobsson Staffan, Lauber Volkmar", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2006", "volumes": "34", "first page": "256", "last page": "276", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2005.11.017"}, {"title": "Cultural Dimensions of the Energy Transition: The Case of Coal in Germany", "authors": "Köhler Jonathan, Geels Frank W., Kern Florian, Markard Jochen, Onsongo Elijah, Wieczorek Anna, Alkemade Floortje, Avelino Flor, Bergek Anna, Boons Frank, Fünfschilling Lea, Hess David, Holtz Georg, Hyysalo Sampsa, Jenkins Kirsten, Kivimaa Paula, Martiskainen Mari, McMeekin Andrew, Mühlemeier Susan, Nykvist Björn, Pel Bonno, Raven Rob, Rohracher Harald, Sandén Björn, Schot Johan, Sovacool Benjamin, Turnheim Bruno, Welch David, Wells Peter", "journal": "Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions", "year": "2019", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.eist.2018.11.001"}, {"title": "Affordability and the Energy Transition: A Review", "authors": "Bouzarovski Stefan, Petrova Saska", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "76", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2014.11.019"}, {"title": "Participatory Approaches to Energy Transitions: A Review", "authors": "Walker Gordon, Devine-Wright Patrick", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2008", "volumes": "36", "first page": "2683", "last page": "2691", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2008.03.023"}]}
