{"Literature Review": "The study of cross-border politics, particularly in the context of diasporic mobilization and state response, has evolved significantly over the past four decades. This evolution has been marked by a shift from viewing immigration and emigration as separate phenomena to understanding them as interconnected processes within the framework of transnationalism. The transnational turn in the social sciences has provided a fertile ground for exploring how diasporas engage in political activities that span their countries of origin and residence, and how states respond to these activities. This literature review delves into the key themes and debates within this field, focusing on the political nature of cross-border movements, the types of diasporic political activities, and the modalities of home state policies. It also reflects on the geopolitical changes since the inception of the transnational turn and their implications for the study of immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics. The political nature of cross-border movements is a central theme in the literature on diasporic mobilization. Scholars have argued that these movements are inherently political, as they involve the negotiation of identities, rights, and resources across national borders (Smith, 2003). The diasporic experience is shaped by the interplay of factors in both the homeland and the host country, including political regimes, economic conditions, and social networks (Levitt & Glick Schiller, 2004). This dual embeddedness enables diasporas to engage in a range of political activities, from lobbying and advocacy to remittance sending and cultural preservation (Brinkerhoff, 2009). However, the political opportunities and constraints faced by diasporas vary significantly depending on the geopolitical context and the policies of both home and host states (Ostergaard-Nielsen, 2003). The types of cross-border political activities undertaken by diasporas are diverse and multifaceted. One prominent form of diasporic political engagement is transnational activism, which involves collective action aimed at influencing political processes in the homeland (Koinova, 2013). This can include participation in elections, support for political parties, and involvement in social movements. Another important form of diasporic political activity is the provision of financial and material support to the homeland, often in the form of remittances or investments (Kapur, 2010). Additionally, diasporas play a crucial role in the cultural and symbolic reproduction of national identity, through activities such as language preservation, religious practices, and the celebration of national holidays (Safran, 1991). The modalities of home state policies towards diasporas have also been a focus of scholarly inquiry. States have adopted a range of strategies to engage with their diasporas, from extending citizenship rights and offering dual nationality to establishing diaspora institutions and organizing cultural events (Gamlen, 2008). These policies are often driven by the desire to harness the economic, political, and cultural resources of diasporas for national development and geopolitical influence (Ragazzi, 2009). However, the effectiveness of these policies is contingent on the ability of states to navigate the complex dynamics of diasporic identities and loyalties (Collyer, 2013). The geopolitical landscape has undergone significant changes since the transnational turn in the social sciences, with implications for the study of cross-border politics. The rise of globalization, the proliferation of communication technologies, and the increasing mobility of people have intensified the transnational connections between diasporas and their homelands (Vertovec, 2009). At the same time, the resurgence of nationalism and the securitization of migration have posed new challenges for diasporic political mobilization (Adamson, 2016). These developments call for a re-examination of the conceptual tools and theoretical frameworks used to study immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics, in order to capture the complexities of the contemporary world. In conclusion, the literature on cross-border politics, diasporic mobilization, and state response has made significant strides in understanding the interconnectedness of immigration and emigration within the framework of transnationalism. However, the field continues to grapple with the challenges posed by the changing geopolitical landscape and the need for more nuanced conceptual tools. Future research should aim to bridge the gap between the study of emigration and immigration, and to explore the implications of diasporic political activities for both home and host states.", "References": [{"title": "Diasporic Memberships in Historical Perspective: Comparative Insights from the Mexican, Italian and Polish Cases", "authors": "Michael Peter Smith", "journal": "International Migration Review", "year": "2003", "volumes": "37", "first page": "724", "last page": "759", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00156.x"}, {"title": "Conceptualizing Simultaneity: A Transnational Social Field Perspective on Society", "authors": "Peggy Levitt, Nina Glick Schiller", "journal": "International Migration Review", "year": "2004", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1002", "last page": "1039", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1747-7379.2004.tb00227.x"}, {"title": "Digital Diasporas: Identity and Transnational Engagement", "authors": "Jennifer M.
