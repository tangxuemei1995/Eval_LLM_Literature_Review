{"Literature Review": "The study of social contexts and their impact on children's well-being has traditionally been segmented into distinct literatures focusing on either neighborhood effects or school effects. However, a growing body of research acknowledges the interconnectedness of these contexts and calls for a more integrated approach to understanding their joint influence. This literature review synthesizes findings from studies that consider neighborhoods and schools together, critiques the prevailing tendency to prioritize one context over the other, and proposes a new framework for examining neighborhood–school structures.Neighborhood effects research has consistently demonstrated the significant role that residential environments play in shaping children's educational, economic, and health outcomes. Studies have shown that neighborhood socioeconomic status, social capital, and exposure to violence can profoundly affect children's development and future opportunities (Sampson, Morenoff, & Gannon-Rowley, 2002). Similarly, school effects research has highlighted the importance of school quality, teacher qualifications, and peer influences in determining students' academic achievement and social mobility (Rumberger & Palardy, 2005). Despite these robust findings, the separate examination of neighborhood and school effects has led to an incomplete understanding of how these contexts interact to influence children's well-being.Acknowledging this gap, recent studies have begun to explore the joint effects of neighborhoods and schools. For example, research by Owens (2010) found that both neighborhood and school characteristics independently predict students' academic achievement, but their combined effects are even more significant. Similarly, Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn (2000) demonstrated that neighborhood and school quality interact to influence children's cognitive and behavioral outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of considering both contexts simultaneously to fully capture their impact on children's development.However, much of the existing research on joint neighborhood and school effects has been characterized by a tendency to evaluate which context matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. This approach not only oversimplifies the complex interplay between these contexts but also overlooks the processes through which families select neighborhoods and schools and how these choices contribute to the mutual constitution of neighborhoods and schools. As a result, there is a need for a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes.The concept of neighborhood–school structures offers a promising framework for advancing this reorientation. Neighborhood–school structures refer to the ways in which families choose neighborhoods and schools and how these choices, in turn, shape the characteristics of both contexts. For instance, families' decisions to move to certain neighborhoods are often influenced by the quality of local schools, while schools' student populations and resources are shaped by the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of their surrounding neighborhoods (Logan, Minca, & Adar, 2012). This cyclical relationship between neighborhoods and schools highlights the need for research that considers both contexts as part of a larger, interconnected system.Moreover, understanding neighborhood–school structures requires attention to the processes of selection and segregation that drive the sorting of families into different neighborhoods and schools. Research has shown that residential segregation and school choice policies contribute to the concentration of poverty and racial/ethnic segregation in both neighborhoods and schools (Reardon & Owens, 2014). These processes not only reinforce existing inequalities but also create distinct neighborhood–school structures that have differential effects on children's outcomes. For example, children in high-poverty, racially segregated neighborhoods and schools are more likely to experience adverse educational and health outcomes compared to their peers in more affluent, diverse contexts (Massey & Denton, 1993).Incorporating neighborhood–school structures into contextual effects research has important implications for both outcomes-oriented studies and studies of selection and segregation. For outcomes-oriented studies, considering neighborhood–school structures can provide a more nuanced understanding of how neighborhoods and schools jointly influence children's well-being. For example, research by Sharkey and Faber (2014) found that the effects of neighborhood violence on children's academic achievement are mediated by school climate, highlighting the importance of examining the interplay between neighborhood and school contexts. Similarly, studies of selection and segregation can benefit from a neighborhood–school structures framework by elucidating the mechanisms through which families' choices contribute to the sorting of students into different neighborhoods and schools.In conclusion, the study of neighborhood and school effects on children's well-being would be enriched by adopting a neighborhood–school structures framework. This approach not only acknowledges the interconnectedness of neighborhoods and schools but also provides a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that shape these contexts and their impact on children's outcomes. Future research should continue to explore the implications of neighborhood–school structures for both outcomes-oriented studies and studies of selection and segregation, with the ultimate goal of informing policies and interventions that promote equity and well-being for all children.", "References": [{"title": "Assessing 'neighborhood effects': Social processes and new directions in research", "authors": "Robert J.
