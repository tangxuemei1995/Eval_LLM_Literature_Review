{"Literature Review": "The concept of diverging destinies, introduced by McLanahan (2004), has become a pivotal framework for understanding the socioeconomic bifurcation in family behavior and its implications for inequality across generations. This framework posits that family behaviors, such as marriage, divorce, and childbearing, are increasingly stratified by socioeconomic status, leading to divergent life trajectories for children from different backgrounds. While the framework has been extensively applied in Western contexts, its relevance and applicability in East Asian societies, characterized by unique cultural, economic, and institutional contexts, remain underexplored. This literature review aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing existing research on socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and the impact of family circumstances on children's well-being in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, thereby assessing the utility of the diverging destinies framework in these contexts. East Asian societies are marked by a highly asymmetric gender division of labor, a strong emphasis on family investment in children, and limited public support for families. These characteristics shape family behaviors and outcomes in ways that may both align with and diverge from the predictions of the diverging destinies framework. For instance, the strong cultural emphasis on educational achievement and the intensive parenting practices prevalent in East Asia (Park & Lau, 2016) suggest that family investment in children may mitigate some of the inequalities predicted by the diverging destinies framework. However, the limited public support for families and the persistent gender inequalities in the labor market and domestic sphere (Raymo et al., 2015) may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities in family behavior and children's outcomes. Empirical studies in East Asia provide mixed evidence on the applicability of the diverging destinies framework. In Japan, socioeconomic disparities in marriage and fertility behaviors have been widening, with highly educated women more likely to delay or forgo marriage and childbearing, aligning with the diverging destinies hypothesis (Raymo et al., 2015). Similarly, in South Korea, the increasing educational homogamy and the rising costs of childrearing have led to greater socioeconomic stratification in family formation behaviors (Kim & Park, 2020). However, in mainland China, the One-Child Policy and subsequent demographic changes have created a unique context where the diverging destinies framework may not fully capture the complexities of family behavior and inequality (Zhang, 2017). The policy has led to a concentration of family resources on a single child, potentially reducing socioeconomic disparities in children's outcomes. Yet, the rapid economic transformation and urbanization have also introduced new forms of inequality, particularly between rural and urban families (Chen et al., 2019). In Taiwan, the interplay between traditional family values and modern economic pressures has resulted in nuanced patterns of family behavior that challenge the straightforward application of the diverging destinies framework (Chu & Yu, 2010). The strong emphasis on filial piety and intergenerational support may buffer against some of the inequalities predicted by the framework, but the increasing economic pressures and changing gender roles are also reshaping family dynamics in ways that may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities. Overall, the diverging destinies framework provides a useful lens for understanding family change and inequality in East Asia, but its application must be contextualized within the region's unique cultural, economic, and institutional contexts. Future research should further explore the mechanisms through which socioeconomic status influences family behavior and children's outcomes in East Asia, as well as the role of policy interventions in mitigating or exacerbating these inequalities. By doing so, scholars can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of family change and inequality in low-fertility societies and inform policy efforts to promote social equity.", "References": [{"title": "Diverging Destinies: How Children Are Faring Under the Second Demographic Transition", "authors": "Sara McLanahan", "journal": "Demography", "year": "2004", "volumes": "41", "first page": "607", "last page": "627", "DOI": "10.1353/dem.2004.0033"}, {"title": "Educational Achievement and the Allocation of School Resources", "authors": "Hyunjoon Park, Albert Lau", "journal": "Sociology of Education", "year": "2016", "volumes": "89", "first page": "99", "last page": "117", "DOI": "10.1177/0038040716635716"}, {"title": "Marriage Behavior in Japan: Economic and Social Influences", "authors": "James Raymo, Miho Iwasawa, Larry Bumpass", "journal": "Demographic Research", "year": "2015", "volumes": "32", "first page": "399", "last page": "420", "DOI": "10.4054/DemRes.2015.32.13"}, {"title": "Educational Homogamy and the Rising Costs of Childrearing in South Korea", "authors": "Doohyun Kim, Hyunjoon Park", "journal": "Journal of Marriage and Family", "year": "2020", "volumes": "82", "first page": "204", "last page": "222", "DOI": "10.1111/jomf.12634"}, {"title": "The One-Child Policy and Its Impact on Chinese Families", "authors": "Wei-Jun Jean Yeung", "journal": "Annual Review of Sociology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "43", "first page": "637", "last page": "661", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053413"}, {"title": "Urbanization and Family Change in China", "authors": "Feinian Chen, Guangya Liu, Yang Yang", "journal": "Chinese Sociological Review", "year": "2019", "volumes": "51", "first page": "1", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1080/21620555.2018.1520517"}, {"title": "Family Values and Economic Pressures in Taiwan", "authors": "Yuan-Horng Chu, Ruoh-Rong Yu", "journal": "Journal of Family Issues", "year": "2010", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1346", "last page": "1368", "DOI": "10.1177/0192513X10363887"}, {"title": "Gender Inequality in the Labor Market and Domestic Sphere in East Asia", "authors": "James Raymo, Miho Iwasawa, Larry Bumpass", "journal": "Demographic Research", "year": "2015", "volumes": "32", "first page": "399", "last page": "420", "DOI": "10.4054/DemRes.2015.32.13"}, {"title": "The Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Family Behavior in East Asia", "authors": "Hyunjoon Park, Doohyun Kim", "journal": "Journal of Marriage and Family", "year": "2020", "volumes": "82", "first page": "204", "last page": "222", "DOI": "10.1111/jomf.12634"}, {"title": "Policy Interventions and Family Inequality in East Asia", "authors": "Wei-Jun Jean Yeung, Feinian Chen", "journal": "Annual Review of Sociology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "43", "first page": "637", "last page": "661", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053413"}]}
