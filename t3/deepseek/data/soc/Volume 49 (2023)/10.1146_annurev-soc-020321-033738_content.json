{"Literature Review": "Ethnomethodology, as introduced by Harold Garfinkel in his seminal work 'Studies in Ethnomethodology' (1967), has profoundly influenced sociological research by focusing on the methods people use to create and maintain a sense of social order. This literature review explores the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, tracing its intellectual roots, its relation to other sociological theories, and its application across various domains of social life. Garfinkel's work was deeply influenced by Alfred Schütz's phenomenology, which emphasized the subjective meanings individuals attach to their social world. However, Garfinkel diverged from Schütz by focusing on the practical, everyday methods through which these meanings are constructed and maintained (Heritage, 1984). This focus on the 'how' of social life led to a unique methodological approach that sought to uncover the taken-for-granted rules and practices that underpin social order. Ethnomethodology also engaged critically with Talcott Parsons's systems theory, challenging the notion of a pre-existing social structure that determines individual behavior. Instead, Garfinkel argued that social order is an ongoing accomplishment, achieved through the practical activities of individuals in specific contexts (Rawls, 2002). This emphasis on contextuality and the documentary method of interpretation, inspired by Karl Mannheim, became a central concern of ethnomethodological research. The application of ethnomethodology has led to the development of several thriving subfields, including conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and studies of science and technology. Conversation analysis, in particular, has become a major area of research, focusing on the sequential organization of talk and its role in the construction of social reality (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). Membership categorization analysis extends this focus to the ways in which individuals are classified and the implications of these classifications for social interaction (Hester & Eglin, 1997). Ethnomethodological studies have also made significant contributions to the understanding of social problems and deviance, legal environments, and the experiences of minoritized groups. For example, research in legal settings has explored how legal professionals use ethnomethods to construct and interpret legal facts (Travers, 1997). Similarly, studies of minoritized groups have highlighted the role of ethnomethods in the construction of racial and gender identities (West & Fenstermaker, 1995). In the realm of science and technology, ethnomethodology has provided insights into the practices of scientific research and the role of technology in shaping social interactions (Lynch, 1993). This includes studies of instructed action, which examine how instructions are followed and interpreted in various settings, from scientific laboratories to everyday life (Suchman, 1987). The workplace has also been a key site for ethnomethodological research, with studies exploring the organization of work practices and the role of rules and procedures in shaping workplace interactions (Heath & Luff, 2000). Finally, ethnomethodology has contributed to the critique of traditional social science methods, challenging the assumptions underlying coding, surveys, and standardization (Button & Sharrock, 1993). This critique has led to a greater awareness of the situated and contingent nature of social research practices. In conclusion, ethnomethodology has left a lasting legacy on sociological research, offering a unique perspective on the organization of social life and the methods through which social order is achieved. Its emphasis on the practical, everyday activities of individuals has opened up new avenues for research across a wide range of domains, from conversation analysis to studies of science and technology. As we look to the future, ethnomethodology continues to offer valuable insights into the complexities of social interaction and the ongoing construction of social reality.", "References": [{"title": "Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology", "authors": "John Heritage", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "1984", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Ethnomethodology's Program: Working Out Durkheim's Aphorism", "authors": "Anne Warfield Rawls", "journal": "Rowman & Littlefield Publishers", "year": "2002", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation", "authors": "Harvey Sacks, Emanuel A.
