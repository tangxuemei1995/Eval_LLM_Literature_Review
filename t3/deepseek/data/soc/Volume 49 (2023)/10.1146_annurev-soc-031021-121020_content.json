{"Literature Review": "The concept of age, while fundamental to social science research, has often been treated as a static and unidimensional variable, rather than a complex, socially constructed phenomenon that intersects with various dimensions of inequality. This literature review synthesizes existing research on the conceptualization and measurement of age, emphasizing its multidimensional nature and its role in the social construction of inequality. Age is not merely a biological fact but a social construct that is deeply embedded in cultural, historical, and institutional contexts. As such, it requires a nuanced approach to both theory and methodology. At the individual level, age can be conceptualized in multiple ways, including chronological age, biological age, psychological age, and social age. Each of these dimensions captures different aspects of the aging process and has distinct implications for social outcomes. Chronological age, the most commonly used measure, is often critiqued for its oversimplification of the aging process. Biological age, which refers to the physical condition of the body, can vary significantly among individuals of the same chronological age due to factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. Psychological age, encompassing cognitive and emotional development, further complicates the picture by highlighting the variability in how individuals experience and perceive aging. Social age, which reflects the roles and expectations associated with different life stages, underscores the cultural and societal dimensions of age. The intersection of these dimensions reveals the complexity of age as a social construct and its implications for inequality. Age intersects with other axes of inequality, such as gender, race, and class, to produce unique experiences of aging and old age. For example, research has shown that older women often face compounded disadvantages due to the intersection of ageism and sexism, leading to lower economic security and higher rates of poverty compared to older men. Similarly, racial and ethnic minorities may experience accelerated aging due to the cumulative effects of discrimination and socioeconomic disadvantage. These intersectional dynamics highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of age and its role in the production of inequality. Methodologically, the multidimensionality of age calls for innovative approaches to measurement. Traditional measures, such as birth cohort and chronological age, are insufficient to capture the complexity of the aging process. Instead, researchers are increasingly turning to a combination of measures, including physical appearance, functional health, and subjective age, to better account for the variability in aging experiences. Physical appearance, for instance, can serve as a proxy for biological age and has been shown to influence social interactions and opportunities. Functional health, which assesses an individual's ability to perform daily activities, provides insight into the lived experience of aging and its impact on quality of life. Subjective age, or how old individuals feel, offers a window into the psychological and social dimensions of age and has been linked to various health and social outcomes. The social construction of age also extends to the institutional level, where age-based norms and policies shape the life course and perpetuate inequality. Age-based policies, such as mandatory retirement and age restrictions on certain benefits, often reflect and reinforce societal assumptions about aging and productivity. These policies can have profound implications for individuals' economic security and well-being, particularly for those who are already marginalized due to intersecting inequalities. Moreover, the institutionalization of age-based norms can create rigid life course trajectories that limit individuals' opportunities and choices. For example, the expectation that individuals should retire at a certain age can lead to the devaluation of older workers and the exclusion of older adults from the labor market. In conclusion, age is a complex and multidimensional construct that intersects with various dimensions of inequality. To advance research on aging and the life course, it is essential to move beyond simplistic measures of age and adopt a more nuanced approach that accounts for its biological, psychological, and social dimensions. By doing so, researchers can better understand the social construction of age and its implications for inequality, ultimately contributing to more equitable policies and practices.", "References": [{"title": "The Intersection of Age, Gender, and Race in the Labor Market", "authors": "Neal Fogg, Paul Harrington", "journal": "Journal of Aging & Social Policy", "year": "2011", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1080/08959420.2011.532011"}, {"title": "Subjective Age and Its Implications for Health and Well-being", "authors": "Yannick Stephan, Angelina R.
