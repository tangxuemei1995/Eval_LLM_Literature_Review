{"Literature Review": "Critical Race Theory (CRT) has emerged as a pivotal framework for understanding the complexities of race and racism in society, particularly in the context of White privilege. White privilege, a term popularized by Peggy McIntosh, refers to the unearned advantages that White individuals experience in societies structured by racial hierarchies. This literature review explores the intersection of White privilege and CRT, focusing on the theoretical underpinnings, the evolution of the concept, and its manifestations in higher education. CRT posits that racism is not an aberration but a normal feature of society, deeply embedded in legal systems and policies. This perspective is crucial for understanding White privilege, as it highlights how Whiteness operates as a form of property, conferring tangible and intangible benefits to those who possess it. The concept of interest convergence, introduced by Derrick Bell, further elucidates the dynamics of White privilege by suggesting that racial advances for people of color occur only when they align with the interests of White individuals. The development of White privilege as a concept has been influenced by various scholars who have expanded on McIntosh's initial work. These scholars have critiqued the individualistic focus of early discussions on White privilege, advocating for a more structural analysis that considers the systemic nature of racism. In higher education, White privilege manifests in several ways, including the construction of knowledge, the prioritization of gender over race in diversity initiatives, and policy-making processes that protect White identities. The construction of knowledge in academic institutions often reflects and reinforces White privilege by centering Eurocentric perspectives and marginalizing other viewpoints. This epistemic violence perpetuates racial inequalities by devaluing the knowledge and experiences of people of color. Furthermore, the prioritization of gender above race in diversity initiatives within higher education institutions often overlooks the intersectional nature of oppression, thereby failing to address the specific challenges faced by women of color. Policy-making processes in higher education are also implicated in the maintenance of White privilege. Policies designed to promote diversity and inclusion frequently fall short of their goals because they are developed within a framework that prioritizes the comfort and interests of White individuals. This results in superficial changes that do not challenge the underlying structures of White supremacy. In conclusion, CRT provides a robust framework for understanding and challenging White privilege. By examining the theoretical foundations of White privilege, its evolution, and its manifestations in higher education, this literature review underscores the importance of a structural approach to dismantling racial inequalities. Future research should continue to explore the intersections of race, gender, and class within the context of White privilege, and develop strategies for creating more equitable and inclusive educational environments.", "References": [{"title": "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack", "authors": "Peggy McIntosh", "journal": "Peace and Freedom Magazine", "year": "1989", "volumes": "", "first page": "10", "last page": "12", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings That Formed the Movement", "authors": "Kimberlé Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, Gary Peller, Kendall Thomas", "journal": "", "year": "1995", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism", "authors": "Derrick Bell", "journal": "", "year": "1992", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Whiteness as Property", "authors": "Cheryl Harris", "journal": "Harvard Law Review", "year": "1993", "volumes": "106", "first page": "1707", "last page": "1791", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color", "authors": "Kimberlé Crenshaw", "journal": "Stanford Law Review", "year": "1991", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1241", "last page": "1299", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Souls of White Folk: Critical Pedagogy, Whiteness Studies, and Globalization Discourse", "authors": "Zeus Leonardo", "journal": "Race Ethnicity and Education", "year": "2002", "volumes": "5", "first page": "29", "last page": "50", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Understanding White Privilege: Creating Pathways to Authentic Relationships Across Race", "authors": "Frances Kendall", "journal": "", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Race, Reform, and Retrenchment: Transformation and Legitimation in Antidiscrimination Law", "authors": "Kimberlé Crenshaw", "journal": "Harvard Law Review", "year": "1988", "volumes": "101", "first page": "1331", "last page": "1387", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Pedagogy of the Oppressed", "authors": "Paulo Freire", "journal": "", "year": "1970", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}]}
