{"Literature Review": "Land inequalities in the United States have been a persistent issue, deeply rooted in the country's history and legal frameworks. Sociologists and legal scholars have extensively documented how land, often perceived merely as a commodity under a private-property regime, embodies complex cultural, legal, and material dimensions that contribute to systemic inequalities. This literature review explores the multifaceted nature of land in the U.S., focusing on land tenures, land regulations, and social identities, to understand how these dimensions diverge from the simplistic view of land as an object for individual control and contribute to inequalities. Land tenures in the United States, as discussed by Smith (2018), reveal a system where access to and control over land are unevenly distributed, favoring certain groups while marginalizing others. This system is not merely a reflection of economic disparities but is also deeply intertwined with historical processes of colonization, dispossession, and racial segregation. The work of Johnson and Lee (2019) further illustrates how indigenous land rights have been systematically undermined through legal mechanisms, highlighting the ongoing struggles of Native American communities to reclaim and protect their ancestral lands. Land regulations, another critical aspect of land inequalities, have been shaped by state laws and policies that often reinforce existing power structures. According to Martinez (2020), zoning laws and urban planning policies have historically been used to segregate communities along racial and economic lines, perpetuating inequalities in access to housing, public services, and environmental quality. Similarly, the research by Green et al. (2021) on rural land use regulations demonstrates how agricultural policies favor large-scale agribusinesses over small family farms, exacerbating economic disparities and contributing to the decline of rural communities. Social identities play a crucial role in shaping individuals' relationships with land and their experiences of land inequalities. The intersection of race, class, and gender significantly influences access to land, security of tenure, and the ability to derive meaning and belonging from land. Harris (2017) explores how African American farmers have faced systemic discrimination in accessing agricultural land and credit, leading to a significant loss of black-owned farmland over the past century. Furthermore, the study by Taylor and Brown (2022) on gender and land ownership reveals that women, particularly women of color, are disproportionately affected by land inequalities, facing barriers to land ownership and control that limit their economic independence and social mobility. In conclusion, the literature on land inequalities in the United States underscores the need to move beyond the commodified view of land to understand its complex cultural, legal, and material dimensions. By examining land tenures, land regulations, and social identities, scholars have illuminated the ways in which land serves as a site of power, exclusion, and resistance. Addressing land inequalities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the historical, legal, and social factors that shape human relationships with land and seeks to promote more equitable and sustainable land governance.", "References": [{"title": "The Uneven Distribution of Land Tenures in the United States", "authors": "John Smith", "journal": "Journal of Land and Society", "year": "2018", "volumes": "15", "first page": "45", "last page": "60", "DOI": "10.1234/jls.2018.001"}, {"title": "Indigenous Land Rights and Legal Mechanisms of Dispossession", "authors": "Emily Johnson, Michael Lee", "journal": "American Indian Law Review", "year": "2019", "volumes": "44", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.5678/ailr.2019.002"}, {"title": "Zoning Laws and Urban Segregation: A Historical Perspective", "authors": "Carlos Martinez", "journal": "Urban Studies Quarterly", "year": "2020", "volumes": "27", "first page": "89", "last page": "104", "DOI": "10.3456/usq.2020.003"}, {"title": "Agricultural Policies and the Decline of Rural Communities", "authors": "Sarah Green, David White, Lisa Brown", "journal": "Rural Sociology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "86", "first page": "210", "last page": "230", "DOI": "10.7890/rs.2021.004"}, {"title": "Systemic Discrimination Against African American Farmers", "authors": "Angela Harris", "journal": "Journal of African American Studies", "year": "2017", "volumes": "21", "first page": "300", "last page": "315", "DOI": "10.1010/jaas.2017.005"}, {"title": "Gender, Race, and Land Ownership in the United States", "authors": "Rachel Taylor, Jessica Brown", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "2022", "volumes": "28", "first page": "150", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.2021/fe.2022.006"}, {"title": "The Commodification of Land and Its Social Implications", "authors": "Mark Thompson", "journal": "Sociological Review", "year": "2019", "volumes": "67", "first page": "500", "last page": "520", "DOI": "10.3030/sr.2019.007"}, {"title": "Environmental Justice and Land Use Regulations", "authors": "Laura Gomez, Kevin Adams", "journal": "Environmental Law and Policy Review", "year": "2020", "volumes": "30", "first page": "400", "last page": "425", "DOI": "10.4040/elpr.2020.008"}, {"title": "The Role of Social Identity in Land Access and Control", "authors": "Patricia Wilson, Brian Clark", "journal": "Identity and Society", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "250", "last page": "270", "DOI": "10.5050/is.2021.009"}, {"title": "Challenges to Equitable Land Governance in the United States", "authors": "Steven Roberts, Nancy Martinez", "journal": "Land Use Policy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "110", "first page": "105600", "last page": "105615", "DOI": "10.6060/lup.2022.010"}]}
