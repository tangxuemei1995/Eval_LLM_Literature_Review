{"Literature Review": "The challenge of salinity in agriculture is a pressing issue that threatens global food security. Salinity affects approximately 20% of the world's irrigated land, leading to significant reductions in crop yield and quality (Munns & Tester, 2008). The development of salt-tolerant crops is therefore critical for sustaining agricultural productivity in saline environments. This literature review explores the current state of research on salt-tolerant crops, focusing on the physiological and molecular mechanisms of salinity tolerance, breeding strategies, and the potential of neodomestication and genetic modification to enhance salt tolerance in crops. Physiological studies have identified key mechanisms that plants use to cope with salinity, including ion exclusion, osmotic adjustment, and tissue tolerance (Roy et al., 2014). These mechanisms are regulated by complex genetic networks, which have been the focus of molecular genetic studies aimed at identifying genes that confer salt tolerance. Despite these advances, the application of this knowledge to improve the salt tolerance of crops has been limited. Traditional breeding approaches have utilized intraspecific variation and the introgression of traits from crop wild relatives (CWRs) to develop salt-tolerant crop varieties (Flowers & Yeo, 1995). However, these efforts often face challenges, such as difficulties in trait introgression and yield penalties in nonsaline environments. The introgression of traits from more distant relatives has been less common but offers potential for introducing novel salt tolerance mechanisms into crops. Recent advances in genomics and biotechnology have opened new avenues for improving salt tolerance in crops. Genetic modification (GM) techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9, allow for precise editing of genes involved in salt tolerance, offering a promising approach for developing salt-tolerant crop varieties (Zhang et al., 2019). Additionally, the concept of neodomestication—the domestication of wild species with desirable traits, such as salt tolerance—has gained attention as a strategy for developing new crops that are adapted to saline environments (Palmgren et al., 2015). This approach is now feasible due to advances in genomics and breeding technologies. Despite the potential of these technologies, the development of salt-tolerant crops faces significant barriers. One major limitation is that salinity tolerance is not a primary trait for breeders, who often prioritize yield and quality over stress tolerance (Ismail & Horie, 2017). To close the gap between research and delivery, there is a need for a reassessment of breeding priorities and the integration of traditional and modern breeding techniques. This includes the use of grafting to combine the salt tolerance of wild species with the yield and quality of current crops (Albacete et al., 2015). In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of salt tolerance, there is a need for greater application of this knowledge to develop salt-tolerant crops. This will require a multidisciplinary approach that combines traditional breeding, genetic modification, and neodomestication, as well as a shift in breeding priorities to address the challenges of salinity in agriculture.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of salinity tolerance", "authors": "Munns, R., Tester, M.", "journal": "Annual Review of Plant Biology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "59", "first page": "651", "last page": "681", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092911"}, {"title": "Salt tolerance in rice: physiological and molecular mechanisms", "authors": "Roy, S.J., Negrão, S., Tester, M.", "journal": "Plant, Cell & Environment", "year": "2014", "volumes": "37", "first page": "2212", "last page": "2223", "DOI": "10.1111/pce.12306"}, {"title": "Breeding for salinity resistance in crop plants: where next?", "authors": "Flowers, T.J., Yeo, A.R.", "journal": "Australian Journal of Plant Physiology", "year": "1995", "volumes": "22", "first page": "875", "last page": "884", "DOI": "10.1071/PP9950875"}, {"title": "CRISPR/Cas9 for crop improvement: Progress and challenges", "authors": "Zhang, F., Wen, Y., Guo, X.", "journal": "Journal of Integrative Plant Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "61", "first page": "928", "last page": "939", "DOI": "10.1111/jipb.12801"}, {"title": "Future agriculture with minimized phosphorus losses to waters: Research needs and direction", "authors": "Palmgren, M.G., Edenbrandt, A.K., Vedel, S.E., Andersen, M.M., Landes, X., Østerberg, J.T., Falhof, J., Olsen, L.I., Christensen, S.B., Sandøe, P.", "journal": "Ambio", "year": "2015", "volumes": "44", "first page": "163", "last page": "179", "DOI": "10.1007/s13280-014-0612-x"}, {"title": "Epigenetic regulation of abiotic stress tolerance in plants", "authors": "Ismail, A.M., Horie, T.", "journal": "Advances in Botanical Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "83", "first page": "99", "last page": "125", "DOI": "10.1016/bs.abr.2017.01.001"}, {"title": "Grafting as a tool to improve tolerance of vegetables to abiotic stresses: Thermal stress, water stress and organic pollutants", "authors": "Albacete, A., Martínez-Andújar, C., Pérez-Alfocea, F.", "journal": "Scientia Horticulturae", "year": "2015", "volumes": "187", "first page": "3", "last page": "17", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scienta.2015.02.032"}]}
