{"Literature Review": "The SWITCH deficient SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) are pivotal in regulating chromatin architecture, thereby influencing transcription, replication, and DNA repair processes. These complexes harness the energy from ATP hydrolysis to reposition or eject histone octamers, facilitating access to genomic DNA. Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry have elucidated the diversity of SWI/SNF complexes, revealing distinct subtypes with unique functionalities and properties. This literature review delves into the multifaceted roles of SWI/SNF CRCs in both animals and plants, emphasizing their significance in development, stimulus response, and disease prevention. SWI/SNF CRCs are instrumental in cell fate reprogramming, working in concert with pioneer and other transcription factors to modulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Their ability to alter chromatin structure is crucial for responding to environmental challenges, highlighting their role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The recruitment of SWI/SNF complexes to specific genomic loci is meticulously regulated by transcription factors, ensuring precise control over chromatin remodeling activities. Furthermore, the biochemical activity of SWI/SNF CRCs is influenced by complex subunit composition, posttranslational modifications, and the chromatin context, which collectively dictate their functional outcomes. Recent studies have employed innovative approaches, such as tethering or rapid depletion and inactivation of SWI/SNF, to gain novel insights into their requirements for enhancer activity and their interplay with Polycomb complexes in balancing chromatin compaction and accessibility. These findings underscore the complexity of SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling and its implications for gene regulation and cellular function. In plants, SWI/SNF CRCs have been implicated in various developmental processes and stress responses, demonstrating their evolutionary conservation and functional versatility. The integration of SWI/SNF activity with signaling pathways and environmental cues further illustrates their central role in orchestrating adaptive responses. As research continues to unravel the mechanisms underlying SWI/SNF function, it becomes increasingly clear that these chromatin remodelers are key players in shaping the epigenetic landscape, with profound implications for understanding development, disease, and the fundamental principles of gene regulation.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of action and regulation of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes", "authors": "Clapier Cedric R., Cairns Bradley R.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "18", "first page": "407", "last page": "422", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm.2017.26"}, {"title": "Chromatin remodelling beyond transcription: the INO80 and SWR1 complexes", "authors": "Papamichos-Chronakis Manolis, Peterson Craig L.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "14", "first page": "601", "last page": "614", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm3622"}, {"title": "The SWI/SNF complex and cancer", "authors": "Kadoch Cigall, Crabtree Gerald R.", "journal": "Oncogene", "year": "2013", "volumes": "32", "first page": "3051", "last page": "3056", "DOI": "10.1038/onc.2012.349"}, {"title": "SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and human malignancies", "authors": "Wilson Brian G., Roberts Charles W.M.", "journal": "Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease", "year": "2015", "volumes": "10", "first page": "145", "last page": "167", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-pathol-012414-040445"}, {"title": "The role of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in hormone crosstalk", "authors": "Hargreaves Diana C., Crabtree Gerald R.", "journal": "Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism", "year": "2011", "volumes": "22", "first page": "417", "last page": "424", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tem.2011.05.009"}, {"title": "Chromatin remodeling: from transcription to cancer", "authors": "Hodges Courtney, Kirkland Jason G., Crabtree Gerald R.", "journal": "Cancer Genetics", "year": "2014", "volumes": "207", "first page": "352", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cancergen.2014.03.006"}, {"title": "The SWI/SNF complex in cancer—biology, biomarkers and therapy", "authors": "Shain A.
