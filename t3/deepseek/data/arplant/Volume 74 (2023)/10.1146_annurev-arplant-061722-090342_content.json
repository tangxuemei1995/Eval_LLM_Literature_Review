{"Literature Review": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis represents a fundamental interaction between plants and fungi, crucial for nutrient exchange, plant growth, and stress adaptation. This symbiotic relationship, primarily involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), facilitates the transfer of essential nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen from the soil to the plant, in exchange for carbon derived from photosynthesis. This mutualistic interaction not only enhances plant nutrition but also plays a significant role in soil health, carbon cycling, and ecosystem functioning (Smith & Read, 2008). Recent advancements have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying nutrient exchange and regulation between host plants and AMF, highlighting the complexity of this symbiotic relationship (Gutjahr & Parniske, 2013). The local and systemic regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by plant nutrient status, along with the autoregulation of mycorrhizae, ensures a balanced and mutually beneficial interaction, akin to a stabilizing free-market symbiosis (Kiers et al., 2011). The concept of the common mycorrhizal network (CMN) further extends the ecological significance of mycorrhizal symbiosis, enabling nutrient and signal exchange among interconnected plants, thereby influencing plant community dynamics and ecosystem resilience (Simard et al., 2012). The role of mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB) in enhancing mycorrhizal symbiosis has also been recognized, with these bacteria facilitating fungal colonization and nutrient exchange, thereby contributing to the overall efficiency of the symbiotic relationship (Frey-Klett et al., 2007). The synergistic effects between mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizosphere microorganisms underscore the potential of mycorrhizal symbiosis in sustainable agriculture and forestry management, offering strategies for biofertilization and bioprotection (Rillig et al., 2019). The ability of mycorrhizal fungi to confer stress resistance to plants, particularly under conditions of drought, salinity, and heavy metal toxicity, further emphasizes their role in plant adaptation and survival (Ruiz-Lozano et al., 2012). The autoregulation of mycorrhizae, mediated by plant signaling pathways, ensures the maintenance of symbiotic efficiency and prevents overcolonization, thereby stabilizing the symbiotic relationship (Vierheilig et al., 2008). The integration of mycorrhizal symbiosis into agricultural practices holds promise for enhancing crop productivity and resilience, reducing the reliance on chemical fertilizers, and promoting environmental sustainability (Gianinazzi et al., 2010). In conclusion, mycorrhizal symbiosis is a cornerstone of plant-microbe interactions, with profound implications for plant growth, stress adaptation, and ecosystem functioning. A deeper understanding of the molecular, physiological, and ecological aspects of this symbiotic relationship is essential for harnessing its potential in sustainable agriculture and forestry management.", "References": [{"title": "Mycorrhizal Symbiosis", "authors": "Sally E.
