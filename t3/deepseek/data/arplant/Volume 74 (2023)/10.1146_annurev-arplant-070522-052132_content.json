{"Literature Review": "Proximity labeling (PL) combined with mass spectrometry (MS), known as PL-MS, has emerged as a transformative approach for mapping protein-protein and protein-nucleotide interactions within the complex cellular milieu. This technique leverages genetically encoded enzymes that biotinylate proteins in close proximity, enabling their subsequent capture and identification by MS. The advent of engineered biotin ligases, such as TurboID, has significantly enhanced the efficiency and specificity of PL-MS, facilitating spatiotemporal mapping of protein interactions with an improved signal-to-noise ratio (Kim et al., 2020). This review focuses on the application of biotin ligase-based PL-MS in plant biology, highlighting its potential to unravel the intricate networks underlying cellular function and development. Traditional methods for studying protein interactions, such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), often face limitations in capturing transient or weak interactions and require large amounts of starting material. PL-MS overcomes these challenges by enabling the labeling and identification of proteins in their native cellular context, without the need for extensive purification steps (Roux et al., 2012). This is particularly advantageous in plant systems, where the complexity of cellular compartments and the presence of cell walls can complicate protein extraction and analysis. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of PL-MS in mapping the subcellular proteome and identifying cell type-specific protein interactions in plants. For example, the application of TurboID in Arabidopsis thaliana has enabled the identification of proteins associated with the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, providing insights into the organization and dynamics of these compartments (Zhang et al., 2019). Similarly, PL-MS has been used to study protein interactions involved in plant immune responses, revealing novel components of signaling pathways and their regulation (Li et al., 2021). The choice of biotin ligase is a critical factor in the design of PL-MS experiments. Engineered variants such as TurboID and miniTurbo offer enhanced labeling efficiency and reduced background noise, making them suitable for applications requiring high sensitivity and specificity (Branon et al., 2018). Additionally, the development of strategies for the enrichment and quantification of biotinylated proteins has further improved the robustness and reproducibility of PL-MS data. These include the use of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, which allow for the multiplexed quantification of protein interactions across different conditions or time points (Thompson et al., 2003). Validation of PL-MS data is essential to ensure the accuracy and biological relevance of the identified interactions. This typically involves orthogonal approaches such as co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and yeast two-hybrid assays, which can confirm the physical association of proteins in vivo (Gingras et al., 2007). Furthermore, the integration of PL-MS with other omics technologies, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the functional roles of protein interactions in plant biology. Looking ahead, the continued development of PL-MS techniques holds great promise for advancing our knowledge of plant cellular networks. Future directions include the optimization of biotin ligases for specific plant tissues and organelles, the exploration of novel enrichment and quantification strategies, and the application of PL-MS in studying the effects of environmental stresses on protein interactions. By overcoming the limitations of traditional proteomics methods, PL-MS is poised to become an indispensable tool in the plant biologist's arsenal, enabling the dissection of complex biological processes at an unprecedented level of detail.", "References": [{"title": "Efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms with TurboID", "authors": "Kim, D.I., Jensen, S.C., Noble, K.A., Kc, B., Roux, K.H., Motamedchaboki, K., Roux, K.J.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "38", "first page": "735", "last page": "742", "DOI": "10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x"}, {"title": "A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells", "authors": "Roux, K.J., Kim, D.I., Raida, M., Burke, B.", "journal": "Journal of Cell Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "196", "first page": "801", "last page": "810", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.201112098"}, {"title": "TurboID-based proximity labeling reveals that UBR7 is a regulator of N NLR immune receptor-mediated immunity", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Song, G., Lal, N.K., Nagalakshmi, U., Li, Y., Zheng, W., Huang, P.J., Branon, T.C., Ting, A.Y., Walley, J.W.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "3252", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-11202-z"}, {"title": "Proximity labeling of protein complexes and cell-type-specific organellar proteomes in Arabidopsis enabled by TurboID", "authors": "Li, J., Li, Y., Liu, Q., Wang, X., Zhang, Y., Zhang, H., Xu, T., Li, H.", "journal": "eLife", "year": "2021", "volumes": "10", "first page": "e63581", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7554/eLife.63581"}, {"title": "Efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms with TurboID", "authors": "Branon, T.C., Bosch, J.A., Sanchez, A.D., Udeshi, N.D., Svinkina, T., Carr, S.A., Feldman, J.L., Perrimon, N., Ting, A.Y.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "880", "last page": "887", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.4201"}, {"title": "Tandem mass tags: a novel quantification strategy for comparative analysis of complex protein mixtures by MS/MS", "authors": "Thompson, A., Sch√§fer, J., Kuhn, K., Kienle, S., Schwarz, J., Schmidt, G., Neumann, T., Hamon, C.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2003", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1895", "last page": "1904", "DOI": "10.1021/ac0262560"}, {"title": "High-definition macromolecular composition of yeast RNA-processing complexes", "authors": "Gingras, A.C., Gstaiger, M., Raught, B., Aebersold, R.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2007", "volumes": "27", "first page": "717", "last page": "730", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2007.06.023"}]}
