{"Literature Review": "Between-plant signaling represents a fascinating and complex aspect of plant biology, where plants communicate and interact with each other through various mechanisms. This review focuses on two primary pathways of between-plant signaling: the haustorial connections formed by parasitic plants and the common mycelial networks (CMNs) established by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Both pathways facilitate the transfer of a wide range of biomolecules and systemic signals, influencing plant interactions and environmental adaptation.Parasitic plants, such as those in the genera Cuscuta and Orobanche, develop specialized organs called haustoria that penetrate host plant tissues to form direct vascular connections. These connections allow for the bidirectional transfer of not only water and nutrients but also secondary metabolites, RNAs, proteins, and systemic signals. Studies have shown that through these haustorial connections, parasitic plants can extract resources from their hosts, significantly impacting host plant growth and survival. For instance, Cuscuta species have been observed to transfer mRNAs and small RNAs between connected plants, potentially influencing gene expression and defense responses in the host (Kim et al., 2014). This molecular exchange underscores the complexity of plant-plant interactions and suggests a level of communication that extends beyond mere resource competition.On the other hand, AMF form extensive underground networks known as CMNs, which connect the roots of different plant species. These networks facilitate the exchange of nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, between plants. However, recent research has highlighted the role of CMNs in transferring systemic signals that can influence plant defense mechanisms and stress responses. For example, plants connected through CMNs have been shown to activate defense responses upon the infection of a neighboring plant, suggesting a form of interplant communication that enhances collective resistance to pathogens (Song et al., 2010). This phenomenon indicates that CMNs serve not only as nutrient highways but also as information conduits, enabling plants to 'warn' each other of impending threats.The ecological implications of between-plant signaling are profound. By facilitating the transfer of resources and information, haustorial connections and CMNs can influence plant community structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. For instance, the ability of parasitic plants to extract resources from hosts can alter competitive dynamics within plant communities, potentially leading to shifts in species composition (Press & Phoenix, 2005). Similarly, the role of CMNs in mediating plant defense responses can affect plant-pathogen interactions and the spread of diseases within ecosystems (Johnson & Gilbert, 2015).Moreover, between-plant signaling has significant implications for plant adaptation to environmental stresses. The transfer of systemic signals through haustorial connections and CMNs can enable plants to rapidly respond to environmental changes, such as drought, salinity, and nutrient deficiency. This adaptive signaling may enhance the resilience of plant communities to climate change and other environmental challenges (Babikova et al., 2013).In conclusion, between-plant signaling mediated by haustorial connections and CMNs represents a critical aspect of plant biology with far-reaching implications for plant interactions, community dynamics, and environmental adaptation. Future research should aim to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these signaling pathways and their ecological and evolutionary consequences. Understanding these complex interactions will be crucial for developing sustainable agricultural practices and conserving biodiversity in the face of global environmental change.", "References": [{"title": "Interplant transfer of small RNAs via parasitic plants", "authors": "Kim, G., LeBlanc, M.L., Wafula, E.K., dePamphilis, C.W., Westwood, J.H.", "journal": "Plant Signaling & Behavior", "year": "2014", "volumes": "9", "first page": "e28975", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.4161/psb.28975"}, {"title": "Interplant communication of tomato plants through underground common mycorrhizal networks", "authors": "Song, Y.Y., Zeng, R.S., Xu, J.F., Li, J., Shen, X., Yihdego, W.G.", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "year": "2010", "volumes": "5", "first page": "e13324", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0013324"}, {"title": "Impacts of parasitic plants on natural communities", "authors": "Press, M.C., Phoenix, G.K.", "journal": "New Phytologist", "year": "2005", "volumes": "166", "first page": "737", "last page": "751", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01358.x"}, {"title": "Plant interactions with multiple soil-borne pathogens mediated by the common mycorrhizal network", "authors": "Johnson, D., Gilbert, L.", "journal": "New Phytologist", "year": "2015", "volumes": "205", "first page": "329", "last page": "334", "DOI": "10.1111/nph.13064"}, {"title": "Underground signals carried through common mycelial networks warn neighbouring plants of aphid attack", "authors": "Babikova, Z., Gilbert, L., Bruce, T.J.A., Birkett, M., Caulfield, J.C., Woodcock, C., Pickett, J.A., Johnson, D.", "journal": "Ecology Letters", "year": "2013", "volumes": "16", "first page": "835", "last page": "843", "DOI": "10.1111/ele.12115"}]}
