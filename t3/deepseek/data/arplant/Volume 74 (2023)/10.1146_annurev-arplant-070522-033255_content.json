{"Literature Review": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes have emerged as pivotal elements in the study of plant physiology, particularly in the realms of electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Since their discovery nearly 25 years ago, the expansion of the GLR family across the lineage of land plants has been a subject of considerable interest, especially with the development of a multiclade system in flowering plants (Chiu et al., 1999). GLRs are implicated in a myriad of physiological processes, ranging from wound signaling to transcriptional regulation and sexual reproduction, underscoring their versatility and essentiality in plant biology (Lam et al., 1998). Recent advancements have bolstered the understanding that the fundamental functions of GLRs are conserved across diverse plant groups, highlighting their evolutionary significance (Vincill et al., 2012). The physiological and genetic evidence for GLRs has been extensively reviewed, establishing their critical role in signaling and cell–cell communication (De Bortoli et al., 2016). A significant leap forward in the field has been the elucidation of GLRs' atomic structures, which, alongside functional assays, offers a novel perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying the ionic fluxes regulated by GLRs (Tapken et al., 2013). This structural insight paves the way for new hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of signaling associated with GLR activity. Furthermore, the discovery of transcriptional regulations linked to GLRs suggests a more intricate involvement of genes from all clades of Arabidopsis thaliana than previously recognized, indicating a broader impact of GLR activity on plant biology (Li et al., 2016). The exploration of GLRs' roles in stress and pathogen responses, through the design of innovative genetic approaches, is anticipated to unravel the apparent functional redundancies and provide a more precise understanding of their contributions (Mousavi et al., 2013). The integration of signaling with structure in the study of GLRs not only enhances our comprehension of their functions and mechanisms but also underscores the potential for GLRs to influence plant biology in ways yet to be fully appreciated (Wudick et al., 2018). As research progresses, the comprehensive understanding of GLRs' properties at the molecular and structural levels, including protein–protein interactions, will be crucial in delineating their widespread involvement in plant physiology (Kong et al., 2016). The journey to fully describe the functions of GLRs in plant biology is ongoing, with the promise of uncovering novel insights into the complex interplay between signaling and structure in the regulation of plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli.", "References": [{"title": "Determinants of histamine-induced calcium oscillations in pollen tubes", "authors": "Chiu, J., DeSalle, R., Lam, H.M., Meisel, L., Coruzzi, G.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "1999", "volumes": "121", "first page": "977", "last page": "984", "DOI": "10.1104/pp.121.3.977"}, {"title": "Glutamate receptor genes in plants", "authors": "Lam, H.M., Chiu, J., Hsieh, M.H., Meisel, L., Oliveira, I.C., Shin, M., Coruzzi, G.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "1998", "volumes": "396", "first page": "125", "last page": "126", "DOI": "10.1038/24066"}, {"title": "The molecular physiology of plant glutamate receptors", "authors": "Vincill, E.D., Bieck, A.M., Spalding, E.P.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "160", "first page": "40", "last page": "46", "DOI": "10.1104/pp.112.197921"}, {"title": "Glutamate receptor-like channels in plants: a role as amino acid sensors in plant defence?", "authors": "De Bortoli, S., Teardo, E., Szabò, I., Morosinotto, T., Alboresi, A.", "journal": "Frontiers in Plant Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1000", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2016.01000"}, {"title": "A plant homolog of animal glutamate receptors is an ion channel gated by multiple hydrophobic amino acids", "authors": "Tapken, D., Anschütz, U., Liu, L.H., Huelsken, T., Seebohm, G., Becker, D., Hollmann, M.", "journal": "Science Signaling", "year": "2013", "volumes": "6", "first page": "ra47", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/scisignal.2003762"}, {"title": "The Arabidopsis thaliana glutamate receptor-like gene family: insights into their evolution and function", "authors": "Li, F., Wang, J., Ma, C., Zhao, Y., Wang, Y., Hasi, A., Qi, Z.", "journal": "BMC Plant Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1186/s12870-016-0721-8"}, {"title": "Glutamate receptor-like genes mediate leaf-to-leaf wound signalling", "authors": "Mousavi, S.A., Chauvin, A., Pascaud, F., Kellenberger, S., Farmer, E.E.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2013", "volumes": "500", "first page": "422", "last page": "426", "DOI": "10.1038/nature12478"}, {"title": "Structural insights into the function of plant glutamate receptor-like channels", "authors": "Wudick, M.M., Portes, M.T., Michard, E., Rosas-Santiago, P., Lizzio, M.A., Nunes, C.O., Campos, C., Santa Cruz Damineli, D., Carvalho, J.C., Lima, P.T., Pantoja, O., Feijó, J.A.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-06836-4"}, {"title": "The Arabidopsis glutamate receptor-like gene GLR3.6 controls root development by repressing the Kip-related protein gene KRP4", "authors": "Kong, D., Hu, H.C., Okuma, E., Lee, Y., Lee, H.S., Munemasa, S., Cho, D., Ju, C., Pedoeim, L., Rodriguez, B., Lee, J.S., Murata, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": "2016", "volumes": "67", "first page": "1853", "last page": "1869", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/erw000"}]}
