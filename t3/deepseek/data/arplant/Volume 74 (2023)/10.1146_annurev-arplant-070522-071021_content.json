{"Literature Review": "The success of invasive plants in non-native ecosystems has been a subject of extensive research, driven by the need to understand and mitigate their ecological and economic impacts. This literature review synthesizes findings from various studies to explore the factors contributing to the success of invasive plants, focusing on intrinsic plant properties, biotic and abiotic conditions, and human-induced changes. Intrinsic plant properties, such as functional traits, play a crucial role in determining species invasiveness. Traits such as high growth rate, efficient resource use, and reproductive strategies have been identified as key factors facilitating the establishment and spread of invasive plants (Pyšek & Richardson, 2007). These traits enable invasive species to outcompete native flora, exploiting available resources more effectively and rapidly colonizing new areas. Biotic interactions, including competition, predation, and mutualism, significantly influence ecosystem invasibility. Invasive plants often benefit from a lack of natural enemies in their new environments, a phenomenon known as the enemy release hypothesis (Keane & Crawley, 2002). This absence of natural predators and pathogens allows invasive species to allocate more resources to growth and reproduction, enhancing their competitive advantage over native species. Additionally, invasive plants can alter soil microbial communities to their benefit, further facilitating their dominance (Callaway et al., 2004). Abiotic conditions, such as climate, soil properties, and disturbance regimes, also mediate the success of invasive plants. Climate change, in particular, has been shown to favor the expansion of invasive species by altering habitat suitability and reducing the resilience of native ecosystems (Dukes & Mooney, 1999). Soil nutrient availability and disturbance, such as fire or human activities, can create opportunities for invasive plants to establish and spread, often at the expense of native vegetation (Hobbs & Huenneke, 1992). Human-induced changes at local to global scales have been fundamental in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions. Globalization has facilitated the movement of species across biogeographical barriers, introducing non-native plants to new regions (Mack et al., 2000). Land use changes, such as urbanization and agriculture, have created disturbed habitats that are highly susceptible to invasion (Vitousek et al., 1997). Furthermore, human activities have altered nutrient cycles and hydrological regimes, creating conditions that favor invasive species over native ones (Ehrenfeld, 2003). The interplay of these factors—intrinsic plant properties, biotic and abiotic conditions, and human-induced changes—shapes the dynamics of plant invasions. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of invasive plants. Future research should focus on the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying invasion success, as well as the potential for human activities to alter future invasion trajectories. By integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines, we can enhance our predictive power and develop more robust frameworks for managing plant invasions in a rapidly changing world.", "References": [{"title": "Traits associated with invasiveness in alien plants: where do we stand?", "authors": "Petr Pyšek, David M.
