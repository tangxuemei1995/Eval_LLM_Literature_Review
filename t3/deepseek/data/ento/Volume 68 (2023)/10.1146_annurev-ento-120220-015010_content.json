{"Literature Review": "The resurgence of bed bugs, particularly Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, has become a significant public health concern worldwide. This resurgence is attributed to several factors, including increased global travel, changes in pest management practices, and the development of insecticide resistance. The historical context of bed bug control reveals a reliance on chemical insecticides, which, while effective initially, have led to the development of resistance among bed bug populations. This literature review explores the origins and global spread of bed bugs, alongside historical and contemporary control strategies, highlighting the challenges and future directions in bed bug management. The origins of bed bugs trace back to ancient times, with Cimex lectularius being associated with human dwellings for thousands of years. The global spread of bed bugs has been facilitated by human activity, particularly through international travel and trade. The resurgence of bed bugs in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been linked to the discontinuation of broad-spectrum insecticides, such as DDT, and the adoption of more targeted pest control methods, which inadvertently favored bed bug survival. Contemporary control strategies for bed bugs encompass a range of nonchemical and chemical methods. Nonchemical control options include physical removal, heat treatment, and the use of mattress encasements, which aim to eliminate bed bugs without the use of insecticides. Chemical control methods involve the application of insecticides, including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and insect growth regulators. However, the effectiveness of chemical control is increasingly compromised by the development of resistance among bed bug populations. The limitations of current control methodologies underscore the need for integrated pest management (IPM) approaches that combine multiple strategies to achieve effective bed bug control. IPM emphasizes the importance of prevention, early detection, and the judicious use of chemical treatments, alongside nonchemical methods, to manage bed bug infestations. Future research directions include the need to better understand the factors contributing to the modern resurgence of bed bugs, the identification of species-specific control strategies for Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, and the development of improved insecticide test protocols and management strategies. Additionally, there is a pressing need for the development of novel control options, including biological control agents and the use of genetic technologies, to combat insecticide resistance and provide sustainable solutions to the bed bug problem. In conclusion, the global resurgence of bed bugs presents a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach to control. By integrating historical knowledge with contemporary research and innovative technologies, it is possible to develop effective strategies for managing bed bug infestations and mitigating their impact on public health.", "References": [{"title": "The resurgence of bed bugs in Australia: with notes on their ecology and control", "authors": "Stephen L.
