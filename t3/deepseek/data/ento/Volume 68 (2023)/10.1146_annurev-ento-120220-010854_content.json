{"Literature Review": "The globalization of trade and travel has significantly increased the risk of non-native forest insect invasions, posing substantial economic and environmental threats. This literature review explores the processes, patterns, predictions, and pitfalls associated with forest insect biosecurity, focusing on the measures used to mitigate the arrival, establishment, spread, and impacts of these invasive species. Despite decades of research and the implementation of various biosecurity measures, the establishment of non-native forest insects continues unabated, with predictions indicating an acceleration in invasion rates. This review highlights the successes and challenges of biosecurity efforts, emphasizing the need for a shared responsibility among countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals to enhance the effectiveness of these measures. Biosecurity measures can be categorized into preborder, border, and postborder strategies. Preborder measures include risk assessment and the regulation of high-risk pathways to prevent the introduction of non-native species. Border measures involve the inspection and quarantine of goods to intercept potential invaders. Postborder measures focus on surveillance, eradication, and management of established populations to prevent their spread and mitigate impacts. Despite these efforts, the continued establishment of non-native species suggests limitations in existing biosecurity systems. One major challenge is the impossibility of inspecting all imports, which allows some invasive species to slip through undetected. Additionally, no phytosanitary measure is perfect, and there is always a risk of non-compliance with regulations. Another significant issue is the 'known-unknowns'—species that are not yet recognized as threats and therefore cannot be regulated against. The success of biosecurity measures is often under-recognized because it is difficult to detect and quantify the invasions that have been prevented. In contrast, biosecurity failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. This asymmetry in recognition can lead to an underestimation of the effectiveness of biosecurity efforts and a lack of support for their enhancement. To improve biosecurity outcomes, it is essential to address the limitations of existing systems and to foster a collaborative approach to biosecurity. This includes sharing information and resources among countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals to enhance the detection, prevention, and management of non-native forest insects. Furthermore, research should focus on improving risk assessment methods, developing more effective phytosanitary measures, and enhancing surveillance and eradication techniques. In conclusion, while biosecurity measures have had some success in mitigating the impacts of non-native forest insects, significant challenges remain. The continued globalization of trade and travel necessitates a concerted effort to strengthen biosecurity systems and to promote a shared responsibility for protecting forests from invasive species. By addressing the limitations of existing measures and fostering collaboration among all stakeholders, it is possible to enhance the effectiveness of biosecurity efforts and to reduce the economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects.", "References": [{"title": "Global trade and the spread of insect pests", "authors": "Andrew M.
