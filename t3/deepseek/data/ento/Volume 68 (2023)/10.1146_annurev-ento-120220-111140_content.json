{"Literature Review": "The Spotted Lanternfly (SLF), Lycorma delicatula (White), a member of the Fulgoridae family, has emerged as a significant invasive pest in the United States since its first detection in Pennsylvania in 2014. This planthopper, native to parts of Asia, has rapidly expanded its range across the eastern U.S., posing substantial threats to agriculture, particularly viticulture, and natural ecosystems. The biology, invasion potential, and management strategies of SLF have been the focus of extensive research to mitigate its impact. SLF exhibits a broad host range, feeding on over 70 plant species, which facilitates its spread across diverse habitats including agricultural, urban, suburban, and forested areas (Barringer et al., 2015). Its high mobility, both through natural dispersal and human-mediated transport, further exacerbates its invasion potential (Dara et al., 2015). The economic impact of SLF is most pronounced in vineyards, where it causes direct damage to grapevines and facilitates the growth of sooty mold through honeydew excretion, reducing photosynthesis and fruit quality (Urban & Leach, 2020). Management of SLF has primarily relied on chemical control measures, including the use of systemic insecticides, which have shown efficacy in reducing SLF populations (Leach et al., 2019). However, the reliance on chemical control raises concerns about environmental impact and the development of insecticide resistance. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, combining chemical, biological, and cultural control methods, are advocated to sustainably manage SLF populations (Nixon et al., 2021). Biological control efforts have explored the potential of natural enemies from SLF's native range, including parasitoids and predators, as a long-term management solution (Kim et al., 2020). Cultural practices, such as the removal of preferred host plants like the Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima), have also been recommended to reduce SLF habitat suitability (Jung et al., 2017). Despite these efforts, the continued spread of SLF underscores the need for ongoing research and adaptive management strategies to address this invasive pest effectively. The development of early detection and rapid response protocols, public education campaigns, and regulatory measures to limit the movement of SLF-infested materials are critical components of a comprehensive management approach (Harper et al., 2021). As SLF continues to expand its range in the U.S., understanding its biology, ecological interactions, and management options remains a priority for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders involved in agriculture and natural resource management.", "References": [{"title": "The First New World Record of Lycorma delicatula (Insecta: Hemiptera: Fulgoridae)", "authors": "Lawrence Barringer, Claire M.
