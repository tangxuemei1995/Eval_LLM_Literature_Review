{"Literature Review": "The management of insect pests through the use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops has been a significant advancement in agricultural biotechnology. Bt corn and cotton, genetically engineered to produce insecticidal toxins, have been widely adopted in the United States for their efficacy in controlling key pests such as the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa zea) (Hutchison et al., 2010). These crops have not only reduced the reliance on conventional insecticides but have also contributed to the regional suppression of pest populations, and in some cases, the eradication of pests within the United States (Tabashnik et al., 2013). The economic benefits for farmers have been substantial, with increased yields and reduced costs associated with pest management (Carpenter, 2010). However, the sustainability of Bt crops is threatened by the evolution of resistance in pest populations. Instances of resistance to multiple Bt traits have been documented, leading to increased feeding injury to crops and compromising the effectiveness of Bt crops in pest management (Gassmann et al., 2014). The factors influencing the susceptibility of pests to Bt toxins versus the evolution of resistance are complex and include aspects of pest biology and pest-crop interactions. For example, the high dose/refuge strategy, which involves planting non-Bt crops alongside Bt crops to maintain a population of susceptible pests, has been a cornerstone of insect resistance management (IRM) strategies (Gould, 1998). However, the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the compliance of farmers and the biology of the pest species, including their mobility and mating behavior (Carrière et al., 2016). To improve the viability of future transgenic traits, it is crucial to learn from past outcomes and implement strategies that delay resistance. Increasing the prevalence of refuges and integrating pest management practices are essential components of a sustainable approach to managing insect pests with Bt crops (Tabashnik et al., 2013). Additionally, the development of new Bt toxins with different modes of action and the use of gene pyramiding, where multiple resistance genes are combined in a single crop, offer promising avenues for enhancing the durability of Bt crops (Carrière et al., 2015). The continued success of Bt crops in managing insect pests in the United States will depend on the adoption of comprehensive IRM strategies that address the challenges of resistance evolution while maximizing the benefits of this technology for farmers and the environment.", "References": [{"title": "Areawide Suppression of European Corn Borer with Bt Maize Reaps Savings to Non-Bt Maize Growers", "authors": "Hutchison, W.D., Burkness, E.C., Mitchell, P.D., Moon, R.D., Leslie, T.W., Fleischer, S.J., Abrahamson, M., Hamilton, K.L., Steffey, K.L., Gray, M.E.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2010", "volumes": "330", "first page": "222", "last page": "225", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1190242"}, {"title": "Insect Resistance to Bt Crops: Lessons from the First Billion Acres", "authors": "Tabashnik, B.E., Brévault, T., Carrière, Y.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "31", "first page": "510", "last page": "521", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.2597"}, {"title": "Peer-Reviewed Surveys Indicate Positive Impact of Commercialized GM Crops", "authors": "Carpenter, J.E.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "28", "first page": "319", "last page": "321", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt0410-319"}, {"title": "Field-Evolved Resistance by Western Corn Rootworm to Multiple Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins in Transgenic Maize", "authors": "Gassmann, A.J., Petzold-Maxwell, J.L., Keweshan, R.S., Dunbar, M.W.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2014", "volumes": "111", "first page": "5141", "last page": "5146", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1317179111"}, {"title": "Sustainability of Transgenic Insecticidal Cultivars: Integrating Pest Genetics and Ecology", "authors": "Gould, F.", "journal": "Annual Review of Entomology", "year": "1998", "volumes": "43", "first page": "701", "last page": "726", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.701"}, {"title": "Optimizing Pyramided Transgenic Bt Crops for Sustainable Pest Management", "authors": "Carrière, Y., Crickmore, N., Tabashnik, B.E.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "33", "first page": "161", "last page": "168", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.3099"}, {"title": "Large-Scale, Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of the European Corn Borer and Corn Rootworm: Implications for Resistance Management", "authors": "Carrière, Y., Ellers-Kirk, C., Sisterson, M., Antilla, L., Whitlow, M., Dennehy, T.J., Tabashnik, B.E.", "journal": "Journal of Economic Entomology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "109", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1093/jee/tov238"}]}
