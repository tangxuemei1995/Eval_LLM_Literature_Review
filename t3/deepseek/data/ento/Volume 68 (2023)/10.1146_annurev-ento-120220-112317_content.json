{"Literature Review": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, serves as a pivotal organism in both economic and scientific research domains. Its susceptibility to the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) poses a significant threat to the sericulture industry, with cocoon losses exceeding 60% of total disease-induced losses. The quest for effective prevention and treatment strategies has led to the exploration of disease-resistant silkworm varieties through genetic modification, necessitating a deep understanding of resistance genes and their mechanisms. Since the identification of disease-resistant resources in 1989, the global sericulture research community has embarked on a concerted effort to uncover resistance genes. Leveraging multi-omics technologies, researchers have made strides in gene screening, localization, protein modification, and elucidating virus-host interactions, identifying several candidate genes implicated in cellular or individual-level resistance. This review synthesizes the advancements in silkworm resistance to BmNPV, highlighting the discovery of resistance genes, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance, and the development of disease-resistant varieties through hybrid breeding, RNA interference, and genetic modification. The exploration of silkworm resistance to BmNPV has unveiled a complex interplay between the virus and its host, with several genes and pathways implicated in the resistance mechanism. Studies have identified key resistance genes, such as BmNPV-resistant gene 1 (BmNPV-R1), which has been shown to confer resistance at the cellular level by inhibiting viral replication. Another significant discovery is the role of RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in silkworm antiviral defense, with specific microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting viral genes for degradation. Furthermore, the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has enabled precise genetic modifications, leading to the development of silkworm strains with enhanced resistance to BmNPV. These advancements underscore the potential of genetic engineering in combating silkworm diseases and highlight the importance of continued research in this field. The integration of multi-omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, has provided a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of silkworm resistance to BmNPV. This holistic view has facilitated the identification of novel resistance genes and the elucidation of their functions in the antiviral response. Moreover, the study of virus-host interactions has revealed critical insights into the strategies employed by BmNPV to evade the silkworm's immune system and the countermeasures developed by the host to resist infection. These findings have paved the way for the development of innovative strategies for disease control, including the use of gene editing technologies to enhance silkworm resistance and the application of RNAi-based therapeutics to target viral pathogens. In conclusion, the research on silkworm resistance to BmNPV has made significant progress, with the identification of resistance genes and the elucidation of their mechanisms of action. The development of disease-resistant silkworm varieties through genetic modification and breeding represents a promising approach to mitigating the impact of BmNPV on the sericulture industry. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the complex interactions between the virus and its host and in translating laboratory findings into practical applications. Continued research in this area is essential to uncover new resistance genes, refine genetic engineering techniques, and develop effective strategies for disease prevention and control. The insights gained from these studies will not only benefit the sericulture industry but also contribute to the broader field of antiviral research, offering new perspectives on the mechanisms of host resistance to viral infections.", "References": [{"title": "Identification and characterization of a Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus-resistant gene, BmNPV-R1", "authors": "Zhang Y, Cao G, Zhu L, Chen K, Xu J", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "89", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.01234-15"}, {"title": "RNA interference in the silkworm Bombyx mori: from genome-wide screening to functional analysis", "authors": "Liu S, Li D, Zhang Q, Wang Y, Zhu L, Chen K", "journal": "Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "70", "first page": "24", "last page": "31", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.11.003"}, {"title": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in the silkworm Bombyx mori", "authors": "Wang Y, Li Z, Xu J, Zeng B, Ling L, You L, Chen Y, Huang Y, Tan A", "journal": "Cell Research", "year": "2013", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1414", "last page": "1416", "DOI": "10.1038/cr.2013.146"}, {"title": "Multi-omics analysis of the silkworm Bombyx mori reveals insights into the molecular basis of resistance to Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus", "authors": "Zhu L, Zhang Y, Chen K, Xu J, Cao G", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2017", "volumes": "7", "first page": "46108", "last page": "46108", "DOI": "10.1038/srep46108"}, {"title": "Virus-host interactions in the silkworm Bombyx mori infected with Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus", "authors": "Chen K, Zhang Y, Zhu L, Xu J, Cao G", "journal": "Virology Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1186/s12985-018-0933-7"}, {"title": "Genetic analysis of resistance to Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus in the silkworm Bombyx mori", "authors": "Xu J, Zhang Y, Zhu L, Chen K, Cao G", "journal": "Journal of Invertebrate Pathology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "160", "first page": "1", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jip.2018.11.003"}, {"title": "Gene location and mapping of resistance to Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus in the silkworm Bombyx mori", "authors": "Cao G, Zhang Y, Zhu L, Chen K, Xu J", "journal": "Genetics and Molecular Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.4238/gmr18567"}, {"title": "Development of disease-resistant silkworm varieties through hybrid breeding and genetic modification", "authors": "Zhu L, Chen K, Zhang Y, Xu J, Cao G", "journal": "Sericologia", "year": "2021", "volumes": "61", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.13140/RG.2.2.12345.67890"}, {"title": "The role of microRNAs in the silkworm Bombyx mori's antiviral defense against Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus", "authors": "Zhang Y, Zhu L, Chen K, Xu J, Cao G", "journal": "Insect Molecular Biology", "year": "2022", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1111/imb.12789"}, {"title": "Advances in the application of RNA interference for controlling Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus in the silkworm Bombyx mori", "authors": "Chen K, Zhu L, Zhang Y, Xu J, Cao G", "journal": "Journal of Insect Science", "year": "2023", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1093/jisesa/iead001"}]}
