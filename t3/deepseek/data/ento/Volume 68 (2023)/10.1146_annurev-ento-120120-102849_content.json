{"Literature Review": "The study of arthropod and pathogen damage on fossil and modern plants has significantly advanced our understanding of the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. The functional feeding group–damage type (FFG-DT) system has been pivotal in this transformation, enabling detailed analyses of arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants across a 420-million-year history. This system has facilitated the exploration of local, regional, and global patterns of herbivory, shedding light on the earliest evidence of herbivory, the emergence of herbivore associations on land plants, and their subsequent expansion on seed plants (Labandeira et al., 2007). The fossil record provides critical insights into the effects of major ecological crises, such as the Permian–Triassic event, on herbivore diversity and the formation of diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms (Labandeira, 2006). Furthermore, the initial diversification of angiosperms marked a significant shift in herbivory patterns, with implications for the evolution of plant-insect interactions (Wilf et al., 2000). Recent studies have also focused on the impact of transient spikes and long-term climate trends on herbivory, offering valuable data for understanding current global change scenarios. These include analyses of herbivore community responses to variations in latitude, altitude, and habitat (Currano et al., 2008). Despite these advances, several paleoecological themes remain to be explored, such as the antiquity of modern interactions, differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and the origins of modern tropical forests (Labandeira, 2013). The expansion of databases encompassing a multitude of specimens, improvements in sampling strategies, and the development of new analytical methods have provided fresh momentum in this rapidly evolving field. These advancements have not only enhanced our ability to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions but also underscored the importance of integrating paleontological and neontological data to gain a comprehensive understanding of herbivory dynamics through time (Schachat et al., 2018). The Cretaceous–Paleogene ecologic crisis, damage types, functional feeding groups, continental scale, Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, and Permian–Triassic ecologic crisis are among the key areas of focus that continue to drive research in this domain, highlighting the intricate interplay between plants, arthropods, and pathogens over geological timescales (Labandeira et al., 2016).", "References": [{"title": "The origin of herbivory on land: Initial patterns of plant tissue consumption by arthropods", "authors": "Conrad C.
