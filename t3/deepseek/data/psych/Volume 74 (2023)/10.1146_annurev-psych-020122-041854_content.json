{"Literature Review": "Psychological resilience, defined as the ability to maintain or regain psychological well-being in the face of adversity, has emerged as a critical area of study within psychology. This literature review explores the concept of psychological resilience through an affect-regulation framework, integrating insights from the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach. The review begins by addressing the conceptual ambiguities surrounding resilience, followed by an examination of the limitations inherent in the two major approaches to understanding resilience. Finally, it proposes an integrative affect-regulation framework that leverages the strengths of both approaches to advance our understanding of resilience. The stress and coping approach has traditionally focused on the processes by which individuals manage stressors and the resources that facilitate effective coping. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) transactional model of stress and coping posits that the impact of a stressor is mediated by an individual's appraisal of the stressor and their coping resources. This model has been foundational in resilience research, highlighting the importance of cognitive appraisal and coping strategies in determining resilience outcomes. However, this approach has been critiqued for its limited attention to the role of emotions in the resilience process. In contrast, the emotion and emotion-regulation approach emphasizes the role of emotional experiences and the strategies individuals use to manage these emotions in the face of adversity. Gross's (1998) process model of emotion regulation, which identifies five stages of emotion regulation (situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation), has been influential in this area. This approach has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms through which individuals can influence their emotional experiences to promote resilience. However, it has been criticized for its relative neglect of the broader context of stress and coping. To address these limitations, recent research has begun to integrate insights from both approaches. For example, Tugade and Fredrickson (2004) have demonstrated that positive emotions can serve as a buffer against stress, facilitating resilience by broadening individuals' thought-action repertoires and building enduring personal resources. Similarly, Folkman and Moskowitz (2000) have highlighted the role of positive emotions in coping with chronic stress, suggesting that the generation of positive emotions can be a key mechanism of resilience. Building on these insights, the proposed affect-regulation framework posits that resilience is facilitated by the dynamic interplay between stress and coping processes and emotion regulation strategies. This framework suggests that effective affect regulation can enhance resilience by modulating emotional responses to adversity, thereby influencing cognitive appraisals and coping strategies. For instance, the use of cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves reinterpreting a stressor in a more positive light, can reduce the perceived threat of a stressor and promote adaptive coping. Moreover, the framework highlights the importance of individual differences in affect regulation capacity as a determinant of resilience. Research has shown that individuals with higher levels of emotional intelligence, which encompasses the ability to perceive, understand, and regulate emotions, tend to exhibit greater resilience in the face of adversity (Salovey, Mayer, & Caruso, 2002). This suggests that interventions aimed at enhancing emotional intelligence could be a promising avenue for promoting resilience. In conclusion, the affect-regulation framework offers a comprehensive and integrative approach to understanding psychological resilience. By bridging the gap between the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach, this framework provides a more nuanced understanding of the processes underlying resilience. It also highlights the importance of affect regulation in promoting resilience and suggests potential directions for future research and intervention.", "References": [{"title": "Stress, appraisal, and coping", "authors": "Richard S.
