{"Literature Review": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) represents a pivotal area of research within the psychological sciences, focusing on how the evaluation of a stimulus can be altered through its association with an affective stimulus. This literature review delves into the historical evolution of EC research, its current state, and the prospective directions it may take, guided by the insights provided in the abstract and keywords. The exploration is structured around three central questions that have shaped the discourse on EC: the application of EC procedures to influence evaluation, the cognitive processes underlying the EC effect, and the external validity of EC findings. The inception of EC research can be traced back to the early 20th century, with foundational studies demonstrating that neutral stimuli could acquire affective properties through association with positive or negative stimuli (Jones, 1924). This early work laid the groundwork for subsequent research, which has sought to elucidate the mechanisms and implications of EC. In terms of applying EC procedures to influence evaluation, recent studies have provided a comprehensive guide based on the functional properties of EC effects. For instance, Hofmann, De Houwer, Perugini, Baeyens, and Crombez (2010) synthesized evidence indicating that EC effects are robust across different modalities and can be effectively utilized in various settings, including marketing and psychotherapy. The cognitive processes mediating the EC effect have been a subject of extensive debate. Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2006) proposed a dual-process model that distinguishes between associative and propositional processes, suggesting that EC effects can be automatic or controlled depending on the context. This model has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the automaticity of EC effects, highlighting the conditions under which they occur without conscious awareness. The external validity of EC research, or its applicability to real-world scenarios, has been increasingly scrutinized. Sweldens, Van Osselaer, and Janiszewski (2010) demonstrated that EC effects can influence consumer behavior outside the laboratory, suggesting that EC has significant implications for everyday life. However, the extent to which EC effects are ubiquitous and the level of control over the mediating processes remain open questions. Future research directions include exploring the relevance of EC to everyday life and the mechanisms that govern the control over EC effects. The integration of EC research with other domains, such as neuroscience and social psychology, offers promising avenues for understanding the broader implications of EC. In conclusion, EC research has made substantial contributions to our understanding of attitude formation and change. By addressing the key questions outlined in this review, future research can further elucidate the mechanisms of EC and its applications in various fields.", "References": [{"title": "A conditioned response to a neutral stimulus", "authors": "Jones, Mary Cover", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Psychology", "year": "1924", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1037/h0072282"}, {"title": "Evaluative conditioning in humans: A meta-analysis", "authors": "Hofmann, Wilhelm, De Houwer, Jan, Perugini, Marco, Baeyens, Frank, Crombez, Geert", "journal": "Psychological Bulletin", "year": "2010", "volumes": "136", "first page": "390", "last page": "421", "DOI": "10.1037/a0018916"}, {"title": "Associative and propositional processes in evaluation: An integrative review of implicit and explicit attitude change", "authors": "Gawronski, Bertram, Bodenhausen, Galen V.", "journal": "Psychological Bulletin", "year": "2006", "volumes": "132", "first page": "692", "last page": "731", "DOI": "10.1037/0033-2909.132.5.692"}, {"title": "Evaluative conditioning effects are modulated by the nature of contextual pairings", "authors": "Sweldens, Steven, Van Osselaer, Stijn M.
