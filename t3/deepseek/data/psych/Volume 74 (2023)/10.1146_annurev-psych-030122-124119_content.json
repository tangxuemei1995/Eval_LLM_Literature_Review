{"Literature Review": "The diagnosis and treatment of cancer are inherently stressful experiences that pose significant psychological and physiological challenges to patients and survivors. The literature underscores the importance of stress management interventions in facilitating adaptation and improving health outcomes in this population. This review synthesizes evidence from randomized controlled trials and emerging research on the efficacy of stress management interventions in cancer care. Cancer-related stressors, ranging from the initial diagnosis through treatment and into survivorship, necessitate substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. These stressors can significantly impair quality of life and well-being, and there is growing evidence that they may also influence cellular and molecular processes that exacerbate physical symptoms and potentially facilitate tumor growth and metastasis (Antoni et al., 2006; Lutgendorf et al., 2010). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely studied as a stress management intervention in cancer patients and survivors. CBT aims to modify maladaptive thoughts and behaviors, thereby improving psychological adaptation and reducing stress. Studies have demonstrated that CBT can lead to significant reductions in anxiety, depression, and stress levels, as well as improvements in quality of life (Savard et al., 2006; Antoni et al., 2001). Moreover, CBT has been associated with positive physiological changes, including reductions in cortisol levels and improvements in immune function (McGregor et al., 2004). Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is another intervention that has gained attention for its potential benefits in cancer care. MBSR involves mindfulness meditation and yoga to enhance awareness and acceptance of the present moment. Research indicates that MBSR can reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life in cancer patients and survivors (Carlson et al., 2007; Speca et al., 2000). Additionally, MBSR has been linked to physiological benefits, such as reductions in inflammatory markers and improvements in sleep quality (Black et al., 2015). Emerging research is exploring the role of stress management interventions in influencing long-term health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. For instance, studies are investigating whether these interventions can reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and improve survival rates (Andersen et al., 2008; Stagl et al., 2015). While preliminary findings are promising, further research is needed to establish the efficacy of stress management interventions in this context. In conclusion, stress management interventions, including CBT and MBSR, hold significant promise for facilitating psychological and physiological adaptation and improving health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to determine the long-term impact of these interventions on cancer health outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "The influence of bio-behavioural factors on tumour biology: pathways and mechanisms", "authors": "Michael H.
