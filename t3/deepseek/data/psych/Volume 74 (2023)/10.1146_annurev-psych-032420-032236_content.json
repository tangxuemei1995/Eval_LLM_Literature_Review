{"Literature Review": "Self-continuity represents a fundamental aspect of human psychology, encapsulating the subjective sense of connection across one's temporal selves. This literature review delves into the multifaceted nature of self-continuity, exploring its motivational character, regulatory properties, and the factors that influence its consolidation. Additionally, it examines the consequences of self-continuity on attitudes, behavior, and health, alongside the benefits of self-discontinuity. The review also considers the neural underpinnings of self-continuity, developmental perspectives, collective self-continuity, and cultural variations in the experience of self-continuity. The concept of self-continuity is pivotal in understanding how individuals perceive their identity over time. Research has identified three primary forms of self-continuity: past–present, present–future, and global self-continuity. These forms are not only distinct in their temporal focus but also in their motivational and regulatory properties. For instance, past–present self-continuity is often driven by the desire to maintain a coherent narrative of one's life, whereas present–future self-continuity is motivated by the aspiration to achieve future goals (Bluck & Alea, 2002). The regulatory properties of self-continuity enable individuals to navigate life transitions and challenges by providing a sense of stability and coherence (Sani, 2008). Various internal and external factors contribute to the consolidation of self-continuity. Internal factors include cognitive processes such as memory and imagination, which allow individuals to mentally traverse their temporal selves (Prebble, Addis, & Tippett, 2013). External factors, on the other hand, encompass social interactions and cultural narratives that reinforce one's sense of continuity (McAdams, 2001). The consequences of self-continuity are profound, influencing attitudes, judgments, and decisions. A strong sense of self-continuity has been associated with positive psychological health, including higher self-esteem and lower levels of anxiety and depression (Chandler & Lalonde, 1998). Conversely, self-discontinuity, or the sense of disconnect among temporal selves, can have beneficial effects in certain contexts, such as facilitating personal growth and adaptation to change (Wilson & Ross, 2001). Neuroscientific research has begun to uncover the brain regions involved in self-continuity, with studies highlighting the role of the default mode network in integrating past, present, and future self-representations (Buckner & Carroll, 2007). Developmental perspectives on self-continuity suggest that the sense of continuity evolves over the lifespan, with significant milestones such as adolescence and old age marking periods of heightened self-continuity exploration (Habermas & Bluck, 2000). Collective self-continuity, or the sense of connection across a group's temporal identity, shares similarities with individual self-continuity but is influenced by group dynamics and collective memory (Sani et al., 2007). Cultural differences in self-continuity are evident, with individualistic cultures emphasizing personal continuity and collectivistic cultures focusing on relational and collective continuity (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). In conclusion, self-continuity is a complex and dynamic construct that plays a crucial role in shaping human experience. The breadth of research on self-continuity underscores its significance in psychology and points to promising directions for future inquiry.", "References": [{"title": "The construction of autobiographical memories in the self-memory system", "authors": "Martin A.
