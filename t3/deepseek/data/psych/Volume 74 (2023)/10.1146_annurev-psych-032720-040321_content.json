{"Literature Review": "Pride, as a self-conscious emotion, plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of social rank attainment across human societies. This literature review delves into the dual facets of pride—authentic and hubristic—and their respective contributions to achieving social status through prestige and dominance. Authentic pride, characterized by feelings of accomplishment and confidence, fosters prosocial behaviors and is instrumental in the attainment of prestige, a form of social rank based on earned respect and admiration. Conversely, hubristic pride, marked by arrogance and conceit, promotes antisocial behaviors and is associated with dominance, a social rank achieved through aggression and coercion. Both pathways, despite their contrasting natures, are effective in securing power and influence within human groups, suggesting that pride, in its multifaceted expression, is a functional adaptation critical for social relationships and hierarchy formation. The universality of pride, underscored by its cross-culturally recognized nonverbal expression, further highlights its significance in the social fabric of human societies. Research by Tracy and Robins (2007) elucidates the distinct nonverbal expressions associated with authentic and hubristic pride, providing empirical evidence for the emotion's universality and its role in social rank attainment. Authentic pride's link to prestige is supported by studies indicating that individuals who exhibit this form of pride are more likely to be respected and admired by their peers, thereby ascending the social hierarchy through positive social evaluations (Cheng, Tracy, & Henrich, 2010). On the other hand, hubristic pride's association with dominance is evidenced by research showing that individuals displaying this facet of pride are more likely to engage in aggressive and coercive behaviors to assert their social rank (Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, 2010). The functional significance of both facets of pride in social rank attainment is further corroborated by evolutionary psychology perspectives, which posit that pride evolved as a mechanism to motivate individuals to achieve and maintain high social status, thereby enhancing their reproductive success (Sznycer et al., 2017). Moreover, the differential outcomes associated with authentic and hubristic pride in terms of social relationships and group cohesion underscore the adaptive value of pride in navigating the complexities of human social hierarchies (Tracy, Shariff, & Cheng, 2010). The interplay between pride and social rank attainment is also influenced by cultural factors, with research indicating that the expression and interpretation of pride vary across cultures, yet its fundamental role in social hierarchy remains consistent (Boiger et al., 2013). This body of research collectively underscores the centrality of pride in the social dynamics of human groups, highlighting its role as a key emotional foundation for the attainment and maintenance of social rank. As such, pride, in its authentic and hubristic forms, emerges as a critical emotion in the architecture of human social relationships, facilitating the navigation of social hierarchies through distinct yet equally effective pathways.", "References": [{"title": "The nonverbal expression of pride: Evidence for cross-cultural recognition", "authors": "Jessica L.
