{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between vision and action has been a subject of increasing interest within the fields of psychology and neuroscience, challenging the traditional see → decide → act paradigm. This literature review explores the evolving understanding of how vision and action are more intimately coupled than previously thought, highlighting three pertinent theories that deserve greater attention. The traditional view, which segregates perception, decision-making, and action into distinct stages, has been increasingly questioned by findings that suggest a more integrated process. For instance, Milner and Goodale's (1995) dual-stream theory of visual processing posits that the brain processes visual information in two distinct pathways: the ventral stream for object recognition and the dorsal stream for guiding actions. This theory underscores the functional specialization within the visual system, suggesting that action and perception are served by separate neural mechanisms. However, recent studies have shown that these streams are not as independent as once thought, with evidence of cross-talk and integration between them (Schenk & McIntosh, 2010). This challenges the notion of a strict separation between vision and action, suggesting a more dynamic interplay. Another theory that has gained traction is the concept of embodied cognition, which posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world. This perspective emphasizes the role of sensory-motor experiences in shaping cognition, suggesting that vision and action are fundamentally intertwined (Wilson, 2002). Empirical support for this view comes from studies demonstrating how action influences perception, such as the finding that the ability to grasp an object can affect its perceived size (Witt et al., 2005). This suggests that our actions can shape our visual experiences, further blurring the lines between perception and action. Lastly, the theory of predictive coding offers a unifying framework for understanding the integration of vision and action. This theory proposes that the brain generates predictions about sensory inputs and uses discrepancies between predictions and actual inputs to update its models of the world (Clark, 2013). In the context of vision and action, this means that motor actions are guided by predictions about their sensory consequences, highlighting a proactive rather than reactive role of the brain in coordinating behavior. Together, these theories challenge the traditional view of vision and action as separate processes, suggesting a more integrated and dynamic relationship. This has important implications for our understanding of consciousness and attention, as it suggests that these processes are not merely passive observers of the world but active participants in shaping our experiences. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms underlying the integration of vision and action, with the aim of developing a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior.", "References": [{"title": "The visual brain in action", "authors": "Milner, A.
