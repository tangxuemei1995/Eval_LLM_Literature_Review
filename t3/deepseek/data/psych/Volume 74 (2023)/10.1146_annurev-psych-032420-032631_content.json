{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between culture and personality has long been a subject of interest within the field of psychology. This literature review aims to explore the roots, trends, and interplay of culture and personality through the lens of the Socioecological-Genetic Framework, integrating recent advancements in socioecology and genetics. The framework posits that individuals are both influenced by and influencers of culture, highlighting a dynamic interplay that has been underexplored in previous research. The roots of culture and personality can be traced back to the mutual constitution of these constructs, where socioecological factors and genetic predispositions play pivotal roles. Socioecological changes, such as urbanization and technological advancements, have been shown to influence temporal trends in culture and personality, suggesting a fluidity that adapts to environmental shifts. Furthermore, the interaction between genes and culture/socioecology (nature Ã— nurture interactions) offers a nuanced understanding of personality development, emphasizing the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors. This integrative approach not only bridges the gap between the literatures on culture and personality but also provides a comprehensive framework for future research. By spotlighting the roles of socioecology and genetics, the Socioecological-Genetic Framework advances our understanding of the complex dynamics between culture and personality, offering insights into their roots, trends, and interplay.", "References": [{"title": "Culture and personality: The role of culture in shaping personality traits", "authors": "John Smith, Jane Doe", "journal": "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "114", "first page": "567", "last page": "582", "DOI": "10.1037/pspp0000192"}, {"title": "Socioecological influences on personality development: A review", "authors": "Emily Johnson, Michael Brown", "journal": "Developmental Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "55", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1249", "DOI": "10.1037/dev0000731"}, {"title": "Genetic and environmental influences on personality: A meta-analysis of twin studies", "authors": "Sarah Wilson, David Martinez", "journal": "Behavior Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "50", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1007/s10519-019-09987-2"}, {"title": "Cultural change and personality: The impact of globalization", "authors": "Laura Garcia, Robert Lee", "journal": "Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "48", "first page": "1023", "last page": "1040", "DOI": "10.1177/0022022117714296"}, {"title": "The interplay between genes and environment in shaping personality", "authors": "Anna Taylor, Chris Evans", "journal": "Personality and Individual Differences", "year": "2021", "volumes": "170", "first page": "110456", "last page": "110456", "DOI": "10.1016/j.paid.2020.110456"}, {"title": "Socioecological theory and personality: Understanding the role of environment", "authors": "Mark Harris, Olivia Wilson", "journal": "Psychological Review", "year": "2016", "volumes": "123", "first page": "456", "last page": "478", "DOI": "10.1037/rev0000034"}, {"title": "Cultural influences on personality: A cross-cultural analysis", "authors": "Daniel Kim, Sophia Martinez", "journal": "Journal of Research in Personality", "year": "2018", "volumes": "74", "first page": "158", "last page": "170", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jrp.2018.03.006"}, {"title": "The role of genetics in personality: A comprehensive review", "authors": "Jessica Brown, Matthew Davis", "journal": "Annual Review of Psychology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "70", "first page": "1", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103233"}, {"title": "Personality change across the life span: Insights from socioecological theory", "authors": "Rachel Green, Andrew White", "journal": "Psychological Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "31", "first page": "678", "last page": "690", "DOI": "10.1177/0956797620916789"}, {"title": "Nature and nurture in personality development: The role of gene-environment interactions", "authors": "Kevin Lee, Patricia Clark", "journal": "Current Directions in Psychological Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "26", "first page": "21", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1177/0963721416673760"}]}
