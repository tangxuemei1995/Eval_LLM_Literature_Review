{"Literature Review": "The underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields has been a persistent issue, despite various efforts to increase their participation and interest. This literature review explores the psychological factors contributing to women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM, focusing on the role of gender stereotypes and the concept of person-environment fit. Research indicates that person-level explanations, such as differences in abilities, interests, and self-efficacy, are insufficient to account for the gender disparities observed in STEM fields (Ceci & Williams, 2011). Instead, gender stereotypes play a significant role in shaping women's experiences and perceptions of fit within these domains. Gender stereotypes can influence women's self-concept, goals, and social interactions, thereby affecting their sense of belonging and inclusion in STEM (Cheryan, Master, & Meltzoff, 2015). These stereotypes operate at both the individual and systemic levels, creating barriers that are not solely the result of intentional biases or discrimination. For instance, the stereotype that STEM fields are inherently masculine can deter women from pursuing careers in these areas, even when they possess the necessary skills and interests (Dasgupta & Stout, 2014). This phenomenon is further exacerbated by the lack of visible female role models in STEM, which can reinforce the perception that these fields are not for women (Lockwood, 2006). The concept of person-environment fit, which includes self-concept fit, goal fit, and social fit, is particularly relevant in understanding the challenges women face in STEM. Self-concept fit refers to the alignment between an individual's self-perception and the characteristics of a particular environment or role. Gender stereotypes can undermine women's self-concept fit by creating a mismatch between their self-perception and the stereotypical attributes associated with STEM fields (Eagly & Wood, 2012). Goal fit involves the alignment between an individual's personal goals and the opportunities provided by a particular environment. Women may perceive a lack of goal fit in STEM fields if they believe that these fields do not offer opportunities for work-life balance or align with their values (Diekman, Brown, Johnston, & Clark, 2010). Social fit pertains to the extent to which individuals feel accepted and included within a social group or environment. Gender stereotypes can negatively impact women's social fit by fostering a culture of exclusion and marginalization in STEM fields (Murphy, Steele, & Gross, 2007). Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach that targets organizational and educational cultures at the institutional, interpersonal, and individual levels. Interventions aimed at increasing women's representation in STEM should focus on challenging and changing gender stereotypes, promoting inclusive practices, and providing support and mentorship for women in these fields (Moss-Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, & Handelsman, 2012). Additionally, efforts should be made to create environments that foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for women, thereby enhancing their self-concept fit, goal fit, and social fit in STEM (Walton & Cohen, 2011). In conclusion, while progress has been made in increasing women's interest and involvement in STEM, significant barriers remain. Understanding the psychological factors that contribute to women's lower fit and inclusion in these fields is crucial for developing effective interventions and creating more equitable and inclusive STEM environments.", "References": [{"title": "Understanding current causes of women's underrepresentation in science", "authors": "Stephen J.
