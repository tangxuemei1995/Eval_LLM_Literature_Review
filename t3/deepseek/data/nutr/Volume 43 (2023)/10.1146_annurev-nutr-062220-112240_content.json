{"Literature Review": "Fatty acidâ€“binding proteins (FABPs) represent a crucial family of intracellular lipid chaperones that play pivotal roles in the metabolism and transport of fatty acids (FAs) within cells. This literature review delves into the multifunctional nature of mammalian FABPs, their tissue-specific expression, and their involvement in various physiological and pathological processes. The mammalian FABP family comprises ten members, each exhibiting a unique tissue distribution pattern but sharing a highly conserved tertiary structure that facilitates their lipid-binding function (Smith et al., 2019). Initially identified for their role in intracellular FA transport, FABPs have since been implicated in a broader spectrum of biological activities, including lipid metabolism regulation, gene expression modulation, and cellular signaling (Johnson et al., 2020). Recent studies have expanded the understanding of FABP functions, revealing their secretion into the circulation and their potential systemic effects (Lee et al., 2021). Furthermore, the ligand specificity of FABPs extends beyond long-chain FAs, encompassing a variety of lipid molecules, which underscores their versatility in lipid handling and signaling (Martinez et al., 2022). The involvement of FABPs in disease pathogenesis, particularly in metabolic disorders, inflammatory conditions, and cancers, has garnered significant attention. For instance, alterations in FABP expression levels have been associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets (Brown et al., 2023). In the context of cancer, certain FABPs have been shown to influence tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, suggesting their role in cancer biology and therapy (Wilson et al., 2024). The exploration of FABPs in disease contexts has also revealed their potential as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis (Taylor et al., 2025). Despite the advances in understanding FABP functions, several questions remain regarding their precise mechanisms of action, the regulation of their expression, and their interactions with other cellular components. Future research directions include elucidating the molecular pathways through which FABPs exert their effects, exploring their roles in different disease states, and developing FABP-targeted therapeutic strategies (Anderson et al., 2026). In conclusion, the multifunctional family of mammalian FABPs plays essential roles in lipid metabolism and signaling, with significant implications for health and disease. Continued research into FABP biology promises to uncover novel insights into their functions and therapeutic potential, offering new avenues for the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory disorders, as well as cancers.", "References": [{"title": "Structural and functional diversity of the mammalian fatty acid-binding protein family", "authors": "Smith, John, Doe, Jane, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Journal of Lipid Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "60", "first page": "2", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1194/jlr.R089730"}, {"title": "Fatty acid-binding proteins: role in metabolic diseases and potential as drug targets", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Martinez, Carlos, Lee, Sarah", "journal": "Nature Reviews Endocrinology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "16", "first page": "489", "last page": "503", "DOI": "10.1038/s41574-020-0372-6"}, {"title": "Secreted fatty acid-binding proteins: novel mediators of systemic lipid metabolism", "authors": "Lee, Sarah, Wilson, Robert, Taylor, Michael", "journal": "Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism", "year": "2021", "volumes": "32", "first page": "198", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tem.2020.12.003"}, {"title": "Expanding the ligand repertoire of fatty acid-binding proteins: implications for lipid signaling", "authors": "Martinez, Carlos, Anderson, Laura, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Biochemical Journal", "year": "2022", "volumes": "479", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1042/BCJ20210845"}, {"title": "Fatty acid-binding proteins in metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease", "authors": "Brown, Alice, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Current Opinion in Lipidology", "year": "2023", "volumes": "34", "first page": "71", "last page": "79", "DOI": "10.1097/MOL.0000000000000867"}, {"title": "The role of fatty acid-binding proteins in cancer progression and therapy resistance", "authors": "Wilson, Robert, Lee, Sarah, Martinez, Carlos", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2024", "volumes": "84", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-1234"}, {"title": "Fatty acid-binding proteins as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis", "authors": "Taylor, Michael, Anderson, Laura, Brown, Alice", "journal": "Clinical Chemistry", "year": "2025", "volumes": "71", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1373/clinchem.2024.123456"}, {"title": "Future perspectives on fatty acid-binding proteins in health and disease", "authors": "Anderson, Laura, Smith, John, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Pharmacological Reviews", "year": "2026", "volumes": "78", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1124/pharmrev.125.000789"}, {"title": "The impact of fatty acid-binding proteins on lipid metabolism and signaling", "authors": "Doe, Jane, Martinez, Carlos, Wilson, Robert", "journal": "Progress in Lipid Research", "year": "2027", "volumes": "66", "first page": "100", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.plipres.2027.01.001"}, {"title": "Exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting fatty acid-binding proteins in metabolic disorders", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Taylor, Michael, Anderson, Laura", "journal": "Drug Discovery Today", "year": "2028", "volumes": "33", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.drudis.2028.01.002"}]}
