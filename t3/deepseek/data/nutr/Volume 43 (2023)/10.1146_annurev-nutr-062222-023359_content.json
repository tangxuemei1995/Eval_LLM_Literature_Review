{"Literature Review": "Nutrition security, an emerging concept distinct from food security, has garnered increasing attention in the United States due to its critical role in promoting healthy dietary intake and outcomes. While food security focuses on the availability and access to sufficient food, nutrition security emphasizes the quality of food and its nutritional adequacy to meet dietary needs for a healthy life. This literature review explores the existing research on nutrition security, its relationship with food security and diet quality, and proposes a conceptual framework for understanding and measuring nutrition security. The US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service has been pivotal in advancing research on food security, providing a foundation for exploring the nuances of nutrition security. However, the absence of a standardized conceptualization or measure of nutrition security poses challenges for its assessment and monitoring. This review identifies two primary constructs of nutrition security: healthy diets and nutritional status, each comprising multiple subconstructs that collectively form the basis of nutrition security. Healthy diets refer to the consumption of a variety of foods in appropriate quantities to meet nutritional needs, while nutritional status pertains to the physiological outcomes of dietary intake, such as body weight, nutrient levels, and overall health. The proposed framework aims to elucidate how nutrition security arises and differs from food security, underscore the importance of its assessment and monitoring, and guide future research to clarify its meaning and measurement. The relationship between nutrition security and food security is complex, as food security is a necessary but not sufficient condition for nutrition security. Studies have shown that individuals in food-secure households may still experience poor nutrition due to the consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, highlighting the need for a distinct focus on nutrition security. Furthermore, diet quality, a key component of nutrition security, has been linked to various health outcomes, including reduced risk of chronic diseases and improved mental health. Research indicates that disparities in nutrition security exist across different demographic groups, with low-income and minority populations being particularly vulnerable. These disparities underscore the importance of targeted interventions to improve access to nutritious foods and promote healthy dietary behaviors. The assessment and monitoring of nutrition security are crucial for identifying at-risk populations, evaluating the effectiveness of nutrition interventions, and informing policy decisions. However, the lack of standardized measures complicates these efforts. Existing measures of diet quality, such as the Healthy Eating Index, provide valuable insights but do not fully capture the multidimensional nature of nutrition security. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive measures that encompass both dietary intake and nutritional status, as well as the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence nutrition security. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed to understand the temporal dynamics of nutrition security and its impact on health outcomes over time. The integration of nutrition security into public health policies and programs is essential for addressing the root causes of poor nutrition and promoting equitable access to healthy diets. In conclusion, nutrition security is a critical yet understudied aspect of public health that warrants greater attention. By advancing our understanding of nutrition security and its determinants, we can develop more effective strategies to improve dietary intake and health outcomes in the United States.", "References": [{"title": "Food Security in the U.S.", "authors": "Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Matthew P.
