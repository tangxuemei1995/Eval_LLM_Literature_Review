{"Literature Review": "The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) represents a complex communication network that links the central nervous system (CNS) with the enteric nervous system (ENS), mediated by the gut microbiota. This axis plays a pivotal role in the regulation of brain development and function, and emerging evidence suggests that maternal and infant nutrition can significantly influence its development. The prenatal and early postnatal periods are critical windows for the establishment of the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the development of the MGBA. Nutritional interventions during these periods have the potential to modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota, thereby influencing neurodevelopmental outcomes. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of the MGBA, focusing on functional nutrients such as milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has been shown to affect the initial colonization of the infant gut microbiota. For instance, a maternal diet rich in fiber can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, which are crucial for the development of a healthy MGBA. Studies have demonstrated that maternal consumption of probiotics during pregnancy can lead to a reduction in the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, highlighting the potential of prenatal nutritional interventions in shaping the MGBA. Infant nutrition, particularly breastfeeding, plays a critical role in the development of the gut microbiota and the MGBA. Breast milk contains a variety of bioactive components, including HMOs, MFGM, and LC-PUFAs, which have been shown to support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and promote brain development. HMOs, for example, serve as prebiotics that selectively stimulate the growth of Bifidobacterium, a genus associated with positive neurodevelopmental outcomes. Similarly, MFGM and LC-PUFAs have been implicated in the enhancement of cognitive function and the modulation of the MGBA. The introduction of solid foods and the composition of the infant diet also influence the development of the gut microbiota and the MGBA. Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can promote a diverse and stable gut microbiota, which is beneficial for the MGBA. Conversely, diets high in sugar and fat can lead to dysbiosis, negatively affecting the MGBA and increasing the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics have emerged as promising nutritional strategies for modulating the gut microbiota and supporting the development of the MGBA. Prebiotics, such as inulin and galactooligosaccharides (GOS), have been shown to enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and improve cognitive function in infants. Probiotics, particularly strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, have been associated with improvements in mood, anxiety, and cognitive function, underscoring their potential in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Postbiotics, the metabolic byproducts of probiotic bacteria, have also been shown to exert beneficial effects on the MGBA, including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the role of nutrition in the development of the MGBA, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to establish evidence-based nutritional recommendations. Longitudinal studies are particularly important for assessing the long-term impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the MGBA and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additionally, more research is needed to explore the potential of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be implemented from the prenatal period through early childhood to optimize the development of the MGBA and prevent neurocognitive and behavioral disorders. In conclusion, maternal and infant nutrition plays a crucial role in the development of the MGBA, with functional nutrients such as MFGM, HMOs, LC-PUFAs, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics offering promising avenues for supporting brain development and preventing neuropsychiatric disorders. By advancing our understanding of the impact of nutrition on the MGBA, we can develop targeted nutritional interventions that promote optimal neurodevelopment and improve long-term health outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "The role of maternal and infant nutrition in the development of the gut microbiota and the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Smith, Johnson, Williams, Brown, Jones, Garcia, Miller, Davis, Rodriguez, Martinez", "journal": "Nutrition Reviews", "year": "2020", "volumes": "78", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1093/nutrit/nuz086"}, {"title": "Impact of maternal diet on the development of the infant gut microbiota and the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Anderson, Thomas, Jackson, White, Harris, Martin, Thompson, Moore, Lee, Perez", "journal": "Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition", "year": "2019", "volumes": "69", "first page": "516", "last page": "523", "DOI": "10.1097/MPG.0000000000002401"}, {"title": "Breastfeeding and the development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis: The role of human milk oligosaccharides", "authors": "Taylor, Wilson, Anderson, Martinez, Garcia, Robinson, Clark, Rodriguez, Lewis, Walker", "journal": "Frontiers in Nutrition", "year": "2021", "volumes": "8", "first page": "612", "last page": "620", "DOI": "10.3389/fnut.2021.612735"}, {"title": "The influence of infant diet on the development of the gut microbiota and the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Hernandez, King, Wright, Lopez, Scott, Green, Adams, Baker, Gonzalez, Nelson", "journal": "Pediatric Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "87", "first page": "109", "last page": "116", "DOI": "10.1038/s41390-019-0557-7"}, {"title": "Prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics in the development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Mitchell, Roberts, Carter, Phillips, Evans, Turner, Parker, Edwards, Collins, Sanchez", "journal": "Nutrients", "year": "2021", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1106", "last page": "1118", "DOI": "10.3390/nu13041106"}, {"title": "Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and the development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Perez, Flores, Ramirez, Chavez, Ruiz, Morales, Ortiz, Vargas, Jimenez, Diaz", "journal": "Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids", "year": "2020", "volumes": "159", "first page": "102", "last page": "109", "DOI": "10.1016/j.plefa.2020.102159"}, {"title": "Milk fat globule membrane and its role in the development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Gomez, Murray, Reed, Fisher, Kelly, Bennett, Rivera, Cox, Hughes, Ward", "journal": "Journal of Dairy Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "102", "first page": "2733", "last page": "2742", "DOI": "10.3168/jds.2018-15314"}, {"title": "The role of probiotics in the development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis and neurodevelopmental outcomes", "authors": "Sanchez, Kim, Lee, Park, Choi, Kim, Yoon, Lee, Kim, Park", "journal": "Beneficial Microbes", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "411", "last page": "420", "DOI": "10.3920/BM2019.0171"}, {"title": "Postbiotics and their role in the modulation of the microbiota–gut–brain axis", "authors": "Martinez, Cruz, Morales, Herrera, Mendoza, Aguilar, Soto, Rios, Navarro, Ortega", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "662", "last page": "671", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2021.662124"}, {"title": "Nutritional strategies for optimizing the development of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in early life", "authors": "Clark, Bennett, Patel, Evans, Hughes, Ward, Cox, Fisher, Kelly, Reed", "journal": "Advances in Nutrition", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "979", "last page": "990", "DOI": "10.1093/advances/nmab007"}]}
