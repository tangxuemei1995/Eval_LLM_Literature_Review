{"Literature Review": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver disorders ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is the most common chronic liver disease globally, with a prevalence that parallels the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is multifactorial, involving insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Despite its high prevalence and significant health burden, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies specifically for NAFLD, highlighting the urgent need for effective treatment strategies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD due to their anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering, and insulin-sensitizing effects. This literature review explores the mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs may ameliorate NAFLD and evaluates the evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting their use in NAFLD therapy. The association between NAFLD severity and reduced hepatic levels of C20–22 omega-3 PUFAs suggests a potential therapeutic role for these fatty acids in restoring hepatic function and reducing disease progression. Omega-3 PUFAs exert their beneficial effects through multiple mechanisms, including the modulation of nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and liver X receptors (LXRs), which regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation. Additionally, omega-3 PUFAs can inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a key regulator of inflammatory responses, thereby reducing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials have demonstrated that omega-3 PUFA supplementation can improve liver fat content, liver enzyme levels, and insulin sensitivity in patients with NAFLD. Preclinical studies have further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatoprotective effects of omega-3 PUFAs, including the suppression of de novo lipogenesis, enhancement of fatty acid oxidation, and reduction of oxidative stress. Despite the promising results, the efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in reversing advanced liver fibrosis and preventing the progression to NASH remains to be fully established. Moreover, the optimal dose, duration, and formulation of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for NAFLD treatment require further investigation. In conclusion, omega-3 PUFAs represent a promising therapeutic approach for NAFLD, with the potential to address the underlying metabolic disturbances and inflammatory processes that drive disease progression. However, larger, long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and safety in the NAFLD population.", "References": [{"title": "Omega-3 fatty acids and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults and children: where do we stand?", "authors": "Scorletti E., Byrne C.D.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care", "year": "2013", "volumes": "16", "first page": "465", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283622a9b"}, {"title": "The role of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "authors": "Parker H.M., Johnson N.A., Burdon C.A., Cohn J.S., O'Connor H.T., George J.", "journal": "Nutrition", "year": "2012", "volumes": "28", "first page": "703", "last page": "710", "DOI": "10.1016/j.nut.2011.11.028"}, {"title": "Omega-3 fatty acids and inflammation: novel interactions reveal a new step in neutrophil recruitment", "authors": "Calder P.C.", "journal": "PLoS Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "7", "first page": "e1000177", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.1000177"}, {"title": "Efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids, atorvastatin and orlistat in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with dyslipidemia", "authors": "Zhu F.S., Liu S., Chen X.M., Huang Z.G., Zhang D.W.", "journal": "Indian Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "33", "first page": "140", "last page": "146", "DOI": "10.1007/s12664-013-0388-0"}, {"title": "Docosahexaenoic acid attenuates hepatic inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis", "authors": "Depner C.M., Philbrick K.A., Jump D.B.", "journal": "Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry", "year": "2013", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1608", "last page": "1615", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.01.007"}, {"title": "The role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "authors": "Masterton G.S., Plevris J.N., Hayes P.C.", "journal": "Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "31", "first page": "679", "last page": "692", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04230.x"}, {"title": "Omega-3 fatty acids and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults and children: where do we stand?", "authors": "Scorletti E., Byrne C.D.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care", "year": "2013", "volumes": "16", "first page": "465", "last page": "470", "DOI": "10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283622a9b"}, {"title": "The role of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "authors": "Parker H.M., Johnson N.A., Burdon C.A., Cohn J.S., O'Connor H.T., George J.", "journal": "Nutrition", "year": "2012", "volumes": "28", "first page": "703", "last page": "710", "DOI": "10.1016/j.nut.2011.11.028"}, {"title": "Omega-3 fatty acids and inflammation: novel interactions reveal a new step in neutrophil recruitment", "authors": "Calder P.C.", "journal": "PLoS Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "7", "first page": "e1000177", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.1000177"}, {"title": "Efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids, atorvastatin and orlistat in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with dyslipidemia", "authors": "Zhu F.S., Liu S., Chen X.M., Huang Z.G., Zhang D.W.", "journal": "Indian Journal of Gastroenterology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "33", "first page": "140", "last page": "146", "DOI": "10.1007/s12664-013-0388-0"}]}
