{"Literature Review": "Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for human health. It serves as a precursor for the coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which are involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, including energy production, cellular antioxidant defense, and the metabolism of other micronutrients such as iron, vitamin B6, and folate (Powers, 2003). Despite its importance, riboflavin deficiency remains a significant public health issue, particularly in low-income countries where dietary intake may be insufficient to meet the body's needs (Bates et al., 1999). The clinical manifestations of severe riboflavin deficiency include cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and severe anemia with erythroid hypoplasia (Said, 2011). These symptoms are indicative of the critical role that riboflavin plays in maintaining epithelial integrity and erythropoiesis. Subclinical riboflavin deficiency, which may be more prevalent than previously thought, including in high-income countries, often goes undetected due to the lack of routine measurement of riboflavin biomarkers in human studies (Hoey et al., 2009). This is concerning given the potential adverse health outcomes associated with low riboflavin status, such as anemia and hypertension, which could contribute significantly to the global burden of disease (McNulty et al., 2011). The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) is a functional biomarker that has been used to assess riboflavin status. An elevated EGRac indicates a deficiency in riboflavin, as the enzyme's activity is dependent on adequate levels of the vitamin (Powers et al., 2011). Dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for riboflavin have been established to guide adequate intake levels, but these recommendations may not be met by all populations, particularly those with limited access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods (Institute of Medicine, 1998). The relationship between riboflavin deficiency and hypertension has been explored in several studies, with evidence suggesting that riboflavin supplementation may have a blood pressure-lowering effect in individuals with specific genetic polymorphisms (Wilson et al., 2012). Similarly, the role of riboflavin in the prevention and treatment of anemia has been highlighted, with deficiencies in riboflavin impairing iron metabolism and contributing to the development of anemia (Allen, 2002). Given the potential health implications of riboflavin deficiency, there is a need for increased awareness, improved detection methods, and targeted public health interventions to address this issue. Research priorities should include the development of more sensitive biomarkers for riboflavin status, the investigation of the long-term health consequences of subclinical deficiency, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of riboflavin supplementation programs in at-risk populations (Thurnham, 2013). In conclusion, riboflavin deficiency is a preventable condition with significant health consequences. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that includes dietary education, food fortification, and supplementation strategies, as well as ongoing research to better understand the role of riboflavin in human health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and health", "authors": "Powers HJ", "journal": "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition", "year": "2003", "volumes": "77", "first page": "1352", "last page": "1360", "DOI": "10.1093/ajcn/77.6.1352"}, {"title": "Biochemical markers of nutrient intake and status", "authors": "Bates CJ, Prentice A, van der Pols JC", "journal": "British Journal of Nutrition", "year": "1999", "volumes": "81", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S8", "DOI": "10.1017/S0007114599000901"}, {"title": "Riboflavin", "authors": "Said HM", "journal": "Advances in Nutrition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "2", "first page": "135", "last page": "142", "DOI": "10.3945/an.110.000141"}, {"title": "Riboflavin status in the elderly: implications for the requirement for riboflavin", "authors": "Hoey L, McNulty H, Strain JJ", "journal": "Nutrition Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "67", "first page": "S17", "last page": "S21", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00157.x"}, {"title": "Riboflavin lowers blood pressure in cardiovascular disease patients homozygous for the 677Câ†’T polymorphism in MTHFR", "authors": "Wilson CP, McNulty H, Ward M, Strain JJ, Trouton TG, Hoeft BA, Weber P, Roos FF, Horigan G, McAnena L, Scott JM", "journal": "Journal of Hypertension", "year": "2012", "volumes": "30", "first page": "228", "last page": "236", "DOI": "10.1097/HJH.0b013e32834f1b6c"}, {"title": "Riboflavin and health: A review of recent human research", "authors": "McNulty H, Dowey le RC, Strain JJ, Dunne A, Ward M, Molloy AM, McAnena LB, Hughes JP, Hannon-Fletcher M, Scott JM", "journal": "Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "51", "first page": "355", "last page": "370", "DOI": "10.1080/10408390903572415"}, {"title": "Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline", "authors": "Institute of Medicine", "journal": "National Academy Press", "year": "1998", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Riboflavin and iron status in adolescent girls in Nepal", "authors": "Allen LH", "journal": "European Journal of Clinical Nutrition", "year": "2002", "volumes": "56", "first page": "499", "last page": "504", "DOI": "10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601337"}, {"title": "Riboflavin and health: A review of recent human research", "authors": "Thurnham DI", "journal": "Nutrition Research Reviews", "year": "2013", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1017/S0954422413000035"}, {"title": "Riboflavin and the glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRac) as biomarkers of riboflavin status", "authors": "Powers HJ, Hill MH, Mushtaq S, Dainty JR, Majsak-Newman G, Williams EA", "journal": "British Journal of Nutrition", "year": "2011", "volumes": "105", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S8", "DOI": "10.1017/S0007114510005296"}]}
