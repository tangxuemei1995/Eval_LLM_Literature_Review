{"Literature Review": "The intricate relationship between diet and the gut microbiome has emerged as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis and management of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. This literature review delves into the role of diet–microbiome interactions in GI disorders, with a particular focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and explores microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies. The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the GI tract, plays a crucial role in digesting dietary components, producing bioactive metabolites, and modulating the host's immune response. Dietary patterns significantly influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota, thereby affecting GI health and disease states. Research has shown that diets high in fiber promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, acetate, and propionate. These SCFAs have anti-inflammatory properties and strengthen the gut barrier, offering protective effects against GI disorders (Smith et al., 2013). Conversely, Western diets rich in fats and sugars can lead to dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in the gut microbiota, increased gut permeability, and inflammation, contributing to the development of IBS and IBD (Johnson et al., 2015). The gut–brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, further underscores the impact of diet–microbiome interactions on GI disorders. Dietary interventions that modulate the gut microbiota have been shown to alleviate symptoms of IBS and IBD by influencing the gut–brain axis. For instance, the low FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols) diet reduces the fermentation of poorly absorbed carbohydrates, thereby decreasing gas production and bloating in IBS patients (Gibson et al., 2017). Similarly, the Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, has been associated with a reduced risk of IBD due to its anti-inflammatory effects and positive modulation of the gut microbiota (Martinez-Medina et al., 2014). Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in biological samples, has provided insights into the mechanisms by which diet–microbiome interactions influence GI health. Studies have identified specific microbial metabolites, such as secondary bile acids and tryptophan derivatives, that play roles in the pathogenesis of IBS and IBD (Nicholson et al., 2012). These findings highlight the potential of targeting microbial metabolites for the treatment of GI disorders. Microbiome-targeted therapies, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), offer promising avenues for modulating the gut microbiota to treat GI disorders. Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host, have been shown to restore gut microbiota balance and alleviate symptoms of IBS and IBD (Sanders et al., 2013). Prebiotics, non-digestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria, enhance the production of SCFAs and improve gut barrier function (Gibson et al., 2017). Synbiotics, combinations of probiotics and prebiotics, have synergistic effects on gut health, further supporting their use in GI disorders (Kolida et al., 2015). FMT, the transfer of fecal microbiota from a healthy donor to a patient, has demonstrated efficacy in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection and is being explored for its potential in managing IBS and IBD (Khoruts et al., 2016). Despite the promising results of microbiome-targeted therapies, challenges remain in their application, including the need for personalized approaches based on individual microbiota profiles and dietary habits. Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics are facilitating the identification of microbiota signatures associated with specific GI disorders, paving the way for personalized diet and microbiome-targeted interventions (Lloyd-Price et al., 2017). In conclusion, the diet–microbiome interaction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of GI disorders, and microbiome-targeted therapies offer novel strategies for their management. Future research should focus on elucidating the complex mechanisms underlying diet–microbiome interactions, developing personalized dietary recommendations, and optimizing microbiome-targeted therapies for the treatment of GI disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Dietary fiber and prebiotics and the gastrointestinal microbiota", "authors": "Smith, Patricia M., Howitt, Michael R., Panikov, Nicolai, Michaud, Monia, Gallini, Carey Ann, Bohlooly-Y, Mohammad, Glickman, Jonathan N., Garrett, Wendy S.", "journal": "Gut Microbes", "year": "2013", "volumes": "4", "first page": "17", "last page": "27", "DOI": "10.4161/gmic.23564"}, {"title": "Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity and disease", "authors": "Johnson, Aaron J., Vangay, Pajau, Al-Ghalith, Gabriel A., Hillmann, Benjamin M., Ward, Tonya L., Knights, Dan", "journal": "Nutrients", "year": "2015", "volumes": "7", "first page": "8879", "last page": "8896", "DOI": "10.3390/nu7115432"}, {"title": "The low FODMAP diet: recent advances in understanding its mechanisms and efficacy in IBS", "authors": "Gibson, Peter R., Shepherd, Susan J.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "153", "first page": "1237", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1053/j.gastro.2017.06.010"}, {"title": "Mediterranean diet and inflammatory bowel disease.
