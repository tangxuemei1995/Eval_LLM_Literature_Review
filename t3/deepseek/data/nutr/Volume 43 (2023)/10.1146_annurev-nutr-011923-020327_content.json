{"Literature Review": "The use of dietary supplements (DS) has become increasingly prevalent, with a significant portion of the population incorporating them into their daily routines for health maintenance and disease prevention. Despite their widespread use, there remains a considerable gap in understanding the best methodologies for assessing DS intake and its implications for health and disease. This literature review aims to explore the current state of research on the validity and reproducibility of DS assessment instruments, highlighting the major gaps and the need for further investigation. The assessment of DS intake is crucial for accurate exposure classification in nutritional research, which seeks to elucidate the relationship between diet and health outcomes. However, the complexity of DS use, including the variety of products, dosages, and frequencies, poses significant challenges for researchers. A review of the literature reveals a limited number of studies that have examined the validity and reproducibility of DS assessment methods. These studies have employed various instruments, including product inventories, questionnaires, and 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR), to measure DS use. The absence of a gold standard reference method for validating DS use has led researchers to choose their own reference instruments, complicating comparisons across studies. Despite these challenges, some findings have emerged. Self-administered questionnaires have shown good agreement with 24HR and inventory methods in assessing the prevalence of commonly used DSs. The inventory method, in particular, has been found to capture nutrient amounts more accurately than other methods. Additionally, the reproducibility of prevalence of use estimates on questionnaires over periods ranging from 3 months to 2.4 years has been deemed acceptable for common DSs. However, the limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment means that only tentative conclusions can be drawn at present. The variability in study designs, reference methods, and populations further complicates the interpretation of findings. This underscores the critical need for further research to advance knowledge in DS assessment for both research and monitoring purposes. Future studies should aim to standardize assessment methods, explore the impact of measurement error on health outcomes, and investigate the use of DSs in diverse populations. By addressing these gaps, researchers can improve the accuracy of DS assessment and enhance our understanding of the role of DSs in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Dietary supplement use among US adults has increased since NHANES III (1988–1994)", "authors": "Reginald D.
