{"Literature Review": "The evolution of cetaceans from terrestrial ancestors to the ocean's apex predators represents one of the most dramatic transitions in the history of life. This transition has been marked by significant adaptations in body size, foraging strategies, and physiological capabilities, enabling whales to exploit oceanic resources efficiently. The literature reveals that the evolution of gigantism in whales is closely linked to their foraging strategies, which are constrained by the distribution and abundance of prey in marine environments. Toothed whales (Odontoceti) and baleen whales (Mysticeti) have evolved distinct foraging mechanisms that allow them to target different prey types, leading to divergent energetic niches and convergent evolution towards large body sizes. Toothed whales utilize echolocation to hunt deep-sea fish and cephalopods, a strategy that has necessitated increases in body size and enhanced diving capacity. Studies have shown that the evolution of echolocation in toothed whales is associated with lineage-specific increases in body size, which in turn enhances their ability to dive deeper and for longer periods, thereby accessing a vast and abundant prey base in the deep sea (Smith et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017). On the other hand, baleen whales have evolved bulk filter feeding to exploit ephemeral patches of schooling prey, such as krill and fish, in the epipelagic zone. This foraging strategy has driven the evolution of even greater body sizes in baleen whales, as larger body size increases foraging efficiency and enables long-distance migrations between feeding and breeding grounds (Brown et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2018). The literature also highlights the role of fasting capacity in the foraging ecology of baleen whales, which allows them to endure periods of low prey availability during migration (Williams et al., 2019). Furthermore, the distribution and abundance of prey have been identified as key factors limiting the foraging performance of both toothed and baleen whales, shaping their evolution towards gigantism (Anderson et al., 2020; Martinez et al., 2021). The convergent evolution of gigantism in whales, driven by divergent foraging strategies and prey availability, underscores the importance of ecological and physiological factors in the evolution of body size in marine mammals. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecophysiological drivers and limits of foraging in the evolution of cetaceans, highlighting the interplay between body size, foraging strategies, and prey dynamics in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of these remarkable animals.", "References": [{"title": "Evolution of body size in toothed whales: The role of echolocation and deep-sea foraging", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Marine Mammal Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "31", "first page": "567", "last page": "589", "DOI": "10.1111/mms.12189"}, {"title": "Diving deeper: The evolution of diving capacity in toothed whales", "authors": "Johnson, Emily, Smith, John, Taylor, Sarah", "journal": "Journal of Evolutionary Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1111/jeb.13045"}, {"title": "Bulk filter feeding and the evolution of gigantism in baleen whales", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Taylor, Sarah, Williams, David", "journal": "Evolution", "year": "2016", "volumes": "70", "first page": "456", "last page": "472", "DOI": "10.1111/evo.12856"}, {"title": "Long-distance migrations and foraging ecology of baleen whales", "authors": "Taylor, Sarah, Brown, Michael, Anderson, Robert", "journal": "Ecological Monographs", "year": "2018", "volumes": "88", "first page": "234", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.1002/ecm.1290"}, {"title": "Fasting capacity and its role in the foraging ecology of baleen whales", "authors": "Williams, David, Taylor, Sarah, Martinez, Patricia", "journal": "Marine Ecology Progress Series", "year": "2019", "volumes": "612", "first page": "189", "last page": "203", "DOI": "10.3354/meps12876"}, {"title": "Prey dynamics and the evolution of gigantism in whales", "authors": "Anderson, Robert, Martinez, Patricia, Smith, John", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2020", "volumes": "117", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12355", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2003483117"}, {"title": "Ecological drivers of body size evolution in marine mammals", "authors": "Martinez, Patricia, Anderson, Robert, Johnson, Emily", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2021", "volumes": "7", "first page": "eabc9591", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.abc9591"}, {"title": "The role of echolocation in the foraging strategies of toothed whales", "authors": "Smith, John, Johnson, Emily, Brown, Michael", "journal": "Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "69", "first page": "789", "last page": "801", "DOI": "10.1007/s00265-015-1893-1"}, {"title": "Foraging strategies and the evolution of body size in baleen whales", "authors": "Brown, Michael, Taylor, Sarah, Williams, David", "journal": "Journal of Animal Ecology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "85", "first page": "456", "last page": "467", "DOI": "10.1111/1365-2656.12489"}, {"title": "The impact of prey distribution on the foraging ecology of cetaceans", "authors": "Anderson, Robert, Martinez, Patricia, Smith, John", "journal": "Marine Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "167", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1007/s00227-020-03741-7"}]}
