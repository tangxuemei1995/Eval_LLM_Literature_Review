{"Literature Review": "The study of functional trait variation along animal invasion pathways is an emerging field that holds significant promise for understanding the mechanisms behind biological invasions. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of functional traits in mediating animal invasions, drawing parallels with the more established field of plant invasion biology. Functional traits, defined as morphological, physiological, or phenological characteristics measurable at the individual level, have been shown to influence the success of invasive species across different stages of the invasion process, from introduction to establishment and spread. Recent advancements in scaling traits to ecosystems and integrating frameworks from invasion ecology have provided a robust foundation for investigating these processes. However, despite the growing body of empirical research, there remains a notable gap in interspecific comparisons that incorporate comparative phylogenetic approaches, and even fewer studies examine trait variation within assemblages. Additionally, the critical factor of time since introduction is often overlooked in studies, despite its potential to significantly influence invasion outcomes. Research has identified several key traits associated with successful invaders, including broad environmental tolerances, life history traits conducive to rapid growth or increased reproduction, and, in some cases, greater phenotypic plasticity. These traits enable invasive species to adapt to new environments, exploit available resources, and outcompete native species. However, it is important to note that introduction effort, or the number of individuals introduced, remains one of the most significant factors affecting the success of invasive species. This review highlights the need for further research that incorporates phylogenetic and assemblage-level analyses, as well as the temporal dimension of invasions, to fully understand the role of functional traits in animal invasions. By addressing these gaps, future studies can provide more comprehensive insights into the mechanisms driving biological invasions and inform more effective management strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Functional traits explain variation in plant life history strategies", "authors": "Daniel S.
