{"Literature Review": "The study of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics has traditionally focused on the upper soil layers, where the majority of biological activity occurs. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of deep SOC, defined as carbon stored below 20 cm, in the global carbon cycle. Over 70% of SOC is stored in these deep layers, and a significant portion of this carbon actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales, making it sensitive to global change drivers such as warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change (LULCC) (Schmidt et al., 2011). Despite its importance, the response of deep SOC to these drivers is not well understood, primarily because most global change studies and experiments focus on surface soils. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on deep SOC responses to global change, identifies gaps in our understanding, and calls for more comprehensive research that includes deep soils in manipulations, measurements, and models. Warming is one of the most significant global change drivers affecting SOC dynamics. While surface soils are expected to lose carbon due to increased microbial activity and decomposition rates under warming, the response of deep SOC is less clear. Some studies suggest that deep SOC may be more stable and less responsive to temperature changes due to stronger mineral associations and reduced microbial activity (Davidson & Janssens, 2006). However, other research indicates that deep SOC could be vulnerable to warming, especially in permafrost regions where thawing can release large amounts of previously frozen carbon (Schuur et al., 2015). Shifting precipitation patterns, another consequence of global change, can also impact deep SOC. Increased precipitation can enhance carbon inputs to deep soils through leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from surface layers, while decreased precipitation can reduce these inputs and potentially increase deep SOC stability (Kindler et al., 2011). However, the net effect of changing precipitation on deep SOC remains uncertain, as it depends on complex interactions between soil moisture, microbial activity, and carbon transport processes. Elevated CO2 levels, a key driver of climate change, can influence deep SOC through changes in plant productivity and root dynamics. Increased CO2 can stimulate plant growth and root exudation, potentially increasing carbon inputs to deep soils (Iversen et al., 2012). However, the extent to which these inputs are stabilized in deep SOC pools versus being respired back to the atmosphere is not well understood. Additionally, elevated CO2 can alter soil microbial communities and their activity, which could further impact deep SOC dynamics (Carney et al., 2007). Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is another critical factor affecting deep SOC. Conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural lands often leads to a loss of SOC, including deep SOC, due to tillage and reduced carbon inputs (Don et al., 2011). Conversely, afforestation and reforestation can increase deep SOC stocks over time as new vegetation establishes and contributes to soil carbon pools (Post & Kwon, 2000). However, the long-term effects of LULCC on deep SOC are still poorly quantified, and more research is needed to understand how different land management practices influence deep carbon storage. In conclusion, while deep SOC represents a significant portion of the global carbon stock, its response to global change drivers is not well understood. Most studies and experiments focus on surface soils, leaving deep SOC dynamics largely unexplored. To improve our understanding and accurately predict the role of soils in climate change mitigation and feedbacks, it is essential to incorporate deep soils into global change research. This includes developing new methods for manipulating and measuring deep SOC, as well as integrating deep soil processes into carbon cycle models. By doing so, we can better account for the response of deep SOC in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Persistence of soil organic matter as an ecosystem property", "authors": "Schmidt, Michael W.I., Torn, Margaret S., Abiven, Samuel, Dittmar, Thorsten, Guggenberger, Georg, Janssens, Ivan A., Kleber, Markus, Kögel-Knabner, Ingrid, Lehmann, Johannes, Manning, David A.C., Nannipieri, Paolo, Rasse, Daniel P., Weiner, Steve, Trumbore, Susan E.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "478", "first page": "49", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1038/nature10386"}, {"title": "Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change", "authors": "Davidson, Eric A., Janssens, Ivan A.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2006", "volumes": "440", "first page": "165", "last page": "173", "DOI": "10.1038/nature04514"}, {"title": "Climate change and the permafrost carbon feedback", "authors": "Schuur, Edward A.G., McGuire, A.
