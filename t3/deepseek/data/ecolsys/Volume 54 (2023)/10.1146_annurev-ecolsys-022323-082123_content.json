{"Literature Review": "The ocean, a vast and dynamic system, is undergoing significant changes due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, leading to increased temperatures and altered ecological dynamics. This literature review explores the critical role of temperature variability in marine ecosystems, focusing on the interplay between anthropogenic warming trends and natural fluctuations, and their combined effects on marine life. The increasing frequency and magnitude of marine heatwaves, a direct consequence of this interplay, pose significant challenges to marine organisms and ecosystems. However, the response to these changes is not uniform across different geographic locations, largely due to variations in temporal temperature variability. Organisms inhabiting environments with higher thermal variability often exhibit greater acclimatization and adaptation to temperature extremes, thereby reducing their sensitivity to anthropogenic heatwaves. This review underscores the importance of considering both the trend and variability in ocean temperatures to understand ecological responses to warming. It also highlights the significance of processes such as legacy effects and extinction debt in shaping the rate of community transformation in marine ecosystems. The literature suggests that depth refuges play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of surface warming, offering a buffer against temperature extremes for deep-sea organisms. Furthermore, acclimation processes enable some species to adjust to changing thermal conditions, although the capacity for acclimation varies widely among species. The concept of legacy effects emphasizes the long-term impacts of past environmental conditions on current ecological states, while extinction debt refers to the delayed extinction of species following environmental changes. Together, these processes influence the resilience and adaptability of marine communities to climate change. This review calls for a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between trend and variability in ocean temperatures to better predict and mitigate the ecological impacts of marine climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Marine heatwaves under global warming", "authors": "Oliver, Eric C.
