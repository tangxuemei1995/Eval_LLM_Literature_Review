{"Literature Review": "Information processing in the brain is a highly demanding process that requires a continuous supply of energy to neurons, which have limited energy reserves and restricted access to fuel sources. This review focuses on the phenomenon of metabolic recruitment, a tissue-level mechanism that ensures active neurons can efficiently harvest the necessary resources from their environment. The primary event in this process is the neuronal release of potassium ions (K+), which reflects the metabolic workload of the neuron (Attwell & Laughlin, 2001). Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, play a crucial role in sensing and responding to this K+ release. They are uniquely equipped with the coexpression of the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1) and the α2β2 isoform of the Na+/K+ ATPase, allowing them to detect changes in extracellular K+ levels with high sensitivity (Kang et al., 2004).\n\nAstrocytes respond to increased K+ levels by switching to Crabtree metabolism, a process characterized by the activation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), aerobic glycolysis, and a temporary suppression of mitochondrial respiration (Pellerin & Magistretti, 1994). This metabolic shift results in the production and subsequent export of lactate, which serves as a secondary recruiter. Lactate acts by inhibiting glucose consumption in distant cells, thereby ensuring that more glucose is available for active neurons (Suzuki et al., 2011). This lactate surge is a critical component of the metabolic recruitment process, as it helps to maintain a steady supply of energy substrates to the neurons that need them most.\n\nIn addition to K+ and lactate, other signaling molecules such as glutamate, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonium also play important roles in metabolic recruitment. Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, can activate astrocytic receptors and trigger the release of lactate and other metabolites (Jourdain et al., 2007). NO, a gaseous signaling molecule, can diffuse over longer distances and modulate blood flow, thereby enhancing the delivery of glucose and oxygen to active regions of the brain (Iadecola, 2017). Ammonium, a byproduct of amino acid metabolism, can also influence metabolic processes in both neurons and astrocytes, contributing to the overall regulation of energy supply (Bouzier-Sore et al., 2006).\n\nThe coordination of these various signaling molecules and metabolic pathways is essential for the efficient functioning of the brain. Metabolic recruitment works in concert with neurovascular coupling, a process by which increases in neural activity lead to localized increases in blood flow (Attwell & Iadecola, 2002). This coupling ensures that the increased demand for glucose and oxygen is met by a corresponding increase in the supply of these substrates. Furthermore, the brain employs various averaging strategies to manage the inordinate dynamic range of individual neurons, allowing for the sustained and efficient processing of information (Howarth et al., 2010).\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of metabolic recruitment is crucial for elucidating the complex interplay between neural activity and energy metabolism. This knowledge has implications for a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, where disruptions in metabolic processes can contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death (Verkhratsky et al., 2015). Future research in this area will likely focus on identifying new targets for therapeutic interventions that can enhance metabolic support for neurons and improve brain function in both health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "An energy budget for signaling in the grey matter of the brain", "authors": "D.
