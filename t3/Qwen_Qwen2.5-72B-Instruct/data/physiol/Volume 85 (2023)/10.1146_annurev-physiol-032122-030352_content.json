{"Literature Review": "Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) play multifaceted roles in cellular physiology, serving as structural components of plasma membranes, energy sources, and signaling molecules. Impaired FA uptake and signaling have been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. This review focuses on the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and signaling, specifically CD36 and the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) FFAR1 and FFAR4, and their physiological implications. CD36, a scavenger receptor, is a critical mediator of FA uptake in various tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the heart. CD36 facilitates the translocation of FAs across the plasma membrane, where they can be utilized for β-oxidation or stored as triglycerides. The importance of CD36 in FA metabolism is underscored by studies showing that CD36 deficiency leads to reduced FA uptake and altered lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, CD36 interacts with caveolin, a scaffolding protein that organizes lipid rafts and influences receptor clustering and signaling. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of CD36 in FA transport and signaling. In addition to its role in FA uptake, CD36 is involved in FA signaling pathways. Activation of CD36 can modulate intracellular signaling cascades, including those involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). These signaling pathways are essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. For instance, CD36-mediated activation of PI3K has been shown to enhance glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. FFAR1 (GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) are GPCRs that recognize long-chain FAs and play significant roles in FA signaling. FFAR1 is primarily expressed in pancreatic β-cells and intestinal L-cells, where it mediates the secretion of insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), respectively. Activation of FFAR1 by FAs enhances insulin secretion, which is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Studies have shown that FFAR1 agonists can improve insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in diabetic models. Moreover, FFAR1 activation can also influence inflammation and immune responses, suggesting a broader role in metabolic regulation. FFAR4, on the other hand, is predominantly expressed in adipocytes, macrophages, and colonic epithelial cells. It plays a role in anti-inflammatory signaling and the regulation of lipid metabolism. Activation of FFAR4 by FAs can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promote the resolution of inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect is particularly relevant in the context of obesity, where chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, FFAR4 activation can enhance the secretion of GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells, further contributing to improved glucose homeostasis. The interplay between CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 highlights the complexity of FA signaling and its impact on cellular functions. For example, both CD36 and FFAR4 can influence the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. This crosstalk is essential for coordinating the cellular response to changes in FA availability and ensuring proper metabolic adaptation. Moreover, the signaling pathways activated by these receptors can intersect with other metabolic regulators, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). PPARs are nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression in response to FAs and are involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. AMPK is a key sensor of cellular energy status and can be activated by FFAR1 and FFAR4, leading to increased FA oxidation and decreased lipogenesis. The integration of these signaling pathways underscores the importance of a coordinated response to maintain metabolic homeostasis. In conclusion, the membrane receptors CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 are pivotal in FA uptake and signaling, influencing a wide range of physiological processes. Understanding the mechanisms by which these receptors mediate FA signaling can provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders and inform the development of therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific signaling pathways and molecular interactions that underlie the effects of these receptors, as well as exploring their potential as targets for intervention.", "References": [{"title": "Alterations in muscle membrane lipid composition accompany insulin resistance in obese Zucker rats", "authors": "M.
