{"Literature Review": "The mammalian liver is a vital organ with a remarkable capacity for regeneration, a process that has fascinated scientists and clinicians for centuries. This review delves into the multiple facets of cellular homeostasis and regeneration of the mammalian liver, highlighting the intricate mechanisms that underpin its unique regenerative capabilities. The liver's ability to regenerate is a complex interplay of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and the maintenance of tissue architecture, which are essential for restoring functional tissue after injury or partial hepatectomy. Liver regeneration is a well-coordinated process that involves various cell types and signaling pathways. Following liver injury, hepatocytes, the primary functional cells of the liver, enter the cell cycle and proliferate to replace damaged or lost tissue. This process is tightly regulated by a network of growth factors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that orchestrate the transition from quiescence to active proliferation. For instance, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) play crucial roles in initiating and sustaining hepatocyte proliferation. In addition to hepatocytes, non-parenchymal cells such as Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells also contribute to the regenerative process. Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of the liver, release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that promote hepatocyte proliferation and protect against apoptosis. Stellate cells, which are activated in response to injury, produce extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors that support tissue repair and regeneration. Endothelial cells, which line the sinusoids of the liver, secrete angiogenic factors that facilitate the formation of new blood vessels, a critical step in the regeneration process. The liver's regenerative capacity is also influenced by its unique zonal organization, which refers to the spatial distribution of hepatocytes along the liver lobule. Hepatocytes exhibit functional heterogeneity, with cells in different zones performing distinct metabolic functions. This zonation is maintained through gradients of oxygen, nutrients, and signaling molecules, which create a microenvironment that supports specific cellular activities. During regeneration, the zonal organization is preserved, ensuring that the newly formed hepatocytes can perform their specialized functions. Acute and chronic liver injuries trigger different regenerative responses. Acute injuries, such as those caused by surgical resection or toxic insults, typically result in a rapid and robust regenerative response characterized by the activation of quiescent hepatocytes. In contrast, chronic injuries, such as those associated with viral hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease, often lead to a more prolonged and less efficient regenerative process. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis can impair the regenerative capacity of the liver by disrupting the normal tissue architecture and creating a hostile microenvironment for hepatocyte proliferation. Cellular plasticity, the ability of cells to change their phenotype in response to environmental cues, is another key aspect of liver regeneration. Under certain conditions, non-hepatocyte cells, such as biliary epithelial cells and liver progenitor cells, can transdifferentiate into hepatocytes, contributing to the regenerative process. This plasticity is particularly important in situations where the regenerative capacity of hepatocytes is compromised, such as in advanced liver disease. The maintenance of cellular homeostasis is crucial for the liver's regenerative capacity. Homeostasis involves the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, which is regulated by a variety of intracellular and extracellular signals. For example, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a central role in maintaining liver homeostasis by regulating hepatocyte proliferation and differentiation. Disruption of this pathway can lead to aberrant cell growth and the development of liver diseases, including cancer. In conclusion, the regenerative capacity of the mammalian liver is a multifaceted process that involves the coordinated action of various cell types and signaling pathways. Understanding the mechanisms that govern liver regeneration is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver repair and prevent liver failure. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie liver regeneration, with the ultimate goal of translating these findings into clinical applications for the treatment of liver diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Liver regeneration", "authors": "George K.
