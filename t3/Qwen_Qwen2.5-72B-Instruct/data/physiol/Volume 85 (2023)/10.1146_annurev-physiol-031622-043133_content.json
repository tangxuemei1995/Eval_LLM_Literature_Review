{"Literature Review": "Insulin clearance plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and is significantly altered in various metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). The process of insulin clearance involves the degradation of insulin primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in peripheral tissues. This review synthesizes the current understanding of insulin clearance in health and disease, focusing on its implications for insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and T2D. Insulin clearance is a complex process mediated by specific receptors, primarily the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). These receptors facilitate the internalization and degradation of insulin, thereby regulating its half-life and bioavailability. The liver is the primary site of insulin clearance, accounting for approximately 50% of total insulin degradation. Hepatocytes express high levels of IRs, which mediate the rapid uptake and degradation of circulating insulin. Extrahepatic tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue, also contribute to insulin clearance but to a lesser extent. Recent advances in molecular biology have identified key proteins involved in insulin clearance, including the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). CEACAM1 is a membrane glycoprotein that interacts with the IR and enhances insulin internalization and degradation. Studies have shown that genetic variations in the CEACAM1 gene can affect insulin clearance rates, potentially contributing to the development of insulin resistance and T2D. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of T2D, is characterized by a reduced responsiveness of target tissues to insulin. This condition leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, where the pancreas increases insulin secretion to maintain normal glucose levels. However, chronic hyperinsulinemia can further impair insulin clearance, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates insulin resistance. Reduced insulin clearance has been observed in individuals with insulin resistance, suggesting that impaired clearance may be both a cause and a consequence of insulin resistance. Obesity, another major risk factor for T2D, is associated with increased insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Adipose tissue expansion in obesity leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, which can impair insulin signaling and clearance. Studies have shown that obese individuals exhibit reduced insulin clearance compared to lean controls, contributing to the development of hyperinsulinemia. Moreover, the accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver, known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), further impairs insulin clearance and exacerbates insulin resistance. Hepatic steatosis, a common feature of NAFLD, is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. This condition is strongly associated with insulin resistance and T2D. Research has demonstrated that hepatic steatosis impairs the expression and function of IRs, leading to reduced insulin clearance and increased insulin resistance. Furthermore, the presence of hepatic steatosis is associated with a higher risk of developing T2D, highlighting the importance of insulin clearance in the pathogenesis of the disease. Age and ethnicity are additional factors that influence insulin clearance and the risk of developing T2D. Aging is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity and clearance, contributing to the increased prevalence of T2D in older adults. Ethnic differences in insulin clearance have also been reported, with some populations, such as African Americans and Hispanics, exhibiting lower insulin clearance rates compared to Caucasians. These differences may contribute to the higher incidence of T2D in these populations. In conclusion, insulin clearance is a critical component of glucose homeostasis and is significantly affected in various metabolic disorders. Reduced insulin clearance contributes to the development of insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and T2D. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin clearance and identifying genetic and environmental factors that influence this process are essential for developing targeted therapies to prevent and treat these conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Glucose metabolism in obesity and type 2 diabetes", "authors": "Gerald I.
