{"Literature Review": "Neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making have been extensively studied in controlled laboratory settings where stimuli, rules, and payoffs are consistent. However, real-world environments are dynamic, requiring individuals to adapt their decision-making processes based on context. This review synthesizes recent findings on the neural mechanisms that enable flexible perceptual decision making, highlighting the role of various brain regions and the importance of context-dependent neural activity. Recent studies have shown that the brain's ability to make flexible decisions is supported by a distributed network of brain regions, including the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), sensory and motor cortices, subcortical regions, and prefrontal areas (PFC). These regions work together to adjust decision policies and stimulus-action mappings based on the current context. For instance, the PPC has been implicated in integrating sensory information and contextual cues to guide decisions. This integration allows the brain to update its decision-making strategies in response to changes in the environment. The PFC, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), plays a crucial role in cognitive control and the adjustment of decision policies. Studies have demonstrated that the DLPFC is involved in maintaining task-relevant information and updating decision rules when the context changes. For example, when participants are required to switch between different tasks, the DLPFC shows increased activity, reflecting the need to inhibit previously relevant responses and activate new task sets. Sensory and motor cortices also contribute to flexible decision making by dynamically adjusting their responses to incoming stimuli. Research has shown that sensory cortices can rapidly reconfigure their representations based on the current task demands. This reconfiguration allows the brain to prioritize relevant sensory information and filter out irrelevant noise, enhancing the accuracy of perceptual decisions. Similarly, motor cortices adapt their activity patterns to execute appropriate actions based on the current context. Subcortical regions, such as the basal ganglia and thalamus, are also integral to flexible decision making. The basal ganglia, in particular, are involved in the selection and execution of actions based on reward predictions and reinforcement learning. This region helps to update action-outcome associations and adjust decision policies to maximize rewards and minimize costs. The thalamus, on the other hand, acts as a relay station, facilitating communication between cortical and subcortical regions and ensuring that relevant information is integrated into the decision-making process. The flexibility of perceptual decision making is further enhanced by the dynamic interactions between these brain regions. Functional connectivity studies have revealed that the strength and pattern of connections between brain regions change depending on the task context. For example, during task switching, the connectivity between the DLPFC and sensory cortices increases, reflecting the need for enhanced top-down control over sensory processing. This dynamic reconfiguration of functional networks allows the brain to efficiently allocate resources and adapt its decision-making strategies to meet the demands of the current environment. Moreover, the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision making are not limited to changes in activity levels or connectivity patterns. Recent evidence suggests that neuromodulatory systems, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, play a critical role in modulating the flexibility of decision-making processes. Dopamine, for instance, is known to influence the salience of stimuli and the strength of reward signals, thereby affecting the brain's ability to update decision policies. Norepinephrine, on the other hand, modulates attention and arousal, helping to focus the brain's resources on the most relevant aspects of the environment. In addition to the neural mechanisms discussed above, the study of flexible decision making has also benefited from advances in computational modeling. Computational models have provided insights into the algorithms and representations that underlie flexible decision making, helping to bridge the gap between neural activity and behavior. For example, reinforcement learning models have been used to explain how the brain updates its decision policies based on trial-and-error learning. These models predict that the brain uses a combination of model-free and model-based learning to optimize its decision-making strategies, with the former relying on simple reward prediction errors and the latter incorporating more complex representations of the environment. Despite significant progress, several challenges remain in the study of flexible decision making. One major challenge is the need to develop more ecologically valid experimental paradigms that better capture the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Traditional laboratory tasks often oversimplify the decision-making process, making it difficult to generalize findings to naturalistic settings. Another challenge is the need to integrate findings from different levels of analysis, from single neurons to large-scale brain networks, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision making.", "References": [{"title": "Corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for learning but not for executing a motor skill", "authors": "N.
