{"Literature Review": "The discovery of granulated lymphocytes in the human uterine mucosa, now recognized as uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, has significantly advanced our understanding of reproductive immunology. These cells, distinct from peripheral natural killer (pNK) cells, play crucial roles in early pregnancy and placental development. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the historical context, functional characteristics, and recent advancements in the study of uNK cells. The presence of granulated lymphocytes in the human uterine mucosa was first observed in the late nineteenth century, but it was not until the 1990s that these cells were identified as a unique subset of NK cells. Unlike pNK cells, which are highly cytotoxic and primarily involved in immune surveillance, uNK cells exhibit reduced cytotoxicity and are more focused on supporting fetal development and maternal-fetal interactions. One of the key functions of uNK cells is their interaction with placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. EVTs are essential for placental implantation and spiral artery remodeling, processes critical for establishing a healthy pregnancy. Studies have shown that uNK cells secrete cytokines and chemokines that promote EVT invasion and migration, thereby facilitating proper placental development. For instance, uNK cells produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which enhances EVT invasion and contributes to the remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Recent research has further elucidated the heterogeneity of uNK cells, identifying three distinct subpopulations based on their surface markers and functional properties. These subpopulations, designated as CD56dimCD16+, CD56brightCD16-, and CD56brightCD16+, each play specific roles in the uterine environment. The CD56brightCD16- subset, for example, is particularly abundant in the early stages of pregnancy and is thought to be involved in the initial phases of placental development. The development and maintenance of uNK cells in the uterine mucosa are influenced by various factors, including hormonal changes and local microenvironmental cues. Estrogen and progesterone, key hormones in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, have been shown to regulate the recruitment and activation of uNK cells. Additionally, the local cytokine milieu, including interleukin-15 (IL-15), plays a crucial role in the differentiation and function of uNK cells. Beyond their role in placental development, uNK cells also contribute to the defense against infections. The uterine mucosa is a potential site of pathogen entry, and uNK cells are well-equipped to recognize and eliminate infected cells. They express a variety of activating receptors, such as NKG2D and NKp46, which enable them to detect and respond to stressed or infected cells. Furthermore, uNK cells can produce antimicrobial peptides and other effector molecules that help to control microbial infections. Another emerging area of research is the potential for uNK cells to mediate memory-like responses. Memory NK cells, initially described in the context of viral infections, have been shown to exhibit enhanced responses upon re-exposure to the same antigen. While the existence of memory uNK cells is still under investigation, preliminary evidence suggests that they may play a role in protecting against recurrent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications. Understanding the complex biology of uNK cells has significant implications for improving pregnancy outcomes. Dysregulation of uNK cell function has been implicated in various pregnancy-related disorders, including recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). For example, reduced numbers or altered function of uNK cells have been associated with impaired placental development and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In conclusion, the study of uNK cells has revealed their multifaceted roles in reproductive immunology, from supporting placental development to defending against infections and potentially mediating memory responses. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying uNK cell function and to explore their therapeutic potential in improving maternal and fetal health.", "References": [{"title": "Human uterine natural killer cells: a review", "authors": "A.
