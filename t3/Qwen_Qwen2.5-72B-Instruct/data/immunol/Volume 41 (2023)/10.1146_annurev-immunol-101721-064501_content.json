{"Literature Review": "The aging process is accompanied by significant changes in the immune system, particularly within the T cell compartment. This phenomenon, known as immunosenescence, is characterized by a decline in the function and diversity of T cells, which can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, cancer, and chronic inflammatory diseases. One of the most notable changes is the reduction in the naive T cell pool, primarily due to thymic involution, which results in decreased production of new T cells. Concurrently, there is an accumulation of memory-like T cells, which often exhibit characteristics of terminal differentiation and senescence. These memory-like T cells, which are prevalent in older individuals, undergo phenotypic and functional changes that contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging. For instance, they lose the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD28, which are crucial for T cell activation and survival. Additionally, these cells acquire properties of senescent cells, including the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can exacerbate chronic inflammation. One subset of age-associated T cells that has garnered significant attention is the extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer (NK) properties. These cells, often referred to as NKT-like cells, express high levels of perforin and granzyme B, enabling them to efficiently kill target cells. However, their excessive cytotoxicity can also lead to collateral damage in tissues, contributing to organ dysfunction and aging-related pathologies. Another important subset is the exhausted T cells, which are characterized by altered cytokine production and reduced proliferative capacity. Chronic antigen stimulation, such as that seen in persistent viral infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV), can drive the development of these exhausted T cells. These cells often express high levels of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and Tim-3, which further impair their function. The accumulation of exhausted T cells in nonlymphoid tissues can contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage, as these cells fail to effectively clear pathogens and instead produce proinflammatory cytokines. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) also undergo significant changes during aging. While Tregs are typically associated with maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, age-related alterations can lead to a loss of suppressive function and the acquisition of proinflammatory properties. For example, aged Tregs may produce higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-Î±, which can contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Moreover, these Tregs lose their ability to home to lymph nodes and instead migrate to nonlymphoid tissues, where they can exacerbate local inflammation. The migration of these age-associated T cell subsets to nonlymphoid tissues is a critical factor in the development of tissue deterioration and inflammaging. The loss of lymph node homing capacity is thought to be mediated by changes in the expression of homing receptors such as CCR7 and CD62L. As a result, these cells accumulate in peripheral tissues, where they can contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. For example, the infiltration of exhausted T cells into the liver can lead to hepatic fibrosis, while the accumulation of NKT-like cells in the brain can contribute to neurodegeneration. In conclusion, the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets during aging, including NKT-like cells, exhausted T cells, and proinflammatory Tregs, plays a significant role in tissue deterioration and inflammaging. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes and developing strategies to mitigate their effects could have important implications for improving healthspan and reducing the burden of age-related diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Understanding how positive and negative selection maintain appropriate T cell reactivity to self and foreign antigens", "authors": "J.
