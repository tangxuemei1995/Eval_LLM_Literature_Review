{"Literature Review": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in the central nervous system (CNS) with multifaceted functions in neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the contributions of the complement system to these processes, highlighting its dual roles in both health and disease. The complement system is a complex network of proteins that can be activated through three main pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. In the CNS, the classical pathway, initiated by C1q, plays a pivotal role in synaptic pruning during development and adulthood. Synaptic pruning is essential for refining neural circuits and maintaining optimal brain function. C1q and other complement components tag synapses for elimination, which is then executed by microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. This process is crucial for proper neural development and is dysregulated in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In addition to its role in synaptic pruning, the complement system contributes to neuroprotection by facilitating the clearance of debris and pathogens. Microglia, activated by complement proteins, phagocytose dead or damaged neurons and clear amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, chronic activation of the complement system can lead to excessive inflammation and neurodegeneration, exacerbating the progression of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of complement in adult neural plasticity. Adult neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are generated in the hippocampus and subventricular zone, is influenced by complement-mediated signaling. C1q and other complement components modulate the survival and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, contributing to cognitive function and learning. Dysregulation of this process may contribute to cognitive decline in aging and neurodegenerative conditions. The complement system's involvement in neuroinflammation is another area of intense research. Microglia, upon activation by complement proteins, release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a cascade of inflammatory responses. This inflammation can be beneficial in the short term by promoting tissue repair and pathogen clearance but becomes detrimental when chronic, contributing to neurodegeneration. In AD, chronic neuroinflammation driven by complement activation is associated with the formation and persistence of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), key pathological features of the disease. The development of complement-directed therapies has gained momentum in recent years, aiming to modulate complement activity to treat neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, inhibitors of C1q or C3 have shown promise in preclinical models of AD by reducing Aβ plaque burden and improving cognitive function. However, the therapeutic window for complement inhibition must be carefully considered to avoid disrupting its beneficial roles in neuroprotection and plasticity. In conclusion, the complement system's diverse functions in the CNS underscore its importance in both health and disease. Understanding the intricate balance between its protective and detrimental effects is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on identifying specific complement pathways and targets that can be modulated to enhance neuroprotection while minimizing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.", "References": [{"title": "The classical complement pathway is essential for developmental synaptic refinement.", "authors": "Beth Stevens, Dori Schafer, Alison K.
