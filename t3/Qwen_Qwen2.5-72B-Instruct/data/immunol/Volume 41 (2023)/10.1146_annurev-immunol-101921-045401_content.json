{"Literature Review": "RNA modifications play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes, including those involved in the immune system. These modifications, which include N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and pseudouridine (Ψ), among others, have been shown to influence various aspects of immune cell development and function. This literature review aims to summarize the current understanding of RNA modifications in the immune system, focusing on their roles in both healthy and diseased states, particularly in the context of antiviral and antitumor immunity. Dynamic RNA modifications, such as m6A, are the most prevalent and well-studied post-transcriptional modifications in eukaryotic cells. m6A is catalyzed by the methyltransferase complex (MTC) and removed by demethylases FTO and ALKBH5. The m6A modification has been implicated in various biological processes, including mRNA splicing, stability, and translation (Roundtree et al., 2017). In the immune system, m6A has been shown to regulate the differentiation and function of T cells, B cells, and innate immune cells. For instance, m6A methylation is essential for the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which play a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Liu et al., 2018). In addition to m6A, other RNA modifications such as m5C and Ψ also contribute to the regulation of immune responses. m5C, which is catalyzed by NSUN family proteins, has been shown to affect the stability and translation of mRNAs. In the context of antiviral immunity, m5C modifications can enhance the recognition of viral RNAs by pattern recognition receptors, leading to the activation of antiviral signaling pathways (Chen et al., 2019). Similarly, Ψ, which is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases, can alter the structure and function of RNAs, influencing their stability and translation efficiency. Pseudouridylation has been linked to the regulation of cytokine production and the activation of immune cells (Dominissini et al., 2016). The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized the study of RNA modifications, enabling the comprehensive profiling of the epitranscriptome. Techniques such as MeRIP-seq (m6A-seq) and bisulfite sequencing (m5C-seq) have been instrumental in mapping the distribution of RNA modifications across the transcriptome (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012). These technologies have revealed that RNA modifications are dynamically regulated in response to various stimuli, including infection and inflammation. For example, m6A levels are increased in response to viral infection, contributing to the rapid induction of antiviral genes (Zhou et al., 2015). In the context of antitumor immunity, RNA modifications have been shown to modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Aberrant RNA modifications can lead to the dysregulation of immune cell function, promoting tumor growth and immune evasion. For instance, reduced m6A levels in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with impaired T cell function and reduced antitumor activity (Xiao et al., 2019). Conversely, increased m6A levels in cancer cells can enhance the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, leading to the suppression of antitumor immune responses (Shi et al., 2017). The role of RNA modifications in the TME extends beyond their effects on immune cells. RNA modifications can also influence the function of non-immune cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which contribute to the formation of the TME. For example, m6A modifications in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to promote the secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, which support tumor growth and angiogenesis. Despite the significant progress made in understanding the role of RNA modifications in the immune system, several key questions remain unanswered. For instance, the specific mechanisms by which RNA modifications regulate immune cell function and the crosstalk between different types of RNA modifications are not fully understood. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of targeting RNA modifications in the context of immune-related diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune disorders, remains to be explored. In conclusion, RNA modifications are essential regulators of immune cell development and function, influencing both antiviral and antitumor immunity. The use of advanced profiling technologies has provided valuable insights into the dynamic nature of RNA modifications and their impact on the immune system. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms and exploring the therapeutic implications of modulating RNA modifications in the context of immune-related diseases.", "References": [{"title": "The dynamic epitranscriptome: N6-methyladenosine and gene expression control", "authors": "Ian A.
