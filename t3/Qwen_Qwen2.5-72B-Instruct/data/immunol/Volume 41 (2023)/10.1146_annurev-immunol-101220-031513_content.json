{"Literature Review": "Over the past decade, the field of immunometabolism has gained significant traction, revealing intricate relationships between immune responses and metabolic processes. This interdisciplinary field integrates immunology and metabolism to understand how cellular metabolism influences immune cell function and vice versa. Traditional approaches, such as bulk metabolic profiling and the analysis of metabolic regulator expression, have been instrumental in laying the groundwork for understanding these interactions. However, the complexity of immunometabolism in vivo necessitates a more comprehensive and integrative approach, leading to the development of systems immunology methods. Systems immunology is an emerging field that leverages high-throughput technologies and computational tools to study the immune system as a whole, rather than focusing on individual components. This holistic approach allows researchers to capture the dynamic and multifaceted nature of immune responses and their metabolic underpinnings. One of the key advancements in this area is the use of spatially resolved metabolic imaging, which provides detailed information about the metabolic state of cells within their tissue microenvironment. Spatially resolved metabolic imaging techniques, such as mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and Raman spectroscopy, enable the visualization of metabolic pathways and metabolite distributions at the subcellular level. These techniques have been particularly useful in studying the metabolic heterogeneity of immune cells in various tissues, including tumors and inflamed sites. For instance, MSI has been used to map the distribution of amino acids and lipids in tumor microenvironments, revealing how metabolic alterations can influence immune cell infiltration and function. In addition to imaging, multi-omics approaches, including transcriptomics and metabolomics, have become essential tools in systems immunology. Transcriptomics involves the large-scale analysis of gene expression patterns, providing insights into the regulatory networks that control immune cell metabolism. Metabolomics, on the other hand, focuses on the identification and quantification of small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes. Integrating these omics datasets using computational algorithms can reveal the complex interplay between gene expression and metabolic activity. Recent studies have demonstrated the power of multi-omics integration in uncovering novel regulatory mechanisms in immunometabolism. For example, a study by Wu et al. combined transcriptomic and metabolomic data to identify a key metabolic pathway that regulates T cell activation and effector function. By integrating these datasets, the researchers were able to pinpoint specific metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways that could be targeted to modulate immune responses. Another important aspect of systems immunology is the use of computational models to simulate and predict immune cell behavior. These models can integrate diverse types of data, including gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and metabolic fluxes, to generate hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of immunometabolism. For instance, a study by Chen et al. developed a computational model to predict the metabolic changes in macrophages during inflammation. The model accurately predicted the upregulation of glycolysis and the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, which are known metabolic shifts in activated macrophages. Moreover, the integration of single-cell technologies with systems immunology approaches has further enhanced our understanding of immune cell heterogeneity and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell metabolomics allow researchers to study the metabolic profiles of individual cells, providing a more granular view of immune cell populations. A study by Stubbington et al. used scRNA-seq to characterize the transcriptional diversity of T cells in different tissues, revealing distinct metabolic signatures associated with specific functional states. The application of machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale omics data has also revolutionized the field of systems immunology. Machine learning can identify patterns and correlations in complex datasets that might not be apparent through traditional statistical methods. For example, a study by Zhang et al. applied machine learning to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data from immune cells, identifying novel biomarkers of immune activation and metabolic dysregulation. In conclusion, the field of systems immunology has made significant strides in elucidating the complex interplay between immune responses and metabolism. The integration of spatially resolved metabolic imaging, multi-omics approaches, and computational modeling has provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying immunometabolism. As technology continues to advance, these integrative approaches will likely lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and strategies for modulating immune responses in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Mass spectrometry imaging for spatially resolved metabolomics", "authors": "Chang, H.
