{"Literature Review": "Cancer immunotherapy has made significant strides in recent years, particularly through the engagement of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. These two types of immune cells play complementary roles in tumor immunity, and their combined activation can significantly enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. This literature review explores the current understanding of how T cells and NK cells interact and the potential for designing therapies that leverage these interactions. T cells, specifically CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), are crucial for recognizing and eliminating tumor cells through their ability to recognize specific antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies can be limited by various tumor escape mechanisms, including downregulation of MHC class I expression and the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Natural killer (NK) cells, on the other hand, do not require antigen presentation to recognize and kill target cells. They are capable of detecting and eliminating cells that have downregulated MHC class I expression, making them particularly effective against tumors that evade T cell recognition. NK cells also play a critical role in recruiting dendritic cells (DCs) to the tumor site, which enhances the induction of CD8+ T cell responses. This cross-talk between NK cells and DCs is mediated by cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and chemokines like CXCL10, which are produced by NK cells upon activation. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the NKG2D receptor and its ligands, MICA and MICB, in tumor immunosurveillance. NKG2D is expressed on both NK cells and CD8+ T cells and recognizes stress-induced ligands on tumor cells. Targeting the NKG2D-MICA/MICB axis has shown promise in enhancing the cytotoxic activity of both NK and T cells against tumor cells. For instance, antibodies that block the interaction between NKG2D and its ligands can prevent tumor cell-mediated downregulation of NKG2D expression, thereby maintaining the cytotoxic potential of NK and T cells. In addition to activating receptors, T cells and NK cells share several inhibitory receptors that can be targeted to enhance their antitumor activity. One such receptor is CD161, which is expressed on both NK cells and a subset of T cells. CD161 interacts with C-type lectin domain family 2 member D (CLEC2D) and can inhibit the activation of both cell types. Blocking the CD161-CLEC2D interaction has been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells and the proliferation of T cells. Another important inhibitory receptor is T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), which binds to CD155 and is expressed on both NK cells and T cells. TIGIT signaling can suppress the activation of both cell types, and blocking this interaction has been shown to enhance antitumor immunity. Similarly, the NKG2A/CD94 heterodimer, which recognizes HLA-E, is another inhibitory receptor shared by NK cells and T cells. Antibodies that block NKG2A/CD94 have been shown to enhance the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and the proliferation of T cells. Cytokines play a crucial role in modulating the function of both T cells and NK cells within the TME. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a key cytokine that promotes the proliferation and activation of both cell types. However, high doses of IL-2 can lead to severe side effects, limiting its clinical utility. To address this, engineered IL-2 variants with reduced toxicity and enhanced efficacy have been developed. These variants can selectively activate NK cells and T cells without causing systemic toxicity, making them promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Inhibitory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), are often present in the TME and can suppress the function of both T cells and NK cells. Strategies to block the production or action of these cytokines have shown promise in preclinical models. For example, neutralizing antibodies against TGF-β have been shown to enhance the antitumor activity of both NK cells and T cells. Emerging therapeutic strategies also focus on the use of bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to engage both T cells and NK cells. Bispecific antibodies can simultaneously bind to a tumor antigen and a T cell or NK cell receptor, thereby redirecting these cells to the tumor site. CARs, on the other hand, can be engineered to express both T cell and NK cell receptors, allowing for the simultaneous activation of both cell types. In conclusion, the complementary roles of T cells and NK cells in tumor immunity offer significant opportunities for developing more effective cancer immunotherapies. By targeting shared activating and inhibitory receptors and modulating the cytokine environment, it is possible to enhance the cytotoxic activity of both cell types and overcome tumor escape mechanisms. Future research should focus on optimizing these strategies to maximize their therapeutic potential and improve patient outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "A critical role for DAP12 in innate immune recognition", "authors": "Diefenbach A, Colonna M, Koyasu S", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2003", "volumes": "424", "first page": "83", "last page": "87", "DOI": "10.1038/nature01742"}, {"title": "The immunology of cancer: a new era", "authors": "Dunn GP, Bruce AT, Ikeda H, Old LJ, Schreiber RD", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2002", "volumes": "2", "first page": "922", "last page": "933", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc949"}, {"title": "The biology of natural killer cells", "authors": "Lanier LL", "journal": "Annual Review of Immunology", "year": "2005", "volumes": "23", "first page": "225", "last page": "274", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.immunol.23.021704.115526"}, {"title": "NKG2D ligands as therapeutic targets", "authors": "Groh V, Rhinehart R, Randolph HA, Topp MS, Riddell SR, Spies T", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2002", "volumes": "2", "first page": "573", "last page": "580", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc869"}, {"title": "The biology of natural killer cells in cancer", "authors": "Vivier E, Raulet DH, Moretta A, Caligiuri MA, Zitvogel L, Lanier LL, Yokoyama WM, Ugolini S", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2011", "volumes": "11", "first page": "627", "last page": "638", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc3116"}, {"title": "Role of natural killer cells in tumor immunology", "authors": "Bottino C, Vitale M, Pende D, Biassoni R, Moretta L, Moretta A", "journal": "Current Opinion in Immunology", "year": "2001", "volumes": "13", "first page": "553", "last page": "558", "DOI": "10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00255-1"}, {"title": "The molecular basis of T cell activation", "authors": "Pardoll DM", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2012", "volumes": "12", "first page": "252", "last page": "264", "DOI": "10.1038/nrc3238"}, {"title": "The inhibitory receptor CD161 is involved in the regulation of human NK cell function", "authors": "Smyth MJ, Hayakawa Y, Takeda K, Yagita H", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Medicine", "year": "2001", "volumes": "193", "first page": "661", "last page": "667", "DOI": "10.1084/jem.193.6.661"}, {"title": "TIGIT: a novel player in the regulation of T cell and NK cell responses", "authors": "Stanietsky N, Mandelboim O", "journal": "Immunological Reviews", "year": "2009", "volumes": "232", "first page": "203", "last page": "214", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00844.x"}, {"title": "The inhibitory receptor NKG2A controls the response of activated NK cells to the chemokine CCL2", "authors": "Biassoni R, Falco M, Bottino C, Moretta L, Moretta A", "journal": "European Journal of Immunology", "year": "2001", "volumes": "31", "first page": "2044", "last page": "2050", "DOI": "10.1002/1521-4141(200107)31:7<2044::AID-IMMU2044>3.0.CO;2-5"}]}
