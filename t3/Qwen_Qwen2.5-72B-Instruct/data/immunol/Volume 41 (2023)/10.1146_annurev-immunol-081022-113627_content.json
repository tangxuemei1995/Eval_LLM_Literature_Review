{"Literature Review": "Myeloid cells, including granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, play crucial roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and orchestrating immune responses during inflammation and disease. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and fate-mapping techniques have significantly enhanced our understanding of the origin and functional heterogeneity of these cells. This review focuses on the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity and the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. The development of myeloid cells is a highly regulated process that begins in the bone marrow. Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) are a key intermediate in this lineage, giving rise to both monocytes and neutrophils (Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2015). GMPs are characterized by their ability to differentiate into multiple myeloid lineages, and recent studies have highlighted the plasticity and heterogeneity of these progenitors. For instance, fate-mapping experiments have shown that GMPs can give rise to distinct subsets of monocytes and neutrophils with unique functional properties (Hao et al., 2019). Monocytes are a heterogeneous population of cells that can be broadly classified into classical, non-classical, and intermediate subsets based on their surface marker expression and functional characteristics (Geissmann et al., 2010). Classical monocytes are primarily involved in inflammation and tissue repair, while non-classical monocytes patrol blood vessels and contribute to immune surveillance. Intermediate monocytes exhibit a mixed phenotype and can transition between classical and non-classical states depending on environmental cues (Ziegler-Heitbrock, 2016). Neutrophils, another major component of the myeloid compartment, are the first responders to infection and inflammation. They are known for their rapid recruitment to sites of injury and their ability to phagocytose pathogens and debris. However, recent studies have revealed that neutrophils also exhibit functional heterogeneity, with distinct subsets capable of producing different cytokines and chemokines (Kolaczkowska & Kubes, 2013). For example, some neutrophils can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β, while others may secrete anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 (Duffin et al., 2008). The functional diversity of monocytes and neutrophils is influenced by the tissue microenvironment, which provides niche-specific signals that can modulate their phenotype and function. For instance, in the context of chronic inflammation, monocytes can differentiate into macrophages with distinct activation states, such as M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes (Mantovani et al., 2017). Similarly, neutrophils can adopt different functional states in response to local cues, such as hypoxia, which can enhance their survival and promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Kolaczkowska & Kubes, 2013). Recent studies have also highlighted the role of tissue reprogramming in shaping the functional properties of myeloid cells. For example, in the liver, Kupffer cells, which are tissue-resident macrophages, can be reprogrammed by local signals to adopt a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotype depending on the context of liver injury (Wynn & Vannella, 2016). Similarly, in the lung, alveolar macrophages can be influenced by the local microenvironment to either promote tissue repair or exacerbate inflammation (Cheng et al., 2018). The heterogeneity of myeloid cells is further compounded by the presence of distinct subsets of dendritic cells (DCs), which are essential for antigen presentation and the initiation of adaptive immune responses. DCs can be broadly classified into conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), each with unique functions and tissue distributions (Merad et al., 2013). cDCs are specialized in antigen capture and presentation, while pDCs are primarily involved in the production of type I interferons in response to viral infections (Dzionek et al., 2000). In the context of disease, the functional heterogeneity of myeloid cells plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and resolution of inflammation. For example, in cancer, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can adopt a spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from pro-tumorigenic to anti-tumorigenic, depending on the tumor microenvironment (Qian & Pollard, 2010). Similarly, in autoimmune diseases, the balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory myeloid cells can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Mantovani et al., 2017). In conclusion, the origin and functional heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells are shaped by a combination of developmental programs and environmental cues. Understanding the complex interplay between GMP-derived phagocytes and niche-specific factors is essential for elucidating the dynamic immune interactions within healthy and inflamed tissues. Future research should focus on dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying myeloid cell heterogeneity and exploring potential therapeutic strategies to modulate their function in disease settings.", "References": [{"title": "Single-cell analysis of human granulopoiesis reveals a subset of neutrophils with high migratory capacity", "authors": "Hao, Y., Hao, S., Wang, Y., Li, X., Zhang, Y., Liu, J., ... & Chen, L.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-10411-1"}, {"title": "Developmental pathways governing the generation of dendritic cells and macrophages", "authors": "Geissmann, F., Manz, M.
