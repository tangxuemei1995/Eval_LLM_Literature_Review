{"Literature Review": "Induced resistance (IR) is a promising strategy to control postharvest diseases in fruits and vegetables, which are highly susceptible to fungal pathogens due to their perishable nature and the physiological changes that occur during ripening and senescence. IR involves the activation of plant defense mechanisms through various treatments, thereby enhancing the plant's ability to resist pathogen invasion. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables, emphasizing the role of host maturity and ripening stages in the effectiveness of these strategies. Postharvest diseases, primarily caused by fungal pathogens, are a significant concern in the horticultural industry, leading to substantial economic losses and reduced product quality. Traditional methods of disease control, such as chemical fungicides, have limitations due to environmental concerns and the development of pathogen resistance. Therefore, alternative approaches, including IR, have gained attention as sustainable and effective methods to manage postharvest diseases. IR can be categorized into systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced systemic resistance (ISR). SAR is triggered by a primary infection, leading to a broad-spectrum resistance against subsequent infections. ISR, on the other hand, is induced by beneficial microorganisms or chemical elicitors and provides protection against a wide range of pathogens without the need for a primary infection. Both mechanisms involve the activation of defense-related genes, the production of antimicrobial compounds, and the reinforcement of cell walls. In fruits and vegetables, IR can be induced through various treatments, including physical, chemical, and biological methods. Physical treatments, such as heat shock and UV radiation, can activate defense responses by altering the plant's cellular environment. Chemical treatments, such as the application of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene, can also induce resistance by modulating the expression of defense-related genes. Biological treatments, involving the use of beneficial microorganisms like Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus spp., can enhance plant defenses by producing antimicrobial compounds and inducing systemic resistance. The effectiveness of IR is influenced by several physiological factors, including the stage of ripening and the maturity of the host. Ripening is a complex process characterized by changes in hormone levels, enzyme activities, and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. These changes can either enhance or suppress the plant's defense responses, depending on the specific stage of ripening. For example, early stages of ripening are often associated with increased susceptibility to pathogens due to the breakdown of cell walls and the accumulation of sugars, which serve as nutrients for fungi. However, as ripening progresses, the production of defense-related compounds, such as phenols and antioxidants, can increase, providing a natural barrier against pathogen invasion. Therefore, the timing of IR treatments is crucial to ensure optimal defense activation. Maturity is another critical factor affecting the expression of IR. Immature fruits and vegetables generally have higher levels of defense-related compounds and are more resistant to pathogens compared to mature ones. However, the application of IR treatments can still enhance the defense responses in mature produce, delaying the onset of senescence and reducing the risk of postharvest diseases. The practical application of IR in postharvest management has shown promising results. For instance, the use of SA and JA has been effective in controlling postharvest diseases in apples, tomatoes, and strawberries. Similarly, the application of beneficial microorganisms, such as Trichoderma harzianum, has been successful in reducing fungal infections in citrus fruits and grapes. However, further research is needed to optimize the timing and dosage of IR treatments, as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of resistance. Advances in genomics and proteomics can provide valuable insights into the regulation of defense-related genes and the identification of key signaling pathways involved in IR. In conclusion, IR is a valuable strategy for managing postharvest diseases in fruits and vegetables. By understanding the physiological factors that influence the expression of IR, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective and sustainable methods to protect produce from fungal colonization, thereby improving the quality and shelf life of harvested crops.", "References": [{"title": "Fungal Pathogens and Postharvest Diseases of Fruits and Vegetables", "authors": "Y.
