{"Literature Review": "Kitaviridae, a family of plant-infecting viruses, has garnered significant attention due to its unique characteristics and the economic impact it has on various crops. This family includes three genera: Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, each distinguished by distinct genomic organizations. Kitaviruses are notable for their multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments, which can vary in number and arrangement, contributing to their diverse biological properties. One of the most distinctive features of kitaviruses is their ability to cause locally restricted infections, often leading to nonsystemic diseases. This phenomenon is attributed to the inefficient or suboptimal movement of these viruses within their host plants. Unlike many other plant viruses that spread systemically, kitaviruses typically remain confined to the initially infected cells or tissues, resulting in localized symptoms such as necrotic spots, chlorotic rings, and mosaic patterns. The cell-to-cell movement of kitaviruses is facilitated by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, which are considered alternative movement modules among plant viruses. The transmission of kitaviruses is primarily mediated by mites, particularly those of the genus Brevipalpus, and at least one species of eriophyids. These vectors play a crucial role in the spread of kitaviruses, making vector management an essential component of disease control strategies. Brevipalpus mites are known to transmit several economically important kitaviruses, including Citrus leprosis virus (CiLV), which causes significant damage to citrus crops. The interaction between kitaviruses and their vectors is complex and involves specific molecular mechanisms that facilitate virus acquisition and transmission. Kitavirus genomes are characterized by the presence of numerous orphan open reading frames (ORFs), which do not share significant homology with known viral genes. However, two conserved proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the transmembrane helix-containing protein (SP24), are common across kitaviruses and show a close phylogenetic relationship with arthropod viruses. The RdRP is essential for viral replication, while the SP24 protein is involved in viral assembly and possibly in the interaction with host cell membranes. The host range of kitaviruses is broad, encompassing a variety of economically important crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry. Citrus leprosis, caused by CiLV, is a prime example of the economic impact of kitaviruses. This disease results in severe leaf and fruit damage, reducing crop yield and quality. Similarly, Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV), a member of the Cilevirus genus, causes significant losses in tomato production, characterized by chlorotic spots and necrosis on leaves and fruits. The study of kitaviruses has also shed light on the evolution and adaptation of plant viruses. The presence of multiple genomic segments and the use of alternative movement modules suggest that kitaviruses have evolved unique strategies to overcome the challenges of plant infection. Additionally, the close phylogenetic relationship between kitaviruses and arthropod viruses highlights the potential for cross-kingdom viral transmission and the importance of understanding the ecological interactions between plants, viruses, and their vectors. In conclusion, kitaviruses represent a fascinating group of plant viruses with atypical characteristics that contribute to their unique biology and pathogenicity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying their nonsystemic movement, vector transmission, and host range is crucial for developing effective disease management strategies and mitigating the economic impact of these viruses on agriculture. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular and ecological factors that drive the evolution and adaptation of kitaviruses, providing valuable insights into the broader field of plant virology.", "References": [{"title": "Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C) and its vector Brevipalpus phoenicis: a comprehensive review", "authors": "Kitajima, E.
