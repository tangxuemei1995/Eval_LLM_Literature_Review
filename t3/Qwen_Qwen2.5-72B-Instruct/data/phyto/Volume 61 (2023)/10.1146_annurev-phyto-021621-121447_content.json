{"Literature Review": "The plant microbiome, encompassing the diverse microbial communities associated with roots, leaves, and other plant tissues, plays a crucial role in plant growth, development, and health. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their microbial partners. This review focuses on the genetic determinants of the plant microbiota and how these interactions can be harnessed for sustainable crop production. Plant domestication has significantly altered the genetic makeup of crops, leading to changes in the composition and function of their associated microbiota. Domesticated crops often exhibit reduced genetic diversity compared to their wild ancestors, which can affect the recruitment and maintenance of beneficial microbial communities. The heritability of microbiota composition, or the extent to which host genetics influences the recruitment of specific microbial taxa, is a critical factor in understanding plant–microbiota interactions. Several studies have demonstrated that plant genotypes can significantly shape the composition of their associated microbial communities. The environment also plays a significant role in shaping the plant microbiome. Environmental factors such as soil type, climate, and agricultural practices can interact with host genetics to influence the composition and function of the microbiota. Recent studies have begun to treat host–microbiota interactions as quantitative traits, allowing for the identification of genetic loci associated with specific microbial communities. Reductionist approaches, such as the use of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs), have been instrumental in establishing causal relationships between specific microbes and plant phenotypes. Integrating microbiota manipulation into crop breeding programs represents a promising strategy for improving crop resilience and productivity. Despite the progress made in understanding plant–microbiota interactions, several challenges remain. The dynamic nature of the plant microbiome and the complex interplay between host genetics, environmental factors, and microbial communities make it difficult to predict and manipulate these interactions consistently. In conclusion, the genetic determinants of the plant microbiota offer a valuable resource for sustainable crop production. Advances in crop genomics and microbiome research are likely to accelerate the development of strategies that harness plant–microbiota interactions for agricultural benefit. However, further research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with the complexity and variability of these interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Plant microbial diversity is influenced by the host and the environment", "authors": "Berg, G., Rybakova, D., Grube, M., and Berg, I.", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1212", "last page": "1224", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2016.01212"}, {"title": "Plant domestication as a driver of change in the rhizosphere microbiome", "authors": "Kremer, R.
