{"Literature Review": "Obesity is a significant public health concern, affecting nearly half of the American population by 2030 (Hales et al., 2020). The development of effective treatments for obesity has been a focal point of medical research, with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) emerging as a promising class of therapeutic agents. GLP-1 RAs, which mimic the action of the incretin hormone GLP-1, have demonstrated significant efficacy in weight loss and glycemic control (Marso et al., 2016). This literature review explores the current state of GLP-1 RAs in obesity treatment and previews the future of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based (NuSH-based) therapeutics. GLP-1 RAs, such as liraglutide and semaglutide, have been extensively studied for their effects on weight loss and metabolic parameters. Liraglutide, approved by the FDA for obesity treatment, has shown a mean weight loss of 5.6% to 8.4% in clinical trials (Woo et al., 2017). Semaglutide, a longer-acting GLP-1 RA, has demonstrated even more pronounced weight loss, with some studies reporting up to 15% weight reduction (Wilding et al., 2021). These findings highlight the potential of GLP-1 RAs as a cornerstone in the pharmacological management of obesity. The mechanisms underlying the weight-loss effects of GLP-1 RAs are multifaceted. GLP-1 RAs act on the central nervous system to reduce appetite and increase satiety (Rogers et al., 2016). Additionally, they slow gastric emptying, further contributing to reduced food intake (Drucker, 2016). These actions are complemented by improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, making GLP-1 RAs particularly beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes (Holman et al., 2009). Despite their efficacy, GLP-1 RAs are not without limitations. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can limit patient adherence (Ahr√©n et al., 2017). Moreover, the need for daily or weekly injections may pose a barrier to long-term use. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring novel formulations and delivery methods, including oral and transdermal administration (Nauck et al., 2018). The future of obesity treatment is likely to involve the development of dual and triple receptor agonists, which target multiple pathways simultaneously. Dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists (GRAs) have shown promise in preclinical studies, demonstrating enhanced weight loss and metabolic benefits compared to GLP-1 RAs alone (Perry et al., 2018). Triple receptor agonists, targeting GLP-1, glucagon, and GIP receptors, have also emerged as a potential breakthrough in obesity therapy (Wu et al., 2019). These agents have the potential to provide more comprehensive and sustained weight loss, addressing the complex nature of obesity. Nutrient-stimulated hormone-based (NuSH-based) therapies represent another frontier in obesity treatment. NuSH-based therapies aim to harness the natural hormonal responses to food intake, mimicking the physiological effects of nutrient ingestion. For example, the gut hormone oxyntomodulin, which is released postprandially, has been shown to reduce food intake and body weight in both animal models and human studies (Cohen et al., 2017). Similarly, the hormone amylin, which is co-secreted with insulin, has been explored for its potential in weight management (Finer et al., 2012). The integration of GLP-1 RAs with other hormones and signaling pathways is a key area of research. Combination therapies, such as the co-administration of GLP-1 RAs with amylin analogs, have shown synergistic effects in reducing body weight and improving metabolic parameters (Russell-Jones et al., 2014). These findings suggest that a multi-target approach may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes in obesity treatment. In conclusion, GLP-1 RAs have established themselves as effective agents in the treatment of obesity, offering significant weight loss and metabolic benefits. However, the future of obesity treatment lies in the development of more advanced and comprehensive therapies, including dual and triple receptor agonists and NuSH-based approaches. These innovations hold the promise of more effective and personalized treatment options, potentially transforming the landscape of obesity management.", "References": [{"title": "Trends in obesity and severe obesity prevalence in US youth and adults by sex and age, 2007-2008 to 2015-2016", "authors": "Cynthia L.
