{"Literature Review": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019 brought with it a myriad of clinical challenges, one of which was the recognition of thrombotic complications. Early reports from Wuhan, China, highlighted the occurrence of both arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients with severe COVID-19. These observations were corroborated by subsequent epidemiological studies, which consistently showed a higher incidence of thrombotic events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to the general population. The pathophysiology underlying thrombosis in COVID-19 is multifaceted. The virus, SARS-CoV-2, triggers a hyperinflammatory response characterized by cytokine storm and endothelial dysfunction, leading to a prothrombotic state. This hypercoagulable state is further exacerbated by hypoxia, immobilization, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation, all of which are common in critically ill patients. Platelet activation and aggregation also play a significant role in the formation of microthrombi, contributing to organ dysfunction and multiorgan failure. In response to these findings, hospitals worldwide began to implement empirical anticoagulation protocols for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Initial approaches varied widely, ranging from prophylactic doses to therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. Observational studies provided early insights into the potential benefits of anticoagulation. For instance, a study found that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was associated with lower mortality rates in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, these studies were limited by their retrospective design and potential confounding factors, necessitating more rigorous evaluation through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Several RCTs have since been conducted to clarify the role of anticoagulation in different patient populations. The ACTIV-4A trial, for example, evaluated the efficacy and safety of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in noncritically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The results showed that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation significantly reduced the risk of major thrombotic events without increasing the risk of major bleeding. Similarly, the REMAP-CAP trial demonstrated that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation improved outcomes in noncritically ill patients but did not show a benefit in critically ill patients. For patients who have been discharged from the hospital, the evidence is less clear. The RECOVERY trial, which included outpatients and recently discharged patients, found no significant benefit of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in reducing the risk of death or hospital readmission. These findings suggest that the benefits of anticoagulation are most pronounced in hospitalized, noncritically ill patients with COVID-19. The choice of anticoagulant and the duration of therapy are also important considerations. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are commonly used in clinical practice. LMWHs have been shown to be effective in preventing thrombotic events in hospitalized patients, while DOACs offer a convenient oral alternative with fewer monitoring requirements. However, the optimal duration of anticoagulation remains a subject of ongoing research, with some studies suggesting that extended anticoagulation may be beneficial in certain high-risk populations. In conclusion, the management of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. While therapeutic-dose anticoagulation has been shown to benefit noncritically ill hospitalized patients, its use in other patient populations remains controversial. Future research should focus on identifying specific subgroups of patients who may benefit from anticoagulation and optimizing the duration and type of anticoagulant therapy.", "References": [{"title": "Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19", "authors": "F.A.
