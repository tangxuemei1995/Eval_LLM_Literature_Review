{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, particularly in the context of lymphomas. Despite its success, one of the major challenges in CAR T cell therapy is the emergence of antigen loss, which can lead to disease relapse. This literature review aims to explore the current understanding of antigen loss, the mechanisms behind it, and the potential of multispecific CAR T cells to overcome this issue, thereby depriving lymphomas of their escape route via antigen loss.\n\n### Mechanisms of Antigen Loss\nAntigen loss, particularly the loss of CD19, is a well-documented mechanism of resistance in CAR T cell therapy. CD19 is a key target for CAR T cells due to its consistent expression on B-cell malignancies. However, the loss of CD19 expression can occur through various mechanisms, including genetic alterations, epigenetic silencing, and downregulation of surface expression.\n\n### Clinical Impact of Antigen Loss\nThe clinical impact of CD19 loss is significant, as it often leads to relapse in patients who initially respond to CAR T cell therapy. Studies have shown that the rate of CD19-negative relapse can range from 10% to 30%, depending on the patient population and the specific CAR T cell product used. Patients with high-risk features, such as bulky disease or prior exposure to anti-CD20 antibodies, may be at a higher risk of developing CD19-negative relapse. Understanding the risk factors for CD19 loss is crucial for identifying patients who may benefit from alternative or combination therapies.\n\n### Multispecific CAR T Cells\nTo address the issue of antigen loss, researchers have developed multispecific CAR T cells that target multiple antigens simultaneously. Bispecific CARs, which target two antigens, and trispecific CARs, which target three antigens, have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies. One of the most studied combinations is the CD19/20 bispecific CAR, which targets both CD19 and CD20, another B-cell-specific antigen. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CD19/20 bispecific CAR T cells can effectively eliminate CD19-negative tumor cells, suggesting that they can prevent escape via CD19 loss.\n\nAnother promising combination is the CD19/22 bispecific CAR, which targets CD19 and CD22, another B-cell antigen. Preclinical studies have shown that CD19/22 bispecific CAR T cells can maintain cytotoxic activity against CD19-negative cells, thereby reducing the risk of relapse. Early clinical trials of CD19/22 bispecific CAR T cells have reported encouraging results, with high response rates and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse.\n\n### Safety and Efficacy of Multispecific CAR T Cells\nThe safety and efficacy of multispecific CAR T cells are critical considerations for their clinical application. Preclinical studies have generally shown that multispecific CAR T cells are safe and effective, with minimal off-target effects. However, the potential for increased toxicity, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, must be carefully monitored in clinical trials. Early clinical trials of CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CAR T cells have reported manageable toxicity profiles, with CRS and neurotoxicity occurring at rates similar to those observed with single-antigen CAR T cells.\n\n### Future Directions\nWhile the initial results of multispecific CAR T cells are promising, several questions remain to be addressed. The optimal combination of antigens and the design of the CAR construct are still under investigation. For example, the choice of costimulatory domains and the affinity of the CAR for each antigen can significantly impact the function and persistence of CAR T cells. Additionally, the long-term durability of responses and the potential for secondary resistance mechanisms need to be evaluated in larger, more diverse patient populations.\n\nIn conclusion, multispecific CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to overcome the challenge of antigen loss in CAR T cell therapy for lymphomas. By targeting multiple antigens, these cells can deprive lymphomas of their escape route via antigen loss, potentially leading to improved outcomes for patients. Further research is needed to optimize the design and application of multispecific CAR T cells, but the early results are encouraging and warrant continued investigation.", "References": [{"title": "Eradication of B-lineage cells and regression of lymphoma in a patient treated with autologous T cells genetically retargeted to CD19", "authors": "Kochenderfer, J.
