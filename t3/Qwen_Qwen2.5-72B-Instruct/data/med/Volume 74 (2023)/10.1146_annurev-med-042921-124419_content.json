{"Literature Review": "The use of race in clinical algorithms, particularly in kidney function estimation, has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate within the medical community. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical context, the scientific and ethical implications, and the path toward health justice in the development and application of race-free kidney function estimation equations.\n\n### Historical Context\nThe practice of incorporating race into clinical algorithms dates back several decades. One of the most prominent examples is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation, which was developed in the 1990s to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine levels (Levey et al., 1999). The MDRD equation included a race coefficient, assigning a higher GFR value to individuals identified as Black. This coefficient was based on the assumption that Black individuals have a higher muscle mass and, consequently, higher creatinine production (Levey et al., 1999).\n\nHowever, the validity of this assumption has been questioned. Studies have shown that the relationship between muscle mass and creatinine production is not consistent across different populations (Stevens et al., 2006). Moreover, the use of race as a proxy for biological differences has been criticized for perpetuating racial essentialism and reinforcing health disparities (Sankar & Cho, 2002).\n\n### Scientific and Ethical Implications\nThe inclusion of race in clinical algorithms has significant scientific and ethical implications. From a scientific perspective, the use of race as a binary variable (Black vs. non-Black) oversimplifies the complex genetic and environmental factors that influence kidney function (Bakker et al., 2015). This oversimplification can lead to misclassification and misestimation of GFR, potentially resulting in inappropriate treatment decisions (Inker et al., 2014).\n\nEthically, the use of race in clinical algorithms can perpetuate health disparities by reinforcing stereotypes and biases (Katz, 2018). It can also undermine trust in the healthcare system, particularly among minority populations who have historically experienced discrimination and mistreatment (Washington, 2006). Therefore, there is a growing consensus that race should be removed from clinical algorithms to promote equity and reduce health disparities (Sankar & Cho, 2002).\n\n### Development of Race-Free Equations\nIn response to these concerns, efforts have been made to develop race-free equations for kidney function estimation. One such equation is the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, which was introduced in 2009 (Levey et al., 2009). The CKD-EPI equation does not include a race coefficient and has been shown to provide more accurate GFR estimates across diverse populations (Inker et al., 2014).\n\nHowever, the transition to race-free equations is not without challenges. One challenge is the need for large, diverse datasets to validate the performance of these equations in different populations (Bakker et al., 2015). Another challenge is the resistance from some clinicians and researchers who are reluctant to abandon established practices (Katz, 2018). Despite these challenges, the nephrology community has made significant progress in adopting race-free equations (Inker et al., 2014).\n\n### Path Toward Health Justice\nThe path toward health justice in kidney function estimation involves not only the development and adoption of race-free equations but also a broader commitment to addressing systemic issues that contribute to health disparities. This includes improving access to healthcare, addressing social determinants of health, and promoting diversity and inclusion in medical research and practice (Sankar & Cho, 2002).\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to engage with communities affected by these disparities to ensure that their voices and perspectives are heard and incorporated into the development and implementation of new clinical guidelines (Washington, 2006). This participatory approach can help build trust and foster a more equitable healthcare system.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe use of race in kidney function estimation has been a contentious issue, reflecting broader debates about the role of race in medicine. By critically examining the historical context, scientific evidence, and ethical considerations, the nephrology community has taken important steps toward developing and adopting race-free equations. These efforts are a crucial part of the broader movement toward health justice and the elimination of health disparities.", "References": [{"title": "A More Accurate Method To Estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate from Serum Creatinine: A New Prediction Equation", "authors": "Andrew S.
