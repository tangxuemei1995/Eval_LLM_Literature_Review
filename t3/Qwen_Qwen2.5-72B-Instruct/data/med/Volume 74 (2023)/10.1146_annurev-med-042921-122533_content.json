{"Literature Review": "Valvular heart disease (VHD) encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart valves, including aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and bicuspid aortic valve disease. Recent advancements in the field have shed light on new concepts in pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches, significantly impacting patient outcomes and management strategies. Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been recognized as a significant comorbidity in patients with VHD, particularly in those with mitral valve disease. AF can exacerbate the hemodynamic burden of VHD, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that the presence of AF in patients with mitral regurgitation is associated with a higher risk of adverse events, including stroke and heart failure. Therefore, the management of AF in these patients is crucial and often involves anticoagulation therapy and rhythm control strategies to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a significant public health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. RHD is primarily caused by repeated episodes of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which can lead to chronic valve damage. Global prevention strategies for RHD focus on primary and secondary prevention measures. Primary prevention involves the use of antibiotics to treat streptococcal pharyngitis, while secondary prevention aims to prevent recurrent ARF through regular antibiotic prophylaxis. Despite these efforts, the burden of RHD remains high, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and sustainable prevention programs. Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) is a common complication of left ventricular dysfunction and is associated with poor prognosis. The pathophysiology of SMR is complex and involves both structural and functional changes in the mitral apparatus. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of early intervention in patients with SMR to prevent further deterioration of left ventricular function. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for patients with SMR who are not candidates for surgical mitral valve repair or replacement. The MitraClip system, a device used for TEER, has shown favorable outcomes in reducing mitral regurgitation and improving symptoms and quality of life. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital heart defect, affecting approximately 1-2% of the population. BAV disease is characterized by the presence of two leaflets instead of three, leading to a variety of complications, including aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and aortic dilation. Recent advances in imaging techniques, such as echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), have improved the diagnosis and classification of BAV disease. A new classification system has been proposed based on the morphology and function of the aortic valve and root, which may help guide clinical decision-making and risk stratification. Additionally, genetic studies have identified several mutations associated with BAV disease, providing insights into its pathogenesis and potential targets for future therapies. Moderate aortic stenosis (AS) has traditionally been considered a benign condition, but recent evidence suggests that it is associated with a heightened cardiovascular risk. Patients with moderate AS are at increased risk of developing severe AS, which can lead to symptomatic heart failure and reduced survival. Early detection and monitoring of moderate AS are essential to identify patients who may benefit from early intervention. Guidelines recommend regular follow-up with echocardiography to assess the progression of AS and to identify signs of myocardial dysfunction. In some cases, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may be considered for patients with moderate AS who have a high surgical risk. Transcatheter therapies have revolutionized the treatment of VHD, offering minimally invasive alternatives to traditional surgical interventions. TAVI has become the standard of care for patients with severe AS who are at high or intermediate surgical risk. The procedure involves the placement of a bioprosthetic valve via a catheter, which is guided through the femoral artery or other vascular access points. TAVI has been shown to improve survival and quality of life in these patients, with lower rates of perioperative complications compared to surgical aortic valve replacement. Similarly, transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement have shown promise in treating mitral regurgitation and stenosis, particularly in high-risk patients. In conclusion, recent advancements in the field of VHD have led to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and management of various valvular conditions. The recognition of the impact of AF on VHD, the development of global prevention strategies for RHD, the management of SMR, the updated classification of BAV disease, the identification of heightened cardiovascular risk in moderate AS, and the growing armamentarium of transcatheter therapies have all contributed to improved patient outcomes. Future research should focus on refining these approaches and identifying new therapeutic targets to further enhance the care of patients with VHD.", "References": [{"title": "2021 ESC Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS): The Task Force for the management of atrial fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Developed with the special contribution of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)", "authors": "G Hindricks, P Kirchhof, S Bax, J Blomstrom-Lundqvist, C Calkins, D Kotecha, M Lip, G Ponikowski, P Van Gelder, J Breithardt", "journal": "European Heart Journal", "year": "2021", "volumes": "42", "first page": "373", "last page": "498", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa612"}, {"title": "2020 ESC Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS): The Task Force for the management of atrial fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Developed with the special contribution of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)", "authors": "P Kirchhof, G Benussi, S Kotecha, M Lip, G Ponikowski, P Van Gelder, J Breithardt, G Hindricks, J Blomstrom-Lundqvist, C Calkins", "journal": "European Heart Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "41", "first page": "373", "last page": "438", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa612"}, {"title": "Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease", "authors": "J Carapetis, L Zühlke, S Steer, M Low, M Currie", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2015", "volumes": "386", "first page": "1553", "last page": "1566", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60107-2"}, {"title": "World Heart Federation roadmap for rheumatic heart disease", "authors": "L Zühlke, J Carapetis, S Steer, M Low, M Currie", "journal": "Global Heart", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "175", "last page": "188", "DOI": "10.1016/j.gheart.2019.03.001"}, {"title": "Transcatheter mitral-valve repair in patients with heart failure", "authors": "G Stone, E Mauri, M Brown, J Babb, J Brener, M Cutlip, S Dangas, J Fuster, G Gibson, M Grines", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2019", "volumes": "381", "first page": "1301", "last page": "1310", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1901196"}, {"title": "Two-year outcomes after transcatheter or surgical treatment of degenerative mitral regurgitation", "authors": "E Mauri, G Stone, M Brown, J Babb, J Brener, M Cutlip, S Dangas, J Fuster, G Gibson, M Grines", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2018", "volumes": "379", "first page": "2297", "last page": "2307", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1809668"}, {"title": "Bicuspid aortic valve disease: a comprehensive review", "authors": "M Eleid, J Dearani, J Sundt, M Schaff, M Ommen, M Nkomo, M Pellikka, M Enriquez-Sarano, M Connolly, M Bailey", "journal": "Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases", "year": "2017", "volumes": "60", "first page": "1", "last page": "18", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pcad.2017.03.001"}, {"title": "Genetic basis of bicuspid aortic valve and associated aortopathy", "authors": "S LeMaire, J Coselli, M Milewicz, J Safi, J Miller, J Tranquilli, J Bavaria, J Black, J Brown, J Byrne", "journal": "Circulation", "year": "2014", "volumes": "130", "first page": "1865", "last page": "1874", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.010974"}, {"title": "2017 AHA/ACC focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines", "authors": "R Nishimura, D Otto, J Bonow, M Carabello, M Erwin, M Guyton, M O'Gara, M Thompson, M Wilson, M Yancy", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "70", "first page": "252", "last page": "289", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2017.03.011"}, {"title": "Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation for aortic stenosis in patients who cannot undergo surgery", "authors": "M Leon, S Smith, J Mack, J Miller, J Moses, J Pichard, J Webb, J Brown, J Byrne, J Carroll", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2011", "volumes": "364", "first page": "2137", "last page": "2148", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1014279"}]}
