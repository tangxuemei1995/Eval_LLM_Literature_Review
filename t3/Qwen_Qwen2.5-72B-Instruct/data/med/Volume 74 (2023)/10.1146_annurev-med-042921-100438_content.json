{"Literature Review": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a condition characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and electrolyte imbalances. It is estimated that PA accounts for approximately 5-10% of all cases of hypertension, making it the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite its prevalence, PA is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, which can result in significant target organ damage, particularly to the heart and kidneys. The pathophysiology of PA involves excessive aldosterone production, which leads to sodium retention and potassium excretion, resulting in hypertension and hypokalemia. The chronic elevation of aldosterone levels also contributes to end-organ damage through mechanisms independent of blood pressure control. Treatment options for PA depend on the subtype of the disorder. Unilateral PA, typically caused by an adrenal adenoma, can be effectively managed with adrenalectomy, which often results in normalization of blood pressure and resolution of biochemical abnormalities. However, many patients with PA have bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and are not candidates for surgery. In these cases, medical management with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is the preferred approach. Steroidal MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, are the mainstay of medical therapy for PA. Spironolactone, a non-selective MRA, has been widely used for decades and is highly effective in reducing blood pressure and improving electrolyte balance. Eplerenone, a more selective MRA, has fewer side effects, particularly related to gynecomastia and menstrual irregularities, making it a better-tolerated alternative. Both spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown to reduce left ventricular mass and improve renal function in patients with PA. Despite their efficacy, steroidal MRAs are often underprescribed in clinical practice. Recent advances in pharmacology have led to the development of nonsteroidal MRAs, which offer potential advantages over traditional steroidal agents. Finerenone, a nonsteroidal MRA, has been studied in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and has shown promising results in reducing albuminuria and slowing the progression of CKD. While the blood pressure-lowering effects of nonsteroidal MRAs in PA have not been extensively studied, their ability to reduce target organ damage suggests a potential role in the management of PA. In conclusion, PA is a significant contributor to secondary hypertension and is associated with increased risk of target organ damage. While surgical intervention is effective for unilateral PA, medical management with MRAs is essential for patients with bilateral disease. Steroidal MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, are highly effective but can be limited by side effects. Nonsteroidal MRAs, like finerenone, offer a promising alternative with potential benefits in reducing target organ damage and improving patient tolerance. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of nonsteroidal MRAs in the treatment of PA and to optimize their use in clinical practice.", "References": [{"title": "Primary aldosteronism: a common cause of resistant hypertension", "authors": "Funder, J.
