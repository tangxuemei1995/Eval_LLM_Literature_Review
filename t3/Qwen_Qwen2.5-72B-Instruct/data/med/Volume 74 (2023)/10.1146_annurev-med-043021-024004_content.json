{"Literature Review": "Understanding the origins of racial and ethnic bias in medical technologies, particularly in pulmonary technologies, is crucial for addressing health disparities and ensuring equitable care. This literature review explores how biases can be introduced through various mechanisms, including the physical design of technologies, unrepresentative data, and the conflation of biological with social determinants of health. It also examines how these biases can be perpetuated by inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Pulse oximeters, which measure blood oxygen saturation, have been shown to exhibit racial and ethnic biases. A study by Sjoding et al. (2020) found that pulse oximeters overestimated the oxygen saturation levels in Black patients compared to White patients, leading to a higher risk of undiagnosed hypoxemia. This discrepancy can result in delayed or inappropriate treatment, potentially exacerbating health outcomes for minority populations. The physical design of pulse oximeters, which relies on light absorption properties of hemoglobin, may contribute to these differences due to variations in skin pigmentation and tissue composition (Sjoding et al., 2020). Unrepresentative data is another significant source of bias in medical technologies. For instance, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are commonly used to diagnose and monitor respiratory conditions. However, reference values for PFTs are often derived from predominantly White populations, leading to inaccuracies when applied to other racial and ethnic groups. A study by Hankinson et al. (1999) highlighted the need for race-specific reference equations to improve the accuracy of PFT results. Similarly, a review by Crapo et al. (2018) emphasized the importance of using diverse populations in the development and validation of PFT reference values to ensure equitable performance across different racial and ethnic groups. Algorithms used to predict healthcare needs and allocate resources can also perpetuate racial and ethnic biases. Obermeyer et al. (2019) demonstrated that a widely used algorithm for predicting high-risk patients systematically under-identified Black patients, leading to reduced access to necessary care. This bias was attributed to the algorithm's reliance on historical healthcare spending data, which reflects systemic inequalities in healthcare access and utilization. Addressing these biases requires the development of more transparent and equitable algorithms that account for social determinants of health and avoid reinforcing existing disparities. Structural racism plays a significant role in the perpetuation of racial and ethnic biases in medical technologies. Structural racism refers to the ways in which societal institutions and practices create and maintain unequal outcomes based on race. In the context of medical technologies, structural racism can manifest in the form of biased data collection, inadequate representation in clinical trials, and insufficient regulatory oversight. A study by Baer et al. (2021) highlighted the need for regulatory agencies to adopt more rigorous standards for evaluating the performance of medical devices across different racial and ethnic groups. This includes requiring manufacturers to provide detailed demographic data and demonstrating the device's safety and efficacy in diverse populations. The conflation of biological with social determinants of health is another critical issue. Biological factors alone cannot explain the observed differences in health outcomes between racial and ethnic groups. Social determinants, such as socioeconomic status, education, and environmental exposures, play a significant role in shaping health outcomes. A study by Williams and Mohammed (2013) emphasized the importance of considering social determinants in the development and evaluation of medical technologies to ensure that they do not inadvertently perpetuate health disparities. Inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards further contribute to the persistence of racial and ethnic biases in medical technologies. Regulatory agencies often rely on limited data and may not require comprehensive evaluations of device performance across diverse populations. A study by Kesselheim et al. (2015) found that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) frequently approves medical devices based on small, non-representative clinical trials, which can lead to biased performance assessments. To address this issue, regulatory agencies must adopt more stringent standards for evaluating the safety and efficacy of medical devices in diverse populations. Efforts to mitigate racial and ethnic biases in medical technologies require a multifaceted approach. This includes improving the representativeness of data used in the development and validation of medical technologies, adopting more rigorous regulatory standards, and promoting transparency and accountability in the design and deployment of algorithms. Additionally, there is a need for ongoing research to identify and address the underlying mechanisms of bias and to develop strategies for ensuring equitable performance of medical technologies across all racial and ethnic groups. In conclusion, understanding and addressing the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies is essential for promoting health equity. By recognizing the multiple sources of bias and implementing comprehensive strategies to mitigate them, we can work towards ensuring that medical technologies perform equally well for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.", "References": [{"title": "Racial bias in pulse oximetry during the COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": "Michael W.
