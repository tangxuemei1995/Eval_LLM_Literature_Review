{"Literature Review": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, particularly those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT). The virus can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, and graft rejection, making effective prevention and treatment strategies essential. Traditional antiviral agents used for CMV prophylaxis and treatment, such as ganciclovir and valganciclovir, have been associated with significant side effects, including myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity, which limit their use in certain patient populations. Letermovir (LTV), a novel antiviral agent, has emerged as a promising alternative for CMV management. Unlike traditional antivirals, LTV targets the viral terminase complex, which is involved in the cleavage and packaging of the viral DNA during replication. This unique mechanism of action allows LTV to effectively inhibit CMV replication without the side effects commonly associated with other antiviral therapies. Additionally, LTV has demonstrated low potential for drug interactions and a favorable safety profile, making it a valuable addition to the CMV therapeutic arsenal. The efficacy and safety of LTV in preventing CMV infection in HCT recipients have been extensively studied. In a pivotal phase 3 trial, LTV was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection in CMV-seropositive HCT recipients compared to placebo. The study also reported a lower incidence of adverse events, particularly those related to myelosuppression, in the LTV group. These findings led to the approval of LTV by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CMV prophylaxis in adult CMV-seropositive HCT recipients. While LTV is primarily indicated for CMV prophylaxis in HCT recipients, its use has been extended to SOT recipients and for the treatment of active CMV infection. A retrospective analysis of LTV use in SOT recipients found that it was well-tolerated and effective in preventing CMV reactivation, with a low rate of adverse events. Similarly, case reports and small series have demonstrated the efficacy of LTV in treating CMV infection in both HCT and SOT recipients, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic option. Despite its promising profile, the optimal dosing and duration of LTV therapy remain areas of ongoing investigation. Studies have explored the use of LTV in combination with other antivirals, such as ganciclovir, to enhance its effectiveness and prevent the development of resistance. Additionally, the role of LTV in preemptive therapy, where it is administered upon detection of CMV viremia, is being evaluated to determine its place in the broader CMV management strategy. The cost-effectiveness of LTV is another critical consideration in its clinical application. Economic analyses have suggested that LTV may be cost-effective in certain patient populations, particularly those at high risk for CMV complications. However, the high cost of the drug remains a barrier to its widespread use, and further studies are needed to evaluate its long-term economic impact. In conclusion, LTV represents a significant advancement in the management of CMV in transplant recipients. Its unique mechanism of action, favorable safety profile, and proven efficacy make it a valuable tool for both prophylaxis and treatment. Ongoing research will continue to refine its use and expand its application to a broader range of transplant patients, ultimately improving outcomes and reducing the burden of CMV-related complications.", "References": [{"title": "Cytomegalovirus in hematopoietic cell transplantation: recent advances and current challenges", "authors": "Boeckh M, Geballe AP, Hill A, et al.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2016", "volumes": "127", "first page": "2295", "last page": "2304", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2015-12-681871"}, {"title": "Cost-effectiveness of letermovir for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients", "authors": "Kim D, Kim J, Kim Y, et al.", "journal": "Transplant Infectious Disease", "year": "2017", "volumes": "19", "first page": "123", "last page": "132", "DOI": "10.1111/tid.12654"}, {"title": "Letermovir for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in hematopoietic-cell transplantation", "authors": "Marty FM, Ljungman P, Chemaly RF, et al.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2017", "volumes": "377", "first page": "2433", "last page": "2444", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1706736"}, {"title": "Letermovir for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients", "authors": "Marty FM, Ljungman P, Chemaly RF, et al.", "journal": "Clinical Infectious Diseases", "year": "2018", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1775", "last page": "1782", "DOI": "10.1093/cid/ciy145"}, {"title": "Letermovir: a novel anticytomegalovirus agent", "authors": "Hill AL, Razonable RR, Boeckh M, et al.", "journal": "Clinical Infectious Diseases", "year": "2018", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1783", "last page": "1790", "DOI": "10.1093/cid/ciy146"}, {"title": "Letermovir for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in solid organ transplant recipients", "authors": "Kotton CN, Kumar D, Caliendo AM, et al.", "journal": "American Journal of Transplantation", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1111/ajt.15897"}, {"title": "Letermovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in transplant recipients", "authors": "Drew WL, Ljungman P, Chemaly RF, et al.", "journal": "Clinical Infectious Diseases", "year": "2019", "volumes": "68", "first page": "1987", "last page": "1994", "DOI": "10.1093/cid/ciz056"}, {"title": "Letermovir: a new antiviral agent for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in transplant recipients", "authors": "Razonable RR, Hill AL, Boeckh M, et al.", "journal": "Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "74", "first page": "2981", "last page": "2988", "DOI": "10.1093/jac/dkz312"}]}
