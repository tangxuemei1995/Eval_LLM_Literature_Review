{"Literature Review": "Exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) have revolutionized the diagnostic landscape for undiagnosed rare and ultrarare Mendelian diseases. These advanced sequencing techniques, powered by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, have enabled the identification of novel genetic variants and the discovery of new disease genes, significantly enhancing our understanding of these conditions. Despite these advancements, a substantial proportion of patients remain undiagnosed, highlighting the ongoing challenges in the field. The introduction of NGS has dramatically reduced the cost and time required for sequencing, making it feasible to analyze large numbers of genes simultaneously. This has led to the widespread adoption of ES and GS in clinical settings, where they are used to identify pathogenic variants in patients with complex and undiagnosed syndromes. ES, which involves sequencing the protein-coding regions of the genome, has been particularly effective in identifying causative mutations in Mendelian disorders. However, ES has limitations, as it does not cover non-coding regions, which can harbor important regulatory elements and structural variations. GS, on the other hand, provides a more comprehensive view of the genome, including both coding and non-coding regions, and has the potential to detect a wider range of genetic variations, including copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations. Despite its advantages, GS is more expensive and computationally intensive than ES, which has limited its widespread use in clinical practice. One of the significant challenges in the application of ES and GS is the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). VUS are genetic variants whose clinical significance is not well understood, and their presence can complicate the diagnostic process. Efforts to address this issue include the development of standardized guidelines for variant interpretation and the integration of functional data to support clinical decision-making. Another challenge is the need for equitable access to NGS-based testing. Disparities in access to genetic testing can lead to unequal healthcare outcomes, particularly for underserved populations. Strategies to improve access include reducing the cost of sequencing, expanding insurance coverage, and developing community-based initiatives to increase awareness and education about genetic testing. The development of long-read sequencing technologies represents a promising advancement in the field. Long-read sequencing, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), can provide longer contiguous reads, which may help resolve complex genomic regions and structural variations that are difficult to detect with short-read sequencing. However, the high cost and technical challenges associated with long-read sequencing have limited its widespread adoption. Ethical considerations also play a crucial role in the application of ES and GS. Issues such as informed consent, data privacy, and the return of incidental findings must be carefully managed to ensure that patients' rights and interests are protected. The ethical implications of genetic testing are particularly relevant in the context of pediatric patients and families, where decisions about testing and the disclosure of results can have long-lasting impacts. Despite these challenges, the future of undiagnosed disease resolution is promising. Ongoing advancements in sequencing technology, computational methods, and clinical genomics are expected to improve diagnostic rates and enhance our ability to manage and treat rare and ultrarare diseases. Collaborative efforts, such as the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), are also playing a critical role in advancing the field by facilitating the sharing of data and resources among researchers and clinicians. In conclusion, ES and GS have transformed the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed rare and ultrarare Mendelian diseases, enabling the identification of novel genetic variants and the discovery of new disease genes. While challenges remain, including the interpretation of VUS, equitable access to testing, and ethical considerations, the continued advancement of sequencing technologies and collaborative efforts offer hope for improved outcomes for patients with undiagnosed syndromes.", "References": [{"title": "Exome sequencing as a tool for Mendelian disease gene discovery", "authors": "Michael J.
