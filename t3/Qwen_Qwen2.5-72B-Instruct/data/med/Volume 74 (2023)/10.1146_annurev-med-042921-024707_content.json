{"Literature Review": "Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from the biliary epithelium and include intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, distal cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder carcinoma. Among these, iCCA has gained significant attention due to its distinct molecular profile, particularly the frequent occurrence of FGFR2 fusions. This review aims to provide an overview of the role of FGFR2 inhibition in iCCA, focusing on the pathophysiology, diagnostic testing strategies, and therapeutic implications. FGFR2, a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In iCCA, FGFR2 fusions are observed in approximately 10-15% of cases, making them a promising therapeutic target. These fusions typically involve the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR2 and various partner genes, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor and downstream signaling pathways such as RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT. The identification of FGFR2 fusions in iCCA has led to the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting FGFR2 activity. Several FGFR inhibitors, including pemigatinib, infigratinib, and derazantinib, have shown clinical efficacy in patients with advanced iCCA harboring FGFR2 fusions. Pemigatinib, for instance, was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020 based on the results of the FIGHT-202 trial, which demonstrated a significant response rate and improved progression-free survival. Similarly, infigratinib received accelerated approval in 2021 following positive outcomes from the BGJ398-iCCA-2 trial. Despite the initial success of FGFR inhibitors, several challenges remain. One of the primary concerns is the development of resistance to these agents. Resistance mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: on-target and off-target. On-target resistance involves secondary mutations within the FGFR2 gene that confer resistance to the inhibitor, while off-target resistance arises from alternative signaling pathways that bypass FGFR2 inhibition. For example, activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway through KRAS mutations or amplification of other RTKs such as EGFR can contribute to resistance. To overcome resistance, combination therapies are being explored. Preclinical studies have shown that combining FGFR inhibitors with MEK inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors can enhance antitumor activity and delay the emergence of resistance. Clinical trials evaluating these combinations are ongoing, and preliminary results are promising. Diagnostic testing for FGFR2 fusions is critical for identifying patients who may benefit from FGFR inhibitors. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as the gold standard for detecting FGFR2 fusions, offering high sensitivity and specificity. However, the cost and turnaround time of NGS can be prohibitive in some settings, leading to the exploration of alternative methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). While these methods are less comprehensive, they can provide rapid and cost-effective screening for FGFR2 alterations. In addition to fusions, other FGFR2 alterations, such as amplifications and in-frame deletions, have been identified in iCCA. The therapeutic potential of these alterations is still under investigation, but early data suggest that they may also be actionable targets. In conclusion, FGFR2 inhibition represents a significant advance in the treatment of iCCA, particularly in patients with FGFR2 fusions. While challenges such as resistance and the need for accurate diagnostic testing remain, ongoing research and clinical trials are expected to further optimize FGFR2-directed therapies. The future of FGFR2 inhibition in iCCA holds promise for improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of precision oncology.", "References": [{"title": "Pemigatinib for previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic, FGFR2-fused cholangiocarcinoma (FIGHT-202): a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study", "authors": "Ghassan K.
