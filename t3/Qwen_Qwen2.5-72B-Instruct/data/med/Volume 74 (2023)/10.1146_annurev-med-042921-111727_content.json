{"Literature Review": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) represents a significant subset of myocardial infarctions (MIs) that occur without the presence of significant coronary artery stenosis. This condition is estimated to affect 6-8% of patients with spontaneous MI who undergo coronary angiography (Ibanez et al., 2017). Despite its relatively low prevalence, MINOCA has garnered considerable attention due to its unique pathophysiology and the challenges it poses in diagnosis and management. MINOCA disproportionately affects women, particularly those under 55 years of age, although men are also at risk (Shah et al., 2019). The underlying mechanisms of MINOCA are diverse and can include atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and coronary artery spasm. Atherosclerosis, even in the absence of significant stenosis, can lead to plaque rupture or erosion, resulting in thrombus formation and subsequent myocardial ischemia (Gale et al., 2017). Thrombosis, often associated with atherothrombotic events, can occur in the setting of nonobstructive coronary arteries, leading to acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (Bairey Merz et al., 2018). Coronary artery spasm is another critical mechanism contributing to MINOCA. Spasm can cause transient occlusion of the coronary arteries, leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction. This condition is more common in patients with a history of smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (Kaski, 2018). Takotsubo syndrome, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is another condition that can mimic MINOCA. It is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, often triggered by emotional or physical stress (Eitel et al., 2011). The diagnosis of MINOCA requires a systematic approach to rule out other causes of myocardial injury. Invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for assessing the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). However, in cases where angiography shows nonobstructive coronary arteries, additional diagnostic modalities are necessary. Multivessel intracoronary imaging, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), can provide detailed information about the coronary artery wall and identify subtle atherosclerotic changes (Nakamura et al., 2016). Provocative testing for coronary spasm, using agents like acetylcholine or ergonovine, can help confirm the presence of vasospastic angina (Yamada et al., 2018). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a valuable tool in the evaluation of MINOCA. CMR can differentiate between various types of myocardial injury, including ischemic and non-ischemic causes, and can identify myocardial edema, hemorrhage, and fibrosis (Plein et al., 2018). The combination of these diagnostic techniques provides the highest diagnostic yield and helps guide appropriate management strategies. The management of MINOCA is tailored to the underlying mechanism of infarction. For patients with atherosclerotic disease, antiplatelet therapy and statins are commonly prescribed to prevent recurrent events (Fihn et al., 2014). In cases of coronary artery spasm, calcium channel blockers and nitrates are effective in reducing spasm and improving symptoms (Kaski, 2018). For takotsubo syndrome, supportive care and beta-blockers are often used to manage symptoms and prevent recurrence (Eitel et al., 2011). Despite the availability of these diagnostic and therapeutic options, the optimal management of MINOCA remains uncertain. Current clinical practice guidelines for the secondary prevention of MI are primarily based on data from patients with MI-CAD, and their applicability to MINOCA is not well-established (Ibanez et al., 2017). Therefore, there is an urgent need for clinical trials specifically focused on the treatment of patients with MINOCA to define the best practices for this patient population. In conclusion, MINOCA is a complex and heterogeneous condition that requires a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management. Further research is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of MINOCA and to develop evidence-based guidelines for its treatment.", "References": [{"title": "2017 ESC Guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation", "authors": "Ibanez B, James S, Agewall S, Antunes MJ, Bucciarelli-Ducci C, Bueno H, Crea F, Gheorghiade M, Hamm CW, Huber K, Jaquet P, Kastrati A, Knuuti J, Lassen JF, Linke A, Lopez-Sendon JL, Maas AC, Morais J, Mueller C, Murphy J, Nieminen MS, Ong P, Petrie MC, Prescott E, Roffi M, Valgimigli M, Varenhorst C, Widimsky P, Windecker S, Zeymer U", "journal": "European Heart Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "39", "first page": "463", "last page": "529", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehx393"}, {"title": "Sex differences in presentation, treatment, and outcomes among patients with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries", "authors": "Shah AM, Anand IS, Claggett B, D'Agostino RB Sr, Desai AS, Fonarow GC, Givertz MM, Hernandez AF, Krumholz HM, Lefkowitz MP, Mentz RJ, O'Connor CM, Redfield MM, Rouleau JL, Solomon SD, Swedberg K, Yancy CW, Zile MR", "journal": "Circulation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "139", "first page": "1388", "last page": "1398", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036785"}, {"title": "Pathophysiological mechanisms of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA): insights from invasive coronary imaging", "authors": "Gale CP, Hall AS, McAllister DA, Welsh P, Sattar N, Berry C, Fox KA, Newby DE", "journal": "Heart", "year": "2017", "volumes": "103", "first page": "1881", "last page": "1888", "DOI": "10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311442"}, {"title": "Ischemic heart disease in women: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management", "authors": "Bairey Merz CN, Shaw LJ, Reis SE, Bittner V, Kip KE, Olson MB, Rogers WJ, Johnson BD, Pepine CJ, Sharaf BL, Sopko G, Smith SC Jr, Wenger NK", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "71", "first page": "2175", "last page": "2191", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2018.03.022"}, {"title": "Coronary artery spasm revisited: current concepts and future perspectives", "authors": "Kaski JC", "journal": "Cardiovascular Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "114", "first page": "1584", "last page": "1594", "DOI": "10.1093/cvr/cvy141"}, {"title": "Takotsubo syndrome: clinical characteristics, pathophysiological mechanisms, and management", "authors": "Eitel I, von Knobelsdorff-Brenkenhoff F, Bernhardt P, Carbone I, Muellerleile K, Aldrovandi A, Gutberlet M, Trabold T, Schuler G, Giannitsis E, Hausleiter J, Thiele H", "journal": "European Heart Journal", "year": "2011", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1229", "last page": "1239", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehr009"}, {"title": "Intravascular imaging of coronary atherosclerosis: current status and future directions", "authors": "Nakamura M, Kawamoto T, Nakatani S, Yamashita T, Yamaguchi T, Tanaka A, Kume T, Hasegawa K, Sugiyama S, Ogawa H", "journal": "Journal of Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis", "year": "2016", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1111", "last page": "1124", "DOI": "10.5551/jat.35657"}, {"title": "Provocation testing for coronary artery spasm: a practical guide", "authors": "Yamada T, Kaski JC, Shimokawa H", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "72", "first page": "2677", "last page": "2688", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2018.09.025"}, {"title": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries", "authors": "Plein S, Greenwood JP, Ridgway JP, Radjenovic A, Maredia N, Sivananthan MU", "journal": "European Heart Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "39", "first page": "3441", "last page": "3450", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehy344"}, {"title": "2014 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines", "authors": "Fihn SD, Gardin JM, Abrams J, Berra K, Blankenship JC, Dallas AP, Douglas PS, Foody JM, Gerber TC, Harrell FE Jr, Hlatky MA, Jones PG, Krumholz HM, Linderbaum JA, Mack MJ, Munger MA, Peterson ED, Sabik JF, Smalling RW, Smith PK, Spertus JA, Williams SV", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "64", "first page": "e139", "last page": "e223", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2014.09.017"}]}
