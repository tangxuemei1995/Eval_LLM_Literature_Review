{"Literature Review": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a significant therapeutic class, initially developed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, their benefits extend beyond glycemic control, particularly in the realm of kidney protection. This literature review synthesizes the current understanding of the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, drawing from a variety of clinical trials and observational studies. The initial development of SGLT2 inhibitors was driven by their ability to lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion. This mechanism of action has been shown to effectively reduce HbA1c levels and body weight in patients with T2D. However, the cardiovascular (CV) benefits observed in large-scale outcome trials, such as the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, have shifted the focus to the broader therapeutic potential of these drugs. One of the most significant findings from these CV outcome trials was the consistent improvement in kidney-related outcomes. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which evaluated empagliflozin in patients with T2D and high CV risk, demonstrated a 46% reduction in the composite endpoint of incident or worsening nephropathy, including a 44% reduction in the risk of new-onset macroalbuminuria and a 55% reduction in the risk of doubling of serum creatinine. These results were corroborated by the CANVAS Program, which assessed canagliflozin and showed similar renal benefits. The kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are not limited to patients with T2D. Dedicated kidney outcome trials, such as the CREDENCE trial, have further solidified the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The CREDENCE trial, which specifically enrolled patients with DKD, found that canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death by 30%. These findings have led to the recommendation of SGLT2 inhibitors as a first-line therapy for DKD in several clinical guidelines. Moreover, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors extend to patients with nondiabetic kidney disease (NDDK). The DAPA-CKD trial, which included patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) regardless of diabetes status, demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the composite endpoint of sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), ESKD, or renal or CV death by 39%. This trial also highlighted the safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors, with no significant increase in adverse events compared to placebo. The mechanisms underlying the kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are multifaceted. Hemodynamic changes, such as a reduction in intraglomerular pressure, are thought to play a crucial role. Additionally, metabolic improvements, including reductions in hyperglycemia and body weight, contribute to the renal benefits. Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties have also been proposed, although the exact pathways remain under investigation. Safety concerns, particularly the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), have been a subject of interest. However, clinical trials and real-world data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and may even reduce the risk of AKI. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a 28% lower risk of AKI compared to placebo. Real-world evidence from the CVD-REAL study, which analyzed data from over 300,000 patients, also supported the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risk of AKI. In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated robust kidney-protective effects across various patient populations, including those with T2D, DKD, and NDDK. These benefits are supported by a growing body of evidence from both clinical trials and real-world studies. The multifaceted mechanisms of action, coupled with a favorable safety profile, position SGLT2 inhibitors as a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal for the management of CKD.", "References": [{"title": "SGLT2 inhibitors: Mechanisms, benefits, and risks", "authors": "Ele Ferrannini, Stefano Del Prato, Francesco Giorgino", "journal": "Diabetes Care", "year": "2016", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1583", "last page": "1591", "DOI": "10.2337/dc16-0765"}, {"title": "Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes", "authors": "Bernard Zinman, M.D., Mark E.
