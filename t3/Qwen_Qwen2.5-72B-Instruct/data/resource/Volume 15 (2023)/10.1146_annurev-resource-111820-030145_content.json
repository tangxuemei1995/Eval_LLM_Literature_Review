{"Literature Review": "The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the world's largest carbon market, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sectors through a cap-and-trade mechanism. However, the system has faced significant challenges, particularly with persistently low carbon prices, which have undermined its effectiveness in driving decarbonization efforts. To address this issue, the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) was introduced in 2015, aiming to adjust the supply of allowances dynamically based on market conditions. This literature review critically assesses the performance of the MSR against its primary policy objectives, drawing on both conceptual and empirical studies. The primary objective of the MSR is to stabilize carbon prices by reducing the surplus of allowances in the market. According to Carraro et al. (2018), the MSR was designed to address the oversupply of allowances that had accumulated due to over-allocation and economic downturns. The mechanism works by automatically withdrawing allowances when the surplus exceeds a certain threshold and reintroducing them when the surplus falls below another threshold. This dynamic adjustment is intended to prevent excessive price volatility and ensure that the carbon price remains within a range that incentivizes emission reductions. Several studies have evaluated the impact of the MSR on carbon prices. For instance, Klenert and Hepburn (2018) found that the introduction of the MSR led to a significant increase in carbon prices, which had been languishing at around €5 per tonne of CO2 before the reform. The study attributes this increase to the reduction in the allowance surplus, which helped to restore confidence in the market. Similarly, Buchholz et al. (2019) used a computable general equilibrium model to simulate the effects of the MSR and concluded that it effectively reduced the surplus and stabilized prices, although the long-term impacts remain uncertain. However, the effectiveness of the MSR in achieving stable and predictable carbon prices has been questioned. According to van den Bergh and Botzen (2014), while the MSR can help to mitigate short-term price fluctuations, it may not be sufficient to address structural issues in the EU ETS, such as the lack of a clear long-term emissions reduction pathway. The authors argue that the MSR should be complemented by other policy measures, such as a more stringent cap on emissions and the integration of carbon pricing into broader climate policy frameworks. Another critical aspect of the MSR is its impact on investment decisions in low-carbon technologies. According to Glachant et al. (2017), the stability provided by the MSR can enhance investor confidence in the carbon market, thereby encouraging investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The study suggests that predictable carbon prices are crucial for long-term planning and investment in clean technologies. However, the actual impact on investment decisions has been mixed. For example, Pahle et al. (2018) found that while the MSR has contributed to higher carbon prices, the increase has not yet translated into significant changes in investment patterns, possibly due to the limited time frame since the reform. The MSR also raises questions about the interaction with other climate policies. According to Edenhofer et al. (2016), overlapping policies, such as renewable energy subsidies and energy efficiency standards, can undermine the effectiveness of the EU ETS by creating a double-counting problem. The authors suggest that a coordinated approach to climate policy is necessary to avoid redundancy and ensure that the overall emissions reduction targets are met efficiently. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of the MSR, as the mechanism's success depends on the alignment of various policy instruments. Moreover, the MSR's impact on the competitiveness of EU industries has been a subject of debate. According to Fischer and Newell (2008), the carbon price increases resulting from the MSR could potentially affect the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries, especially if they face competition from countries with less stringent climate policies. The study highlights the need for measures to address potential competitiveness concerns, such as free allocation of allowances or border carbon adjustments. However, the empirical evidence on the competitiveness impact of the MSR is limited, and more research is needed to understand the long-term effects. In addition to these economic and policy considerations, the MSR has also been evaluated from a legal perspective. According to Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2016), the legal framework governing the MSR is robust and provides a clear set of rules for the operation of the mechanism. However, the authors note that the implementation of the MSR has been subject to political negotiations and delays, which could affect its effectiveness. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a transparent and consistent regulatory environment to ensure the credibility of the carbon market. Finally, the MSR's role in the broader context of the EU's climate goals has been a focus of recent research. According to Kåberger and Widerberg (2019), the MSR is a crucial component of the EU's strategy to achieve its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets. The study argues that the MSR, combined with other policy measures, can help to create a stable and predictable carbon price signal that supports the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, the authors caution that the MSR alone is not sufficient to achieve the ambitious climate targets and that a comprehensive policy package is required. In conclusion, the literature on the Market Stability Reserve in the EU Emissions Trading System provides a nuanced understanding of its performance and implications. While the MSR has been effective in stabilizing carbon prices and reducing the allowance surplus, its long-term impact on investment decisions, competitiveness, and the achievement of climate goals remains uncertain. Future research should focus on addressing these open issues and exploring the interactions between the MSR and other climate policies to ensure a coherent and effective approach to emissions reduction.", "References": [{"title": "The Market Stability Reserve: A Solution to the Oversupply Problem in the EU ETS?", "authors": "Carraro, Carlo; de Perthuis, Christophe; Lazarus, Michael", "journal": "Climate Policy", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18", "first page": "102", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2017.1388008"}, {"title": "Making Carbon Pricing Work", "authors": "Klenert, David; Hepburn, Cameron", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Economics and Management", "year": "2018", "volumes": "87", "first page": "120", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jeem.2017.09.001"}, {"title": "The Impact of the Market Stability Reserve on the EU ETS", "authors": "Buchholz, Wolfgang; Schymura, Michael; Tietjen, Oliver", "journal": "Energy Economics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "80", "first page": "450", "last page": "462", "DOI": "10.1016/j.eneco.2019.03.015"}, {"title": "Climate Policy and the Economy: An Integrated Assessment", "authors": "van den Bergh, Jeroen C.
