{"Literature Review": "The estimation of the size of nonobserved or shadow economies has been a subject of extensive research, employing both micro and macro methods. This review aims to evaluate the plausibility of differences in the size of the shadow economy as estimated by these methods. The primary focus is on three micro and three macro estimation approaches to determine whether unrealistic discrepancies exist and to explore the reasons behind any observed differences. Micro approaches, such as the survey technique and the consumption-income gap approach, typically involve direct data collection from individuals or households. The survey technique, which involves asking respondents about their involvement in informal economic activities, has been widely used due to its directness and specificity. However, this method can suffer from underreporting and social desirability bias, leading to potentially lower estimates of the shadow economy. The consumption-income gap approach, another micro method, compares reported consumption with reported income to identify discrepancies that may indicate unreported economic activity. This approach is less prone to underreporting but can still be affected by measurement errors and the complexity of household financial behaviors. Macro approaches, on the other hand, use aggregate economic data to estimate the size of the shadow economy. One of the most prominent macro methods is the Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model, which uses a combination of indicators and causes to estimate the shadow economy. The MIMIC model has been criticized for potentially overestimating the size of the shadow economy due to the inclusion of activities that are not strictly part of the informal sector. Another macro approach is the currency demand method, which estimates the shadow economy based on the demand for cash, assuming that a significant portion of cash transactions occurs in the informal sector. This method can be influenced by changes in payment technologies and the overall economic environment, leading to potential overestimations. The electricity consumption method, a third macro approach, correlates electricity consumption with economic activity, assuming that a higher level of unreported economic activity will lead to higher electricity consumption. This method is also subject to various biases, including the impact of weather conditions and technological advancements on electricity usage. When comparing the results of micro and macro approaches, it is evident that macro methods often yield higher estimates of the shadow economy. For instance, MIMIC models have been found to produce estimates that are significantly higher than those obtained through the statistical discrepancy approach. However, this difference can be attributed to the broader scope of activities included in macro approaches. Macro methods typically encompass a wider range of activities, including voluntary work, do-it-yourself activities, and even criminal activities, which are not strictly part of the informal economy. To address the issue of overestimation, adjustments can be made to the MIMIC model to exclude activities that are not part of the informal sector. When such adjustments are made, the estimated size of the shadow economy using the MIMIC approach becomes more comparable to the estimates obtained from micro survey approaches. This suggests that the higher estimates produced by macro methods are not necessarily unrealistic but rather reflect a broader definition of the shadow economy. Furthermore, the inclusion of a wider range of activities in macro approaches can lead to more accurate estimates of the shadow economy. For example, the MIMIC model, when adjusted for double-counting and other biases, provides estimates that are closer to those obtained from micro surveys. This finding challenges the notion that macro approaches are inherently flawed and rely on unrealistic assumptions. In conclusion, while there are differences in the size of the shadow economy estimated by micro and macro methods, these differences are not necessarily implausible. Macro approaches, by nature, cover a broader range of activities, leading to higher estimates. However, with appropriate adjustments, the estimates from macro methods can align more closely with those from micro methods. Therefore, the claim that macro approaches are unrealistically high and based on unrealistic assumptions must be reconsidered. Future research should continue to refine these methods to improve the accuracy and comparability of shadow economy estimates.", "References": [{"title": "A public choice approach to the economics of tax evasion", "authors": "Bruno S.
