{"Literature Review": "Food losses in agrifood systems have garnered significant attention since being placed on the global agenda by the United Nations and the G20 in 2015. Despite this, the scale of the problem remains substantial, largely due to the conflation of food loss and food waste in measurement practices and the lack of comprehensive data. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the measurements, causes, and determinants of food loss, as well as the interventions designed to mitigate it. The first step in addressing food loss is understanding its measurement. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food loss is defined as the decrease in edible food mass throughout the part of the supply chain that specifically leads to edible food for human consumption (FAO, 2011). However, the lack of standardized measurement methods has led to inconsistencies in data collection and reporting. For instance, a study by Gustavsson et al. (2011) highlighted the need for a more uniform approach to measuring food loss, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between pre-harvest, post-harvest, and processing stages. Similarly, Lipinski et al. (2013) argued that the absence of a common metric hinders the ability to compare and aggregate data across different regions and sectors. The causes of food loss are multifaceted and vary across different stages of the agrifood system. At the production stage, factors such as poor harvesting techniques, inadequate storage facilities, and pest infestations contribute significantly to food loss (Kumar et al., 2015). Post-harvest losses are often attributed to inefficient transportation and handling practices, as well as a lack of proper cooling and preservation technologies (Buzby et al., 2014). In the processing and distribution stages, issues such as overproduction, quality standards, and market fluctuations play a crucial role (Parfitt et al., 2010). Determining the determinants of food loss involves analyzing both structural and behavioral factors. Structural determinants include infrastructure deficiencies, policy frameworks, and market dynamics. For example, a study by FAO (2019) found that inadequate infrastructure, particularly in developing countries, is a major contributor to food loss. Behavioral determinants, on the other hand, encompass farmer practices, consumer behavior, and retailer policies. A study by Quested et al. (2013) highlighted the role of consumer attitudes and behaviors in generating food waste, which can indirectly affect food loss through demand-side pressures. Interventions to reduce food loss have been proposed at various levels of the agrifood system. At the production level, improving agricultural practices and investing in better storage facilities can significantly reduce losses (Kumar et al., 2015). Post-harvest interventions focus on enhancing transportation and handling practices, as well as promoting the use of appropriate preservation technologies (Buzby et al., 2014). In the processing and distribution stages, interventions aim to optimize supply chain management and address market inefficiencies (Parfitt et al., 2010). However, the effectiveness of these interventions is contingent upon the availability of accurate and granular data. The paucity of microdata poses a significant challenge in identifying intervention hot spots and assessing the impact of interventions (Lipinski et al., 2013). Standardized measurements and improved data collection methods are essential to address this gap. For instance, a study by FAO (2019) recommended the development of a global food loss database to facilitate data sharing and analysis. Moreover, integrating feedback loops and cascading effects across the value chain is crucial for a holistic understanding of food loss. This involves recognizing the interdependencies between different stages of the agrifood system and the potential trade-offs and synergies of interventions (Gustavsson et al., 2011). For example, reducing food loss at the production stage may have positive spillover effects on post-harvest and processing stages, but it could also lead to unintended consequences if not managed properly (Parfitt et al., 2010). In conclusion, while progress has been made in addressing food loss, the lack of standardized measurements and comprehensive data remains a significant barrier. Future research should focus on developing and implementing standardized measurement methods, improving microdata collection, and integrating feedback loops across the agrifood system. Such efforts will not only help identify intervention hot spots but also assess the socioeconomic, environmental, and food security impacts of food loss reduction strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Global food losses and food waste: Extent, causes and prevention", "authors": "Johan Gustavsson, Christel Cederberg, Ulf Sonesson, Robert van Otterdijk, Alexandre Meybeck", "journal": "Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations", "year": "2011", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodpol.2011.07.001"}, {"title": "Reducing food loss and waste", "authors": "Brian Lipinski, Craig Hanson, Richard Waite, Tim Searchinger, Ralph Heimlich, Janet V.
