{"Literature Review": "Obesity has emerged as a significant global health issue, affecting both developed and developing countries. However, the impact of obesity on life expectancy varies across different regions and by gender. This literature review synthesizes existing research to provide a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy from a global perspective. The prevalence of obesity has been increasing worldwide, but the rates differ significantly between developed and developing countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of obesity in high-income countries is generally higher than in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2018). For instance, in the United States, the obesity rate among adults was 42.4% in 2017-2018 (Hales et al., 2020), while in sub-Saharan Africa, the adult obesity rate was around 13% in 2016 (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2017). These differences can be attributed to variations in dietary patterns, physical activity levels, and socioeconomic conditions. Sociodemographic factors play a crucial role in the distribution of obesity. In developed countries, obesity is more prevalent among lower socioeconomic groups, whereas in developing countries, it is often more common among higher socioeconomic groups (Monteiro et al., 2004). This pattern suggests that the transition from traditional diets to Westernized diets, characterized by high-calorie and high-fat foods, is a significant contributor to obesity in developing countries (Popkin, 2001). The relationship between obesity and life expectancy is complex and multifaceted. Studies have consistently shown that obesity is associated with a reduced life expectancy. For example, a meta-analysis by Flegal et al. (2013) found that individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30-35 kg/m² had a 27% higher risk of premature death compared to those with a BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m². Similarly, a study by Prospective Studies Collaboration (2009) reported that each 5 kg/m² increase in BMI was associated with a 30% increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 40% increase in the risk of death from cancer. However, the impact of obesity on life expectancy differs between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, the negative effects of obesity on life expectancy are more pronounced due to the higher prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (Whitlock et al., 2009). In contrast, in developing countries, the burden of infectious diseases and undernutrition may overshadow the impact of obesity on life expectancy (Ezzati et al., 2002). Gender also plays a role in the relationship between obesity and life expectancy. Women tend to have a higher prevalence of obesity than men, but the impact on life expectancy may differ. A study by Berrington de Gonzalez et al. (2010) found that the excess risk of death associated with obesity was slightly higher for women than for men. This difference could be attributed to the higher prevalence of obesity-related conditions such as breast cancer and uterine cancer in women. At the population level, the impact of obesity on life expectancy is influenced by the overall health status and healthcare systems of a country. In developed countries, where healthcare systems are more advanced, the negative effects of obesity on life expectancy may be mitigated by early detection and treatment of obesity-related conditions (Mokdad et al., 2001). In developing countries, limited access to healthcare and poor health infrastructure exacerbate the negative impact of obesity on life expectancy (Ezzati et al., 2002). Public policies aimed at addressing obesity have been implemented in both developed and developing countries, but their effectiveness varies. In developed countries, policies such as taxation on sugary drinks, food labeling, and school-based interventions have shown some success in reducing obesity rates (Swinburn et al., 2011). In developing countries, the focus has been on improving nutrition and physical activity through community-based programs and public education campaigns (Lobstein et al., 2007). Despite these efforts, the global obesity epidemic continues to pose a significant challenge to public health. The heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy highlight the need for tailored interventions that consider the specific sociodemographic and economic contexts of different regions. Future research should focus on identifying effective strategies to prevent and manage obesity, particularly in developing countries where the burden of obesity is expected to increase in the coming decades. In conclusion, the relationship between obesity and life expectancy is complex and varies across different regions and by gender. While obesity is associated with a reduced life expectancy, the impact is more pronounced in developed countries and among women. Public policies and interventions must be context-specific to effectively address the global obesity epidemic and improve health outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Worldwide trends in body-mass index, underweight, overweight, and obesity from 1975 to 2016: a pooled analysis of 2416 population-based measurement studies in 128·9 million children, adolescents, and adults", "authors": "NCD Risk Factor Collaboration", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2017", "volumes": "390", "first page": "2627", "last page": "2642", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32129-X"}, {"title": "Prevalence of obesity among adults and youth: United States, 2017–2018", "authors": "Cynthia L.
