{"Literature Review": "Agroecology has emerged as a promising approach to address the multifaceted challenges of the agricultural and food system, including environmental degradation, social inequity, and economic instability. This literature review explores the potential of agroecology to transform the agri-food system into a more sustainable and resilient model, emphasizing the need for a multiscale and multiactor approach. Agroecology integrates ecological principles and practices into agricultural systems to enhance biodiversity, soil health, and resource efficiency while promoting social and economic equity. Despite its potential, the widespread adoption of agroecology faces significant barriers, including economic viability, technological limitations, and policy constraints. Economic viability is a critical factor for the adoption of agroecological practices. Farmers and other food system actors must see tangible benefits in terms of profitability and risk management. Studies have shown that agroecological practices can lead to higher yields and better economic returns over time, particularly through reduced input costs and improved soil fertility. However, the initial transition period can be challenging due to the need for investment in new practices and the potential for lower short-term yields. To overcome these challenges, financial incentives and support mechanisms are essential. Government subsidies, market access, and fair trade practices can help bridge the economic gap during the transition phase. Additionally, innovative business models, such as community-supported agriculture (CSA) and direct marketing, can provide stable income streams for agroecological farmers. New and emerging technologies play a crucial role in the agroecological transformation. Digitalization, precision agriculture, and advanced breeding techniques can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of agroecological practices. For example, precision agriculture technologies can optimize resource use and reduce waste, while advanced breeding techniques can develop crops that are more resilient to climate change and pests. However, the integration of these technologies must be done carefully to ensure they align with agroecological principles. Over-reliance on technology can undermine the ecological and social dimensions of agroecology, leading to unintended consequences such as increased dependency on external inputs and loss of traditional knowledge. Effective policy design is essential for the large-scale adoption of agroecology. Policies should support the development and dissemination of agroecological practices, provide financial and technical assistance to farmers, and create market incentives for sustainable products. International frameworks, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), can guide national and regional policies to promote agroecology. At the local level, participatory governance and co-management approaches can empower communities to take ownership of their agroecological initiatives. These approaches involve stakeholders in decision-making processes, ensuring that policies are tailored to local contexts and needs. A multiscale systems approach is necessary to address the complex and interconnected nature of the agri-food system. This approach involves considering the interactions between different scales, from individual farms to regional landscapes and global markets. It requires a holistic understanding of the biophysical, socioeconomic, and cultural factors that influence the agri-food system. Sustainability indicators and assessment methods are crucial tools for monitoring and evaluating the performance of agroecological systems at various scales. Indicators should cover a range of dimensions, including environmental, social, and economic aspects, to provide a comprehensive picture of sustainability. To support the large-scale adoption of agroecology, six key areas of attention are identified: Economic Support, Technological Integration, Policy Frameworks, Participatory Governance, Sustainability Indicators, and Research and Education. In conclusion, agroecology holds great promise for transforming the agri-food system into a more sustainable and resilient model. However, achieving this transformation requires a multiscale and multiactor approach that addresses economic, technological, and policy challenges. By focusing on the six areas of needed attention, we can create a supportive environment for the large-scale adoption of agroecology, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future for agriculture and food systems.", "References": [{"title": "Agroecology and the design of climate change-resilient food systems", "authors": "Miguel A.
