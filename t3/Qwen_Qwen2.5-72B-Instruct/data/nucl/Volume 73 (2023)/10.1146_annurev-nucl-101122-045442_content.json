{"Literature Review": "Lepton flavor universality (LFU) and lepton flavor violation (LFV) have emerged as critical areas of investigation in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). These phenomena are particularly relevant in the context of b and c quark decays, where recent experimental data suggest deviations from the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and experimental aspects of LFU and LFV in b and c decays, highlighting the potential for new discoveries. The Standard Model predicts that leptons of different flavors (e, μ, τ) should interact identically, a principle known as lepton flavor universality (LFU). However, several recent measurements have indicated possible violations of this principle. For instance, the LHCb collaboration has reported discrepancies in the ratios of branching fractions involving different lepton flavors in B meson decays, such as R_K and R_{K^*} (Aaij et al., 2019; Aaij et al., 2021). These ratios, defined as the ratio of branching fractions of B -> K μ^+ μ^- to B -> K e^+ e^- and B -> K^* μ^+ μ^- to B -> K^* e^+ e^-, respectively, have been measured to deviate from the SM prediction of unity. Similar discrepancies have been observed in other observables, such as R_D and R_{D^*} in B -> D(*) τ ν decays (Huschle et al., 2015; Sato et al., 2016). Theoretical models that can explain these deviations often involve new particles or interactions that couple differently to different lepton flavors. One such model is the introduction of leptoquarks, which can mediate flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) and lead to LFU violations (Bauer et al., 2015; Hiller et al., 2014). Another possibility is the presence of new gauge bosons, such as Z' or W', which can also induce LFU-violating effects (Crivellin et al., 2017; Altmannshofer et al., 2017). Lepton flavor violation (LFV) is a more stringent test of BSM physics, as it is strictly forbidden in the SM. Observations of LFV processes would provide direct evidence of new physics. While no definitive LFV signals have been observed yet, the observed LFU violations suggest that LFV could be within reach of current and future experiments. For example, the decay B_s -> μ^+ μ^- has been measured with high precision, and any deviation from the SM prediction could indicate LFV (Aaij et al., 2017). Additionally, the decay B -> K τ^+ τ^- is another promising channel for LFV searches (Descotes-Genon et al., 2016). The relationship between LFU and LFV is well-established in theoretical frameworks. Models that predict LFU violations often also predict LFV at some level. For instance, the presence of leptoquarks can lead to both LFU and LFV effects (Bauer et al., 2015). Similarly, new gauge bosons can induce both types of violations (Altmannshofer et al., 2017). Therefore, the observed LFU violations in b and c decays provide a strong motivation to search for LFV in these processes. Experimental efforts to probe LFU and LFV in b and c decays are ongoing and will continue to improve with the upgrades of existing facilities. The LHCb experiment, in particular, has been at the forefront of these searches. The LHCb Upgrade I and II will significantly enhance the sensitivity to LFU and LFV observables, allowing for more precise measurements and potentially uncovering new physics (LHCb Collaboration, 2018). Other experiments, such as Belle II, are also expected to contribute to these searches with increased luminosity and improved detector performance (Belle II Collaboration, 2018). In conclusion, the study of lepton flavor universality and lepton flavor violation in b and c decays represents a promising avenue for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model. The observed deviations from SM predictions in LFU observables suggest that new physics may be within reach. Theoretical models that can explain these deviations often predict LFV at some level, making the search for LFV a crucial component of these investigations. With the ongoing and planned upgrades of experimental facilities, the field stands a concrete chance of ushering in genuinely unexpected discoveries.", "References": [{"title": "Measurement of the ratio of branching fractions $R_K = \\mathcal{B}(B^+ \\to K^+ \\mu^+ \\mu^-)/\\mathcal{B}(B^+ \\to K^+ e^+ e^-)$", "authors": "R.
