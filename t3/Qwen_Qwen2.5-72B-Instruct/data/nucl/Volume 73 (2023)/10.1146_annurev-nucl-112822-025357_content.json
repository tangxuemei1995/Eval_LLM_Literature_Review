{"Literature Review": "Ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray astronomy has emerged as a critical field in the study of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, particularly with the recent detection of PeVatrons and photons above 1 PeV. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge in this area, highlighting key findings and methodologies. The detection of UHE gamma-rays has been significantly advanced by the development of extensive air shower (EAS) detection techniques. Traditional cosmic ray (CR) measurement methods, such as those employed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have enabled the identification of UHE gamma-ray sources within our Galaxy. These techniques are crucial because they allow for the broadening of the field of view, enabling the measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources, which is essential for understanding particle propagation and injection processes. One of the most significant discoveries in UHE gamma-ray astronomy is the identification of PeVatrons, or sources capable of accelerating particles to energies above 1 PeV. The detection of 12 PeVatrons has been a landmark achievement, providing insights into the mechanisms of particle acceleration in various celestial objects. Nearly all known celestial object types that emit in the TeV band have been found to emit UHE photons, suggesting a commonality in the underlying physical processes. The horizon for UHE gamma-rays within our Galaxy is well-defined due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. This absorption limits the distance over which UHE gamma-rays can travel, making their detection a powerful tool for probing nearby sources. The study of UHE gamma-rays in the deep Kleinâ€“Nishina regime, where leptonic processes are suppressed, further emphasizes the importance of hadronic sources. UHE gamma-ray detection can thus help locate and identify hadronic radiation sources, contributing to the long-standing quest for the origin of cosmic rays (CRs) around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula stands out as a focal point in UHE gamma-ray astronomy, with measured photon emissions up to 1 PeV. The presence of such high-energy photons in the absence of hadronic processes suggests the existence of an extreme accelerator of e+ e- pairs. This finding challenges existing models of particle acceleration and highlights the need for further investigation into the mechanisms driving these extreme energies. The use of EAS detection techniques has also enabled the measurement of muon content, which is a critical parameter for distinguishing between hadronic and leptonic sources. The muon content provides valuable information about the nature of the primary particles and the conditions within the source environment. By combining muon measurements with other observational data, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the physical processes at play in UHE gamma-ray sources. In conclusion, UHE gamma-ray astronomy is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. The detection of PeVatrons and the measurement of UHE photons from various sources have opened new windows into the study of particle acceleration and cosmic ray origins. Future research will likely benefit from continued advancements in EAS detection techniques and the integration of multi-messenger astronomy, which combines observations across different wavelengths and particle types to provide a more complete picture of the universe's most energetic events.", "References": [{"title": "Detection of ultra-high-energy gamma rays from the Crab Nebula", "authors": "F.
