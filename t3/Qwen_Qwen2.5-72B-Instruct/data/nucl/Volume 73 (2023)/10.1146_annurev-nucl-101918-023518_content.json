{"Literature Review": "The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory has emerged as a pivotal facility for neutrino physics, particularly for the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The COHERENT Collaboration, utilizing the unique capabilities of the SNS, has made groundbreaking measurements that have significant implications for both fundamental physics and astrophysics. This literature review summarizes the key findings and future prospects of the COHERENT experiment at the SNS. The SNS provides an intense flux of neutrinos from pion decay at rest, making it an ideal source for CEvNS studies. The first detection of CEvNS was reported by the COHERENT Collaboration in 2017 using a CsI[Na] detector, marking a significant milestone in neutrino physics. This measurement confirmed the theoretical predictions of CEvNS, which had been proposed over four decades earlier. The detection of CEvNS is crucial because it offers a sensitive probe for testing the weak interaction and can provide insights into the structure of atomic nuclei. Following the initial detection, the COHERENT Collaboration extended its measurements to other target materials, including NaI(Tl) and Ge. The use of multiple target materials allows for a comprehensive study of the CEvNS process across different nuclear environments. The second CEvNS measurement, using a NaI(Tl) detector, was published in 2018 and provided additional confirmation of the CEvNS signal. These measurements have not only validated the theoretical framework but also set stringent limits on new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as light dark matter and non-standard neutrino interactions. The SNS neutrino source is particularly well-suited for exploring inelastic neutrino-nucleus interactions, which are of great interest for understanding the behavior of neutrinos in extreme astrophysical environments, such as supernovae. Inelastic scattering processes can provide valuable information about the energy distribution and flavor composition of neutrinos emitted during core-collapse supernovae. The COHERENT experiment's future plans include detailed studies of inelastic neutrino-nucleus interactions, which could shed light on the mechanisms driving supernova explosions and the synthesis of heavy elements. Another exciting aspect of the COHERENT program is the search for sub-GeV dark matter particles. Dark matter, a dominant component of the universe's mass, remains one of the most significant unsolved problems in modern physics. The SNS neutrino source, with its high-intensity and well-characterized neutrino flux, provides a unique opportunity to search for dark matter particles in the sub-GeV mass range. The COHERENT Collaboration is developing advanced detector technologies to enhance sensitivity to these elusive particles. The COHERENT experiment's success at the SNS has also paved the way for future neutrino experiments. The next generation of detectors, such as those based on liquid argon and germanium, will further improve the precision of CEvNS measurements and expand the scope of the physics program. These advancements will not only refine our understanding of neutrino interactions but also contribute to the broader fields of nuclear physics and astrophysics. In conclusion, the COHERENT experiment at the SNS has made significant contributions to the field of neutrino physics through its pioneering measurements of CEvNS. The ongoing and planned experiments at the SNS promise to deepen our understanding of fundamental physics and astrophysical phenomena, making the SNS a cornerstone of neutrino research for years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Observation of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering", "authors": "Y.
