{"Literature Review": "The study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons has been a focal point in particle physics, providing crucial insights into the fundamental interactions governed by the Standard Model (SM). These decays are particularly important for testing the SM through the measurement of decay constants and form factors, which are essential parameters in understanding the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the structure of hadrons. Additionally, they offer a unique window into the unitarity of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the principle of lepton flavor universality (LFU).\n\nRecent advancements in both theoretical and experimental techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to study these decays. Theoretical frameworks, such as lattice QCD, have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing for more precise calculations of decay constants and form factors. For instance, the work by Davies et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of lattice QCD to compute the decay constant of the D+ meson with unprecedented precision, which is crucial for understanding the weak decays of charmed hadrons.\n\nExperimental efforts, particularly those at the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII), have also made significant contributions. BESIII, located at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPCII), operates near the production thresholds of charmed hadrons, providing a rich dataset for detailed studies. The high-luminosity environment at BESIII has enabled precise measurements of various decay modes, including the purely leptonic decay D+ -> mu+ nu_mu and the semileptonic decay D0 -> K- e+ nu_e. The results from BESIII, as reported by Ablikim et al. (2018), have provided stringent tests of the SM predictions and have helped refine our understanding of the CKM matrix elements.\n\nThe precision of these measurements is critical for testing the unitarity of the CKM matrix, which is a cornerstone of the SM. The CKM matrix describes the mixing of quarks and is essential for understanding CP violation and the hierarchy of quark masses. The work by Artuso et al. (2016) highlighted the importance of precise measurements of semileptonic decays in constraining the CKM matrix elements, particularly V_{cd} and V_{cs}. These elements are crucial for verifying the consistency of the SM and for searching for potential new physics beyond the SM.\n\nLepton flavor universality (LFU) is another key aspect tested through the study of semileptonic decays. LFU posits that the strength of the weak interaction is the same for all leptons, regardless of their mass. Any deviation from this principle would indicate new physics. The recent measurements of the ratio R(D) and R(D*) by the Belle collaboration, as reported by Hokuue et al. (2017), have shown intriguing discrepancies with the SM predictions, suggesting possible violations of LFU. These findings have sparked considerable interest in the particle physics community and have motivated further experimental and theoretical investigations.\n\nThe study of charmed baryons, such as Lambda_c, Xi_c, and Omega_c, has also seen significant progress. The decays of these baryons provide additional constraints on the CKM matrix and offer insights into the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. The work by Aaij et al. (2017) on the semileptonic decay Lambda_c+ -> p mu+ nu_mu has provided valuable data for testing the SM and for understanding the structure of charmed baryons. The precision of these measurements is crucial for validating theoretical models and for identifying any deviations from the SM.\n\nTheoretical developments in the context of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) have also played a significant role in advancing our understanding of charmed hadron decays. HQET simplifies the description of heavy quark systems by separating the dynamics of the heavy quark from the light degrees of freedom. The work by Neubert (1994) laid the foundation for using HQET to calculate form factors and decay rates, which has been instrumental in interpreting experimental data. The application of HQET to the study of semileptonic decays of charmed baryons, as discussed by Flynn et al. (2015), has provided a robust framework for understanding the underlying physics.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons continues to be a vibrant area of research, driven by both theoretical advancements and experimental precision. The interplay between lattice QCD, HQET, and high-precision experiments at facilities like BESIII and Belle has significantly deepened our understanding of the SM and has opened new avenues for exploring potential new physics. Future studies will likely benefit from the continued development of theoretical tools and the accumulation of more data, particularly from upcoming experiments at the LHCb and Belle II collaborations.", "References": [{"title": "High-Precision Determination of the D+ Meson Decay Constant from Lattice QCD", "authors": "C.
