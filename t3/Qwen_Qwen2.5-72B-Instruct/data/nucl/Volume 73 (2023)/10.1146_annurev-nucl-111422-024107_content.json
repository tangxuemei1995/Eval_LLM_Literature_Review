{"Literature Review": "The Hubble tension, a significant discrepancy between the locally measured Hubble constant H0 and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the standard ΛCDM model, has emerged as one of the most pressing issues in modern cosmology. This tension has grown to a level of statistical significance that cannot be easily dismissed as a result of systematic errors or measurement uncertainties. The local measurement of H0 using the cosmic distance ladder, primarily through observations of Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae, yields a value of approximately 73.5 ± 1.4 km/s/Mpc (Riess et al., 2021). In contrast, the Planck satellite's precise measurements of the CMB, when interpreted within the ΛCDM framework, suggest a lower value of 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc (Planck Collaboration, 2020). This discrepancy, often referred to as the 'Hubble tension,' has reached a significance of about 4.4σ, indicating a potential breakdown in our understanding of the universe's expansion history. The Hubble tension has prompted a re-evaluation of both observational techniques and theoretical models. On the observational front, efforts have been made to refine and cross-check the measurements of H0. For instance, the SH0ES (Supernovae and H0 for the Equation of State) collaboration has continued to improve the precision of their local H0 measurements by incorporating new data and reducing systematic uncertainties (Riess et al., 2021). Similarly, independent methods, such as gravitational lens time delays and the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), have been employed to provide additional constraints on H0 (Wong et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021). These independent measurements generally support the higher value of H0 derived from the cosmic distance ladder, further solidifying the tension. On the theoretical side, the Hubble tension has led to a renewed interest in models that modify the early Universe physics of the ΛCDM paradigm. One of the most promising approaches is the introduction of early dark energy (EDE), a form of dark energy that becomes significant only during the early stages of the universe's evolution, before recombination. EDE can affect the expansion rate during the radiation-dominated era, leading to a different prediction for the CMB anisotropies and thus altering the inferred value of H0 (Poulin et al., 2019). This modification can help reconcile the tension between the local and CMB-derived values of H0. The EDE model is particularly appealing because it introduces minimal changes to the late-time cosmology, preserving the success of the ΛCDM model in explaining a wide range of observational data, including the large-scale structure of the universe and the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) (Smith et al., 2020). However, the EDE scenario must also satisfy stringent constraints from other cosmological probes. For example, the abundance of light elements produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) provides a robust test of early Universe physics. Models that significantly alter the expansion rate during BBN can lead to discrepancies in the predicted abundances of helium and deuterium, which are well-constrained by observations (Cooke et al., 2018). Recent studies have explored the parameter space of EDE models and found that a small fraction of dark energy (typically less than 1%) during the radiation-dominated era can alleviate the Hubble tension without violating other observational constraints (Poulin et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020). These models predict a slight increase in the sound horizon at recombination, which can be detected through high-precision measurements of the CMB and BAO. Future experiments, such as the Simons Observatory and the Euclid mission, will play a crucial role in testing these predictions and potentially resolving the Hubble tension (Ade et al., 2019). In addition to EDE, other early Universe modifications have been proposed to address the Hubble tension. These include models with additional relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g., extra neutrino species), modified gravity theories, and interactions between dark matter and dark energy (Di Valentino et al., 2020). Each of these scenarios faces its own set of challenges and constraints, but they collectively highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to understanding the early Universe. The Hubble tension remains a critical issue in cosmology, driving both observational and theoretical advancements. While the introduction of early dark energy offers a promising solution, it is essential to continue refining measurements and exploring alternative models. The upcoming generation of cosmological surveys will provide the necessary data to test these ideas and potentially uncover new insights into the fundamental nature of the universe.", "References": [{"title": "Cosmology from Cosmic Shear with DES Science Verification Data", "authors": "A.
