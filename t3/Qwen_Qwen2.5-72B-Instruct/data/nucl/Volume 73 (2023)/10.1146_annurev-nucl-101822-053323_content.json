{"Literature Review": "Vector boson scattering (VBS) is a critical process for understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This process is particularly important because it involves the self-interactions of vector bosons and their interactions with the Higgs boson, which are essential for probing the nature of EWSB. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC) provide unique opportunities to study these interactions in detail, offering insights into potential new physics beyond the SM. Recent experimental measurements of VBS at the LHC have focused on the production of vector boson pairs in association with two jets, which is a clean signature for VBS. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported several significant results in this area, using data sets recorded at various center-of-mass energies. These measurements are crucial for testing the SM predictions and searching for deviations that could indicate new physics. One of the key aspects of VBS is the measurement of the production cross sections of vector boson pairs, such as WW, WZ, and ZZ. The ATLAS collaboration has reported precise measurements of the WW and WZ production cross sections in association with two jets, using data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. These measurements are consistent with the SM predictions but also set stringent limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs), which are sensitive to new physics contributions. Similarly, the CMS collaboration has measured the ZZ production cross section in the same channel, finding good agreement with the SM expectations. The precision of these measurements is crucial for constraining models of new physics. For instance, the ATLAS and CMS results on WW and WZ production have been used to set limits on the scale of new physics contributing to VBS. These limits are typically expressed in terms of the energy scale Λ, where deviations from the SM predictions become significant. The current limits suggest that any new physics scale must be above several TeV, which is beyond the direct reach of the LHC. Another important aspect of VBS is the search for resonances that could be produced in these processes. Such resonances could be signatures of new particles or states predicted by theories beyond the SM, such as technicolor or composite Higgs models. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have performed extensive searches for such resonances in the diboson final states, using large data sets collected at 13 TeV. While no significant excesses have been observed, the searches have set stringent upper limits on the production cross sections of potential resonances, further constraining the parameter space of new physics models. The HL-LHC will provide even larger data samples, allowing for more precise measurements of VBS and enhanced sensitivity to new physics. The increased luminosity will enable the detection of rarer processes and the measurement of differential cross sections with higher precision. This will be particularly important for testing the SM predictions and searching for deviations that could indicate new physics. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have outlined detailed plans for the HL-LHC, including the development of advanced analysis techniques and the use of machine learning algorithms to improve the signal-to-background ratio. In addition to the experimental efforts, theoretical developments are also crucial for interpreting the VBS measurements. Theoretical calculations of the VBS cross sections and distributions have been refined to include higher-order corrections and to account for the effects of initial-state radiation and parton distribution functions. These improvements are essential for achieving the necessary precision to test the SM and to search for new physics. The study of VBS at the LHC is a multifaceted effort that combines precise experimental measurements with advanced theoretical calculations. The results obtained so far have provided valuable insights into the nature of EWSB and have set stringent limits on new physics. As the LHC continues to operate and the HL-LHC comes online, the prospects for discovering new physics through VBS are promising. The continued collaboration between experimentalists and theorists will be essential for realizing the full potential of VBS studies at the LHC.", "References": [{"title": "Measurement of the WW and WZ production cross sections in association with two jets in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector", "authors": "G.
