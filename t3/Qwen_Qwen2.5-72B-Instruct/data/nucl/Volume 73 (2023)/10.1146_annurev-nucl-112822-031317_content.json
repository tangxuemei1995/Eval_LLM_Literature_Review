{"Literature Review": "The study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced our understanding of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its properties. Jet quenching, a phenomenon where jets lose energy as they traverse the QGP, has been a key tool in probing the transport properties of this medium. Recent theoretical and phenomenological developments have shed light on the medium response to jet energy loss, which includes both the thermalization and propagation of energy deposited by jets. This review aims to provide an overview of these developments, focusing on the weakly and strongly coupled approaches, the effects of medium response on jet observables, and the unique signatures in jet-hadron correlations. Jet quenching was first observed in experiments at RHIC and LHC, where the suppression of high-pT hadrons and jets in central heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton collisions indicated significant energy loss in the QGP. Theoretical models have since been developed to describe this energy loss, with two main approaches: weakly coupled and strongly coupled. Weakly coupled approaches, such as the BDMPS-Z formalism, treat the QGP as a dilute gas of partons and calculate the energy loss through multiple scattering processes. On the other hand, strongly coupled approaches, inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence, consider the QGP as a strongly interacting fluid and use holographic methods to compute energy loss. The medium response to jet energy loss is a complex phenomenon that involves the thermalization and propagation of the energy deposited by jets. In weakly coupled scenarios, the energy deposited by jets can be modeled using hydrodynamics, where the energy is treated as a perturbation to the background QGP flow. This approach has been successful in explaining the collective flow patterns observed in heavy-ion collisions. Strongly coupled approaches, however, predict a more rapid thermalization of the deposited energy, leading to a different pattern of medium excitation. The effects of medium response on jet observables are multifaceted. One of the most significant effects is the modification of jet shapes and substructure. Jets traversing the QGP can lose energy and momentum, leading to a broadening of the jet cone and a reduction in the energy of the leading particles. This effect has been observed in experimental data and is a crucial signature of jet quenching. Additionally, the medium response can lead to the production of additional particles, which can be detected in jet-hadron correlations. These correlations provide a direct probe of the in-medium dynamics of jets and the properties of the QGP. Jet-induced medium excitation is a critical component in understanding the interplay between jets and the QGP. The energy deposited by jets can create a localized region of high temperature and density, which can be detected through the emission of soft particles. This phenomenon, known as the 'jet wake,' has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. The jet wake can be characterized by the angular distribution of soft particles around the jet axis, which provides information about the energy deposition and the transport properties of the QGP. Recent experimental data from the LHC have provided new insights into jet-induced medium excitation. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured jet-hadron correlations in Pb-Pb collisions and observed a significant enhancement of soft particle production in the direction of the jet. These measurements are consistent with the predictions of jet-induced medium excitation and provide strong evidence for the existence of the jet wake. Theoretical models have been developed to describe these correlations, incorporating both weakly and strongly coupled approaches. In conclusion, the study of medium response and jet-hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions has provided valuable insights into the properties of the QGP. Jet quenching and jet-induced medium excitation are essential components in understanding the in-medium dynamics of jets and the transport properties of the QGP. Future research will focus on refining theoretical models and improving experimental techniques to further explore these phenomena and extract precise information about the QGP.", "References": [{"title": "Formation of dense partonic matter in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC: Experimental evaluation by the PHENIX collaboration", "authors": "K.
