{"Literature Review": "The top quark, being the heaviest known elementary particle, has a unique position in the Standard Model (SM) and is a focal point for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This literature review delves into various BSM scenarios where the top quark plays a crucial role, particularly in addressing the hierarchy problem, flavor physics, and dark matter interactions. The hierarchy problem, which concerns the large discrepancy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale, is one of the most pressing issues in particle physics. Many BSM models aim to stabilize the weak scale by introducing new particles that cancel the quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass. One prominent class of such models is supersymmetry (SUSY), where each SM particle has a superpartner. In SUSY models, the top quark's superpartners, the stop squarks, play a critical role in stabilizing the Higgs mass. The stop squarks must be relatively light to effectively cancel the large contributions from the top quark loop, leading to a rich phenomenology at colliders. For instance, the production and decay of stop squarks can provide distinctive signatures, such as jets, missing transverse energy, and leptons, which can be searched for at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. Another approach to addressing the hierarchy problem is through composite Higgs models, where the Higgs boson is a bound state of new strongly interacting particles. In these models, the top quark is often a composite state as well, leading to the existence of top partners. These top partners can have masses in the TeV range and can be produced at the LHC. Their decays can lead to multi-jet and multi-lepton final states, providing clear signals of new physics [2]. The presence of top partners also affects the Higgs couplings, which can be probed through precision measurements at the LHC and future colliders [3]. In the realm of flavor physics, the top quark's unique properties make it a valuable probe for BSM physics. The top quark's large Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson suggests that it may be sensitive to new physics effects. Models of flavor, such as those based on horizontal symmetries or extra dimensions, often predict deviations from the SM in top quark couplings and decays. For example, flavor-violating processes involving the top quark, such as t → c γ or t → c Z, can be enhanced in certain BSM scenarios [4]. These processes are highly suppressed in the SM but can be observable in experiments if new physics is present. The LHC and future colliders will play a crucial role in testing these predictions and constraining BSM models. Dark matter (DM) is another area where the top quark can play a significant role. In many DM models, the top quark can mediate interactions between DM and the SM sector. For instance, in models with vector-like fermions, the top quark can couple to DM through a mediator particle, leading to a rich phenomenology. The production of DM at colliders can be accompanied by top quark pairs, resulting in events with large missing transverse energy and jets. These signals can be used to search for DM at the LHC and other colliders [5]. Additionally, direct detection experiments can probe the interactions of DM with the top quark, providing complementary constraints on BSM models [6]. The interplay between the top quark and BSM physics is further highlighted in models of composite dark matter, where the top quark can be part of a composite sector that includes DM. In these models, the top quark can mediate the interactions between the composite sector and the SM, leading to novel collider and direct detection signatures [7]. The top quark's role in these models can also affect the relic density of DM, providing a connection between collider physics and cosmology. In summary, the top quark is a key player in various BSM scenarios, offering a rich phenomenology that can be probed at colliders and through precision measurements. The unique properties of the top quark, such as its large mass and strong couplings, make it a powerful tool for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model. Future experiments at the LHC and other colliders, as well as direct and indirect DM searches, will continue to shed light on the nature of BSM physics and the role of the top quark in these scenarios.", "References": [{"title": "Stop Squark Searches at the LHC", "authors": "A.
