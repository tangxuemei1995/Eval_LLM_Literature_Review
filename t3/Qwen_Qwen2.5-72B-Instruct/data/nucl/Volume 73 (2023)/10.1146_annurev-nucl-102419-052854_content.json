{"Literature Review": "The discovery of the top quark at the Tevatron in 1995 marked a significant milestone in particle physics, confirming the existence of the heaviest known fundamental particle and completing the quark sector of the Standard Model (SM). Since then, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the top quark's properties and production mechanisms. This review appraises the current state of top quark physics at the LHC and outlines the prospects for future discoveries. The LHC has provided a wealth of data on top quark production and decay, enabling precise measurements of various fundamental parameters. One of the most critical parameters is the top quark mass (mt), which has been measured with a relative uncertainty of less than 0.5%. This precision is crucial for testing the consistency of the SM and for constraining new physics scenarios. The strong coupling constant (αS) has also been determined with a relative uncertainty of 1.8% from top quark events, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of strong interactions. Another important parameter is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element Vtb, which describes the strength of the interaction between the top quark and the bottom quark. The LHC measurements of Vtb have achieved a relative uncertainty of 2%, further validating the SM predictions. Additionally, the top quark Yukawa coupling (yt), which quantifies the interaction between the top quark and the Higgs boson, has been measured with a relative uncertainty of 10%. These measurements are essential for understanding the electroweak interactions and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHC has also made significant strides in measuring the production cross sections of top quarks. The inclusive and differential cross sections for top quark pair production (tt) have been measured with high precision, providing stringent tests of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). These measurements are crucial for validating theoretical models and for improving the accuracy of event generators used in collider physics. In addition to the production of top quark pairs, the LHC has explored the associated production of top quarks with other particles, such as W and Z bosons, and the Higgs boson. These processes are sensitive to the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons and the Higgs boson, and they provide complementary information to the tt measurements. The associated production of top quarks with bosons has been measured with increasing precision, and the results are consistent with the SM predictions, although some tensions remain that could hint at new physics. The LHC has also conducted searches for rare top quark decays, such as t → Hq and t → Zq, which are highly suppressed in the SM but could be enhanced in beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) scenarios. While no significant deviations from the SM have been observed, these searches have placed stringent limits on the branching fractions of these rare decays, further constraining the parameter space of BSM theories. One of the most challenging and intriguing areas of top quark physics is the search for processes involving multiple top quarks, such as the production of four top quarks (tttt). The LHC has made initial measurements of the tttt cross section, which is extremely rare in the SM but could be enhanced in certain BSM models. Although the current measurements are statistically limited, they provide valuable constraints on the phase space of new physics and pave the way for more precise measurements in the future. Looking ahead, the LHC program is expected to continue delivering high-precision measurements of top quark properties and production mechanisms. The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade, scheduled to begin operations in the mid-2020s, will provide an order of magnitude more data, allowing for even more precise measurements and the potential discovery of new physics. The HL-LHC will also enable the development of new experimental techniques and theoretical tools, further enhancing our ability to probe the top quark sector. In conclusion, the LHC has revolutionized our understanding of the top quark, providing precise measurements of fundamental parameters and stringent constraints on new physics. As the LHC program continues, top quark physics will remain a key area of research, offering unique insights into the consistency of the SM and the energy scale of new physics.", "References": [{"title": "Observation of the top quark", "authors": "F.
