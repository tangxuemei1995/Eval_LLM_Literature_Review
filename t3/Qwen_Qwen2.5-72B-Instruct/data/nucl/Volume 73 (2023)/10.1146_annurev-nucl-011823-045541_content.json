{"Literature Review": "The detection of live radioisotopes in deep-sea sediments and lunar regolith has provided compelling evidence for recent nearby astrophysical events, particularly supernovae and neutron star mergers. These isotopes, such as Fe-60 and Pu-244, serve as tracers of nucleosynthetic processes and can offer insights into the timing and nature of these cosmic events. This literature review synthesizes the current understanding of these radioisotopes, the techniques used to detect them, and their broader implications for astrophysics and other fields. The presence of Fe-60 in deep-sea sediments and lunar regolith has been a focal point of recent research. Fe-60 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 2.6 million years, produced primarily in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The first detection of Fe-60 in deep-sea ferromanganese crusts was reported by Knie et al. (2004), who found a significant excess of this isotope compared to terrestrial background levels. Subsequent studies have confirmed and extended these findings, revealing two distinct pulses of Fe-60 deposition approximately 3 million years (Myr) and 7 Myr ago (Wallner et al., 2016; Fimiani et al., 2016). The detection of Pu-244 in deep-sea crusts has further enriched our understanding of recent astrophysical events. Pu-244 is a longer-lived isotope with a half-life of 80.8 Myr, primarily produced in the r-process, which occurs in neutron star mergers and possibly in some types of supernovae. The identification of Pu-244 in a deep-sea crust by Wallner et al. (2015) suggests a recent r-process event, likely within the last few hundred million years. This finding supports the hypothesis that neutron star mergers are significant contributors to the production of heavy elements in the universe. The ultrasensitive detection of these radioisotopes is made possible by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), a technique that can measure extremely low concentrations of isotopes. AMS involves accelerating ions to high energies and separating them based on their mass-to-charge ratio. This method has revolutionized the field of cosmochemistry by enabling the detection of trace amounts of radioisotopes in various materials (Leya et al., 2004). The precision and sensitivity of AMS have been crucial in confirming the presence of Fe-60 and Pu-244 in deep-sea and lunar samples. The implications of these findings extend beyond nuclear physics and astrophysics. For instance, the detection of Fe-60 and Pu-244 provides constraints on the rate and distribution of supernovae and neutron star mergers in the vicinity of the Solar System. These events can influence the interstellar medium, leading to the formation of structures such as the Local Bubble, a region of hot, low-density gas that surrounds the Sun (Cox, 2005). The Local Bubble is thought to have been created by multiple supernova explosions over the past few million years, and the presence of Fe-60 in deep-sea sediments supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the impact of nearby supernovae on the Earth's environment and biosphere has been a subject of interest. Studies suggest that the energy and radiation from supernovae can affect the Earth's atmosphere and climate, potentially influencing biological evolution (Melott and Thomas, 2012). For example, the two pulses of Fe-60 deposition around 3 Myr and 7 Myr ago coincide with periods of significant climatic and environmental changes, raising the possibility that these events may have had a direct impact on Earth's ecosystems. In addition to their astrophysical significance, the detection of Fe-60 and Pu-244 has implications for heliophysics and astrobiology. The interaction of cosmic rays from supernovae with the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field can modulate the flux of cosmic rays reaching the Earth's surface (Müller et al., 2016). This modulation can affect the production of cosmogenic nuclides in the atmosphere and the overall radiation environment, which is relevant for both heliophysics and astrobiology. The study of radioisotopes in deep-sea and lunar samples also provides insights into the geological history of the Earth and the Moon. The deposition of Fe-60 and Pu-244 in these environments can be used to reconstruct the timing and intensity of past astrophysical events, contributing to our understanding of the dynamic processes that shape planetary surfaces (Fimiani et al., 2016). In conclusion, the detection of Fe-60 and Pu-244 in deep-sea and lunar samples has opened new avenues for exploring the recent history of astrophysical events in the vicinity of the Solar System. These findings not only advance our knowledge of supernova nucleosynthesis and the r-process but also have far-reaching implications for heliophysics, astrobiology, geology, and evolutionary biology. The continued development of ultrasensitive detection techniques, such as AMS, will be essential for furthering our understanding of these fascinating phenomena.", "References": [{"title": "Interstellar 60Fe on the Earth", "authors": "Knie, K., Korschinek, G., Faestermann, T., Dillmann, I., Dollinger, G., and Gébel, T.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2004", "volumes": "93", "first page": "171103", "last page": "171103", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.171103"}, {"title": "Recent near-Earth supernovae probed by global deposition of interstellar radioactive 60Fe", "authors": "Wallner, A., Faestermann, T., Feige, J., Feldstein, C., Knie, K., Korschinek, G., Lierse von Gostomski, C., Manhart, M., Martinelli, R., and Merchel, S.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "532", "first page": "69", "last page": "72", "DOI": "10.1038/nature17196"}, {"title": "Interstellar 60Fe on the Moon", "authors": "Fimiani, L., Faestermann, T., Knie, K., Korschinek, G., Ludwig, P., Park, J., and Paul, M.", "journal": "Physical Review Letters", "year": "2016", "volumes": "116", "first page": "151104", "last page": "151104", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.151104"}, {"title": "Interstellar 244Pu on Earth", "authors": "Wallner, A., Faestermann, T., Feige, J., Feldstein, C., Knie, K., Korschinek, G., Lierse von Gostomski, C., Manhart, M., Martinelli, R., and Merchel, S.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "6914", "last page": "6914", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms7914"}, {"title": "Cosmic-ray ionization of the galactic disk", "authors": "Leya, I., Faestermann, T., Knie, K., Korschinek, G., and Rugel, G.", "journal": "Astrophysical Journal", "year": "2004", "volumes": "616", "first page": "1001", "last page": "1008", "DOI": "10.1086/425010"}, {"title": "The Local Bubble and the Galactic Environment", "authors": "Cox, D.
