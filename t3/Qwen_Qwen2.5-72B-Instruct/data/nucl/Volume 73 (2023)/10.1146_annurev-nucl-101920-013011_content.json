{"Literature Review": "Long-lived particles (LLPs) have garnered significant attention in the high-energy physics community due to their potential to provide insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). These particles, which decay over macroscopic distances, can arise from various theoretical frameworks, including supersymmetry (SUSY), extra dimensions, and hidden sectors. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers a unique opportunity to search for LLPs, given its high luminosity and energy reach. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical motivations, experimental techniques, and challenges associated with LLP searches at the LHC.\n\n### Theoretical Motivations\n\nThe primary theoretical motivation for LLPs stems from their ability to address several open questions in particle physics. For instance, SUSY models predict the existence of neutralinos, which can be long-lived if they are nearly degenerate in mass with other SUSY particles (Buchmüller et al., 2007). In these scenarios, neutralinos can travel macroscopic distances before decaying, leading to distinctive signatures in the detector. Similarly, models with extra dimensions, such as Kaluza-Klein theories, can produce long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes that decay outside the primary interaction region (Appelquist et al., 2001).\n\nAnother compelling framework is the hidden sector scenario, where new particles interact only weakly with the Standard Model (SM) particles. In such models, the long-lived nature of these particles can be attributed to their weak couplings or the presence of a conserved quantum number (Arkani-Hamed et al., 2006). These particles can decay via rare processes, leading to displaced vertices or long tracks in the detector.\n\n### Experimental Techniques\n\nThe experimental techniques employed in LLP searches at the LHC are designed to detect the unique signatures of these particles. One of the most common methods is the use of displaced vertex (DV) reconstruction. DVs are formed when LLPs decay after traveling a significant distance from the primary interaction point. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have developed sophisticated algorithms to identify and reconstruct DVs, taking into account the detector geometry and material effects (Aad et al., 2015; Khachatryan et al., 2016).\n\nAnother technique involves the detection of long tracks, which can be produced by charged LLPs. These tracks can be identified by their unusual properties, such as large impact parameters or late arrival times. The ALICE experiment, with its excellent tracking capabilities, has been particularly effective in searching for long tracks (Acharya et al., 2018).\n\n### Challenges and Subtleties\n\nDespite the advanced experimental techniques, LLP searches at the LHC face several challenges. One of the primary challenges is the estimation of signal efficiencies and background rates. Signal efficiencies can be affected by various factors, including the detector resolution, material interactions, and the kinematics of the LLPs (Curtin et al., 2014). Accurate simulations and detailed detector studies are essential to mitigate these effects.\n\nBackgrounds can also pose significant challenges, especially in the context of DVs. Standard Model processes, such as heavy-flavor decays and pile-up events, can produce fake DVs that mimic the signal. Advanced machine learning techniques and multivariate analysis methods have been employed to distinguish true DVs from backgrounds (Aaboud et al., 2017; Sirunyan et al., 2019).\n\n### Recent Developments and Future Prospects\n\nRecent developments in LLP searches at the LHC have led to improved sensitivity and a broader range of explored models. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported several null results, setting stringent limits on the production cross-sections of LLPs (Aaboud et al., 2018; Sirunyan et al., 2018). However, these results do not rule out the existence of LLPs but rather constrain specific parameter regions.\n\nFuture prospects for LLP searches at the LHC are promising. The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will provide an order of magnitude more data, enhancing the sensitivity to LLPs. Additionally, the development of new detector technologies, such as pixel detectors with improved time resolution, will further enhance the capability to detect LLPs (Cerri et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the search for long-lived particles at the LHC is a vibrant and evolving field. The combination of strong theoretical motivations, advanced experimental techniques, and ongoing improvements in data analysis holds great promise for uncovering new physics beyond the Standard Model.", "References": [{"title": "Supersymmetric Dark Matter: An Update", "authors": "W.
