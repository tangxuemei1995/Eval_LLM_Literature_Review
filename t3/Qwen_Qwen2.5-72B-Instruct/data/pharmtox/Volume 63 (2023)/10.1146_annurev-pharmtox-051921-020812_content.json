{"Literature Review": "Air pollution, a pervasive environmental issue, comprises a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter (PM) that can have profound effects on human health, particularly on the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiological studies have increasingly linked air pollution exposure to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2016; Power et al., 2011). This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the neurotoxic effects of air pollution across the life span, focusing on the roles of particulate matter, especially ultrafine particles (UFPs) and PM2.5, and their impact on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes.\n\n### Early Life Exposure and Neurodevelopmental Disorders\nExposure to air pollution during early life stages, including prenatal and postnatal periods, has been associated with increased risks of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies have shown that maternal exposure to high levels of PM2.5 during pregnancy is linked to higher rates of ASD in offspring (Volk et al., 2013). Similarly, postnatal exposure to UFPs and PM2.5 has been correlated with cognitive deficits and behavioral problems in children (Perera et al., 2014). These findings suggest that early life exposure to air pollutants can disrupt normal brain development, potentially through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and inflammation (Baccarelli et al., 2010).\n\n### Mechanisms of Neurotoxicity\nThe neurotoxic effects of air pollution are thought to be mediated by several key mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and brain metal dyshomeostasis. Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's antioxidant defenses, can lead to cellular damage and dysfunction (Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas, 2009). Inflammatory responses triggered by air pollutants can further exacerbate this damage, contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas, 2009). Additionally, air pollution can cause brain metal dyshomeostasis, altering the levels of essential metals such as iron, copper, and zinc, which are crucial for neuronal function (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2016). This dyshomeostasis can disrupt neurotransmitter systems and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n### Neurodegenerative Diseases\nEpidemiological and experimental studies have also linked chronic exposure to air pollution with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). For instance, long-term exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with a higher incidence of AD, possibly due to the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (Chen et al., 2017). Similarly, exposure to UFPs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, with evidence suggesting that these particles can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce dopaminergic neuron loss (Block and Calderón-Garcidueñas, 2009). These findings underscore the importance of understanding the specific components of air pollution that contribute to neurodegeneration.\n\n### Future Research Directions\nWhile significant progress has been made in elucidating the neurotoxic effects of air pollution, several areas require further investigation. First, identifying the specific contaminants within air pollution that are most responsible for neurotoxicity is critical for developing targeted interventions. Second, more longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the long-term effects of air pollution on the CNS and to establish causal relationships. Third, research should focus on the potential interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental exposures, as these interactions may influence individual susceptibility to neurotoxic effects (Power et al., 2011). Finally, translational research aimed at developing biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the neurotoxic effects of air pollution is essential for protecting public health.\n\nIn conclusion, the neurotoxic effects of air pollution are a significant public health concern, affecting individuals across the life span. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these effects and identifying the responsible contaminants are crucial steps toward developing effective prevention and intervention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter, residential proximity to major roads and measures of brain structure", "authors": "Chen, H., Kwong, J.
