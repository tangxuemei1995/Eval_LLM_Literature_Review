{"Literature Review": "Early human life, particularly the fetal and early childhood stages, represents a critical period of development during which the body is highly susceptible to environmental influences. The concept of the exposome, defined as the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, has gained significant attention in recent years. This review focuses on the chemical exposome, which encompasses all xenobiotics—both synthetic and natural—that humans encounter throughout their lives. Understanding the impact of these exposures on fetal and infant metabolism is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying various health outcomes later in life. The chemical exposome includes a wide array of substances, such as industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and natural biotoxins. These substances can enter the body through multiple routes, including inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact. For instance, maternal exposure to environmental pollutants can lead to the transfer of these chemicals across the placenta, affecting fetal development. The placenta, while serving as a protective barrier, is not impermeable to all xenobiotics, and some substances can cross it, potentially leading to adverse developmental outcomes. One of the key challenges in studying the chemical exposome is the complexity of mixture effects. Exposure to multiple xenobiotics simultaneously can result in synergistic or antagonistic interactions, making it difficult to predict the overall impact on health. Human biomonitoring plays a crucial role in assessing the chemical exposome. Biomonitoring involves measuring the levels of specific chemicals or their metabolites in biological samples, such as blood, urine, and breast milk. This approach provides direct evidence of exposure and can help identify high-risk populations. Models for studying maternal-fetal transfer are essential for understanding how xenobiotics cross the placenta and affect fetal development. In vitro models, such as placental perfusion systems, have been used to investigate the transport of specific chemicals across the placental barrier. Animal models, particularly those using rodents, have also been valuable in studying the effects of prenatal exposure on offspring. Natural biotoxins, such as mycotoxins and marine toxins, are often overlooked in discussions of the chemical exposome. These substances can contaminate food and water supplies and pose significant health risks, especially to vulnerable populations like infants. Large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics are essential for advancing our knowledge of the chemical exposome. To improve our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome, several recommendations are proposed. First, there is a need for more comprehensive biomonitoring programs that cover a broader range of xenobiotics, including natural biotoxins. Second, the development of advanced in vitro and in vivo models that better mimic human physiology is crucial for studying the effects of prenatal exposure. Third, interdisciplinary collaborations between toxicologists, epidemiologists, and clinicians are necessary to integrate different lines of evidence and provide a more holistic view of the chemical exposome. Finally, public health policies should be informed by the latest scientific findings to protect vulnerable populations from harmful exposures. In conclusion, the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood is a complex and multifaceted area of research. By addressing the current data gaps and advancing our methodologies, we can gain a deeper understanding of the impact of environmental exposures on early human life and ultimately improve public health outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Developmental neurotoxicity of industrial chemicals", "authors": "Philippe Grandjean, Philip J.
