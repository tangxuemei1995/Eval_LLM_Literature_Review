{"Literature Review": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential benefits in cardiovascular health. These fatty acids are primarily found in seafood, supplements, and concentrated pharmaceutical preparations. Prospective cohort studies have consistently shown that higher intakes of EPA and DHA are associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction, as well as a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality in the general population (Mozaffarian & Wu, 2011).\n\nThe cardioprotective effects of EPA and DHA are attributed to their ability to modulate various risk factors for CVD. For instance, these fatty acids have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels, lower blood pressure, and improve endothelial function (Kris-Etherton et al., 2002). Additionally, they exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and can stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing the risk of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis (Calder, 2007).\n\nSeveral large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy of EPA and DHA in both primary and secondary prevention of CVD. The GISSI-Prevenzione trial, one of the most influential studies, demonstrated that supplementation with 1 gram of EPA and DHA daily significantly reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular causes in patients who had recently experienced a myocardial infarction (GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators, 1999). Similarly, the JELIS trial found that adding 1.8 grams of EPA to statin therapy further reduced the risk of major coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients (Saito et al., 2007).\n\nHowever, the evidence regarding the benefits of EPA and DHA in CVD prevention is not entirely consistent. The REDUCE-IT trial, which used a highly purified form of EPA (icosapent ethyl), showed a significant reduction in the risk of ischemic events in patients with elevated triglycerides despite statin therapy (Bhatt et al., 2019). In contrast, the VITAL trial, which examined the effects of 1 gram of fish oil per day in a general population, did not find a significant reduction in the incidence of major cardiovascular events (Ridker et al., 2019).\n\nMeta-analyses have attempted to synthesize the findings from multiple studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of EPA and DHA in CVD prevention. A meta-analysis by Aung et al. (2018) concluded that while there was a modest benefit of fish oil supplementation in reducing the risk of fatal CHD, the overall effect on non-fatal CHD and stroke was less clear. Another meta-analysis by Alexander et al. (2017) found that EPA and DHA supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in triglyceride levels but had no significant effect on LDL cholesterol or HDL cholesterol.\n\nDespite the generally positive findings, some concerns have been raised about potential adverse effects of LCn-3 PUFAs. For example, high doses of fish oil may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in individuals taking anticoagulant medications (Calder, 2007). Additionally, there is some evidence suggesting that very high intakes of LCn-3 PUFAs may be associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (Burr et al., 2006). However, these adverse effects are relatively rare and typically occur at doses much higher than those commonly recommended for CVD prevention.\n\nIn conclusion, the available evidence suggests that EPA and DHA have significant potential benefits in the prevention and management of CVD. While the results of individual studies are sometimes inconsistent, meta-analyses generally support the use of these fatty acids, particularly in high-risk populations. However, it is important to consider potential adverse effects and to tailor recommendations based on individual patient characteristics and risk profiles.", "References": [{"title": "Omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease: effects on risk factors, molecular pathways, and clinical events", "authors": "Dariush Mozaffarian, Jason H.Y.
