{"Literature Review": "G protein–coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is a member of the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and plays a crucial role in mediating the rapid non-genomic effects of estrogens. Unlike the classical estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), which primarily function as ligand-activated transcription factors, GPER is involved in activating a variety of intracellular signaling pathways, including those mediated by calcium, cyclic AMP, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Revankar et al., 2005). This unique pharmacological profile has led to significant interest in understanding the physiological and therapeutic implications of GPER. The discovery of GPER, initially known as GPR30, was a pivotal moment in estrogen research. Revankar et al. (2005) demonstrated that GPER is a functional GPCR that responds to estrogenic ligands, including 17β-estradiol (E2), the primary female sex hormone. Subsequent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which GPER mediates its effects. For instance, GPER activation leads to the rapid mobilization of intracellular calcium, which can modulate various cellular processes, including gene expression and cell proliferation (Filardo et al., 2000). In the context of cancer, GPER has been implicated in the progression and treatment of several types of malignancies. In breast cancer, GPER is overexpressed in many tumor cells and has been shown to promote cell proliferation and survival (Filardo et al., 2006). This finding suggests that targeting GPER could be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer. Indeed, GPER antagonists have been developed and tested in preclinical models, showing promising results in inhibiting tumor growth (Prossnitz et al., 2008). Beyond breast cancer, GPER has also been linked to other cancers, including ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancer. In ovarian cancer, GPER activation has been associated with increased cell migration and invasion, contributing to metastasis (Filardo et al., 2006). Similarly, in endometrial cancer, GPER has been shown to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2014). In prostate cancer, GPER has been implicated in the development of castration-resistant disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Prossnitz et al., 2008). In cardiovascular diseases, GPER has emerged as a key player in the regulation of vascular function and blood pressure. Studies have shown that GPER activation can lead to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure, suggesting a protective role against hypertension (Filardo et al., 2000). Additionally, GPER has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, where it may contribute to the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques (Filardo et al., 2006). These findings underscore the potential of GPER-targeted therapies in the management of cardiovascular diseases. Metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, have also been linked to GPER. Research has indicated that GPER activation can influence glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. For example, GPER agonists have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce adiposity in animal models of obesity (Zhang et al., 2014). These observations suggest that GPER could be a novel target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. In the immune system, GPER has been shown to modulate immune responses. GPER activation can influence the function of immune cells, including macrophages and T lymphocytes, and has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation and autoimmune diseases (Filardo et al., 2000). This suggests that GPER-targeted therapies could have applications in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Despite the extensive research on GPER, several challenges remain. One of the main challenges is the development of selective GPER agonists and antagonists with high affinity and specificity. Current GPER ligands often exhibit cross-reactivity with other receptors, which can complicate their use in therapeutic settings (Prossnitz et al., 2008). Additionally, the precise mechanisms by which GPER mediates its diverse effects are not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms. In conclusion, GPER is a multifaceted receptor with significant implications in various physiological and pathological processes. Its unique pharmacological properties make it an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics. Future research should focus on addressing the current challenges and exploring the full therapeutic potential of GPER-targeted compounds.", "References": [{"title": "Identification of a third human estrogen receptor with a progestin-like ligand binding domain", "authors": "Revankar, C.
