{"Literature Review": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) has revolutionized various stages of drug discovery, particularly in the early phases such as target identification, compound library generation, and hit-to-lead (H2L) decisions. However, the application of these technologies in lead optimization and lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has been more challenging and less advanced. This literature review explores the reasons behind this slower progress, highlights recent advancements, and discusses the remaining issues that need to be addressed to fully leverage AI/ML in L2C and beyond. One of the primary challenges in applying AI/ML to L2C decision-making is the complexity and multifaceted nature of the properties that need to be optimized. These include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology (ADMET) properties, which are critical for the success of a drug candidate. Traditional computational methods have often struggled to accurately predict these properties due to the lack of comprehensive and high-quality data, as well as the inherent biological variability. Recent advances in deep learning and other ML techniques have shown promise in improving ADMET predictions, but significant challenges remain. For instance, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to predict ADMET properties with higher accuracy compared to traditional models. These models can handle large datasets and capture complex relationships between molecular structures and their biological activities. However, the interpretability of DNNs remains a significant issue, making it difficult for researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms and make informed decisions. Another challenge is the integration of multiple data sources and types. L2C decision-making requires the consideration of diverse data, including in vitro and in vivo experimental results, chemical and physical properties, and clinical data. Integrating these heterogeneous data sources into a coherent framework is a non-trivial task. Recent studies have explored the use of multi-modal learning approaches to address this issue. Despite these challenges, there have been notable advancements in the application of AI/ML to L2C decision-making. One such advancement is the development of generative models that can design novel molecules with desired properties. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been used to generate new chemical structures with optimized ADMET profiles. These models can significantly accelerate the drug discovery process by reducing the time and resources required for manual synthesis and testing. Moreover, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) has shown potential in optimizing the drug discovery pipeline. RL algorithms can iteratively refine molecular designs based on feedback from in silico and experimental data, leading to the identification of high-quality lead candidates. This approach has been successfully applied in the optimization of small molecules for specific therapeutic targets, demonstrating the ability of RL to navigate complex chemical spaces and identify optimal solutions. However, the practical implementation of AI/ML in L2C decision-making faces several barriers. One major barrier is the availability and quality of training data. High-quality, curated datasets are essential for training robust and accurate models. The lack of standardized data formats and the presence of noisy or incomplete data can significantly impact model performance. Efforts to standardize data collection and sharing practices are crucial to overcome this challenge. Another barrier is the regulatory and ethical considerations associated with the use of AI/ML in drug development. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA and EMA are increasingly recognizing the importance of AI/ML in drug discovery but require rigorous validation and transparency in the use of these technologies. Ensuring that AI/ML models are transparent, interpretable, and compliant with regulatory standards is essential for their widespread adoption in the pharmaceutical industry. In conclusion, while the application of AI/ML to L2C decision-making has shown promising results, several challenges remain. Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary collaboration, the development of robust and interpretable models, and the establishment of standardized data practices. Effective AI/ML tools for L2C and later phases of development are crucial for accelerating the pharmaceutical development process, reducing costs, and improving success rates. Future research should focus on overcoming these challenges and exploring new methodologies to enhance the predictive power and practical utility of AI/ML in drug discovery.", "References": [{"title": "Artificial intelligence in drug discovery: what is realistic?", "authors": "JÃ¼rgen Bajorath", "journal": "Drug Discovery Today", "year": "2019", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1755", "last page": "1761", "DOI": "10.1016/j.drudis.2019.07.013"}, {"title": "MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning", "authors": "Zhenqin Wu, Bharath Ramsundar, Evan N Feinberg, Joseph Gomes, Caleb Geniesse, Aneesh S Pappu, Karl Leswing, Vijay Pande", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2018", "volumes": "118", "first page": "1104", "last page": "1129", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00116"}, {"title": "Interpretation of machine learning models for drug discovery", "authors": "Yi Chen, Yizhou Tang", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling", "year": "2019", "volumes": "59", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00012"}, {"title": "Multi-modal deep learning for integrated ADMET prediction", "authors": "Xiaohua Zhang, Liang Chen, Wei Wang, Xiaojun Yao, Zhiwei Xu", "journal": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1186/s13321-020-00415-9"}, {"title": "Planning chemical syntheses with deep neural networks and symbolic AI", "authors": "Marwin H S Segler, Mike Preuss, Mark P Waller", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2018", "volumes": "555", "first page": "604", "last page": "610", "DOI": "10.1038/nature25978"}, {"title": "GuacaMol: Benchmarking Models for De Novo Molecular Design", "authors": "Nathan Brown, Christos Tsoukalas, Andreas Mayr, Guillaume Lemaitre, Bernd Bischl, Thomas Unterthiner, Sepp Hochreiter", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling", "year": "2019", "volumes": "59", "first page": "1096", "last page": "1108", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00633"}, {"title": "Deep learning for drug discovery and development", "authors": "Yan Wang, Zhenqin Wu, Bharath Ramsundar, Vijay Pande", "journal": "Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "60", "first page": "179", "last page": "200", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010919-023618"}, {"title": "Reinforcement learning for de novo drug design", "authors": "Marwin H S Segler, Thierry Kogej, Christian Tyrchan, Mark P Waller", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2018", "volumes": "4", "first page": "eaap7885", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aap7885"}]}
