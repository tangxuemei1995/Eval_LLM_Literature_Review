{"Literature Review": "The global effort to achieve universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) for individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has made significant strides since the first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in 1981. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid-1990s marked a turning point in the management of HIV, transforming it from a fatal disease into a chronic, manageable condition. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain, particularly in ensuring timely diagnosis, expanding access to treatment, and addressing the unique needs of specific populations, such as pediatric and adolescent patients. One of the key milestones in the fight against HIV/AIDS was the introduction of the 90-90-90 targets by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 2014. These targets aim to ensure that 90% of people living with HIV know their status, 90% of those diagnosed receive ART, and 90% of those on ART achieve viral suppression by 2020. While some regions have made remarkable progress towards these goals, disparities persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of HIV is highest. Timely diagnosis remains a critical challenge in achieving universal ART coverage. Late diagnosis is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, as well as increased risk of HIV transmission. Innovative strategies, such as self-testing and community-based testing, have shown promise in increasing early detection rates. However, these approaches must be integrated into comprehensive care systems to ensure that individuals who test positive are linked to appropriate treatment and support services. Access to ART is another major hurdle, particularly in resource-limited settings. The cost of antiretroviral drugs, infrastructure limitations, and logistical challenges can impede the delivery of treatment to those in need. Generic drug production and international funding mechanisms, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, have played crucial roles in making ART more accessible. However, sustained investment and policy support are essential to maintain and expand these gains. Pediatric and adolescent patients present unique challenges in the context of HIV treatment. Children and adolescents often face barriers to accessing care, including stigma, lack of child-friendly formulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training. Additionally, adherence to ART regimens can be particularly difficult for this age group, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Tailored interventions, such as peer support programs and simplified dosing schedules, are needed to improve adherence and retention in care. As the population of HIV-positive individuals ages, the management of comorbidities becomes increasingly important. Chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and renal dysfunction, are more prevalent among people living with HIV, partly due to the direct effects of the virus and the side effects of long-term ART. Research is ongoing to understand the complex interplay between HIV, ART, and aging, with a focus on developing strategies to prevent and manage these comorbidities. The development of new long-acting antiretrovirals represents a promising advancement in the field of HIV treatment and prevention. Long-acting injectable formulations offer the potential to reduce the pill burden and improve adherence, particularly for individuals who struggle with daily oral medications. These agents are also being evaluated for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), providing an alternative to daily oral PrEP for high-risk individuals. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the global response to HIV/AIDS, achieving universal ART coverage remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. Addressing the barriers to timely diagnosis, expanding access to treatment, and tailoring interventions for specific populations are essential steps towards realizing the 90-90-90 targets. Ongoing research and innovation, coupled with sustained political commitment and financial support, will be crucial in overcoming these challenges and ultimately ending the HIV epidemic.", "References": [{"title": "Declining Morbidity and Mortality Among Patients With Advanced Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection", "authors": "F.J.
