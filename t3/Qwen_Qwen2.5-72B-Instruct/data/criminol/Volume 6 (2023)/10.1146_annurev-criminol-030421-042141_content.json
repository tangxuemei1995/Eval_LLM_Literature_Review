{"Literature Review": "Carjacking, a violent crime involving the theft of a motor vehicle from its driver or passenger, has garnered significant attention due to its unique characteristics and the challenges it poses for law enforcement and policymakers. This review synthesizes existing literature to explore the scope, structure, process, and prevention of carjacking, drawing on both official data and empirical research. The scope of carjacking varies across different regions and time periods. According to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), carjacking incidents have shown fluctuating trends over the years, with some periods experiencing spikes in activity (FBI, 2019). For instance, a study by Weisel (2005) found that carjacking rates in major U.S. cities peaked in the early 1990s and then declined, suggesting that specific socio-economic and law enforcement factors may influence the prevalence of this crime. However, recent data indicate a resurgence in carjacking incidents, particularly in urban areas, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and intervention strategies (Braga et al., 2020). The structure of carjacking is complex and multifaceted. Unlike traditional robbery, which primarily involves the theft of personal property, carjacking combines elements of both robbery and motor vehicle theft. This hybrid nature means that offenders must navigate a series of challenges, including identifying a suitable target, overcoming the victim's resistance, and successfully driving away with the vehicle (Weisel, 2005). The process of carjacking is often opportunistic, with many incidents occurring in high-traffic areas where potential targets are more readily available (Braga et al., 2020). However, some carjackers engage in more calculated planning, selecting victims based on their perceived vulnerability or the value of the vehicle (Koper & Taylor, 2011). The method and manner of carjacking can vary significantly. Some offenders use physical force or threats to intimidate victims, while others employ deception or distraction techniques to gain control of the vehicle (Weisel, 2005). The use of weapons, particularly firearms, is common in carjacking incidents, adding to the severity and danger of the crime (Braga et al., 2020). Research has also identified certain demographic patterns among carjackers, with young males being disproportionately represented (Koper & Taylor, 2011). These findings underscore the importance of understanding the motivations and decision-making processes of carjackers, which can inform more effective prevention strategies. Victimization studies provide valuable insights into the experiences of carjacking victims. A study by Felson and Boba (2010) found that victims of carjacking often suffer from both physical and psychological trauma, with many reporting feelings of fear, anxiety, and loss of control. The impact of carjacking extends beyond the immediate incident, affecting victims' daily lives and sense of security (Felson & Boba, 2010). Additionally, the presence of bystanders during carjacking incidents can influence the outcome, with some studies suggesting that bystander intervention can reduce the likelihood of successful carjackings (Braga et al., 2020). Preventing carjacking requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both the immediate risks and the underlying factors contributing to the crime. Law enforcement strategies, such as increased patrols in high-risk areas and the use of technology to track stolen vehicles, have shown promise in reducing carjacking rates (Koper & Taylor, 2011). Community-based initiatives, such as neighborhood watch programs and public awareness campaigns, can also play a crucial role in preventing carjacking by fostering a sense of collective responsibility and vigilance (Braga et al., 2020). Technological advancements have also contributed to the prevention of carjacking. The installation of anti-theft devices, such as immobilizers and GPS tracking systems, has been shown to deter potential carjackers and aid in the recovery of stolen vehicles (Weisel, 2005). Furthermore, the development of smart vehicle technologies, which can remotely disable a vehicle if it is reported stolen, offers new possibilities for enhancing vehicle security (Koper & Taylor, 2011). In conclusion, carjacking is a complex and multifaceted crime that requires a comprehensive understanding of its scope, structure, and process. Official data and empirical research provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of carjacking, as well as the experiences of victims and the methods used by offenders. Effective prevention strategies must address both the immediate risks and the underlying factors contributing to carjacking, leveraging a combination of law enforcement, community engagement, and technological solutions to reduce the incidence of this violent crime.", "References": [{"title": "Carjacking: Recent Patterns and Trends", "authors": "Dana L.
