{"Literature Review": "Ethnographic studies of immigration and crime have a rich history dating back to the early 20th century, particularly through the work of the Chicago School. These early studies provided deep insights into the social dynamics and lived experiences of immigrants, often highlighting the complexities of their interactions with the criminal justice system. However, contemporary scholarship has largely shifted towards quantitative methods, leading to what some scholars have termed a 'collective amnesia' and 'newness fetish' in criminology (Wacquant, 2009). This literature review aims to revitalize interest in ethnographic approaches by revisiting classic works and synthesizing recent qualitative research on immigration and crime. The Chicago School, a pioneering group of sociologists at the University of Chicago, conducted extensive ethnographic research in the early 20th century. Notable works include Robert Park's and Ernest Burgess's studies on urban ecology and social disorganization (Park & Burgess, 1925). These researchers emphasized the importance of understanding the spatial and social contexts in which immigrants lived, arguing that these factors significantly influenced their involvement in crime. For instance, Park and Burgess's work highlighted how the concentration of poverty and social disorganization in urban areas contributed to higher crime rates among immigrant communities. Building on the Chicago School's foundational work, later ethnographers continued to explore the intersection of immigration and crime. Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay's seminal study, 'Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas' (Shaw & McKay, 1942), further developed the concept of social disorganization, showing how neighborhood conditions and social structures affected delinquency rates. Their research underscored the need to consider the broader social context when examining the relationship between immigration and crime. Despite the valuable insights provided by these early studies, the shift towards quantitative methods in the latter half of the 20th century led to a decline in ethnographic research on immigration and crime. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in qualitative approaches, driven by the recognition that quantitative data alone cannot capture the nuanced experiences of immigrants. Contemporary ethnographic research has shed light on various aspects of immigration and crime, including the policing of immigrant communities in the age of 'crimmigration.' Crimmigration refers to the convergence of criminal law and immigration law, where immigration enforcement increasingly relies on criminal justice mechanisms (Stumpf, 2006). Ethnographic studies have documented the profound impact of crimmigration policies on immigrant communities. For example, De Genova's (2002) work on the 'migrant 'illegality'' highlights how the legal status of immigrants shapes their interactions with law enforcement and their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. Another area of focus in contemporary ethnographic research is the lived experiences within deportation and detention regimes. Studies have revealed the harsh realities faced by immigrants in detention centers, including poor living conditions, lack of due process, and psychological distress (Menjívar & Abrego, 2012). These experiences are often compounded by the uncertainty and fear of deportation, which can lead to social isolation and mental health issues. Muslim immigrants, a highly marginalized but understudied population, have also been the subject of recent ethnographic research. Studies have explored the unique challenges faced by Muslim immigrants, including discrimination, surveillance, and the stigmatization of their religious practices (Khan, 2013). These experiences can contribute to a sense of alienation and mistrust of authority, which may affect their willingness to engage with the criminal justice system. Immigrants' vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization have also been a focus of contemporary ethnographic research. Studies have shown that immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented, are more likely to be victims of crime but less likely to report it due to fear of deportation or retaliation (Gutierrez & Kirk, 2017). Ethnographic methods have been crucial in uncovering these hidden forms of victimization and understanding the barriers that prevent immigrants from seeking help. In conclusion, while quantitative methods have their strengths, they often fail to capture the complex and multifaceted nature of immigration and crime. Ethnographic studies provide a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and structural factors that influence immigrants' experiences with the criminal justice system. By revisiting classic works and synthesizing recent qualitative research, this review underscores the value of ethnographic approaches in advancing our knowledge of immigration and crime. Future research should continue to integrate qualitative methods to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of this important issue.", "References": [{"title": "The City: Suggestions for Investigation of Human Behavior in the Urban Environment", "authors": "Robert E.
