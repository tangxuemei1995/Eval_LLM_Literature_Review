{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race and crime has been a focal point in criminological research, often emphasizing the disparities between Black and White populations. However, the rapid growth and increasing visibility of the Latino/a/x community necessitate a broader and more nuanced understanding of how race influences crime and criminal legal system involvement. This literature review aims to integrate Latina and Latino Critical Legal Theory (LatCrit) into criminological theory to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals within the criminal justice system. LatCrit is a theoretical approach that emerged from critical race theory (CRT) and focuses on the unique experiences of Latino/a/x individuals. It emphasizes the role of systemic racism in shaping the social, economic, and legal conditions that contribute to criminal behavior and legal system involvement. According to LatCrit, Latino/a/x individuals are racialized as an inferior and criminogenic category, which leads to their marginalization and increased vulnerability to criminalization. Empirical research supports the notion that Latino/a/x individuals face significant barriers and challenges that contribute to their involvement in the criminal justice system. For instance, studies have shown that Latino/a/x youth are disproportionately represented in juvenile detention centers and are more likely to be tried as adults. This overrepresentation can be attributed to various factors, including racial profiling, discriminatory policing practices, and the criminalization of immigration. Moreover, the intersection of race and immigration status further complicates the experiences of Latino/a/x individuals. Research indicates that undocumented immigrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, which can lead to higher rates of victimization and, paradoxically, increased involvement in the criminal justice system. The fear of deportation and the lack of legal protections exacerbate these vulnerabilities, making it difficult for individuals to seek help or report crimes. Criminological theories, such as strain theory and social disorganization theory, offer valuable insights into the factors that contribute to crime and delinquency. Strain theory posits that individuals may turn to crime when they experience strain or frustration due to the inability to achieve societal goals through legitimate means. For Latino/a/x individuals, this strain can be exacerbated by systemic barriers and discrimination, which limit their access to education, employment, and other resources. Social disorganization theory, on the other hand, suggests that crime is more likely to occur in communities characterized by poverty, residential instability, and weak social institutions. Many Latino/a/x communities face these structural challenges, which can contribute to higher rates of crime and delinquency. Additionally, the cultural and linguistic devaluation of Latino/a/x individuals can further erode social cohesion and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Integrating LatCrit into criminological theory can enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics that shape Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement. By centering race and racism, LatCrit provides a critical lens for examining the ways in which systemic inequalities and discriminatory practices contribute to criminalization. This approach also highlights the importance of context and the need to consider the unique experiences and histories of Latino/a/x communities. In conclusion, the integration of LatCrit into criminological theory is essential for advancing the field's understanding of race and crime. By recognizing the racialization of Latino/a/x individuals and the systemic barriers they face, researchers can develop more nuanced and effective strategies for addressing criminal justice disparities. This review underscores the need for a more inclusive and intersectional approach to criminology that acknowledges the diverse experiences of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States.", "References": [{"title": "Liminal Legality: Salvadoran Immigrants' Lives in the United States", "authors": "Cecilia Menjívar", "journal": "American Journal of Sociology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "111", "first page": "1588", "last page": "1621", "DOI": "10.1086/508733"}, {"title": "Latinas/os and the U.S. Criminal Justice System: A Critical Review", "authors": "Cecilia Menjívar, Leisy J.
