{"Literature Review": "Police killings, particularly in the United States, have garnered significant attention due to their frequency and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. This literature review explores the factors contributing to high rates of fatal police violence (FPV) in the United States compared to other developed nations, with a particular focus on the role of gun violence, ethnoracial inequality, and the decentralized structure of U.S. policing. The United States stands out among developed nations for its high rate of police killings. According to data from the Mapping Police Violence project, the U.S. has one of the highest rates of FPV in the developed world. This phenomenon is often attributed to a combination of factors, including the prevalence of gun violence, systemic racial inequalities, and the unique structure of U.S. policing. One of the primary factors contributing to high FPV in the U.S. is the elevated rate of gun violence. Research by Koper et al. (2019) indicates that the widespread availability of firearms in the U.S. creates a heightened sense of danger among law enforcement officers, leading to more frequent use of lethal force. This preoccupation with danger is further exacerbated by the cultural narrative surrounding guns, which often portrays them as necessary for personal safety. As a result, police officers may feel justified in using deadly force as a preemptive measure, even in situations where it might not be strictly necessary. Ethnoracial inequality and discord also play a significant role in the high rates of FPV in the U.S. Studies by Goff et al. (2014) and Fryer (2016) have shown that Black individuals are disproportionately affected by police violence, with higher rates of both non-lethal and lethal encounters. These disparities are rooted in historical and systemic racism, which has led to a lack of trust between law enforcement and minority communities. This mistrust can escalate tensions during police interactions, increasing the likelihood of violent outcomes. The decentralized structure of U.S. policing is another critical factor. Unlike many other developed nations, the U.S. has a highly fragmented system of law enforcement, with over 18,000 separate agencies operating at various levels of government. This hyperlocalism limits the influence of external oversight and hinders the implementation of standardized policies and training programs. As a result, there is significant variation in the quality and consistency of police practices across different jurisdictions. This lack of uniformity can lead to inconsistent application of use-of-force guidelines and reduced accountability for misconduct. However, the relationship between decentralization and FPV is not straightforward. Some Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, also experience high rates of FPV despite having relatively centralized policing systems. This suggests that while decentralization can contribute to high FPV, it is not a necessary condition. Factors such as political instability, corruption, and weak institutional frameworks may also play a role in these contexts. Conversely, countries like Spain and Chile, which have centralized policing systems, have managed to achieve relatively low rates of FPV. This indicates that centralization alone is not sufficient to ensure low FPV. Instead, effective training, robust oversight mechanisms, and a commitment to community-oriented policing are crucial for reducing police violence. In wealthy Northern European nations, such as Norway and Denmark, the combination of extensive resources and rigorous training programs has been effective in suppressing FPV. These countries invest heavily in officer education, emphasizing de-escalation techniques and non-lethal alternatives to force. Additionally, they have strong accountability mechanisms, including independent oversight bodies and transparent reporting processes, which help to maintain public trust and reduce the incidence of police violence. In conclusion, the high rates of FPV in the United States are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including the prevalence of gun violence, ethnoracial inequality, and the decentralized structure of U.S. policing. While decentralization can contribute to high FPV, it is not the sole determinant. Effective strategies to reduce FPV must address these underlying issues, incorporating comprehensive training, robust oversight, and a commitment to equitable and community-oriented policing practices.", "References": [{"title": "Gun Violence and Public Safety: The Role of Law Enforcement", "authors": "Christopher S.
