{"Literature Review": "The concept of overcriminalization has gained significant traction in both academic and practical discourse, particularly within the context of the United States' criminal justice system. This review aims to explore six critical questions that must be addressed to gain a deeper understanding of overcriminalization and its implications. These questions pertain to the nature of criminal law, the definition of overcriminalization, its perceived perniciousness, whether it is a de jure or de facto phenomenon, the normative criteria for addressing it, and its actual severity in the penal system. First, the question of what the criminal law is, remains a foundational issue. Criminal law is traditionally understood as a body of rules and statutes that define prohibited conduct and the penalties for violating these rules. However, this broad definition does not capture the nuances of how criminal law is applied in practice. For instance, the proliferation of regulatory offenses has blurred the lines between civil and criminal law, leading to a situation where individuals can face severe penalties for actions that may not intuitively seem criminal. Second, defining overcriminalization itself is a contentious task. Overcriminalization generally refers to the excessive use of criminal law to regulate behavior, often resulting in the creation of too many crimes or overly harsh penalties. However, the term's vagueness allows for a wide range of interpretations. Some scholars argue that overcriminalization occurs when the state criminalizes conduct that does not cause harm or is not sufficiently blameworthy. Others focus on the procedural aspects, such as the lack of mens rea requirements in many modern offenses. Third, the perceived perniciousness of overcriminalization is a critical concern. Critics argue that overcriminalization undermines the rule of law by creating a legal system that is overly complex and difficult for ordinary citizens to navigate. This complexity can lead to arbitrary enforcement and selective prosecution, eroding public trust in the justice system. Additionally, the overuse of criminal sanctions can disproportionately affect marginalized communities, exacerbating social inequalities. Fourth, the distinction between de jure and de facto overcriminalization is crucial. De jure overcriminalization refers to the existence of laws that are overly broad or numerous, while de facto overcriminalization pertains to the way these laws are enforced. Both aspects are interrelated but require different approaches to address. For example, reforming the law on the books may not necessarily change the practices of law enforcement and prosecutors, which can perpetuate overcriminalization. Fifth, identifying normative criteria to alleviate overcriminalization is essential. One proposed criterion is the principle of legality, which requires that criminal laws be clear, precise, and accessible. Another is the harm principle, which suggests that criminalization should be limited to conduct that causes or risks significant harm to others. Additionally, the principle of proportionality, which mandates that the severity of punishment should be commensurate with the gravity of the offense, is also relevant. Finally, assessing the actual severity of overcriminalization in the penal system is a complex task. While anecdotal evidence and case studies suggest that overcriminalization is a serious concern, empirical data is needed to support these claims. Quantitative studies that measure the number of criminal offenses, the frequency of prosecutions, and the distribution of penalties across different demographics can provide a more comprehensive picture. In conclusion, a deep understanding of overcriminalization requires addressing these six interrelated issues. The nature of criminal law, the definition of overcriminalization, its perceived perniciousness, the distinction between de jure and de facto phenomena, normative criteria for reform, and the actual severity of the problem are all critical components of a comprehensive analysis. By engaging with these questions, scholars and policymakers can develop more nuanced and effective strategies to address the challenges posed by overcriminalization.", "References": [{"title": "Overcriminalization: A New Legal Principle", "authors": "Douglas Husak", "journal": "Criminal Law and Philosophy", "year": "2008", "volumes": "2", "first page": "1", "last page": "21", "DOI": "10.1007/s11572-007-9036-0"}, {"title": "The Criminal Law as a Last Resort", "authors": "Sanford H.
