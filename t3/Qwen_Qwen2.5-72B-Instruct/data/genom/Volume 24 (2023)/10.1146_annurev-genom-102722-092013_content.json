{"Literature Review": "Padlock probe–based in situ sequencing (ISS) has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization and quantification of gene expression within the context of tissue architecture. This method leverages the unique properties of padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high-resolution spatial mapping of RNA molecules, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and intercellular interactions that are often lost in bulk sequencing approaches.Padlock probes are circular DNA molecules that hybridize to a specific target RNA sequence and are subsequently ligated to form a circular template. This circular template serves as a substrate for RCA, which generates long, repetitive sequences that can be detected using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. The combination of these techniques allows for the visualization of multiple RNA targets simultaneously within a single cell, making ISS a valuable tool for studying complex biological systems (Nielson et al., 2013).One of the key advantages of padlock probe–based ISS is its ability to maintain the spatial context of gene expression. Unlike traditional bulk RNA sequencing, which provides an average expression profile across a population of cells, ISS can reveal the precise location of RNA molecules within tissues. This spatial information is crucial for understanding the functional organization of tissues and the interactions between different cell types. For example, ISS has been used to map the expression of immune-related genes in tumor microenvironments, providing insights into the spatial distribution of immune cells and their interactions with cancer cells (Ståhl et al., 2016).Recent methodological advancements have further enhanced the capabilities of padlock probe–based ISS. For instance, the development of multiplexed ISS protocols has enabled the simultaneous detection of hundreds of RNA targets, significantly expanding the scope of spatial transcriptomic studies (Ke et al., 2013). These multiplexed approaches have been applied to generate spatial cell atlases, which provide a comprehensive map of gene expression patterns across different cell types and tissue regions. Such atlases are invaluable for understanding the cellular composition and organization of tissues, and have been used to study a wide range of biological processes, including development, disease, and regeneration (Larsson et al., 2019).In addition to methodological advancements, computational tools have been developed to analyze and interpret the complex data generated by padlock probe–based ISS. These tools include algorithms for image processing, RNA target identification, and spatial data analysis. For example, the SpatialDE algorithm has been used to identify genes with spatially variable expression patterns, which can provide insights into the functional organization of tissues (Andrews et al., 2018). Other computational tools, such as Seurat, have been adapted to integrate spatial transcriptomic data with other types of omics data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of cellular heterogeneity and function (Stuart et al., 2019).Padlock probe–based ISS is also compatible with other spatially resolved transcriptomic methods, such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). These methods can be used in combination to provide complementary information about gene expression and cellular organization. For example, ST can provide a broader overview of gene expression patterns across a tissue section, while ISS can provide more detailed information about specific RNA targets within individual cells (Larsson et al., 2018). The integration of these methods has the potential to generate a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional view of tissue organization and function.Furthermore, padlock probe–based ISS can be integrated with multiomic platforms to provide a more holistic understanding of cellular processes. For instance, the combination of ISS with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility assays (ATAC-seq) can provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression and cellular identity. This multiomic approach has been used to study the development of complex tissues, such as the brain, and to identify cell types and states that are difficult to distinguish using single-omics approaches (Cao et al., 2017).In conclusion, padlock probe–based ISS is a powerful and versatile method for spatially resolved transcriptomics. Its ability to maintain the spatial context of gene expression, combined with recent methodological and computational advancements, has made it an essential tool for studying the functional organization of tissues and the interactions between different cell types. The integration of ISS with other spatially resolved transcriptomic methods and multiomic platforms holds great promise for advancing our understanding of complex biological systems and for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a wide range of diseases.", "References": [{"title": "In situ sequencing of mRNA using padlock probes and rolling circle amplification", "authors": "T.
