{"Literature Review": "The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are critical for bone development and skeletal health. These pathways are part of the larger TGF-β superfamily, which includes a variety of ligands, receptors, and downstream signaling molecules. Dysregulation of these pathways can lead to a wide range of skeletal dysplasias, characterized by both short and tall stature. This review focuses on the latest advances in understanding the role of TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal dysplasias, particularly those resulting in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) and tall stature (Marfan syndrome). Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting bone and cartilage development. Over 30 different types of skeletal dysplasia have been linked to pathogenic variants in genes that belong to the TGF-β superfamily or regulate TGF-β/BMP bioavailability. The TGF-β superfamily includes TGF-β, BMPs, activins, and nodal, which signal through a complex network of receptors and intracellular mediators, such as Smad proteins.", "References": [{"title": "The TGF-β superfamily and its role in skeletal development and disease", "authors": "D.
