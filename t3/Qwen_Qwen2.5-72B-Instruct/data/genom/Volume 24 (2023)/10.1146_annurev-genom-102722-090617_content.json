{"Literature Review": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of visual function, as it ensures that light is precisely focused on the retina. The mean axial length of the adult human eye is approximately 23.5 mm, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate this length remain poorly understood. Abnormalities in axial length can lead to significant visual morbidity, with underdevelopment resulting in microphthalmia and overgrowth leading to high myopia. Microphthalmia, defined as an eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood, is a severe condition that can result in profound visual impairment or blindness. High myopia, characterized by an axial length of 26.5 mm or more, is a common condition that increases the risk of various ocular complications, including retinal detachment, glaucoma, and macular degeneration. Both microphthalmia and high myopia exhibit high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Over 90 genes have been implicated in microphthalmia, and several hundred genes are associated with myopia. However, the diagnostic yields for these conditions remain low, highlighting the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying axial length determination. Recent advances in genetic and molecular studies have begun to uncover the shared molecular pathways that regulate eye size, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie both under- and overgrowth of the eye. One of the key genetic factors associated with microphthalmia is the PAX6 gene, which plays a crucial role in eye development. Mutations in PAX6 can lead to a spectrum of ocular anomalies, including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma. Similarly, the SOX2 gene, a transcription factor essential for the development of the optic vesicle, has been linked to microphthalmia and anophthalmia. These findings underscore the importance of transcription factors in the regulation of eye size and development. In contrast, high myopia is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic loci associated with myopia, including the 15q14 locus, which harbors the ZMAT4 gene. The ZMAT4 gene is thought to play a role in the regulation of eye growth, although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Another gene, RASGRF1, has been implicated in the development of high myopia, with variants in this gene associated with increased axial length. These genetic studies highlight the polygenic nature of myopia and the involvement of multiple pathways in the regulation of eye growth. Environmental factors, such as near work and outdoor activity, also play a significant role in the development of myopia. Studies have shown that increased time spent outdoors is associated with a reduced risk of myopia, suggesting that light exposure and visual stimuli may influence eye growth. The interplay between genetic and environmental factors in myopia development is complex, and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular pathways that regulate axial length. For example, the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of eye size. Wnt signaling is known to play a role in the development and growth of various tissues, and disruptions in this pathway have been associated with ocular anomalies, including microphthalmia. Similarly, the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, has been linked to the regulation of eye growth. These findings suggest that common signaling pathways may be involved in both the under- and overgrowth of the eye. The identification of shared molecular pathways in microphthalmia and high myopia has important implications for the development of therapeutic interventions. For example, understanding the role of Wnt signaling in eye growth could lead to the development of targeted therapies that modulate this pathway to prevent or treat myopia. Similarly, the identification of genetic variants associated with myopia could inform personalized treatment strategies, such as the use of atropine eye drops or orthokeratology, which have been shown to slow the progression of myopia. In conclusion, the genetic determinants of axial length are complex and involve multiple genes and signaling pathways. While significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying microphthalmia and high myopia, much remains to be discovered. Further research is needed to elucidate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to axial length determination and to develop effective therapies for these conditions. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length regulation will have far-reaching implications for the prevention and treatment of visual disorders, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.", "References": [{"title": "The genetics of microphthalmia and anophthalmia", "authors": "Khan, N., Carr, I.
