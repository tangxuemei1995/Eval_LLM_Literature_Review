{"Literature Review": "Meiosis is a specialized cell division process that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing haploid gametes. A critical step in meiosis is the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that facilitates homologous chromosome pairing and recombination. The SC is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and the maintenance of genetic diversity. In recent years, mutations in genes encoding SC proteins have been increasingly linked to various forms of infertility in both males and females. This literature review integrates structural and genetic data to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which SC mutations contribute to human infertility.The mammalian SC is a highly organized structure composed of at least eight coiled-coil proteins, including SYCP1, SYCP2, SYCP3, and SYCE1-3 (Herruzo et al., 2018). These proteins interact to form a tripartite structure, with the central element (CE) flanked by lateral elements (LEs) and transverse filaments (TFs). The LEs are primarily composed of SYCP3, which forms the axial elements (AEs) along the length of each chromosome. The TFs, composed of SYCP1, connect the AEs of homologous chromosomes, while the CE, composed of SYCE1-3, stabilizes the SC (Page and Hawley, 2004).Mutations in SC genes have been associated with a range of reproductive disorders. For instance, mutations in the SYCP3 gene have been linked to azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate (Kumar et al., 2017). A study by Kumar et al. (2017) identified a frameshift mutation in SYCP3 that results in a truncated protein, leading to defective chromosome synapsis and spermatogenic arrest. Similarly, mutations in SYCP1 have been associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by premature ovarian failure and infertility in women (Liu et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2019) reported a missense mutation in SYCP1 that disrupts the protein's ability to form stable interactions with other SC components, leading to impaired homologous chromosome pairing and increased rates of aneuploidy.The impact of SC mutations on fertility can be further understood by examining the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects. For example, the SYCE1 protein plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the SC and the formation of genetic crossovers. Mutations in SYCE1 have been shown to result in reduced levels of the protein, leading to defective SC assembly and increased rates of meiotic errors (Revenkova et al., 2008). Revenkova et al. (2008) demonstrated that SYCE1-deficient mice exhibit impaired homologous chromosome pairing and increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks, which are essential for the initiation of meiotic recombination. These findings highlight the importance of SYCE1 in maintaining the integrity of the SC and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation.In addition to structural defects, SC mutations can also result in functional abnormalities that affect meiotic progression. For instance, the SYCP2 protein is involved in the formation and maintenance of the AEs. Mutations in SYCP2 have been associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), a condition characterized by multiple consecutive miscarriages (Chen et al., 2020). Chen et al. (2020) identified a missense mutation in SYCP2 that disrupts the protein's ability to form stable A Es, leading to defective chromosome synapsis and increased rates of aneuploidy in early embryos. These findings suggest that SYCP2 plays a critical role in ensuring the proper formation and function of the SC, which is essential for successful meiotic progression and embryo development.The genetic basis of SC mutations and their impact on fertility is further complicated by the presence of dominant-negative mutations. These mutations, which are often heterozygous, can have a significant impact on SC function by disrupting the assembly and stability of the complex. For example, a study by Li et al. (2016) identified a dominant-negative mutation in SYCP1 that results in the production of a truncated protein. This truncated protein competes with the wild-type protein for binding sites on the SC, leading to the formation of unstable and dysfunctional SCs. Li et al. (2016) demonstrated that heterozygous mice carrying this mutation exhibit impaired homologous chromosome pairing and increased rates of aneuploidy, highlighting the pathogenic potential of dominant-negative mutations in SC genes.The impact of SC mutations on fertility can also be influenced by the specific stage of meiosis at which the defect occurs. For instance, mutations that affect the early stages of SC assembly, such as the formation of AEs, can have more severe consequences than those that affect later stages, such as the stabilization of the SC. A study by Roig et al. (2010) demonstrated that mutations in SYCP3, which is involved in the formation of AEs, result in more severe meiotic defects compared to mutations in SYCE1, which is involved in the stabilization of the SC. Roig et al. (2010) found that SYCP3-deficient mice exhibit extensive chromosomal abnormalities and spermatogenic arrest, while SYCE1-deficient mice exhibit milder defects, such as reduced levels of genetic crossovers. These findings suggest that the timing and nature of SC defects can significantly influence the severity of the resulting reproductive disorder.In conclusion, the synaptonemal complex plays a critical role in meiotic chromosome synapsis and recombination, and mutations in SC genes can have profound effects on fertility. The molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are complex and can involve structural and functional abnormalities, as well as dominant-negative mutations. Understanding the genetic and molecular basis of SC mutations is essential for developing targeted therapies and improving the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive disorders. Future research should focus on identifying novel SC mutations and elucidating their functional consequences, as well as exploring the potential for gene therapy and other molecular interventions to restore SC function and improve fertility outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "The synaptonemal complex: A structure with regulatory functions", "authors": "Herruzo, E.
