{"Literature Review": "The SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin-remodeling complexes play a crucial role in the development and differentiation of neural crest cells (NCCs), which give rise to a diverse array of derivatives, including elements of the craniofacial skeleton, skin pigmentation, and the peripheral nervous system. Two mammalian paralogs of the SWI/SNF complexes, BAF (Brg1-associated factors) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF), are essential for the proper specification and function of NCCs during normal mammalian development. Recent studies have highlighted the multipotency of Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), which are derived from NCCs. SCPs can give rise to various cell types, including Schwann cells, melanocytes, and smooth muscle cells. The BAF and PBAF complexes are critical for maintaining the multipotency and differentiation potential of SCPs. For instance, the BAF complex has been shown to regulate the expression of key transcription factors such as Sox10 and Krox20, which are essential for the development of Schwann cells and other NCC derivatives. Pathogenic variants in components of the BAF and PBAF complexes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neural crest–derived tumors. One of the most well-studied components is SMARCB1 (also known as INI1 or hSNF5), a core subunit of the BAF complex. Transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that pathogenic variants in Smarcb1 result in the formation of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors, such as rhabdoid tumors, during early development. These tumors are characterized by the loss of SMARCB1 expression and are often associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of SMARCB1 in later stages of development is more complex. Homozygous inactivation of Smarcb1 later in development requires additional pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor genes to drive the development of differentiated adult neoplasms derived from the neural crest. For example, schwannomas, which are benign tumors of Schwann cells, are often associated with mutations in the NF2 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein Merlin. The combination of SMARCB1 loss and NF2 mutations can lead to the development of more aggressive schwannomas. The temporal and spatial regulation of the BAF and PBAF complexes is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of NCC derivatives. For instance, the BAF complex is involved in the regulation of neural crest migration and the establishment of the craniofacial skeleton. Studies have shown that the BAF complex interacts with other transcription factors, such as Pax3 and FoxD3, to regulate the expression of genes involved in neural crest migration and differentiation. Disruption of these interactions can lead to developmental defects, such as craniofacial abnormalities and neural tube defects. In addition to its role in development, the BAF complex is also involved in the maintenance of neural crest–derived tissues in adults. For example, the BAF complex is essential for the maintenance of Schwann cell identity and function. Loss of SMARCB1 in Schwann cells can lead to the dedifferentiation of these cells and the formation of aggressive tumors. This highlights the importance of the BAF complex in both developmental and adult contexts. The PBAF complex, another paralog of the SWI/SNF complex, also plays a critical role in neural crest development and disease. The PBAF complex contains unique subunits, such as BRD7 and BRD9, which are not found in the BAF complex. These subunits contribute to the specific functions of the PBAF complex in neural crest development. For example, BRD7 has been shown to interact with the transcription factor Sox10 to regulate the expression of genes involved in Schwann cell differentiation. Pathogenic variants in BRD7 have been associated with developmental disorders, such as Kabuki syndrome, which can affect neural crest derivatives. In conclusion, the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes, particularly the BAF and PBAF complexes, are essential for the proper development and function of neural crest cells and their derivatives. Pathogenic variants in components of these complexes can lead to the development of aggressive tumors, such as rhabdoid tumors, and more differentiated adult neoplasms, such as schwannomas. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the BAF and PBAF complexes in neural crest development and disease is crucial for the development of targeted therapies for these conditions.", "References": [{"title": "A Brg1 mutation that uncouples ATPase activity from chromatin remodeling reveals an ATP-dependent role for SWI/SNF in global cell cycle gene regulation.", "authors": "Bultman, S.
