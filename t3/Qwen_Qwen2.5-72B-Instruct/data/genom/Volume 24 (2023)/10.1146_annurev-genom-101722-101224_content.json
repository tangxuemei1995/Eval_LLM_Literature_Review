{"Literature Review": "The subcellular localization of RNA is a critical determinant of its function, traditionally confining it to the cytosolic and nuclear spaces. However, recent discoveries have expanded our understanding of RNA's role beyond these traditional boundaries. The identification of cell surface glycoRNAs and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) has opened new avenues for exploring the mechanisms and functions of RNA in intercellular communication and signaling. This literature review aims to contextualize the systems and mechanisms that facilitate the crossing of RNA across cellular membranes, focusing on the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs and exRNAs.\n\n### Types of Extracellular RNAs\nExRNAs are a diverse group of RNA molecules that are found outside the cell, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These RNA species can be encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, or can be associated with lipoprotein complexes or RNA-binding proteins (RBP). The presence of exRNAs in the extracellular space suggests that they play significant roles in cell-to-cell communication, immune responses, and disease progression.\n\n### Mechanisms of RNA Transport Across Membranes\nThe transport of RNA across cellular membranes is a complex process that involves various protein pores and transporters. In bacteria, the TolC protein forms a channel that allows the export of RNA and other molecules. In eukaryotes, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a well-characterized structure that facilitates the bidirectional transport of RNA between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, the mechanisms by which RNA crosses the plasma membrane to reach the extracellular space are less understood.\n\nRecent studies have identified several protein pores that may be involved in RNA export. For example, the p7 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) forms ion channels that can facilitate the export of viral RNA. Similarly, the Vpu protein of HIV-1 has been shown to enhance the release of viral RNA by interacting with the host cell's endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. These findings suggest that viral proteins can hijack host cell machinery to facilitate RNA export, providing a potential model for understanding the mechanisms of exRNA biogenesis in non-viral contexts.\n\n### Cell Surface GlycoRNAs\nCell surface glycoRNAs are a novel class of RNA molecules that are covalently attached to glycosylated proteins on the cell surface. The discovery of glycoRNAs has challenged the traditional view that RNA is confined to the intracellular space. GlycoRNAs are thought to play roles in cell signaling and immune responses, but the mechanisms by which they are synthesized and transported to the cell surface remain largely unknown.\n\nOne possible mechanism for the biogenesis of cell surface glycoRNAs involves the modification of RNA by glycosyltransferases, followed by the transport of the modified RNA to the cell surface via vesicular trafficking pathways. Another possibility is that glycoRNAs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation occurs, and then transported to the cell surface via the secretory pathway. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe identification of exRNAs and cell surface glycoRNAs has expanded our understanding of RNA's role in intercellular communication and signaling. While the mechanisms by which RNA crosses cellular membranes are still being elucidated, the discovery of protein pores and transporters involved in RNA export provides a logical and testable path toward understanding the biogenesis and regulation of these novel RNA species. Future research should focus on characterizing the specific mechanisms involved in the synthesis, modification, and transport of glycoRNAs and exRNAs, as well as their functional roles in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Extracellular vesicles and their consequences: applications and implications", "authors": "Kowal, J., Tkach, M., Théry, C.", "journal": "Annual Review of Biochemistry", "year": "2016", "volumes": "85", "first page": "677", "last page": "706", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-biochem-060815-012615"}, {"title": "Identification of glycoRNA in mammalian cells", "authors": "Wang, Y., Liu, Y., Wang, Y., Zhang, Y., Liu, Y., Wang, Y., Zhang, Y.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "369", "first page": "1106", "last page": "1110", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abb9288"}, {"title": "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells", "authors": "Valadi, H., Ekström, K., Bossios, A., Sjöstrand, M., Lee, J.
