{"Literature Review": "The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a central regulator of cell growth and homeostasis in eukaryotes, comprising two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. While TORC1 has been extensively studied for its role in nutrient sensing and growth control, TORC2 has emerged as a critical regulator of plasma membrane (PM) integrity and cell polarity. This review focuses on the regulation of TORC2 function and localization in yeast, particularly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, highlighting recent advances and key findings from the literature. TORC2 is a multiprotein complex that includes the catalytic subunit Tor2, along with regulatory subunits such as Avo1, Avo2, Avo3, Bit61, and Lst8. The assembly and stability of TORC2 are crucial for its function, and several studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying this process. For instance, Avo1 and Avo2 are essential for the formation and stability of the complex, as demonstrated by genetic and biochemical analyses. These subunits interact with Tor2 to form a stable core, which is further stabilized by the addition of Avo3 and Bit61. The localization of TORC2 to the plasma membrane is a key aspect of its function. Studies have shown that phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), play a critical role in the recruitment and activation of TORC2 at the PM. PI(4,5)P2 interacts with the PH domain of Avo1, facilitating the membrane association of the complex. Additionally, the interaction between Avo1 and the small GTPase Rho1 is essential for the proper localization and activation of TORC2. TORC2's primary function is to maintain the integrity and proper composition of the plasma membrane. It achieves this by regulating the levels and distribution of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterols, which are essential for membrane fluidity and function. Phosphorylation of the sphingolipid biosynthetic enzyme, CerS, by TORC2 is a critical step in this process. Furthermore, TORC2 phosphorylates the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein Slm1, which is involved in the regulation of sphingolipid synthesis and endocytosis. This phosphorylation event is crucial for maintaining the balance of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids in the PM, ensuring proper membrane function and cell growth. In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, TORC2 is also involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and cell polarity. The small GTPase Rho1, which is a key activator of TORC2, is itself regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. This interplay between Rho1 and the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the proper localization and activation of TORC2 at sites of active cell growth and division. Moreover, TORC2 phosphorylates the actin-binding protein Bem2, which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization and cell polarization. This phosphorylation event is crucial for the proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the establishment of cell polarity. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of TORC2 in stress response and membrane repair. Under conditions of osmotic stress, TORC2 is rapidly recruited to the PM, where it phosphorylates the protein kinase Ypk1, leading to the activation of a signaling cascade that enhances membrane integrity and cell survival. This stress response is mediated by the interaction between TORC2 and the small GTPase Rho1, which is activated by osmotic stress and promotes the recruitment and activation of TORC2 at the PM. The regulation of TORC2 activity is tightly controlled by various upstream signals, including nutrient availability, growth factors, and stress cues. One of the key regulators of TORC2 is the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which is activated by glucose and other nutrients. PKA phosphorylates the regulatory subunit Avo3, leading to the inhibition of TORC2 activity. This negative regulation ensures that TORC2 activity is tightly coupled to nutrient availability and cellular energy status, preventing excessive growth under nutrient-poor conditions. In summary, the regulation of TORC2 function and localization in yeast is a complex and multifaceted process involving the assembly and stability of the complex, its recruitment to the plasma membrane, and the regulation of its activity by various upstream signals. The proper functioning of TORC2 is essential for maintaining plasma membrane integrity, regulating lipid metabolism, and controlling actin dynamics and cell polarity. Future studies will likely continue to uncover new insights into the intricate mechanisms that govern TORC2 function and its role in cellular homeostasis and stress response.", "References": [{"title": "Structure and function of the TOR signaling network in yeast", "authors": "E.
