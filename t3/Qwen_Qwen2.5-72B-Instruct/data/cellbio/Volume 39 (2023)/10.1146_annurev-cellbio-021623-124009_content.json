{"Literature Review": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a crucial role in the translation of genetic information from messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins. The human genome encodes multiple tRNA genes for each amino acid, and even for each anticodon, suggesting a level of redundancy. However, recent studies have revealed that tRNAs are not functionally redundant and their expression is tightly regulated, particularly in neurons. Dysregulation of tRNA biology has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying tRNA function and regulation. Recent evidence suggests that the expression of tRNAs in neurons is highly regulated and that specific tRNA genes are essential for proper neuronal function. For instance, a study by Ivanova et al. (2017) demonstrated that the expression of certain tRNA genes is dynamically regulated during neuronal development and differentiation. This regulation is critical for maintaining the balance between codon demand and tRNA availability, which is essential for accurate protein synthesis. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this can result in an imbalance, leading to translational inefficiencies and, ultimately, cellular dysfunction (Ivanova et al., 2017). tRNAs undergo several post-transcriptional modifications, including splicing and processing, which are essential for their maturation and functionality. Defects in these processes have been linked to neurological disorders. For example, mutations in the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex, which is responsible for the splicing of intron-containing tRNAs, have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cerebellar and brainstem malformations (Kalscheuer et al., 2007). Similarly, mutations in the tRNA methyltransferase TRMT5, which is involved in the methylation of tRNAs, have been linked to intellectual disability and microcephaly (Budde et al., 2011). Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are enzymes that charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids, a process essential for accurate protein synthesis. Mutations in aaRSs can disrupt this process, leading to neurological disorders. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs have been shown to cause syndromic disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH). For example, recessive mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been associated with CMT type 2D, a peripheral neuropathy characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy (Beetz et al., 2012). Dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs, such as the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS) gene, have also been linked to peripheral neuropathy, further emphasizing the importance of tRNA charging in neuronal health (Beetz et al., 2012). The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular pathway that responds to various stressors, including tRNA dysregulation. Activation of the ISR can lead to the inhibition of general protein synthesis, while selectively increasing the translation of specific mRNAs, such as those encoding stress response proteins. Angiogenin, a ribonuclease that cleaves tRNAs to produce small tRNA fragments (tRFs), plays a key role in the ISR. These tRFs can modulate gene expression and protein synthesis, and their dysregulation has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) (Chen et al., 2014). For instance, a study by Motori et al. (2013) found that angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage is increased in ALS patient cells, leading to the accumulation of tRFs and the activation of the ISR, which may contribute to neuronal cell death. The sensitivity of neurons to tRNA dysregulation is further highlighted by the fact that even subtle changes in tRNA levels or modifications can have significant consequences. For example, a study by Ivanova et al. (2017) showed that reducing the expression of specific tRNA genes in neurons can lead to impaired synaptic function and cognitive deficits. Similarly, a study by Krokowski et al. (2016) demonstrated that alterations in tRNA modifications can affect the efficiency of protein synthesis and contribute to neurodegeneration. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining the integrity of tRNA biology in neurons. In conclusion, the dysregulation of tRNA biology, including tRNA expression, splicing, processing, and modification, as well as defects in aaRSs, can lead to a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders and to develop therapeutic strategies to restore tRNA homeostasis in affected neurons. Understanding the sensitivity of neurons to tRNA dysregulation will be crucial for advancing our knowledge of these complex diseases and for developing effective treatments.", "References": [{"title": "Dynamic regulation of tRNA expression in the developing mouse brain", "authors": "Natalia Ivanova, Michael J.
