{"Literature Review": "Toll signaling is a conserved pathway known for its critical role in innate immunity across the animal kingdom. However, its involvement in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in insects, particularly in Drosophila, has been a subject of extensive research. The discovery of this dual functionality in insects raises intriguing questions about the evolutionary history and mechanisms of neofunctionalization. This literature review explores the current understanding of how Toll signaling has been co-opted from its ancestral immune function to participate in embryonic patterning, focusing on various insect models and non-insect hexapods. In Drosophila, the Toll signaling pathway is essential for both immune responses and DV axis formation. The activation of the Toll receptor by the ligand Spätzle leads to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Dorsal, which regulates the expression of genes involved in DV patterning (Anderson et al., 1985). This dual role of Toll signaling in Drosophila has been well-documented, but the extent to which this integration is conserved across other insect species remains a topic of ongoing investigation. Studies in other insects have revealed a more complex picture. For instance, in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, Toll signaling is also required for DV patterning, but its role is less pronounced compared to Drosophila. Instead, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway, which is responsible for DV axis formation in most metazoans, plays a more significant role in Tribolium (Schröder, 2006). This suggests that the integration of Toll signaling into DV patterning may have occurred at the base of the insects or during their early evolution, with subsequent modifications in different lineages. Similarly, in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, Toll signaling is involved in DV patterning, but its role is again less prominent than in Drosophila. The BMP pathway is the primary driver of DV axis formation in Nasonia, indicating a pattern of reduced reliance on Toll signaling in more distantly related insects (Goltsev et al., 2007). These findings support the hypothesis that the ancestral role of Toll signaling in DV patterning was likely co-opted from its immune function and subsequently modified in different insect lineages. The milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus provides another interesting case study. In Oncopeltus, the Toll pathway is involved in DV patterning, but its role is more limited compared to Drosophila. The BMP pathway is the dominant player in DV axis formation, similar to what is observed in Tribolium and Nasonia (Angelini and Kaufman, 2005). This further reinforces the idea that the integration of Toll signaling into DV patterning is a derived feature within the insects, with varying degrees of involvement across different species. The cricket Gryllus bimaculatus offers additional insights. In Gryllus, the Toll pathway is involved in DV patterning, but its role is again less pronounced than in Drosophila. The BMP pathway is the primary driver of DV axis formation, consistent with the pattern observed in other non-Drosophila insects (Suzuki et al., 2009). This suggests that the ancestral BMP-based patterning system was likely co-opted by the Toll pathway in the early evolution of insects, with subsequent modifications leading to the diverse roles observed today. The extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue in most insect embryos, provides a potential clue to the co-option of Toll signaling. The serosa is known to play a crucial role in immune responses, and the Toll pathway is active in this tissue (Liu et al., 2016). This suggests that the ancestral immune function of Toll signaling may have been co-opted for its new role in DV patterning, possibly through the integration of the pathway into the early embryonic development of the serosa. Non-insect hexapods, such as springtails and proturans, do not exhibit the same integration of Toll signaling into DV patterning. In these organisms, the BMP pathway is the primary driver of DV axis formation, similar to other metazoans (Janssen et al., 2010). This further supports the idea that the integration of Toll signaling into DV patterning is a derived feature specific to the insects. The germ layer evolution and mesoderm formation are also influenced by the integration of Toll signaling. In Drosophila, the Toll pathway is crucial for the proper formation of the mesoderm, which is essential for DV patterning (Stathopoulos and Levine, 2002). In other insects, the role of Toll in mesoderm formation varies, reflecting the diverse evolutionary trajectories of the pathway. The serosal cuticle and blastodermal cuticle are early structures that form during insect embryogenesis and are influenced by the Toll pathway. The serosal cuticle, in particular, is an important barrier against pathogens and is regulated by the Toll pathway (Liu et al., 2016). This suggests that the ancestral immune function of Toll signaling may have been co-opted for its role in the formation of these early embryonic structures. In conclusion, the neofunctionalization of Toll signaling in insects from an ancestral immune function to a role in DV patterning is a complex and dynamic process. The integration of Toll signaling into DV patterning appears to have occurred at the base of the insects or during their early evolution, with subsequent modifications leading to the diverse roles observed in different species. The co-option of the Toll pathway from its immune function in the serosa provides a plausible mechanism for this evolutionary transition. Future research will continue to elucidate the molecular and genetic details of this fascinating evolutionary process.", "References": [{"title": "Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning is mediated by a Toll signaling pathway", "authors": "Anderson, K.
