{"Literature Review": "The issue of bias and discrimination remains a pervasive challenge across various domains of social life, including education, employment, and healthcare. While numerous interventions have been developed to mitigate these biases, their effectiveness has often been found to be limited. This literature review explores the role of laws and policies in both perpetuating and addressing biases, highlighting the need for systemic changes beyond individual-level interventions. One of the primary methods used to combat bias is debiasing training, which aims to alter individuals' cognitive processes and reduce discriminatory behaviors. However, a significant body of research indicates that these trainings often have short-lived effects. For instance, a meta-analysis by Dovidio et al. (2019) found that while debiasing interventions can temporarily change attitudes, their impact on behavior is minimal and typically lasts less than 24 hours. Similarly, a study by Lai et al. (2016) demonstrated that even after extensive training, participants' implicit biases returned to pre-intervention levels within a short period. The limited efficacy of debiasing trainings can be attributed to the broader social context in which they are implemented. Historical and contemporary laws and policies have created a segregated and stratified social structure that perpetuates biases. For example, residential segregation, which is often a result of discriminatory housing policies, limits intergroup contact and reinforces stereotypes (Massey & Denton, 1993). This lack of meaningful interaction between different racial and ethnic groups hinders the development of more positive and accurate perceptions, thereby maintaining biases. Moreover, educational policies that disproportionately affect marginalized communities contribute to the perpetuation of biases. For instance, the underfunding of schools in low-income areas, which are often predominantly populated by minority groups, leads to poorer educational outcomes and reinforces negative stereotypes (Kozol, 2005). These systemic issues create a cycle where biases are continually reinforced and difficult to break through individual-level interventions alone. In addition to housing and education, employment policies also play a crucial role in perpetuating biases. Discriminatory hiring practices, such as the use of subjective criteria that favor certain demographic groups, can lead to unequal opportunities and outcomes (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004). Furthermore, the lack of diversity in leadership positions within organizations can create a homogenous environment that discourages the inclusion of diverse perspectives and perpetuates biases (Phillips, 2014). Given the limitations of individual-level interventions, it is essential to consider how laws and policies can be leveraged to create more lasting changes in biases. One approach is to implement policies that promote intergroup contact and reduce segregation. For example, fair housing laws that prohibit discriminatory practices and encourage integrated neighborhoods can help break down barriers and foster more positive intergroup relations (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Similarly, educational policies that ensure equal funding and resources for all schools can help level the playing field and reduce the disparities that contribute to biases. Another strategy is to adopt affirmative action policies that aim to increase diversity and inclusion in various sectors. Affirmative action programs have been shown to improve the representation of marginalized groups in higher education and employment, leading to more diverse and inclusive environments (Bowen & Bok, 1998). These policies can help challenge stereotypes and reduce biases by exposing individuals to a wider range of perspectives and experiences. Furthermore, organizational policies that promote transparency and accountability can also play a crucial role in reducing biases. For example, implementing blind recruitment processes that remove identifying information from job applications can help reduce the influence of unconscious biases in hiring decisions (Goldin & Rouse, 2000). Additionally, establishing clear metrics for evaluating performance and promoting diversity can help ensure that decisions are based on objective criteria rather than subjective biases. In conclusion, while individual-level debiasing interventions have their place, they are insufficient to address the deep-seated biases that are embedded in our social structures. By recognizing the role of laws and policies in perpetuating biases, we can develop more comprehensive strategies that target the root causes of discrimination. Through the implementation of policies that promote integration, equality, and diversity, we can create a more just and inclusive society where biases are systematically reduced and intergroup relations are improved.", "References": [{"title": "A multi-method examination of the roots of racial prejudice in America", "authors": "John F.
