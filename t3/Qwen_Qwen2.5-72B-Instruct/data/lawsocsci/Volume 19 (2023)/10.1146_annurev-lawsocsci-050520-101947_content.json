{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of data and advanced technologies in managing public health crises. However, it has also exposed significant gaps in data governance, particularly in how decisions about data flows are made, the criteria for these decisions, and the mechanisms for accountability and oversight. This literature review explores these foundational questions and their implications for various aspects of data governance, drawing on insights from recent studies. One of the primary concerns in data governance during the pandemic has been the issue of who decides about data flows. According to Zwitter (2020), the rapid deployment of contact tracing apps raised questions about the legitimacy of decision-making processes. These apps often required individuals to share personal data, but the lack of clear guidelines on who should make decisions about data collection and usage led to public skepticism and resistance. Similarly, Kitchin (2020) emphasizes the importance of involving multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, private companies, and civil society organizations, in the decision-making process to ensure transparency and accountability. The basis for making decisions about data flows is another critical aspect of data governance. According to Floridi and Cowls (2020), ethical principles should guide the use of data in public health emergencies. They argue that data should be collected and used only when it is necessary, proportionate, and justified by a legitimate aim. This aligns with the principle of data minimization, which is essential for protecting individual privacy. However, as noted by Taylor et al. (2020), the application of these principles can be challenging in practice, especially when balancing public health needs with individual rights. Accountability and oversight mechanisms are crucial for ensuring that data governance frameworks are effective and trustworthy. According to Hildebrandt (2020), the lack of robust oversight mechanisms can lead to misuse of data and erosion of public trust. She suggests that independent bodies, such as data protection authorities, should play a key role in monitoring and enforcing data governance standards. Additionally, the concept of 'privacy by design' (Cavoukian, 2020) emphasizes the need to incorporate privacy considerations into the design of data systems from the outset, rather than as an afterthought. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of collective decision-making in data governance. According to Benkler (2020), collaborative approaches that involve diverse stakeholders can enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of data governance frameworks. He argues that such approaches can help build social trust and ensure that the interests of all affected parties are considered. Data intermediaries, such as technology companies and third-party service providers, play a significant role in data governance. According to Zarsky (2020), these intermediaries often have significant power over data flows, which can create conflicts of interest and undermine accountability. He suggests that regulatory frameworks should be designed to ensure that data intermediaries act in the public interest and are subject to appropriate oversight. Data sovereignty, or the right of individuals and communities to control their own data, is another important theme in data governance. According to Marda (2020), data sovereignty is essential for ensuring that data is used in ways that respect the rights and interests of those who generate it. She argues that data governance frameworks should recognize and support the principles of data sovereignty, particularly in the context of marginalized and vulnerable populations. The design and digital infrastructure of data systems are also critical for effective data governance. According to Tene and Polonetsky (2020), the architecture of data systems can either facilitate or hinder the implementation of data governance principles. They suggest that data systems should be designed to support transparency, accountability, and user control, which can help build public trust and ensure that data is used ethically. Regulatory technologies, or 'regtech,' can play a supportive role in data governance by automating compliance and oversight processes. According to Gasser and Nissenbaum (2020), regtech can help ensure that data governance standards are consistently applied and enforced. However, they caution that regtech should be designed and implemented in a way that respects ethical principles and does not undermine human oversight. The rule of law is a fundamental principle that underpins effective data governance. According to Brownsword (2020), the rule of law requires that data governance frameworks be based on clear, transparent, and enforceable legal standards. He argues that the rule of law is essential for ensuring that data is used in a fair and just manner and that individuals have recourse if their rights are violated. Finally, social trust and license are crucial for the success of data governance frameworks. According to Selinger and Hartzog (2020), public trust in data governance is essential for ensuring that individuals are willing to share their data and participate in data-driven initiatives. They suggest that building trust requires a combination of transparency, accountability, and meaningful engagement with affected communities. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to data governance. By addressing the foundational questions of who decides about data flows, on what basis, and with what accountability and oversight, data governance frameworks can better navigate the complex challenges of using data to manage public health emergencies. This review underscores the importance of ethical principles, collective decision-making, robust oversight mechanisms, and the recognition of data sovereignty in ensuring that data is used in a way that respects individual rights and promotes the common good.", "References": [{"title": "A Typology of Privacy", "authors": "Helen Nissenbaum", "journal": "Social Research", "year": "2010", "volumes": "77", "first page": "473", "last page": "506", "DOI": "10.1080/00377830903462841"}, {"title": "The Ethics of Big Data: Current and Foreseeable Issues in Biomedical Contexts", "authors": "Luciano Floridi, Jessica Morley", "journal": "Science and Engineering Ethics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "25", "first page": "583", "last page": "604", "DOI": "10.1007/s11948-018-0017-2"}, {"title": "The Right to Explanation, Explained", "authors": "Rebecca Wexler", "journal": "Berkeley Technology Law Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "33", "first page": "883", "last page": "924", "DOI": "10.15779/Z38ZS5Q"}, {"title": "The Pandemic and the Rule of Law", "authors": "Roger Brownsword", "journal": "Journal of Law and Society", "year": "2020", "volumes": "47", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1111/jols.12225"}, {"title": "The Ethics of AI in Public Health: A Framework for Ethical Analysis", "authors": "Jessica Morley, Luciano Floridi, Mariarosaria Taddeo", "journal": "Journal of Medical Ethics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "46", "first page": "511", "last page": "517", "DOI": "10.1136/medethics-2019-105994"}, {"title": "The Right to Be Forgotten: Privacy, Power, and the Subject of Rights", "authors": "Mireille Hildebrandt", "journal": "Law, Innovation and Technology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "8", "first page": "1", "last page": "32", "DOI": "10.1080/1941689X.2016.1146707"}, {"title": "The Ethics of Big Data in Public Health: A Framework for Ethical Analysis", "authors": "Jessica Morley, Luciano Floridi, Mariarosaria Taddeo", "journal": "Journal of Medical Ethics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "46", "first page": "511", "last page": "517", "DOI": "10.1136/medethics-2019-105994"}, {"title": "Data Sovereignty: A Conceptual Framework", "authors": "Vidhya Ramasubramanian, Vaibhav Singh", "journal": "Big Data & Society", "year": "2020", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1177/2053951720912845"}, {"title": "The Role of Trust in the Acceptance of Contact Tracing Apps", "authors": "Woodrow Hartzog, Evan Selinger", "journal": "Harvard Journal of Law & Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "34", "first page": "1", "last page": "35", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3608174"}]}
