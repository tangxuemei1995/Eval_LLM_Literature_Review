{"Literature Review": "Vaccination has long been a cornerstone of public health strategies, yet the discourse surrounding vaccines in legal and social science research often remains narrowly focused on their instrumental value in promoting public health outcomes. This literature review aims to explore the broader sociolegal and science studies perspectives on vaccines, moving beyond the instrumentalist approach to uncover the rich, multidisciplinary insights that can inform our understanding of vaccine hesitancy, acceptance, and the broader social and political implications of vaccination programs. The instrumentalist approach to vaccines in legal and social science research is characterized by its focus on using law and policy as tools to achieve specific public health goals, such as increasing vaccine uptake and reducing vaccine hesitancy. This approach is evident in numerous studies that emphasize the role of legal mandates, public health campaigns, and educational interventions in promoting vaccine acceptance. For instance, studies by Salmon et al. (2005) and Opel et al. (2011) highlight the effectiveness of legal mandates and public health messaging in improving vaccination rates. However, while these interventions have had some success, they have also faced significant challenges, particularly in addressing deep-seated vaccine hesitancy and the complex social and cultural factors that underlie it. Constructivist approaches, particularly those rooted in feminist sociology and anthropology, offer a more nuanced understanding of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance. These approaches emphasize the importance of context, culture, and power dynamics in shaping people's attitudes toward vaccines. Ethnographic research by Blume (2006) and Brown (2013) has revealed how vaccine debates can illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. For example, Blume's study of vaccine hesitancy among parents in the United States found that concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy were often intertwined with broader issues of trust in medical institutions and the government. Similarly, Brown's work in South Africa highlighted how historical experiences of colonialism and apartheid continue to influence perceptions of vaccines and healthcare. Science and technology studies (STS) provide another valuable lens for understanding vaccines. STS approaches take seriously the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics. These studies often focus on the ways in which vaccines are developed, distributed, and regulated, and how these processes intersect with broader social and economic systems. For example, Jasanoff (2005) and Kleinman (2011) have explored the role of regulatory frameworks and international organizations in shaping vaccine policies and practices. Jasanoff's work on the governance of biotechnology highlights the importance of considering the ethical and social implications of vaccine development and distribution. Kleinman's research on the global vaccine market underscores the economic and political factors that influence vaccine availability and access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the potential of these interdisciplinary approaches, there are significant methodological challenges in conducting research on vaccines from a sociolegal and STS perspective. One of the primary challenges is the complexity of the systems involved, which require a deep understanding of both the technical aspects of vaccine development and the social and political contexts in which they are used. Additionally, the interdisciplinary nature of this research often requires collaboration across multiple fields, which can be logistically and intellectually challenging. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation and new insights. The lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines reflects a broader trend in public health research, where instrumentalist approaches dominate. This trend is partly due to the practical and immediate goals of public health interventions, which often prioritize short-term outcomes over long-term, systemic changes. However, as the limitations of these approaches become increasingly apparent, there is a growing recognition of the need for more holistic and interdisciplinary research. Constructivist and STS approaches offer valuable tools for addressing the complex social and cultural factors that influence vaccine hesitancy and acceptance, and for developing more effective and equitable public health strategies. In conclusion, while the instrumentalist approach to vaccines in legal and social science research has had some success in promoting vaccine uptake, it is limited in its ability to address the deeper social and cultural factors that underlie vaccine hesitancy. Constructivist and STS approaches provide a more comprehensive understanding of these factors and offer valuable insights for developing more effective and equitable public health strategies. Future research should continue to explore these interdisciplinary perspectives and address the methodological challenges they present.", "References": [{"title": "Factors associated with refusal of childhood vaccines among parents of school-aged children: A case-control study", "authors": "Daniel A.
