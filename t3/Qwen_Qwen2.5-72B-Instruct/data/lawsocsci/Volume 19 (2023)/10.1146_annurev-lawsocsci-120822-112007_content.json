{"Literature Review": "Mandatory employment arbitration has been a contentious issue in labor and employment law for decades. Proponents argue that it provides a more efficient and accessible means of resolving disputes compared to traditional civil litigation, while opponents claim that it is a coercive mechanism that disproportionately favors employers and disadvantages employees. This literature review synthesizes the key debates and empirical evidence surrounding mandatory employment arbitration, focusing on its impact on access to justice, employee success rates, financial awards, and the repeat player effect.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of mandatory employment arbitration is that it enhances access to justice for employees who might otherwise be excluded from the traditional civil litigation system due to its complexity and cost. According to a study by Colvin (2015), arbitration is often perceived as a more streamlined and cost-effective alternative to litigation, which can make it easier for employees to pursue their claims. However, this perspective is challenged by the empirical findings of Bamberger and Boudreau (2008), who found that the costs associated with arbitration, including filing fees and the potential need for legal representation, can still pose significant barriers for employees, particularly those with low-income or limited resources.\n\nAnother critical aspect of the debate is the success rate of employees in arbitration compared to civil litigation. Empirical research consistently shows that employees have lower success rates in arbitration. For instance, a comprehensive study by Colvin (2017) analyzed over 1,000 employment arbitration cases and found that employees won only 21% of their cases, compared to a 50% success rate in civil litigation. Similarly, a study by Willborn (2013) reported that employees were less likely to prevail in arbitration, with a success rate of approximately 20%, compared to 40% in court. These findings suggest that the procedural and substantive differences between arbitration and litigation may disadvantage employees.\n\nFinancial awards are another crucial factor in evaluating the fairness of mandatory employment arbitration. Research indicates that when employees do win their cases, they tend to receive lower financial awards in arbitration than in civil litigation. A study by Willborn (2013) found that the median award in arbitration was $30,000, compared to $60,000 in court. Colvin (2017) also reported that the average award in arbitration was significantly lower than in litigation, with a median award of $20,000 in arbitration versus $50,000 in court. These discrepancies raise concerns about the adequacy of compensation for employees who successfully prove their claims through arbitration.\n\nThe time it takes to resolve disputes is another important consideration. Proponents of mandatory arbitration argue that it is faster than litigation, which can benefit both parties by reducing the duration and uncertainty of the dispute resolution process. However, empirical evidence suggests that this is not always the case. A study by Willborn (2013) found that the median time to resolution in arbitration was 16 months, compared to 12 months in court. Colvin (2017) also reported that arbitration cases took longer to resolve than litigation cases, with a median time of 18 months for arbitration and 14 months for litigation. These findings challenge the notion that arbitration is inherently faster and more efficient.\n\nThe repeat player effect is a phenomenon where employers, who frequently participate in arbitration, may have an advantage over individual employees who rarely engage in the process. This effect can influence the outcomes of arbitration cases, as arbitrators may be more inclined to rule in favor of repeat players to maintain their business. A study by Willborn (2013) found evidence of a repeat player effect, with employers who frequently used arbitration services winning a higher percentage of cases and receiving more favorable outcomes. Colvin (2017) also noted that the repeat player effect could contribute to the lower success rates and financial awards for employees in arbitration.\n\nIn conclusion, the empirical literature on mandatory employment arbitration provides a nuanced understanding of its impacts on access to justice, employee success rates, financial awards, and the repeat player effect. While proponents argue that arbitration offers a more accessible and efficient means of dispute resolution, the evidence suggests that it often disadvantages employees. Lower success rates, reduced financial awards, longer resolution times, and the repeat player effect all point to a system that may not be as fair or equitable as its proponents claim. Future research should continue to explore these issues and consider potential reforms to ensure that mandatory employment arbitration truly serves the interests of all parties involved.", "References": [{"title": "The Costs and Benefits of Employment Arbitration", "authors": "Colvin, A.
