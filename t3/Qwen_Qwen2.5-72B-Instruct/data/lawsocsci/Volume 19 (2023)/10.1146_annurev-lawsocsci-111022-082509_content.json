{"Literature Review": "The evaluation of litigants' experiences within the civil justice system is a critical area of study that intersects law and psychology. Understanding how individuals perceive their interactions with the legal system can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and fairness of judicial processes. This literature review synthesizes key findings from existing research, highlighting the factors that influence litigants' evaluations and the broader implications for law and policy. One of the foundational concepts in this field is procedural justice, which posits that the perceived fairness of procedures is a significant determinant of litigants' satisfaction and trust in the legal system. Procedural justice theory emphasizes the importance of transparency, respect, and voice in legal proceedings. Studies have consistently shown that litigants who feel they are treated with respect and given a chance to express their views are more likely to view the process as fair, regardless of the outcome. Another crucial factor in litigants' evaluations is the clarity and comprehensibility of legal procedures. Research indicates that when litigants understand the process and the reasons behind decisions, they are more likely to accept the outcomes. The role of legal representation also plays a significant part in shaping litigants' perceptions. Contextual variables, such as the type of case and the specific court, also influence litigants' evaluations. The physical environment of the courtroom and the behavior of court personnel can also impact litigants' experiences. Moreover, the duration of the legal process is a critical factor in litigants' evaluations. The use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms, such as mediation and arbitration, has been shown to positively influence litigants' evaluations. In conclusion, the evaluation of litigants' experiences in the civil justice system is a multifaceted issue influenced by procedural justice, clarity of communication, legal representation, contextual variables, and the efficiency of the legal process.", "References": [{"title": "Procedural Fairness as a Source of Legitimacy for Political, Legal, and Organizational Authorities", "authors": "Cass R.
