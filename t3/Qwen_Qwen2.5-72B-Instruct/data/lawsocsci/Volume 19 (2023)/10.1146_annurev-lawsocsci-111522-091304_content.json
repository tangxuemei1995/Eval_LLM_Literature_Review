{"Literature Review": "The study of global lawmaking, particularly in the context of intellectual property (IP) and international health emergencies, offers a rich ground for understanding the complex interplay between domestic and international legal frameworks. This literature review synthesizes existing scholarship to highlight key insights and methodological approaches, drawing primarily from the negotiation and implementation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and its implications for public health. The TRIPS agreement, adopted in 1994 as part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework, marked a significant milestone in the harmonization of IP laws across nations. It established minimum standards for the protection of IP rights, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights, which had profound implications for the pharmaceutical industry and access to essential medicines. The agreement's provisions on patent protection, for instance, extended the duration and scope of patent rights, leading to increased costs and reduced availability of generic drugs in developing countries. Despite its intentions to promote innovation and economic growth, the TRIPS agreement has been criticized for exacerbating health disparities, particularly in low-income countries. The high cost of patented drugs has limited access to life-saving treatments, such as antiretroviral therapies for HIV/AIDS, in regions most affected by the disease. This has sparked debates over the balance between IP protection and public health needs, leading to calls for flexibilities within the TRIPS framework to ensure equitable access to medicines. Scholarship on global lawmaking can be categorized into three primary methodological approaches: methodological internationalism, methodological nationalism, and the interplay between domestic and international factors. Methodological internationalism focuses on the role of international institutions and norms in shaping global governance. In the context of IP and health, this approach emphasizes the influence of international organizations, such as the WTO and the World Health Organization (WHO), in setting global standards and facilitating cooperation among states. Methodological nationalism, on the other hand, centers on the domestic political and legal processes that shape national policies and regulations. This perspective highlights the importance of local contexts, such as political economy, cultural values, and institutional structures, in determining how international rules are implemented and enforced. A third approach, which integrates both international and domestic factors, recognizes the co-constitutive nature of global lawmaking. This approach acknowledges that international norms and domestic policies are mutually reinforcing, with each influencing the other in a dynamic and iterative process. In the context of IP and health, this means that the effectiveness of international agreements depends on how they are adapted and integrated into national legal and policy frameworks. The interplay between domestic and international factors is particularly evident in the negotiation and implementation of regional and bilateral trade agreements. These agreements often include provisions on IP that go beyond the TRIPS standards, further complicating the landscape of global lawmaking. Moreover, the response to international health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted the need for a more integrated approach to global lawmaking. The pandemic has underscored the importance of international cooperation in the development and distribution of vaccines and treatments, while also exposing the limitations of existing IP frameworks in ensuring equitable access. The World Health Assembly's decision to establish a council for pandemic preparedness and response, which includes discussions on IP and technology transfer, reflects a growing recognition of the need for a more holistic and collaborative approach to global health governance. In conclusion, the study of global lawmaking in the context of IP and international health emergencies reveals the complexity and interconnectedness of domestic and international legal processes. While methodological internationalism and nationalism provide valuable insights, a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements is essential for a comprehensive understanding of global lawmaking. Researchers and policymakers should advocate for and integrate this approach in their work to address the challenges and opportunities presented by global governance in the 21st century.", "References": [{"title": "Implementing the TRIPS Agreement: A Guide for Developing Countries", "authors": "Carlos M.
