{"Literature Review": "The military detention facility at Guantánamo Bay naval base has been a focal point of controversy and debate since its inception in 2002. As a symbol of the US 'war on terror,' it has been associated with numerous human rights violations, including torture, indefinite detention without trial, and the use of military commissions. This literature review examines the legacy of Guantánamo across four US presidential administrations, highlighting the legal, political, and ethical dimensions of its operation and the broader implications for the rule of law and human rights. The establishment of Guantánamo was initially justified by the Bush administration as a necessary measure to detain and interrogate suspected terrorists captured during the conflict in Afghanistan. However, the facility quickly became a site of significant human rights abuses, including the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that amounted to torture. These practices were not only morally reprehensible but also violated international law, particularly the Geneva Conventions and the UN Convention Against Torture. The legality of Guantánamo and the treatment of detainees was challenged in several landmark Supreme Court cases. In Rasul v. Bush (2004), the Court ruled that detainees had the right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus petitions, a decision that marked a significant victory for due process and the rule of law. However, the Bush administration responded by creating military commissions, which were criticized for lacking the procedural safeguards of civilian courts and for their potential to produce unfair trials. The Obama administration, which took office in 2009, pledged to close Guantánamo within a year. Despite this commitment, the closure proved to be a complex and politically fraught process. Congressional opposition and concerns about the transfer of detainees to the United States or third countries hindered progress. While some detainees were released or transferred, the facility remained open, and the use of military commissions continued, albeit with some reforms aimed at improving their fairness and transparency. The Trump administration, which took office in 2017, reversed many of the Obama-era reforms and reaffirmed the use of Guantánamo and military commissions. The administration's stance reflected a broader skepticism of international law and multilateral institutions, as well as a willingness to prioritize national security over human rights. The Trump administration's policies further entrenched the partisan divide over Guantánamo, with Democrats generally advocating for its closure and Republicans supporting its continued operation. The Biden administration, which took office in 2021, has renewed efforts to close Guantánamo, but the process remains challenging. The administration faces similar obstacles to those encountered by the Obama administration, including congressional resistance and the difficulty of finding suitable countries willing to accept transferred detainees. Additionally, the ongoing military commissions, particularly the high-profile case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-defendants, continue to raise questions about the fairness and legitimacy of these proceedings. The legacy of Guantánamo is multifaceted and deeply intertwined with broader issues of national security, human rights, and the rule of law. The facility has become a symbol of the US government's willingness to circumvent legal norms in the name of counterterrorism, a practice that has eroded trust in the justice system and damaged the country's moral standing internationally. Moreover, the lack of a shared narrative about Guantánamo reflects the deep partisan divisions that characterize contemporary US politics, making it difficult to achieve a consensus on how to address the facility's legacy. In conclusion, the legacy of Guantánamo is a testament to the complex and often contradictory nature of US policy in the post-9/11 era. While the facility has been a source of controversy and human rights violations, it has also been a site of legal and political struggle, reflecting the ongoing tension between national security and the rule of law. The future of Guantánamo remains uncertain, but its impact on the discourse around human rights and the rule of law will likely be felt for years to come.", "References": [{"title": "The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals", "authors": "Jane Mayer", "journal": "Doubleday", "year": "2008"}, {"title": "All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime", "authors": "David J.
