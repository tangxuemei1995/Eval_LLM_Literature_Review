{"Literature Review": "The intersection of race and low-wage immigrant labor is a critical area of study that has gained increasing attention in recent years. This literature review synthesizes existing research to highlight the historical and contemporary factors that drive immigrant worker precarity and the central role of race in achieving worker justice. By building on the framework of racial capitalism, we examine the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession, which have shaped an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally. We also explore how racism and colonial legacies contribute to migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. Additionally, we analyze how racism permeates the immigration bureaucracy, exacerbating migrant worker precarity. Finally, we discuss the role of the traditional labor movement, worker centers, and the immigrant rights movement in advancing immigrant worker rights, while navigating the challenges of coalition-building.\n\nRacial capitalism, a concept introduced by Cedric J. Robinson (1983), provides a foundational framework for understanding the interplay between race and capitalism. Robinson argues that racial hierarchies are integral to the capitalist system, shaping economic relations and social structures. This perspective is crucial for analyzing the experiences of low-wage immigrant workers, who often face systemic barriers rooted in racial discrimination. For instance, studies have shown that racialized immigrants are more likely to be concentrated in low-wage, precarious jobs with limited opportunities for advancement (Bonacich & Appelbaum, 2000; Massey, 2007).\n\nThe legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession have had lasting impacts on the U.S. economy and society. Enslavement created a racial hierarchy that devalued Black labor and justified exploitation, while Indigenous dispossession facilitated the expansion of capitalist enterprises through land theft and resource extraction (Smith, 2015). These historical processes have contributed to the marginalization of racialized groups, including immigrants, who often find themselves at the bottom of the economic ladder. Contemporary research highlights how these historical legacies continue to influence the labor market, with racialized immigrants facing higher rates of unemployment, lower wages, and poorer working conditions compared to their white counterparts (Chavez, 2001; Zúñiga & Hernández-León, 2005).\n\nRacism and colonial legacies also play a significant role in creating migrant displacement. Economic policies and global inequalities, often rooted in colonial histories, force many individuals to migrate in search of better opportunities. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been linked to increased migration from Mexico to the United States, as it led to the displacement of Mexican farmers and the creation of a surplus labor force (Massey et al., 1994). Similarly, the legacy of colonialism in countries like the Philippines and India has contributed to the global migration of workers, particularly in sectors such as healthcare and domestic work (Parreñas, 2001).\n\nOnce in the United States, immigrant workers often encounter a hostile immigration bureaucracy that further exacerbates their precarity. Racial profiling and discriminatory practices within the immigration system can lead to detention, deportation, and the denial of legal status, which in turn limit access to basic rights and protections (Ngai, 2004). Research has documented how these policies disproportionately affect racialized immigrants, who are more likely to be targeted by immigration enforcement and subjected to harsher penalties (Menjívar, 2006). The fear of deportation can also deter immigrant workers from reporting labor violations or seeking help, perpetuating a cycle of exploitation (Hagan & Rodriguez, 2008).\n\nDespite these challenges, the traditional labor movement has played a crucial role in advocating for immigrant worker rights. Unions have historically organized immigrant workers and fought for better working conditions, higher wages, and legal protections (Foner, 2005). However, the changing nature of the labor market and the rise of non-traditional forms of employment have necessitated new strategies. Worker centers, which are community-based organizations that advocate for low-wage workers, have emerged as key players in this space. These centers provide legal assistance, training, and support to immigrant workers, helping them navigate the complexities of the labor market and assert their rights (Milkman & Wong, 2009).\n\nThe immigrant rights movement has also been instrumental in advancing the cause of immigrant workers. Through grassroots organizing, advocacy, and direct action, this movement has brought attention to the issues faced by immigrants and pushed for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels (García Bedolla, 2005). However, coalition-building within the movement has not been without its challenges. Tensions can arise between different racial and ethnic groups, as well as between immigrants and native-born workers, over issues of resource allocation and political representation (Wong, 2002). Effective coalition-building requires a commitment to addressing these tensions and fostering solidarity across diverse communities.\n\nIn conclusion, centering race in studies of low-wage immigrant labor is essential for understanding the complex dynamics that shape the experiences of immigrant workers. Historical and contemporary factors, including racial capitalism, the legacies of enslavement and dispossession, and the impact of colonial legacies, all contribute to the precarity faced by immigrant workers. While the traditional labor movement, worker centers, and the immigrant rights movement have made significant strides in advancing worker rights, ongoing efforts are needed to address the systemic barriers that racialized immigrants continue to face.", "References": [{"title": "Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition", "authors": "Cedric J.
