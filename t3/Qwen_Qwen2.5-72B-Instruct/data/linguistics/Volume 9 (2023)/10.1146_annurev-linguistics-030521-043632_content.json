{"Literature Review": "Verb classification is a fundamental aspect of linguistic analysis, essential for understanding the syntactic and semantic roles of verbs in sentences. In recent years, the advent of large-scale language models has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling these models to derive linguistic information from raw text corpora with minimal supervision. However, despite their impressive performance, these models often exhibit limitations in their understanding of nuanced linguistic phenomena, including verb classification. This literature review explores the current state of verb classification across languages, the role of human-designed lexical resources, and the potential benefits of augmenting pretrained language models with external verb knowledge. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of large language models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and its variants, which have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data and can capture complex linguistic patterns, including syntactic and semantic relationships between words. However, several studies have highlighted the limitations of these models in understanding deeper linguistic structures. For instance, Rogers et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive analysis of BERT's linguistic knowledge and found that while it excels at surface-level tasks, it struggles with more abstract and context-dependent aspects of language, such as verb classification. Verb classification involves categorizing verbs based on their syntactic and semantic properties, such as transitivity, aspect, and thematic roles. This classification is crucial for various NLP applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. Traditional approaches to verb classification rely on manually curated verb lexicons, which are created through extensive lexicographic work. These lexicons provide detailed information about the properties and usage of verbs in specific languages, making them valuable resources for NLP tasks. However, the creation and maintenance of verb lexicons are resource-intensive processes that require significant expertise and time. As a result, many languages lack comprehensive verb lexicons, limiting the applicability of traditional approaches in multilingual settings. To address this issue, researchers have explored alternative methods for generating verb classes, including crowdsourcing and unsupervised learning techniques. Crowdsourcing involves leveraging the knowledge of untrained native speakers to gather linguistic data, which can then be used to create verb lexicons. This approach has the advantage of being cost-effective and scalable, but it also raises concerns about the quality and consistency of the data collected. Unsupervised learning techniques, on the other hand, aim to automatically discover verb classes from large text corpora without the need for labeled data. These methods typically involve clustering algorithms that group verbs based on their distributional similarity. While unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for generating verb classes, it often requires careful tuning and may not always produce results that align with human intuition. Despite the limitations of large language models and the challenges associated with manual and unsupervised approaches, there is growing interest in augmenting pretrained models with external verb knowledge. Studies have shown that incorporating external linguistic resources can improve the performance of NLP models on various tasks. For example, Pinter et al. (2017) demonstrated that integrating verb lexicons into a neural machine translation system can enhance the accuracy of verb translations. Similarly, Raganato et al. (2018) found that using external knowledge to pretrain word embeddings can lead to better performance on downstream NLP tasks. The utility of external verb knowledge in enhancing the capabilities of pretrained language models is further supported by the work of Peters et al. (2018), who introduced the ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) framework. ELMo leverages contextualized word representations derived from bidirectional language models and can be fine-tuned with external linguistic resources to improve performance on specific tasks. This approach highlights the potential of combining the strengths of large language models with human-curated linguistic knowledge. In multilingual settings, the challenge of verb classification is compounded by the diversity of linguistic structures across different languages. While some languages have well-established verb lexicons, others lack such resources, making it difficult to apply traditional approaches uniformly. To address this issue, researchers have explored cross-lingual transfer learning, where knowledge from one language is used to inform the classification of verbs in another language. This approach leverages the shared linguistic features of related languages to improve the accuracy of verb classification in low-resource settings. In conclusion, while large language models have made significant strides in NLP, they still face limitations in understanding nuanced linguistic phenomena such as verb classification. Human-designed lexical resources, including verb lexicons, remain valuable tools for enhancing the performance of these models. Alternative methods, such as crowdsourcing and unsupervised learning, offer promising avenues for generating verb classes in multilingual settings. By integrating external verb knowledge with pretrained language models, researchers can bridge the gap between machine learning and human expertise, ultimately advancing the field of multilingual NLP.", "References": [{"title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding", "authors": "Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805", "year": "2019", "DOI": "10.48550/arXiv.1810.04805"}, {"title": "A Primer in BERTology: What We Know About How BERT Works", "authors": "Anna Rogers, Olga Kovaleva, Anna Rumshisky", "journal": "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "8", "first page": "842", "last page": "866", "DOI": "10.1162/tacl_a_00348"}, {"title": "English and Japanese Verb Classes", "authors": "Beth Levin", "journal": "Linguistic Inquiry", "year": "1993", "volumes": "24", "first page": "1", "last page": "50", "DOI": "10.1162/ling.1993.24.1.1"}, {"title": "Cheap and Fast - But Is It Good?
