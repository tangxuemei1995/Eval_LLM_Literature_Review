{"Literature Review": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework has emerged as a prominent approach within the broader field of probabilistic pragmatics, integrating insights from formal and experimental semantics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the RSA framework, its foundational principles, and its applications, while also addressing key challenges and future directions. The RSA framework was introduced by Frank and Goodman (2012) as a computational model that aims to explain how speakers and listeners use context and prior knowledge to infer the intended meaning of utterances. At its core, RSA treats language as a probabilistic system where the likelihood of an utterance being used or interpreted in a particular way is determined by a combination of the speaker's and listener's beliefs, the context, and the alternatives available. This probabilistic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how people communicate, moving beyond the traditional binary view of truth and falsity in linguistic meaning. One of the key features of RSA is its treatment of informativeness as a gradient property. Unlike classical models that assume a fixed set of possible meanings for each word or phrase, RSA posits that the informativeness of an utterance can vary depending on the context and the listener's prior beliefs. For example, the utterance 'It's hot' might be more informative in a context where the temperature is typically cool than in a context where it is typically warm (Goodman and Stuhlmüller, 2013). This gradient approach to informativeness is crucial for explaining how people can effectively communicate using vague or ambiguous language. Another important aspect of RSA is its context-dependent treatment of alternatives. In many pragmatic phenomena, the interpretation of an utterance depends on the set of alternative utterances that could have been used but were not. For instance, the scalar implicature 'Some of the students passed the exam' implies that not all students passed, because the stronger alternative 'All of the students passed the exam' was not used (Bergen et al., 2016). RSA models this by considering the probability distribution over all possible utterances, given the context and the speaker's goals. Subjective prior beliefs, or world knowledge, play a crucial role in the RSA framework. Listeners use their prior knowledge about the world to make inferences about the speaker's intended meaning. For example, if a speaker says, 'The book is on the table,' the listener might infer that the book is visible and accessible based on their prior experience with books and tables (Frank and Goodman, 2012). This integration of world knowledge into the model allows RSA to account for a wide range of pragmatic phenomena, including implicatures, presuppositions, and conversational implicatures. RSA also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation. In traditional models, the processes of speaking and listening are often treated separately, with different mechanisms and rules governing each. RSA, however, models both production and interpretation as part of a single, coherent system. The speaker's choice of an utterance is modeled as a rational decision based on the expected utility of the utterance, taking into account the listener's ability to interpret it correctly. Conversely, the listener's interpretation of an utterance is modeled as a Bayesian inference process, where the listener updates their beliefs about the world based on the speaker's utterance and their prior knowledge (Goodman and Lassiter, 2015). Despite its successes, RSA faces several challenges that need to be addressed for the framework to continue advancing. One of the primary challenges is scalability. While RSA has been successful in modeling small-scale pragmatic phenomena, scaling it up to handle more complex and realistic language use remains a significant challenge. This is particularly true for natural language processing (NLP) applications, where the model needs to handle large vocabularies and diverse contexts (Lassiter and Goodman, 2017). Another challenge is the treatment of the boundedness of cognition. RSA assumes that speakers and listeners are rational agents who can perform complex probabilistic computations. However, human cognition is limited, and people often rely on heuristics and approximations to make decisions. Future work in RSA should explore how to incorporate these cognitive limitations into the model, making it more realistic and applicable to real-world communication (Gibson et al., 2019). Finally, RSA must address the incremental and compositional nature of language. Language is processed incrementally, with each word or phrase building on the previous ones to form a coherent interpretation. RSA models have primarily focused on static, context-free scenarios, but extending them to handle the dynamic, incremental nature of language use is essential for a complete understanding of human communication. In conclusion, the RSA framework represents a significant advancement in the field of probabilistic pragmatics. By treating language as a probabilistic system, RSA provides a unified account of how speakers and listeners use context and prior knowledge to infer meaning. Despite its challenges, RSA has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of language and communication, offering new insights into the cognitive processes underlying human interaction.", "References": [{"title": "Predicting pragmatic reasoning in language games", "authors": "Michael C.
