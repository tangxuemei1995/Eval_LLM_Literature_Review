{"Literature Review": "The actuation problem in linguistics addresses the question of why a specific linguistic change occurs in a particular language at a particular time and place. This multifaceted issue has been approached from various angles, including sound change, individual and population perspectives, and the role of cognitive, social, and environmental factors. This review synthesizes existing literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of the actuation problem, focusing on sound change and its propagation through populations. Sound change, a fundamental aspect of language evolution, involves alterations in phonological systems over time. Labov (1994) posited that sound changes often begin as minor variations in pronunciation, which can be influenced by individual speaker-listeners' unique linguistic experiences and cognitive processes. These variations, initially present at the idiolectal level, can gradually spread through a community, leading to broader linguistic changes. However, the mechanisms by which these changes propagate are complex and multifaceted. Individual differences play a crucial role in the actuation of linguistic changes. Ohala (1981) emphasized that individual speaker-listeners' past linguistic experiences, physical attributes, perceptual abilities, cognitive styles, and social backgrounds significantly influence how they process and analyze the primary linguistic data they encounter. For instance, Labov (2001) found that social factors, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, can affect the rate and direction of sound changes. Similarly, Bybee (2006) highlighted the importance of frequency and usage-based factors in shaping linguistic variation and change. Cognitive processing styles also contribute to the actuation of linguistic changes. Pierrehumbert (2003) argued that individual differences in memory and attention can lead to divergent representations and grammars across speaker-listeners. For example, some individuals may be more likely to adopt innovative pronunciations if they align with their existing mental schemas, while others may resist such changes due to entrenched linguistic habits. This variability at the individual level can create a rich tapestry of linguistic diversity within a community. At the population level, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovations depend on the nature of contact between speakers with unique idiolects. Milroy and Milroy (1992) proposed that social networks and community structures play a critical role in the diffusion of linguistic changes. They suggested that tightly-knit social groups, where individuals frequently interact, are more likely to adopt and propagate new linguistic forms. Conversely, in more loosely connected communities, linguistic changes may spread more slowly or not at all. Individuals who possess the wherewithal to take advantage of linguistic innovations for ideological or social purposes can also drive the propagation of changes. Eckert (2000) demonstrated that certain individuals, often referred to as 'innovators' or 'leaders,' can influence the adoption of new linguistic forms by leveraging their social status or charisma. These individuals may use linguistic innovations to signal group identity, social status, or other ideological goals, thereby accelerating the spread of changes through the community. Despite the numerous factors that can facilitate the actuation and propagation of linguistic changes, the process is inherently stochastic and unpredictable. Trudgill (2011) noted that the alignment of multiple contingencies, such as social dynamics, cognitive biases, and environmental factors, is necessary for a linguistic change to occur and spread. Given the complexity of these interactions, the incrementation and propagation of linguistic innovations are expected to be relatively rare events. Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a promising approach to investigating the stochastic nature of language change propagation. ABM allows researchers to simulate the interactions between individual agents with varying linguistic behaviors and social characteristics, providing insights into how small-scale variations can lead to large-scale linguistic changes. Nettle (1999) used ABM to explore the role of social network structure in the diffusion of linguistic innovations, demonstrating that the topology of social networks can significantly impact the spread of changes. Similarly, Cuskley et al. (2018) employed ABM to study the interplay between cognitive biases and social learning in the actuation of linguistic changes, highlighting the importance of both individual and population-level factors. However, despite the advances in ABM, a comprehensive model of linguistic change actuation at the individual level remains elusive. While ABM can simulate the propagation of linguistic changes, it often simplifies the complex cognitive and social processes involved in actuation. Further research is needed to integrate detailed cognitive models with social network analysis and agent-based simulations to better understand the actuation problem. In conclusion, the actuation problem in linguistics is a complex and multifaceted issue that involves the interplay of individual and population-level factors. Sound change, driven by individual differences in linguistic experience, cognitive processing, and social context, can propagate through populations via social networks and the actions of influential individuals. Agent-based modeling provides a valuable tool for investigating the stochastic nature of language change propagation, but a comprehensive understanding of the actuation problem requires further integration of cognitive, social, and environmental factors.", "References": [{"title": "Principles of Linguistic Change: Internal Factors", "authors": "William Labov", "journal": "Blackwell Publishing", "year": "1994", "DOI": "10.1002/9781444351464"}, {"title": "The Origins of Vowel Systems", "authors": "John J.
