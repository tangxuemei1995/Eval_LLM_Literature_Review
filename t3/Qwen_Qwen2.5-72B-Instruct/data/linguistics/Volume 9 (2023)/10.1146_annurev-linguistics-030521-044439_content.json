{"Literature Review": "Compositionality, a fundamental principle in linguistics, posits that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. In the context of computational linguistics, this principle has been a cornerstone for developing models that can understand and generate human language. However, the advent of neural network models has challenged the traditional reliance on compositionality, as these models often achieve superior performance without explicit adherence to compositional principles. This literature review explores the role of compositionality in modern computational linguistics, particularly in the context of neural and neurosymbolic models, and discusses how compositionality can be reconciled with the need for broad coverage and robust generalization. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of neural models that significantly outperform traditional grammar-based models in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and semantic parsing. These models, such as transformers, leverage large amounts of data and complex architectures to capture intricate patterns in language. However, their success often comes at the cost of interpretability and the ability to generalize to unseen data. This raises the question of whether compositionality, which emphasizes the systematic combination of meaning, is still relevant in the era of neural NLP. Despite the impressive performance of neural models, several studies have highlighted the limitations of these models in capturing compositional generalization. For instance, even state-of-the-art neural models struggle to generalize to new combinations of known elements, a task that is inherently compositional. Similarly, neural models trained on semantic parsing tasks often fail to generalize to novel compositions of known parts, suggesting that these models do not fully capture the compositional structure of language. To address these limitations, researchers have explored hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of neural and symbolic models. Neurosymbolic models aim to integrate the representational power of neural networks with the rule-based reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems. These models can potentially offer a more balanced approach to compositionality, allowing for both broad coverage and systematic generalization. Another line of research focuses on designing neural architectures that explicitly incorporate compositional structures. For instance, introduced a recursive neural network (RNN) architecture that processes sentences in a tree-structured manner, aligning with the hierarchical nature of language. This architecture has been shown to improve performance on tasks that require compositional reasoning, such as natural language inference. Similarly, developed a compositional vector grammar (CVG) model that combines the strengths of neural and probabilistic grammatical models, achieving better performance on semantic parsing tasks. However, the integration of compositionality into neural models is not without challenges. One major challenge is the trade-off between expressiveness and interpretability. While more expressive models can capture a wider range of linguistic phenomena, they often become less interpretable and harder to control. Another challenge is the need for large amounts of annotated data to train these models effectively. Compositional models, which rely on structured representations, often require more detailed annotations than purely neural models. To overcome these challenges, researchers have explored various strategies. For example, proposed a method for training compositional models using weak supervision, where the model learns from noisy or incomplete annotations. This approach can reduce the dependency on large amounts of high-quality annotated data, making it more feasible to apply compositional models to a broader range of tasks. Additionally, recent work has focused on developing evaluation metrics that specifically assess a model's ability to generalize compositionally. These metrics can help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different models and guide the development of more robust compositional systems. In conclusion, while neural models have achieved remarkable success in many NLP tasks, the principle of compositionality remains a crucial aspect of language understanding and generation. The integration of compositional principles into neural and neurosymbolic models can enhance their ability to generalize to novel compositions and provide more interpretable and controllable representations. Future research should continue to explore the design space of compositional models, aiming to strike a balance between broad coverage and systematic generalization. By doing so, we can develop more robust and reliable NLP systems that better align with the cognitive and linguistic principles underlying human language.", "References": [{"title": "The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English", "authors": "Richard Montague", "journal": "Synthese", "year": "1970", "volumes": "22", "first page": "221", "last page": "242", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00413578"}, {"title": "Attention Is All You Need", "authors": "Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.
