{"Literature Review": "Heritage languages represent a unique category within the broader spectrum of bilingualism and multilingualism. These languages are typically acquired in early childhood but are subsequently used less frequently due to the dominance of the majority language in the environment. This literature review synthesizes foundational studies on the linguistic properties of heritage languages, age effects in language acquisition, and recent advancements in heritage language relearning and reactivation. The concept of a heritage language is rooted in its sociopolitical context, where it is often a minority or minoritized language. For instance, Spanish in the United States is a common example of a heritage language, spoken by immigrants and their descendants who may also acquire English as a dominant language. The acquisition of a heritage language is characterized by reduced exposure and limited use, which can lead to attrition and structural changes over time. One of the key areas of research in heritage languages is the comparison between heritage speakers and native speakers. Studies have shown that heritage speakers exhibit differences in various aspects of language, including phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. For example, heritage speakers may have a more restricted vocabulary and less complex grammatical structures compared to monolingual native speakers. These differences are attributed to the reduced input and the influence of the majority language, which can lead to incomplete acquisition or attrition of the heritage language. Age effects play a crucial role in the acquisition and maintenance of heritage languages. Research has consistently shown that the age at which a child is exposed to the majority language can significantly impact their proficiency in the heritage language. Early exposure to the majority language can lead to a shift in language dominance, resulting in the heritage language being used less frequently and becoming less proficient. This phenomenon is often referred to as 'language shift' and can be observed in immigrant communities where the younger generation tends to favor the majority language. Despite the challenges faced by heritage speakers, recent studies have explored the potential for relearning and reactivating heritage languages. Relearning refers to the process by which heritage speakers can improve their proficiency in the heritage language through formal instruction or immersion. Reactivation, on the other hand, involves the spontaneous recovery of language skills that were previously lost or dormant. Both processes highlight the resilience of the human brain in retaining and rebuilding language knowledge, even after periods of reduced use. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of relearning programs for heritage languages. For example, a study by Polinsky and Kagan found that heritage speakers of Russian who participated in a relearning program showed significant improvements in their grammatical accuracy and vocabulary size. Similarly, Montrul reported that heritage speakers of Spanish who received targeted instruction in specific grammatical areas showed marked improvements in their language skills. The study of heritage languages has important implications for both bilingualism and society. From a linguistic perspective, heritage languages provide valuable insights into the processes of language acquisition, attrition, and relearning. They challenge traditional notions of native speaker competence and highlight the dynamic nature of language knowledge. From a societal perspective, the maintenance and revitalization of heritage languages are crucial for preserving cultural identity and promoting linguistic diversity. In conclusion, the study of heritage languages is a multifaceted field that intersects with various disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, and education. Foundational studies have established the unique characteristics of heritage languages and the factors that influence their acquisition and maintenance. Recent research on relearning and reactivation offers promising avenues for supporting heritage speakers in improving their language skills. The continued exploration of heritage languages will contribute to a deeper understanding of bilingualism and the cognitive and social benefits of maintaining linguistic diversity.", "References": [{"title": "Incomplete Acquisition in Bilingualism: Re-examining the Age Factor", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "John Benjamins Publishing Company", "year": "2008", "DOI": "10.1075/tilar.1"}, {"title": "The Handbook of Heritage, Community, and Native American Languages in the United States: Research, Policy, and Educational Practice", "authors": "Elika Benmamoun, Silvina Montrul, Maria Polinsky", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2013", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203130163"}, {"title": "The Acquisition of Spanish: Morphosyntactic Development in Monolingual and Bilingual L1 Acquisition and Adult L2 Acquisition", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "John Benjamins Publishing Company", "year": "2004", "DOI": "10.1075/tilar.10"}, {"title": "Age and the End State of Second Language Acquisition", "authors": "David Birdsong", "journal": "Multilingual Matters", "year": "2005", "DOI": "10.21832/9781853598322"}, {"title": "Heritage Language Acquisition: A New Field of Inquiry", "authors": "Maria Polinsky, Olga Kagan", "journal": "Language and Linguistics Compass", "year": "2007", "volumes": "1", "first page": "313", "last page": "333", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00016.x"}, {"title": "The Bilingual Brain: Human Evolution and Second Language Acquisition", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "Oxford University Press", "year": "2016", "DOI": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190255977.001.0001"}, {"title": "Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes", "authors": "Rosalind King", "journal": "Multilingual Matters", "year": "2000", "DOI": "10.21832/9781853594952"}, {"title": "The Role of Age in Second Language Acquisition", "authors": "David Birdsong", "journal": "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics", "year": "2005", "volumes": "25", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1017/S0267190505000018"}, {"title": "The Role of Input and Interaction in the Acquisition of Heritage Languages", "authors": "Silvina Montrul", "journal": "Studies in Second Language Acquisition", "year": "2004", "volumes": "26", "first page": "157", "last page": "186", "DOI": "10.1017/S027226310404006X"}, {"title": "Heritage Language Maintenance and Loss: The Case of Russian in the United States", "authors": "Maria Polinsky, Olga Kagan", "journal": "International Journal of the Sociology of Language", "year": "2007", "volumes": "185", "first page": "1", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.1515/IJSL.2007.029"}]}
