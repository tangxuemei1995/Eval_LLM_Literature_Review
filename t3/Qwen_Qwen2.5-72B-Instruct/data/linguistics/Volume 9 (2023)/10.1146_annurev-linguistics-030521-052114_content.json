{"Literature Review": "In the contemporary globalized world, the ability to communicate effectively in a second language (L2) has become increasingly essential for academic, professional, and social interactions. The assessment of L2 speaking proficiency is a critical component of language education, yet it presents unique challenges due to the dynamic and ephemeral nature of spoken communication. This literature review synthesizes insights from various disciplines to develop a comprehensive understanding of L2 speaking proficiency and the factors that influence its assessment. Speaking proficiency is a multifaceted construct that encompasses both linguistic and strategic competencies. Linguistic competencies include phonological, grammatical, lexical, and discourse skills, which are fundamental for effective communication. Strategic competencies involve the ability to compensate for gaps in knowledge and to manage the communication process, such as using repair strategies and adjusting speech to the listener's needs. These competencies are interrelated and collectively contribute to the overall speaking proficiency of an individual. Interactional competence is another crucial aspect of speaking proficiency. It refers to the ability to engage in conversation, take turns, and respond appropriately to the interlocutor. Interactional competence involves rapid prediction and the ability to anticipate the flow of conversation, which is essential for smooth and effective communication. Research has shown that interactional competence is a distinct and important component of speaking proficiency, particularly in contexts where communication is primarily oral. The assessment of speaking proficiency is complicated by several factors that can introduce construct-irrelevant variance. Task design is one such factor. Tasks that are too complex or unfamiliar can overwhelm test-takers, leading to performance that does not accurately reflect their true speaking abilities. Conversely, overly simplistic tasks may fail to elicit the full range of the test-taker's linguistic and strategic competencies. Therefore, tasks should be carefully designed to ensure that they are appropriate for the level of the test-takers and that they elicit a wide range of communicative behaviors. Rater reliability is another significant challenge in speaking assessment. Raters may have varying interpretations of scoring criteria, leading to inconsistencies in the evaluation of test-takers' performances. To mitigate this issue, extensive rater training and clear, detailed scoring rubrics are essential. Additionally, the use of multiple raters and statistical methods to adjust for rater effects can enhance the reliability of the assessment. Interlocutor effects can also impact the validity of speaking assessments. Interlocutors, whether they are test administrators or other test-takers, can influence the test-taker's performance through their own communication style and behavior. For example, an interlocutor who provides minimal feedback or who dominates the conversation can hinder the test-taker's ability to demonstrate their speaking proficiency. Therefore, interlocutors should be trained to maintain a balanced and supportive role during the assessment. Technological advancements have opened new possibilities for assessing speaking proficiency. Computer-based testing (CBT) and automated speech recognition (ASR) systems have been developed to provide more objective and consistent evaluations. While these technologies offer potential benefits, they also raise concerns about the authenticity of the speaking tasks and the ability of the system to capture the nuances of human communication. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these technologies in assessing speaking proficiency. In conclusion, the assessment of L2 speaking proficiency is a complex endeavor that requires a multi-faceted approach. A comprehensive construct of speaking proficiency should include linguistic, strategic, and interactional competencies. To ensure valid and reliable assessments, it is essential to control for task design, rater reliability, and interlocutor effects. Future research should continue to explore the integration of technology in speaking assessment and the development of more authentic and contextually relevant tasks.", "References": [{"title": "Theoretical bases of communicative approaches to second language teaching and testing", "authors": "Michael Canale, Merrill Swain", "journal": "Applied Linguistics", "year": "1980", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "47", "DOI": "10.1093/applin/1.1.1"}, {"title": "On Disciplinary Boundaries and the Nature of Social/Sociocultural Activity", "authors": "Alastair Pennycook", "journal": "TESOL Quarterly", "year": "1997", "volumes": "31", "first page": "525", "last page": "542", "DOI": "10.2307/3587911"}, {"title": "Rater Effects and Rater Cognition in Performance Assessment", "authors": "Therese A.
