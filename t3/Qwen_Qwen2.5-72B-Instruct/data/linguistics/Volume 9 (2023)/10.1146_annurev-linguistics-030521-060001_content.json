{"Literature Review": "The study of homesign, or the gestural communication systems developed by deaf individuals without exposure to a formal sign language, has undergone significant transformations over the past few decades. Early research primarily focused on the developmental and structural aspects of homesign, often through the lenses of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics. However, a recent wave of linguistic ethnographic investigations has challenged many of the foundational assumptions and methodologies, leading to a critical reevaluation of how homesign is understood and studied. Early studies of homesign were instrumental in demonstrating that deaf children could develop complex communication systems in the absence of a conventional language model. Goldin-Meadow and Mylander (1998) documented the emergence of homesign systems in deaf children, highlighting the systematic and rule-governed nature of these systems. They found that homesigns exhibit properties such as consistent word order, morphological regularities, and the use of iconic gestures, suggesting that the human capacity for language is robust and can manifest even in the absence of a linguistic community. This work was pivotal in establishing homesign as a legitimate object of linguistic inquiry. However, subsequent research has raised important questions about the methodological and theoretical frameworks used in early homesign studies. Linguistic ethnographers have emphasized the importance of context and social interaction in the development and use of homesign. Schieffelin and Ochs (1986) argued that language is fundamentally a social practice, and that understanding homesign requires considering the broader sociocultural context in which it is used. This perspective challenges the notion that homesign can be studied in isolation from its social and cultural milieu. One of the key contested issues is the portrayal of deaf individuals and their communication practices. Deaf scholars have critiqued the tendency in early research to view deafness primarily through a medical or deficit lens, rather than recognizing the rich and diverse communication strategies employed by deaf individuals. Lane, Pillard, and Hedberg (2011) argue that the deaf community has its own cultural and linguistic practices, and that homesign should be understood as part of this broader cultural context. This perspective emphasizes the agency and creativity of deaf individuals in developing and using homesign. Another area of contention is the conceptualization of language itself. Early studies often assumed a universalist approach to language, positing that certain linguistic structures and processes are innate and universal across all human languages. However, recent research has highlighted the variability and diversity of homesign systems, challenging the idea of a single, universal template for language. Senghas, Kita, and Ozyurek (2004) demonstrated that homesign systems can vary significantly across different cultural and linguistic contexts, suggesting that language emergence is influenced by a range of factors, including social interaction and cultural practices. Linguistic ethnography has also brought attention to the role of gesture in homesign. Kendon (2004) emphasized the importance of gesture in human communication, arguing that gesture and speech are closely intertwined and that gesture can serve as a foundation for the development of more complex symbolic systems. This perspective aligns with the findings of recent homesign research, which has shown that homesign systems often incorporate both iconic and arbitrary elements, reflecting the interplay between gesture and language. The transition in homesign research is also reflected in the methods used to study these systems. While early studies relied heavily on experimental and observational methods, more recent research has adopted a more holistic and participatory approach. Wilcox (2000) advocated for a more collaborative and community-based methodology, emphasizing the importance of involving deaf individuals and communities in the research process. This approach not only provides a more nuanced understanding of homesign but also empowers deaf individuals to contribute to the knowledge production about their own communication practices. The critical movement within Deaf Studies has also influenced the direction of homesign research. Deaf scholars have called for a more inclusive and equitable research agenda that recognizes the value and validity of deaf perspectives. Bauman and Murray (2013) argue that deaf people should be at the center of research on deaf communication, and that their insights and experiences should inform the theoretical and methodological frameworks used in homesign studies. This shift towards a more participatory and inclusive research paradigm is reflected in the growing body of work that foregrounds the voices and perspectives of deaf individuals. In conclusion, the study of homesign is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a critical reevaluation of the foundational assumptions and methodologies used in early research. Linguistic ethnography, the recognition of the social and cultural context of homesign, and the involvement of deaf individuals and communities are key elements of this new direction. As the field continues to evolve, it is essential to remain open to new perspectives and to engage with the diverse and dynamic nature of homesign systems.", "References": [{"title": "Spontaneous sign systems of deaf children in two cultures", "authors": "Goldin-Meadow, S., & Mylander, C.", "journal": "Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development", "year": "1998", "volumes": "63", "first page": "1", "last page": "155", "DOI": "10.2307/1166214"}, {"title": "Language Socialization Across Cultures", "authors": "Schieffelin, B.
