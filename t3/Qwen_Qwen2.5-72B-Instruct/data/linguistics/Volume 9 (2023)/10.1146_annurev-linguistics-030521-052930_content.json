{"Literature Review": "The concept of the modern nation-state has been a central framework in the fields of language policy and planning (LPP) and sociolinguistics. However, its applicability and relevance in postcolonial contexts, particularly in Africa, have been increasingly questioned. This literature review explores the limitations of the modern nation-state concept in addressing language issues in postcolonial settings, emphasizing the need for a revised historical and theoretical framework that acknowledges the colonial legacy and the importance of Southern epistemologies. The colonial history of LPP is a critical starting point for understanding the current challenges in postcolonial language policies. According to Ricento (2000), the field of LPP emerged during the colonial era, where language policies were often designed to maintain colonial control and suppress indigenous languages. This historical context has shaped the way language issues are framed and addressed in postcolonial states. For instance, the colonial administration in Africa often imposed European languages as the medium of instruction and governance, leading to the marginalization of local languages (Phillipson, 1992). This legacy continues to influence contemporary language policies, where multilingualism is often viewed as a problem rather than a resource. The framing of African multilingualisms as problems to be solved is a direct result of the colonial legacy. Blommaert (2010) argues that the colonial project was not only about political and economic control but also about cultural and linguistic domination. The imposition of European languages and the suppression of indigenous languages were part of a broader strategy to create a homogeneous and controllable population. This historical context has led to a persistent view of multilingualism as a barrier to national unity and development, rather than as a rich cultural and linguistic resource (Mazrui, 1996). The contemporary understanding of citizenship in Africa is deeply entangled with the colonial history of the state. In many African countries, the concept of citizenship is based on a Western model of the nation-state, which emphasizes homogeneity and uniformity. This model is at odds with the diverse and complex social realities of postcolonial societies. For example, in Sudan, the notion of citizenship has been heavily influenced by the colonial legacy, where the state has often been seen as an instrument of control rather than a vehicle for inclusive governance (El Tayeb, 2011). The conflict in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, can be partly attributed to the failure of the state to accommodate the diverse linguistic and cultural identities of its population (Prunier, 2007). The construct of the 'developing nation' is another aspect of the methodological nationalism that characterizes early LPP frameworks. This construct assumes that postcolonial states are on a linear path towards modernization, with the ultimate goal of achieving a Western-style nation-state. However, this assumption overlooks the unique historical and cultural contexts of postcolonial societies. As Tollefson (2002) points out, the imposition of Western models of statehood and language policy has often led to the marginalization of local languages and cultures. This has resulted in a disconnect between the state and its citizens, further exacerbating social and political tensions. To address these limitations, there is a growing call for a perspective on language that is historically and locally embedded. This perspective recognizes the importance of Southern epistemologies in understanding and addressing language issues in postcolonial contexts. Southern epistemologies emphasize the value of local knowledge and practices, challenging the dominance of Western theories and methods (Canagarajah, 2005). For example, in the context of Sudan, local languages and cultural practices play a crucial role in community identity and social cohesion. Recognizing and valuing these local resources can contribute to more inclusive and effective language policies (Hassan, 2013). In conclusion, the concept of the modern nation-state has significant limitations in addressing language issues in postcolonial contexts. A revised historical and theoretical framework that acknowledges the colonial legacy and the importance of Southern epistemologies is necessary. This approach can lead to more inclusive and effective language policies that recognize and value the diverse linguistic and cultural resources of postcolonial societies.", "References": [{"title": "Language Policy and Political Economy: English in the Developing World", "authors": "Terry Ricento", "journal": "Annual Review of Applied Linguistics", "year": "2000", "volumes": "20", "first page": "145", "last page": "164", "DOI": "10.1017/S0267190500000088"}, {"title": "Language and Identity in the Sudan", "authors": "Abdel Rahim M.
