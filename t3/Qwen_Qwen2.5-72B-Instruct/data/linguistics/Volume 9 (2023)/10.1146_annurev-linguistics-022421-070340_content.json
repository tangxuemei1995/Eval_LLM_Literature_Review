{"Literature Review": "The study of language has evolved into a multifaceted and interdisciplinary field, encompassing various perspectives and methodologies. This literature review aims to explore the epistemological and methodological frameworks in the study of language, focusing on its organization within linguistics departments and across other disciplinary areas. Additionally, we will highlight emerging transdisciplinary trends and the importance of recentering the human communicative experience. Linguistics, as a discipline, has traditionally been divided into several subfields, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Each subfield has its own set of theories and methods, which have been developed over time to address specific aspects of language. For instance, phonetics focuses on the physical properties of speech sounds, while syntax examines the rules governing sentence structure. These subfields often operate within distinct academic departments, reflecting the specialized nature of linguistic inquiry. However, the study of language is not confined to linguistics departments alone. Other disciplines, such as psychology, anthropology, and computer science, also contribute significantly to our understanding of language. These interdisciplinary approaches enrich our understanding of language by providing multiple perspectives and methodologies. The organizational structure of language studies reflects these interdisciplinary connections. Many universities have established interdisciplinary programs or centers that bring together scholars from different fields to collaborate on language-related research. Despite these interdisciplinary efforts, the study of language remains fragmented, with each subfield and discipline maintaining its own epistemological and methodological traditions. To address this issue, there is a growing trend towards transdisciplinary research, which seeks to break down disciplinary boundaries and foster collaboration across different fields. Transdisciplinary research in language studies involves integrating diverse perspectives and methodologies to address complex problems. One of the key challenges in transdisciplinary research is ensuring that the human communicative experience remains at the center of inquiry. To illustrate the complexity and relevance of the study of language across areas and paradigms, consider the investigation of lexical and morphological phenomena. In conclusion, the study of language is a rich and dynamic field that spans multiple disciplines and methodologies. While traditional subfields and departments continue to play a crucial role, there is a growing need for transdisciplinary research that integrates diverse perspectives and approaches. By recentering the human communicative experience, we can gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of language and its role in human life.", "References": [{"title": "Syntactic Structures", "authors": "Noam Chomsky", "journal": "Mouton", "year": "1957"}, {"title": "The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language", "authors": "Rodney Huddleston, Geoffrey K.
