{"Literature Review": "Tobamoviruses, including the well-known tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), are among the most economically significant plant pathogens, causing substantial yield losses in a wide range of crops (Adams et al., 2004). The recent emergence of the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) has further highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between tobamoviruses and plant immune systems. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the perpetual interplay between tobamoviruses and plant immunity, focusing on the mechanisms of viral evasion and suppression of plant defenses. Plants have evolved a sophisticated multilayered defense system to combat viral infections. The first line of defense is pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), which is activated upon recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the plant cell surface (Boller & Felix, 2009). PTI leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the reinforcement of the cell wall, and the induction of defense-related genes. However, tobamoviruses can often overcome PTI through the secretion of effector proteins that interfere with PRR signaling (Jones & Dangl, 2006). The second layer of defense is effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which is mediated by resistance (R) genes that recognize specific viral effectors. R genes encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins that activate a strong and rapid immune response, often leading to localized cell death (hypersensitive response, HR) to prevent the spread of the virus (Dangl & Jones, 2001). For example, the N gene in tobacco confers resistance to TMV by recognizing the viral movement protein (MP) and triggering HR (Lawton et al., 1995). However, tobamoviruses can evolve to avoid recognition by R genes, as seen in the case of ToBRFV, which has been shown to evade the N gene-mediated resistance in tomato (Liu et al., 2020). RNA silencing is another critical component of plant antiviral defense. It involves the cleavage of viral RNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which then target complementary viral RNA for degradation (Voinnet, 2005). Tobamoviruses have developed countermeasures to suppress RNA silencing, such as the expression of viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). For instance, the 126-kDa and 183-kDa replicase proteins of TMV act as VSRs by binding to siRNAs and preventing their incorporation into RISC (Lakatos et al., 2006). Salicylic acid (SA) is a key signaling molecule in plant defense against biotrophic pathogens, including viruses. SA accumulation leads to the activation of defense-related genes and the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds (Durrant & Dong, 2004). Tobamoviruses can manipulate SA signaling to their advantage. For example, the MP of TMV has been shown to interact with the SA receptor NPR1, thereby suppressing SA-dependent defense responses (Cao et al., 1997). The emergence of ToBRFV underscores the dynamic nature of the virus-plant interaction. ToBRFV has rapidly spread across multiple continents, affecting tomato crops and causing significant economic losses (Katis et al., 2020). Its ability to overcome existing resistance mechanisms highlights the need for continuous monitoring and the development of novel resistance strategies. One approach is the engineering of plants with broad-spectrum resistance genes, such as those encoding NLR proteins that recognize multiple viral effectors (Steuernagel et al., 2016). Another strategy involves enhancing RNA silencing pathways through the overexpression of key components, such as Dicer-like enzymes and Argonaute proteins (Zhang et al., 2011). In conclusion, the intricate relationship between tobamoviruses and plant immunity is characterized by a constant arms race. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying viral evasion and suppression of plant defenses is essential for developing effective control measures and genetic resistance to emerging tobamoviruses. Future research should focus on identifying novel resistance genes and improving RNA silencing pathways to provide durable protection against these economically important pathogens.", "References": [{"title": "The complete nucleotide sequence of tobacco mosaic virus RNA", "authors": "Adams, M.
