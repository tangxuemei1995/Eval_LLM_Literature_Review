{"Literature Review": "Understanding the factors that shape viral evolution is essential for developing effective antiviral strategies, predicting viral evolution, and preventing pandemics. One of the key determinants of viral evolution is the interplay between viral protein biophysics and the host's proteostasis networks. These networks, which include chaperones and quality control processes, play a crucial role in determining the fate of viral proteins, particularly those with biophysical defects resulting from adaptive mutations. Viral proteins often undergo adaptive mutations to evade host defenses, such as the immune system and antiviral drugs. However, these mutations frequently introduce biophysical defects, leading to misfolding or aggregation. The host's proteostasis network, which includes molecular chaperones and quality control mechanisms, can either assist in the proper folding of these defective proteins or target them for degradation. This interplay significantly influences the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, are essential components of the proteostasis network. They assist in the folding of nascent polypeptides and refold misfolded proteins, thereby enhancing the stability and function of viral proteins. For example, Hsp90 has been shown to stabilize the HIV-1 Gag protein, which is critical for viral assembly and replication. Similarly, Hsp70 has been implicated in the folding and stabilization of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA), a key surface glycoprotein. Quality control mechanisms, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated degradation (ERAD) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), are also integral to the proteostasis network. ERAD targets misfolded proteins in the ER for degradation, ensuring that only properly folded proteins are transported to their final destinations. The UPS, on the other hand, degrades misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus, maintaining cellular proteostasis. Both ERAD and the UPS have been shown to influence the fate of viral proteins, with some viruses exploiting these pathways to enhance their survival and replication. The impact of the proteostasis network on viral evolution is further highlighted by the concept of 'evolvability.' Evolvability refers to the capacity of a population to generate heritable phenotypic variation that can be acted upon by natural selection. The proteostasis network can buffer the effects of deleterious mutations, allowing viruses to explore a broader sequence space and potentially acquire beneficial adaptations. For instance, the chaperone GroEL has been shown to buffer the effects of mutations in the bacteriophage Î» repressor, enabling the phage to tolerate higher mutation rates without compromising fitness. Moreover, the proteostasis network can influence the emergence of drug resistance in viruses. Antiviral drugs often target viral enzymes, such as the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease. Mutations that confer drug resistance can also introduce biophysical defects, which may be mitigated by the host's chaperones and quality control mechanisms. For example, the chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to stabilize drug-resistant variants of HIV-1 RT, suggesting that targeting Hsp90 could be a novel strategy to combat drug resistance. The proteostasis network also plays a role in the immune evasion of viruses. The immune system recognizes and eliminates cells infected with viruses through the presentation of viral peptides on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. However, the proteostasis network can influence the processing and presentation of viral antigens, potentially affecting the immune response. For instance, the chaperone calreticulin has been shown to facilitate the loading of viral peptides onto MHC class I molecules, enhancing the recognition of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In conclusion, the host proteostasis network significantly shapes the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. By assisting in the folding of defective proteins or targeting them for degradation, the proteostasis network can buffer the effects of deleterious mutations, influence the emergence of drug resistance, and affect immune evasion. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms by which the proteostasis network interacts with viral proteins and how these interactions can be targeted to develop novel antiviral strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Predicting the evolution of influenza", "authors": "Jesse D.
