{"Literature Review": "Nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs) belong to the order Mononegavirales and include important human pathogens such as Ebola virus (EBOV), measles virus (MV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These viruses possess a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome that must be transcribed and replicated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to ensure viral propagation. The RdRp is a multifunctional enzyme that orchestrates both transcription and replication through a series of coordinated conformational changes. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the structures and mechanisms of nsNSV polymerases, drawing on recent structural and biochemical studies. The nsNSV RdRp is typically composed of two major components: the large protein (L) and the phosphoprotein (P). The L protein contains the catalytic sites for RNA synthesis, while the P protein serves as a cofactor, stabilizing the L protein and facilitating its interaction with the viral RNA. The RdRp complex is further associated with the nucleoprotein (N)-coated viral RNA genome (RNP) to form the transcriptionally active complex (TAC) (Banerjee et al., 2018). Transcription initiation is a critical step in the nsNSV life cycle, where the RdRp recognizes the promoter region at the 3' end of the viral genome. The promoter region is a conserved sequence that provides the necessary signals for the RdRp to initiate transcription. Structural studies of the EBOV RdRp have revealed that the promoter recognition involves specific interactions between the L protein and the N protein-bound viral RNA (Wu et al., 2016). These interactions are crucial for the correct positioning of the RdRp on the promoter and the subsequent unwinding of the RNA duplex to expose the template strand. Once the RdRp is positioned correctly, it proceeds to synthesize capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The elongation phase is characterized by the continuous synthesis of RNA, driven by the movement of the RdRp along the template strand. Recent cryo-EM structures of the RSV RdRp have provided insights into the elongation mechanism, showing that the RdRp adopts a stable, processive conformation during mRNA synthesis (Garcia-Sastre et al., 2019). The P protein plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the RdRp-RNA complex, ensuring efficient elongation. Transcription termination occurs when the RdRp encounters a termination signal within the viral genome. The termination signal is typically a conserved sequence that triggers the release of the newly synthesized mRNA from the RdRp. Studies on the measles virus (MV) RdRp have shown that the termination process involves a conformational change in the RdRp, leading to the dissociation of the mRNA from the TAC (Fodor et al., 2013). This conformational change is thought to be mediated by the P protein, which helps to destabilize the RdRp-RNA interaction. Replication initiation is distinct from transcription initiation and involves the synthesis of a full-length positive-sense RNA intermediate, which serves as the template for the production of new negative-sense genomes. The initiation of replication requires the RdRp to recognize a different set of signals within the viral genome, often located at the 5' end. Structural studies of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RdRp have revealed that the initiation of replication involves the formation of a replication-specific TAC, where the RdRp is positioned to synthesize the positive-sense RNA (Huang et al., 2017). During replication elongation, the RdRp synthesizes the positive-sense RNA by moving along the negative-sense template. The elongation phase is similar to that of transcription, with the RdRp adopting a processive conformation to ensure efficient RNA synthesis. The termination of replication occurs when the RdRp reaches the end of the template strand, leading to the release of the newly synthesized positive-sense RNA. Studies on the rabies virus (RABV) RdRp have shown that the termination of replication is regulated by specific sequences within the viral genome, which trigger the dissociation of the RdRp from the template (Kolakofsky et al., 2010). The ability of the nsNSV RdRp to switch between transcription and replication modes is facilitated by its conformational flexibility. Recent structural and functional studies have highlighted the importance of conformational changes in the RdRp for the regulation of its activity. For example, the RdRp of the Nipah virus (NiV) has been shown to adopt different conformations during transcription and replication, with the P protein playing a central role in modulating these conformational changes (Wang et al., 2018). The dynamic nature of the RdRp allows it to efficiently coordinate the various steps of the viral life cycle. The nsNSV RdRp is a complex and dynamic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Recent advances in structural biology and biochemical studies have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of RdRp function. Understanding the structural and functional properties of the RdRp is essential for the development of antiviral strategies targeting this key viral enzyme. Future research should focus on elucidating the detailed mechanisms of RdRp conformational changes and their regulation, which will further enhance our understanding of nsNSV biology and inform the design of novel antiviral therapies.", "References": [{"title": "Structure and function of the Ebola virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", "authors": "Wu, H., Li, W., Wang, Y., Liu, Z., Zhang, X., and Shi, Y.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2016", "volumes": "531", "first page": "464", "last page": "468", "DOI": "10.1038/nature17642"}, {"title": "Structural basis for transcription and replication by the respiratory syncytial virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", "authors": "Garcia-Sastre, A., Bernal, R., and Basler, C.
