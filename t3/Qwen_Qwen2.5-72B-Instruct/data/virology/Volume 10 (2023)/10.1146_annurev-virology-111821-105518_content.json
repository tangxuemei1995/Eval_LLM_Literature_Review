{"Literature Review": "Herpesviruses, a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses, have evolved intricate mechanisms to replicate and spread within host cells. One of the most remarkable aspects of their life cycle is the nuclear egress of viral capsids, which involves the transport of newly assembled capsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is essential for the production of infectious virions and has been the subject of extensive research over the past few decades. The nuclear egress complex (NEC), a key player in this process, has been extensively characterized, but many questions remain regarding its formation, function, and regulation. The NEC is a heterodimeric complex composed of two viral proteins, UL31 and UL34, which are conserved among herpesviruses. These proteins form a honeycomb-like structure on the inner nuclear membrane (INM), inducing membrane curvature and facilitating the budding of the capsid into the perinuclear space. The resulting primary enveloped virion (PEV) is then transported to the outer nuclear membrane (ONM), where the primary envelope fuses with the ONM, releasing the capsid into the cytoplasm. Mutational analyses have provided valuable insights into the functional domains of UL31 and UL34. For instance, specific mutations in UL31 have been shown to disrupt the interaction between UL31 and UL34, leading to impaired nuclear egress. Similarly, mutations in UL34 have been found to affect the ability of the NEC to induce membrane curvature and scission. These findings highlight the importance of the NEC in the nuclear egress process and suggest that the interaction between UL31 and UL34 is crucial for the formation and function of the NEC. Structural studies have further elucidated the molecular architecture of the NEC. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography have revealed that the NEC forms a lattice-like structure on the INM, with UL31 and UL34 interacting to create a scaffold that supports the budding of the capsid. The honeycomb-shaped coat of the NEC is thought to provide the necessary mechanical force to deform the INM and facilitate the budding process. Despite these advances, several questions remain unanswered. One of the most pressing issues is the timing and location of NEC formation. It is unclear whether the NEC is pre-assembled in the nucleus or if it forms de novo at the INM upon the arrival of the capsid. Additionally, the mechanisms that regulate the induction of membrane curvature and vesicle formation are not fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that the NEC may interact with cellular factors to modulate these processes, but the identity and function of these factors remain to be determined. Another area of ongoing investigation is the composition of the primary enveloped virion (PEV). While it is generally accepted that the PEV contains the viral capsid and the NEC, the presence of other viral and cellular components is still debated. Some studies have reported the presence of additional viral proteins, such as glycoproteins, in the PEV, while others have suggested that the PEV is relatively simple in composition. Understanding the composition of the PEV is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of nuclear membrane fusion and the subsequent release of the capsid into the cytoplasm. The fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is another critical step in the nuclear egress process. This fusion event is thought to be mediated by the interaction between the NEC and the ONM, but the specific machinery involved in this process is not well characterized. Some studies have proposed that the fusion is driven by the interaction between the NEC and cellular fusogenic proteins, such as SNAREs (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors). However, the exact nature of these interactions and the role of cellular factors in the fusion process remain to be clarified. Species and cell type-specific differences further complicate our understanding of the nuclear egress process. While the basic mechanism of NEC-mediated budding appears to be conserved among herpesviruses, variations in the composition and function of the NEC have been observed in different viral species and cell types. For example, the NEC of herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been shown to differ from that of pseudorabies virus (PRV) in terms of protein-protein interactions and the ability to induce membrane curvature. These differences highlight the need for a more comprehensive and comparative analysis of the nuclear egress process across different herpesviruses and host cells. In conclusion, the nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids is a complex and highly regulated process that involves the coordinated action of the NEC and various cellular factors. While significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, many questions remain. Future research should focus on elucidating the timing and location of NEC formation, the mechanisms of membrane curvature and vesicle formation, the composition of the PEV, and the machinery mediating nuclear membrane fusion. Addressing these questions will provide a more complete picture of the nuclear egress process and may lead to the development of new antiviral strategies targeting this critical step in the herpesvirus life cycle.", "References": [{"title": "Herpesvirus nuclear egress: Breaking out of the nucleus", "authors": "Baldwin, P.
