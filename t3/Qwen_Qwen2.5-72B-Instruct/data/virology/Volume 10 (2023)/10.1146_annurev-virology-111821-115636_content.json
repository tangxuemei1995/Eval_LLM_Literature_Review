{"Literature Review": "Host defense against viral pathogens is a critical aspect of innate immunity, involving sophisticated mechanisms that detect and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Among these mechanisms, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthaseâ€“stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway in animals and the cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS) in bacteria stand out as conserved and evolutionarily significant examples of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense. The cGAS-STING pathway is a key component of the mammalian innate immune system, responsible for detecting cytosolic DNA, a hallmark of viral infection. Upon binding to double-stranded DNA, cGAS catalyzes the production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger that activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). STING then translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it recruits and activates TBK1 and IRF3, leading to the transcription of type I interferons and other antiviral genes. Recent studies have revealed that the cGAS-STING pathway is not unique to mammals but is conserved across various eukaryotic species, including plants and fungi. This suggests that the use of nucleotide second messengers in antiviral defense is a fundamental strategy that has been preserved throughout evolution. However, the discovery of CBASS in bacteria has further expanded our understanding of the evolutionary origins of this signaling mechanism. CBASS is a prokaryotic defense system that uses cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) to combat bacteriophages. Similar to cGAS, the central enzyme in CBASS, known as a cyclic dinucleotide cyclase (CD-NTase), produces CDNs upon recognition of phage DNA. These CDNs then activate downstream effectors, leading to phage inhibition or cell death. The structural and functional similarities between cGAS and CD-NTases suggest a common evolutionary origin, highlighting the ancient roots of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense. The biochemical and structural details of cGAS and CD-NTases provide insights into the mechanisms of nucleotide second messenger production. Both enzymes contain a conserved active site that facilitates the synthesis of CDNs from ATP and GTP. Crystal structures of cGAS and CD-NTases reveal a dimeric arrangement, with each monomer contributing to the active site. This arrangement allows for the precise positioning of substrates and the efficient production of CDNs. In addition to cGAS and CD-NTases, other cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) have been identified in various organisms, including plants and protists. These receptors share structural and functional similarities with cGAS and are capable of producing CDNs in response to DNA recognition. The presence of cGLRs in diverse eukaryotic lineages underscores the widespread importance of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense. The downstream signaling events triggered by CDNs are also conserved across different systems. In the cGAS-STING pathway, cGAMP binds to STING, inducing a conformational change that promotes its interaction with TBK1 and IRF3. Similarly, in CBASS, CDNs bind to specific receptors that activate downstream effectors, leading to phage inhibition. The conservation of these signaling mechanisms suggests that the use of nucleotide second messengers provides a robust and efficient means of transmitting signals from pathogen recognition to immune activation. Despite the conserved nature of nucleotide second messenger signaling, there are notable differences between the cGAS-STING pathway and CBASS. For instance, while cGAS-STING primarily functions in antiviral defense, CBASS can also mediate cell death in response to phage infection, a strategy that may help prevent the spread of phages to neighboring cells. These differences reflect the diverse evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development of antiviral defense mechanisms in different organisms. The evolutionary pressures that have driven the development of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense are multifaceted. One key factor is the need for rapid and specific responses to pathogen invasion. Nucleotide second messengers provide a fast and reliable means of signal transmission, allowing cells to quickly activate immune defenses upon pathogen recognition. Additionally, the use of CDNs as second messengers may offer a level of specificity that helps to minimize false alarms and reduce the risk of autoimmunity. Another important consideration is the metabolic cost of producing and maintaining nucleotide second messenger signaling pathways. The synthesis of CDNs requires energy and resources, and the evolutionary advantage of these pathways must outweigh the associated costs. Studies have shown that the production of CDNs is tightly regulated, with mechanisms in place to ensure that signaling is activated only in response to genuine threats. In conclusion, the cGAS-STING pathway and CBASS represent pioneering examples of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity. The use of nucleotide second messengers in these pathways provides a robust and efficient means of linking pathogen detection with immune activation. By comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we gain valuable insights into the origins and evolution of antiviral defense mechanisms. Future research will likely uncover additional examples of nucleotide second messenger signaling in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, further enriching our understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of host-pathogen interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway", "authors": "Ablasser, A., Bauernfeind, F., Hartmann, G., Latz, E., Fitzgerald, K.
