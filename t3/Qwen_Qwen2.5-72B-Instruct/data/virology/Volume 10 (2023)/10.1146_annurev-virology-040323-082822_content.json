{"Literature Review": "The human gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and viral persistence, particularly in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH). Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral replication, PLWH often experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which contribute to the persistence of latent HIV reservoirs and the development of clinical comorbidities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these phenomena is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life for PLWH. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiome in modulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis. Dysbiosis, or alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, has been associated with various immune disorders and chronic inflammatory conditions. In the context of HIV, gut dysbiosis is characterized by a reduction in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pathogenic species, leading to increased intestinal permeability and translocation of microbial products into systemic circulation. This translocation triggers a chronic state of immune activation, which is a key driver of HIV persistence and disease progression. Two major classes of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), have emerged as critical mediators of immune function and homeostasis. SCFAs, primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced through the fermentation of dietary fibers by anaerobic bacteria in the colon. These metabolites exert a wide range of effects on both innate and adaptive immune cells, including the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, enhancement of regulatory T cell (Treg) function, and promotion of mucosal barrier integrity. In the context of HIV, SCFAs have been shown to influence the establishment and maintenance of latent HIV reservoirs. For instance, butyrate, a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has been demonstrated to reactivate latent HIV in vitro, suggesting its potential as a latency-reversing agent. However, the role of SCFAs in vivo is more complex, as they also possess anti-inflammatory properties that could counteract the pro-inflammatory environment associated with HIV infection. Therefore, the balance of SCFA levels and their downstream effects on immune cells is likely to be a critical factor in determining the overall impact on HIV persistence. Bile acids, another class of microbiome-derived metabolites, are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and undergo modifications by gut bacteria before being reabsorbed and recycled. BAs activate specific receptors, such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5), which regulate various physiological processes, including glucose metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and immune function. In the context of HIV, BAs have been shown to modulate immune responses and influence the gut-liver axis, which is particularly relevant given the high prevalence of liver-related complications in PLWH. Recent studies have begun to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which BAs affect immune function in the context of HIV. For example, activation of TGR5 by BAs has been shown to enhance the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and promote the differentiation of Tregs. This anti-inflammatory effect could potentially mitigate the chronic immune activation observed in PLWH, thereby reducing the risk of HIV persistence and comorbidities. Conversely, dysregulated BA signaling has been linked to increased inflammation and liver injury, highlighting the need for a balanced BA profile to maintain immune homeostasis. The interplay between the gut microbiome, SCFAs, and BAs in regulating immune homeostasis and HIV persistence is further complicated by the bidirectional nature of these interactions. On one hand, changes in the gut microbiome can alter the production and metabolism of SCFAs and BAs, which in turn affect immune function. On the other hand, immune activation and inflammation can also perturb the gut microbiome, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates immune dysfunction and HIV persistence. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for developing targeted interventions that can restore immune homeostasis and reduce HIV persistence. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiome and its metabolites in PLWH. Probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have shown promise in restoring a healthy gut microbiome and reducing inflammation. Additionally, pharmacological agents that target specific metabolic pathways, such as HDAC inhibitors and FXR agonists, may offer new avenues for treating HIV-associated immune dysfunction and viral persistence. In conclusion, the gut microbiome, SCFAs, and BAs play pivotal roles in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence. Elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions is essential for advancing HIV cure efforts and improving the quality of life for PLWH. Future research should focus on developing targeted interventions that can restore a balanced gut microbiome and metabolic profile, thereby mitigating chronic inflammation and promoting immune recovery.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial translocation is a cause of systemic immune activation in chronic HIV infection", "authors": "J.
