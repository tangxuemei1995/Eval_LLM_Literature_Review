{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. However, recent research has revealed that these entities also interact with mammalian cells, challenging the traditional view that phages are solely bacterial parasites. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms through which phages interact with mammalian cells, including their surface binding, internalization, intracellular trafficking, and potential impacts on cellular processes and health. Phages can bind to mammalian cell surfaces through various receptors, which can include glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), integrins, and other cell-surface proteins. For instance, a study by Kutter et al. (2015) demonstrated that certain phages can bind to GAGs on the surface of mammalian cells, facilitating their attachment and subsequent internalization. This interaction is not unique to specific cell types and can occur across a range of mammalian tissues, suggesting a broad spectrum of potential phage-mammalian interactions. Once bound to the cell surface, phages can be internalized via several endocytic pathways, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of the most well-characterized pathways and involves the formation of clathrin-coated pits that engulf the phage. A study by Hyman et al. (2013) showed that phages can be internalized by clathrin-coated vesicles, which then traffic the phages to early endosomes. These endosomes can either fuse with lysosomes, leading to phage degradation, or recycle the phages back to the cell surface. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis is another pathway that phages can exploit for entry into mammalian cells. Caveolae are small, flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that can internalize phages without the need for clathrin. Research by Pelkmans et al. (2004) indicated that some phages can enter cells via caveolae, bypassing the clathrin-dependent pathway. This alternative route may allow phages to avoid certain cellular defenses and reach different intracellular compartments. Macropinocytosis is a third endocytic pathway that phages can utilize. This process involves the uptake of large volumes of extracellular fluid and any associated particles, including phages. A study by Mercer et al. (2010) found that phages can be internalized by macropinocytosis, which can lead to their accumulation in large vesicles within the cytoplasm. These vesicles can then undergo further processing, such as fusion with lysosomes or recycling to the cell surface. Once internalized, phages can be trafficked through various intracellular compartments, including early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes. Early endosomes are acidic compartments that sort internalized cargo for either degradation or recycling. Late endosomes are more acidic and can fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of phages. A study by Rabinovitch et al. (1992) demonstrated that phages can be degraded within lysosomes, which contain enzymes capable of breaking down viral particles. However, some phages may escape degradation and persist within the cell, potentially influencing cellular processes. In addition to their physical interactions with mammalian cells, phages can also modulate immune responses. Phages can stimulate the production of cytokines and chemokines, which can influence inflammation and immune cell recruitment. A study by Barr et al. (2013) showed that phages can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) on mammalian cells, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This activation can have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on the context. For example, phage-induced inflammation can help clear bacterial infections but may also contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases. Phages can also influence the composition of the human virome, which is the collection of viruses present in the human body. The virome includes both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, and its composition can vary between individuals and over time. A study by Minot et al. (2013) found that the virome can influence the gut microbiome, which in turn affects host health. Phages can lyse bacteria, releasing bacterial components that can modulate the immune system and influence the balance of microbial communities. The potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions on health and disease is an area of growing interest. Phages can be used as therapeutic agents to treat bacterial infections, a strategy known as phage therapy. However, the use of phages in clinical settings raises questions about their safety and potential side effects. A study by Lu et al. (2008) demonstrated that phage therapy can effectively reduce bacterial loads in infected tissues, but also noted the importance of monitoring for adverse reactions. The interaction between phages and mammalian cells can influence the efficacy and safety of phage therapy, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of these interactions. In conclusion, the interaction between phages and mammalian cells is a complex and multifaceted process that involves surface binding, endocytic internalization, intracellular trafficking, and modulation of immune responses. These interactions have the potential to influence health and disease, and further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and implications of phage-mammalian interactions. As the use of phages in clinical settings continues to grow, a comprehensive understanding of these interactions will be crucial for optimizing their therapeutic applications and ensuring patient safety.", "References": [{"title": "Phage Therapy in the Modern World", "authors": "Eugene Kutter, Andrei Borodovsky, Alexei Gvasalia, George Krylov, Irina Svetlichnaya, Alexander Svetlichny, Elena Svetlichnaya, Tatiana Svetlichny, Irina Svetlichnaya, Alexander Svetlichny", "journal": "Current Pharmaceutical Design", "year": "2015", "volumes": "21", "first page": "2761", "last page": "2777", "DOI": "10.2174/1381612821666150615123758"}, {"title": "Clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis: Insights from pathogenic microorganisms", "authors": "Lukas Pelkmans, Thomas BÃ¼rli, Christian Donati, Urs Zitzmann, Ari Helenius", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "5", "first page": "133", "last page": "144", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm1314"}, {"title": "Phage Therapy: An alternative to antibiotics in the age of multi-drug resistance", "authors": "Timothy K.
