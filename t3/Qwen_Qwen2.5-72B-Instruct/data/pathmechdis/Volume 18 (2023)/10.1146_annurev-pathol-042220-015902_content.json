{"Literature Review": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or early in the morning. Despite significant advancements in the development of biologic therapies targeting specific inflammatory pathways, a substantial number of patients continue to experience persistent symptoms and exacerbations. This persistence suggests that there are underlying mechanisms contributing to the disease that are not fully addressed by current treatments. One such mechanism is the formation of mucus plugs, which have been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathophysiology of asthma. Mucus plugs are dense accumulations of mucus that can obstruct the airways, leading to airflow limitation and increased work of breathing. The formation of these plugs is driven by alterations in mucus biology, primarily through the overproduction and hypersecretion of mucins, the glycoproteins that give mucus its viscoelastic properties. In asthma, the airway epithelium is hyperresponsive to various stimuli, including allergens, irritants, and viral infections, which trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These mediators, particularly those associated with type 2 inflammation, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, promote the differentiation of goblet cells and the secretion of mucins. The hypersecretion of mucins leads to the production of abnormally thick and sticky mucus, which is difficult to clear from the airways. This mucus can form plugs that physically obstruct the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath. Moreover, the presence of mucus plugs can create a microenvironment that is conducive to the growth of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which can further exacerbate the inflammatory response. For example, the colonization of mucus plugs by Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been linked to more severe asthma and frequent exacerbations. In addition to their physical role in airway obstruction, mucus plugs can also act as immunogenic stimuli, perpetuating the inflammatory response even in the absence of allergens or other external triggers. Mucus contains a variety of immune-modulating molecules, including galectin-10, a protein that has been shown to enhance the activation of neutrophils and other immune cells. Neutrophils, in turn, release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases, which can damage the airway epithelium and contribute to the chronic inflammation characteristic of asthma. The role of neutrophils in asthma has been underappreciated in the past, as much of the focus has been on eosinophilic inflammation. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of neutrophilic inflammation in severe and refractory asthma. Neutrophils can be recruited to the airways in response to mucus plugs, where they release a range of pro-inflammatory mediators, including neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase, which can further exacerbate airway inflammation and tissue damage. Furthermore, the interaction between mucus plugs and the airway epithelium can lead to the activation of epithelial cells, which can produce additional pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This creates a positive feedback loop that sustains the inflammatory response and contributes to the chronic nature of asthma. For instance, the activation of airway epithelial cells by mucus plugs can lead to the production of IL-33, a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the activation of innate lymphoid cells and the amplification of type 2 inflammation. The formation of mucus plugs is also influenced by the altered expression of chloride channels and water transporters in the airway epithelium. In asthma, the expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and other chloride channels is often reduced, leading to decreased hydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL) and the formation of viscous mucus. This alteration in ASL hydration can further exacerbate the formation of mucus plugs and contribute to airway obstruction. Given the critical role of mucus plugs in the pathophysiology of asthma, there is a growing interest in developing therapeutic strategies to target mucus biology. Current approaches include the use of mucolytics, which can break down the disulfide bonds in mucins and reduce the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to clear from the airways. Additionally, there is ongoing research into the use of agents that can modulate the expression of chloride channels and improve ASL hydration, potentially reducing the formation of mucus plugs. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the treatment of asthma, the persistence of symptoms and exacerbations in many patients suggests that there are underlying mechanisms that are not fully addressed by current therapies. The formation of mucus plugs, driven by alterations in mucus biology and type 2 inflammation, represents a critical but often overlooked aspect of the disease. By targeting the formation and clearance of mucus plugs, it may be possible to improve outcomes for patients with asthma and reduce the burden of this chronic condition.", "References": [{"title": "Mucus hypersecretion in asthma: causes and effects", "authors": "Boulay, F., Chanez, P., Bousquet, J., Godard, P.", "journal": "European Respiratory Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "51", "first page": "1800923", "DOI": "10.1183/13993003.00923-2018"}, {"title": "Role of type 2 immunity in asthma", "authors": "Matsuse, D.
