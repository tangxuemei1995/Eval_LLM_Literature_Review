{"Literature Review": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% (Siegel et al., 2020). A significant contributing factor to this poor prognosis is the complex and highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME) that characterizes PDAC. The TME is a dynamic and heterogeneous milieu composed of various cell types, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes, as well as the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Bhowmick et al., 2004). This intricate network of cellular and non-cellular components plays a crucial role in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics have provided unprecedented insights into the cellular composition and spatial organization of the PDAC TME. For instance, scRNA-seq has revealed distinct subpopulations of CAFs with unique gene expression profiles and functional properties (Liacos et al., 2020). These subpopulations, such as myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), exhibit differential contributions to tumor growth and metastasis. MyCAFs are characterized by their ability to produce collagen and other ECM components, leading to increased desmoplasia and mechanical stiffness, which can impede drug delivery and immune cell infiltration (Erez et al., 2010). In contrast, iCAFs are involved in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, particularly macrophages and neutrophils, which can promote an immunosuppressive environment (Quail et al., 2016). The immune landscape of the PDAC TME is another critical aspect of its complexity. Immune cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders effective anti-tumor immunity (Feig et al., 2013). TAMs, for example, secrete cytokines and chemokines that promote angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis (DeNardo et al., 2011). Additionally, Tregs and MDSCs suppress the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby reducing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (Koebel et al., 2007). The ECM, a key component of the TME, is also a major contributor to PDAC pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. The dense and stiff ECM in PDAC tumors creates a physical barrier that impedes the penetration of therapeutic agents and immune cells (Provenzano et al., 2012). Moreover, the ECM can modulate the behavior of cancer cells and stromal cells through integrin-mediated signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and survival (Erler et al., 2009). For example, the overexpression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme that cross-links collagen fibers, has been shown to enhance the invasive and metastatic potential of PDAC cells (Erler et al., 2009). The interplay between cancer cells and the TME is bidirectional, with cancer cells actively shaping their microenvironment to support their growth and survival. Cancer cells can secrete factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that activate CAFs and promote ECM deposition (Bhowmick et al., 2004). Conversely, the TME can influence the genetic and epigenetic landscape of cancer cells, leading to the acquisition of aggressive phenotypes and resistance to therapy (Hingorani et al., 2016). For instance, the hypoxic conditions within the TME can induce the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which drive the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, metabolism, and stemness (Semenza, 2012). Despite the challenges posed by the TME, recent studies have identified potential therapeutic strategies to target this complex microenvironment. One approach involves targeting CAFs to reduce desmoplasia and improve drug delivery. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway, which is often dysregulated in CAFs, can reduce stromal content and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy (Olive et al., 2009). Another strategy is to modulate the immune landscape by combining ICIs with agents that target immunosuppressive cells or pathways. For example, the combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies with inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that degrades tryptophan and suppresses T cell function, has shown promise in preclinical models of PDAC (Sharma et al., 2017). In conclusion, the TME in PDAC is a multifaceted and dynamic entity that significantly influences disease biology and therapeutic outcomes. Advances in single-cell and spatial technologies have provided valuable insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin the complexity of the TME. Targeting the TME, either directly or indirectly, represents a promising avenue for improving the treatment of PDAC and overcoming therapeutic resistance. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional and spatial dependencies within the TME and to develop more effective therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Cancer statistics, 2020", "authors": "Rebecca L.
