{"Literature Review": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment by facilitating intercellular communication and modulating various aspects of cancer progression. These vesicles, which include exosomes and microvesicles, are released by tumor cells and carry a diverse array of bioactive molecules, such as proteins, noncoding RNAs, and DNA fragments (Théry et al., 2018). The multifunctional nature of these EVs has been extensively studied, revealing their significant impact on tumor biology and potential utility in clinical applications. One of the key functions of tumor-derived EVs is their ability to condition the premetastatic niche. By transferring specific cargo to distant sites, EVs can prepare the microenvironment for the arrival of circulating tumor cells, thereby facilitating metastasis. For instance, exosomes derived from breast cancer cells have been shown to induce the formation of premetastatic niches in the lung by promoting the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Peinado et al., 2012). This process is further supported by the transfer of miRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-29a, which can reprogram recipient cells to support tumor growth and invasion (Hood et al., 2011). In addition to conditioning the premetastatic niche, tumor-derived EVs also contribute to the evasion of the immune response. These vesicles can carry immunosuppressive molecules that inhibit the activation and function of immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. For example, exosomes from melanoma cells have been found to express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with PD-1 on T cells, leading to T cell exhaustion and reduced antitumor immunity (Zhang et al., 2016). Similarly, EVs can transfer regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumor microenvironment, further suppressing immune responses (Qu et al., 2014). The role of tumor-derived EVs in promoting cell migration and invasion is another critical aspect of their multifunctional nature. EVs can transfer oncogenic proteins and miRNAs that enhance the migratory and invasive capabilities of recipient cells. For instance, exosomes from glioblastoma cells have been shown to transfer the oncoprotein MET to neighboring cells, leading to increased cell motility and invasiveness (Al-Nedawi et al., 2008). Additionally, miR-105, which is enriched in exosomes from ovarian cancer cells, can target and downregulate the tight junction protein ZO-1, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing tumor cell invasion (Zhou et al., 2014). The impact of tumor-derived EVs on carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-infiltrating cells is also well-documented. CAFs, which are a major component of the tumor stroma, can be activated by EVs to produce growth factors and extracellular matrix components that support tumor growth and angiogenesis. For example, exosomes from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells have been shown to activate CAFs through the transfer of miR-21, leading to increased production of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Costa-Silva et al., 2015). Similarly, EVs can modulate the behavior of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to create a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment (Feng et al., 2015). The variability in the number and content of EVs produced by tumors has led to growing interest in their potential as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Liquid biopsies, which involve the analysis of EVs in bodily fluids such as blood and urine, offer a non-invasive means of monitoring tumor dynamics and response to therapy. For instance, the levels of specific miRNAs in EVs have been correlated with disease stage and prognosis in various cancers, including lung cancer and prostate cancer (Taylor et al., 2013; Han et al., 2015). Furthermore, the presence of certain proteins, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2, in EVs can serve as markers for targeted therapy response (Albanese et al., 2015). Despite the promising potential of EVs as biomarkers, several challenges remain in their clinical implementation. These include the need for standardized methods for EV isolation and characterization, as well as the development of robust assays for detecting and quantifying specific EV cargoes. Additionally, the heterogeneity of EV populations and the complexity of their cargo make it essential to understand the specific roles of different EV subtypes in tumor biology (Kalluri, 2016). In conclusion, tumor-derived EVs are multifunctional entities that play a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment by mediating intercellular communication and modulating various aspects of cancer progression. Their impact on the premetastatic niche, immune evasion, cell migration, and invasion, as well as their potential as biomarkers, underscores the importance of further research in this field. Addressing the challenges in EV research and developing standardized protocols will be essential for translating these findings into clinical applications.", "References": [{"title": "Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells", "authors": "Clotilde Théry, Laurence Zitvogel, Gregory J.
