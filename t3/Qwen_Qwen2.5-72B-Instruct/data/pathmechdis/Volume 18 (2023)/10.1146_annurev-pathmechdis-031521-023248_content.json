{"Literature Review": "Neuroepithelial interactions have emerged as a critical aspect of cancer biology, highlighting the intricate relationship between nerves and cancer cells. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how neural regulation influences cancer development and progression, focusing on axonogenesis, neurogenesis, perineural invasion, and neuronal transdifferentiation. Nerves play a pivotal role in regulating the homeostasis and energetic metabolism of normal epithelial cells. In cancer, these regulatory mechanisms are hijacked, leading to the development and progression of malignancies. One of the key observations is that cancer cells rarely develop in denervated organs, suggesting a strong dependency on neural signals for tumorigenesis. Denervation has been shown to affect tumorigenesis both in vivo and in clinical settings, further emphasizing the importance of neural regulation in cancer. Axonogenesis, the process by which new axons form, is a critical early step in the neural regulation of cancer. As cancer progresses, new axons grow to supply the expanding malignant tissue with neural connections. This process is essential for the establishment of a supportive microenvironment that promotes tumor growth and survival. Studies have demonstrated that axonogenesis is regulated by various growth factors and signaling pathways, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Following axonogenesis, neurogenesis occurs, involving the formation of new neurons. This process typically begins in ganglia around organs or the spinal column and is followed by the recruitment of neuroblasts from the central nervous system. Neurogenesis is crucial for the regulation of homeostasis and energetic metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. Research has shown that neurogenesis can be induced by cancer cells through the secretion of neurotrophic factors, which promote the differentiation and survival of neural progenitor cells. Perineural invasion, a common feature in many cancers, represents a more advanced stage of neuroepithelial interactions. During this stage, cancer cells invade and follow the path of nerves, leading to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. This interaction is facilitated by the release of chemokines and cytokines from cancer cells, which attract and activate neural cells. Perineural invasion is particularly prevalent in head and neck cancers, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of metastasis. In the final stage of neuroepithelial interactions, carcinoma cells undergo transdifferentiation into a neuronal profile. This process, known as neuronal transdifferentiation, allows cancer cells to achieve a degree of neural independence, reducing their reliance on external neural signals. Transdifferentiation involves the activation of neural gene programs and the acquisition of neuronal-like properties, such as the expression of neurofilaments and synaptic proteins. This stage is often observed in advanced cancers and is associated with resistance to conventional therapies. Understanding the biology of neural regulation in cancer has significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Targeting the neural components of the tumor microenvironment may offer new avenues for cancer treatment. For example, blocking the action of neurotrophic factors or disrupting the formation of new axons and neurons could potentially inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, targeting the mechanisms underlying perineural invasion and neuronal transdifferentiation may help to prevent the spread of cancer and improve patient outcomes. In conclusion, neuroepithelial interactions are a fundamental aspect of cancer biology, influencing multiple stages of tumor development and progression. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Addressing the biology of neural regulation in cancer is crucial for developing more effective and targeted treatments.", "References": [{"title": "Neural regulation of cancer: A new paradigm", "authors": "Peter Friedl, Janina Klinkert, Christiane A.
