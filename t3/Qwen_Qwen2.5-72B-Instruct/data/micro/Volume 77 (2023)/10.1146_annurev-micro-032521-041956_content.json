{"Literature Review": "Fermented foods have been a cornerstone of human diets for millennia, providing unique flavors, extended shelf-life, and enhanced nutritional value. The microbial communities that drive these processes, collectively known as the microbiome, have been the subject of extensive research in recent years. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the assembly of microbiomes in three key fermented foods: surface-ripened cheese, sourdough starters, and fermented vegetables. By integrating ecological and evolutionary frameworks, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms that govern microbial community assembly in these systems. Microbial communities in fermented foods are shaped by a combination of ecological processes, including dispersal, selection, diversification, and drift. Dispersal refers to the movement of microorganisms from one environment to another, often facilitated by human activities such as the transfer of starter cultures or the use of raw materials. In the context of cheese, for example, the initial microbial inoculum can come from the milk, the environment, or added cultures. Similarly, in sourdough starters, the initial microbial community is influenced by the flour used and the local environment. Selection plays a crucial role in shaping the microbial community during fermentation. Environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, and nutrient availability, create selective pressures that favor certain microbial taxa over others. In cheese, the low pH and high salt content select for lactic acid bacteria and halotolerant fungi, which contribute to the characteristic flavors and textures. In sourdough, the acidic environment created by lactic acid bacteria selects for yeast species that can tolerate low pH, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Diversification, or the generation of new microbial strains within a community, can occur through mutation, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. In fermented vegetables, the dynamic changes in the microbial community over time can lead to the emergence of new strains with specific metabolic capabilities. This process is particularly important in maintaining the stability and functionality of the microbial community throughout the fermentation process. Drift, or random changes in the frequency of microbial taxa, can also influence community composition. In small, isolated fermentations, such as those in artisanal cheese production, drift can lead to the dominance of particular strains due to chance events. This stochasticity can result in variations in the final product, contributing to the unique characteristics of different batches. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled detailed surveys of microbial diversity in fermented foods. These studies have revealed complex and dynamic microbial communities that vary across different stages of fermentation and production practices. For instance, a study by Bokulich et al. used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the microbial communities in artisanal cheeses, identifying key taxa involved in flavor development and ripening. Similarly, De Angelis et al. conducted a comprehensive analysis of sourdough starters, highlighting the importance of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in the fermentation process. In vitro models have complemented in situ sequencing surveys by allowing researchers to manipulate environmental conditions and observe the effects on microbial community dynamics. For example, Gobbetti et al. used controlled laboratory experiments to study the interactions between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in sourdough, demonstrating the synergistic effects of these microorganisms on dough properties. Such models provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying community assembly and can inform the development of strategies for managing microbial communities in industrial settings. The application of ecological and evolutionary theory to fermented food microbiomes offers new opportunities for optimizing production practices. By understanding the factors that influence microbial community assembly, food producers can better control the quality and consistency of their products. For instance, the deliberate introduction of specific microbial strains can enhance the desired sensory and functional properties of fermented foods. Additionally, monitoring and managing the environmental conditions during fermentation can help maintain the stability and performance of the microbial community. In conclusion, the assembly of microbiomes in fermented foods is a complex process governed by a combination of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. Advances in sequencing technologies and in vitro models have provided valuable insights into these processes, paving the way for more informed and effective management of microbial communities in food production. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between different ecological processes and their impact on the functionality and stability of fermented food microbiomes.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial biogeography of wine grapes is conditioned by cultivar, vintage, and climate", "authors": "N.
