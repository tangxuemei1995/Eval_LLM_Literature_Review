{"Literature Review": "The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a critical component of two remarkable bacterial nanomachines: the rotary flagellum and the injectisome. These nanomachines play pivotal roles in bacterial motility and pathogenesis, respectively. The T3SS is a complex protein assembly that spans the bacterial cell envelope, facilitating the secretion of proteins necessary for the assembly of the flagellum and the direct translocation of effector proteins into host cells by the injectisome. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the structural insights into these systems, highlighting the molecular similarities and differences that underpin their distinct functions. The bacterial flagellum is a sophisticated rotary motor that enables bacterial motility. It consists of a basal body, a hook, and a filament. The basal body, which includes the T3SS, is responsible for the export of flagellar components and the generation of rotational force. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been instrumental in elucidating the high-resolution structures of the flagellar T3SS, revealing the intricate arrangement of its components. In contrast, the injectisome, also known as the type III secretion needle complex, is a specialized T3SS found in many pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia. The injectisome is responsible for the direct translocation of effector proteins into host cells, enabling the manipulation of host cell processes for the benefit of the bacterium. The injectisome shares a common evolutionary origin with the flagellum, but it has evolved to perform a more specialized function. Cryo-EM studies have revealed the structural details of the injectisome, including the needle, the inner and outer membrane rings, and the export apparatus. One of the key structural differences between the flagellar T3SS and the injectisome lies in the composition and function of their export apparatuses. The flagellar T3SS includes a set of proteins that are essential for the assembly of the flagellum, such as FliI, FliH, and FliJ, which form the ATPase complex. In contrast, the injectisome's export apparatus is composed of proteins like SpaS, SpaP, and SpaR, which are involved in the recognition and secretion of effector proteins. Despite these differences, both systems share a common core structure, suggesting a conserved mechanism for protein export. The evolution of the injectisome from the flagellum is a well-documented process. Comparative genomics and structural studies have shown that the injectisome has retained many of the ancestral components of the flagellum while acquiring additional proteins to enhance its pathogenic capabilities. For example, the injectisome's needle, which is absent in the flagellum, is a crucial component for the delivery of effectors into host cells. The needle is composed of a single protein, PrgI in Salmonella, and its structure has been determined using cryo-EM, providing insights into its role in effector translocation. Recent advances in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have further refined our understanding of the T3SS. Cryo-ET allows for the visualization of the T3SS in its native cellular context, revealing the dynamic interactions between the T3SS and other cellular structures. For instance, cryo-ET studies of the Salmonella injectisome have shown how the needle complex interacts with the host cell membrane during infection. These studies have also highlighted the importance of the T3SS in the formation of the bacterial surface structures that facilitate adhesion and invasion. The functional similarities and differences between the flagellar T3SS and the injectisome are also evident in their regulatory mechanisms. Both systems are tightly regulated to ensure the correct timing and coordination of protein export. The flagellar T3SS is regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways that control the expression of flagellar genes and the assembly of the flagellum. Similarly, the injectisome is regulated by a variety of environmental cues, such as host cell contact and nutrient availability, which trigger the expression of effector proteins and the activation of the secretion machinery. In conclusion, the T3SS is a versatile and highly conserved protein secretion system that plays a crucial role in the function of both the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome. Advances in cryo-EM and cryo-ET have provided unprecedented insights into the structural and functional aspects of these nanomachines, highlighting the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions. Understanding the T3SS is essential for developing new strategies to combat bacterial pathogens and for advancing our knowledge of bacterial biology.", "References": [{"title": "The bacterial flagellar motor: structure and function of a complex molecular machine", "authors": "Charles Brennen, Howard C.
