{"Literature Review": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a critical physiological process that allows microorganisms to reduce or oxidize molecules and minerals located outside their cellular boundaries. This unique capability was first observed in the bacteria Shewanella and Geobacter, which can couple their growth to the reduction of iron or manganese oxides located extracellularly. Unlike most respiratory activities, EET requires the transfer of electrons beyond the cell membrane, a challenge that has been the focus of extensive research over the past decade. The mechanisms underlying EET have been extensively studied in Shewanella and Geobacter, two genera that serve as model organisms for understanding this process. In these bacteria, the transfer of electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface is facilitated by a series of well-conserved strategies. One of the most prominent mechanisms involves the use of multiheme cytochromes, which are proteins containing multiple heme groups that can efficiently conduct electrons. These cytochromes are often embedded in the outer membrane or are secreted into the periplasmic space, where they can interact with extracellular electron acceptors. In Shewanella, the Mtr pathway is a well-characterized example of this mechanism. The Mtr pathway consists of several components, including the inner membrane protein MtrA, the periplasmic protein MtrB, and the outer membrane protein MtrC. Together, these proteins form a conductive bridge that allows electrons to be transferred from the quinone pool in the inner membrane to extracellular acceptors. Similarly, in Geobacter, the OmcS and OmcZ proteins play crucial roles in electron transfer across the outer membrane. While the Mtr and Omc pathways provide a clear understanding of how electrons are transferred across the outer membrane, recent data suggest that there are additional mechanisms that enable electron transfer to more distant acceptors. For instance, some bacteria produce soluble electron shuttles, such as flavins, which can diffuse through the extracellular environment and facilitate electron transfer over longer distances. These shuttles can significantly enhance the efficiency of EET by reducing the resistance to electron flow and allowing bacteria to access a broader range of electron acceptors. Another intriguing mechanism involves the formation of conductive pili or nanowires, which are protein filaments that extend from the cell surface and can conduct electrons over micrometer-scale distances. In Geobacter, these pili, known as OmcP, have been shown to play a critical role in long-distance electron transfer, enabling the bacteria to reduce extracellular acceptors that are far removed from the cell surface. The ability to transfer electrons beyond the outer membrane also has significant implications for microbial interactions and community dynamics. For example, some bacteria can use EET to communicate with other microorganisms, forming syntrophic relationships where one organism donates electrons to another. This type of interaction can lead to the formation of complex biofilms and consortia, where different species work together to degrade recalcitrant organic matter or reduce difficult-to-reduce minerals. Despite the progress made in understanding EET, many questions remain unanswered. For instance, the specific mechanisms that allow electrons to be transferred to highly variable minerals and electrodes are still not fully understood. Additionally, the role of EET in natural environments, such as sediments and soils, is an area of active research. Recent studies have shown that EET can play a significant role in biogeochemical cycles, influencing the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. In conclusion, the study of EET in Shewanella and Geobacter has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms that enable electrons to be transferred beyond the outer membrane. While the Mtr and Omc pathways are well-characterized, the discovery of additional mechanisms, such as soluble electron shuttles and conductive pili, highlights the complexity and diversity of EET. Future research will likely uncover new strategies and expand our understanding of the ecological and biotechnological applications of this fascinating process.", "References": [{"title": "Iron reduction by dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria", "authors": "D.
