{"Literature Review": "The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses, with bacteriophages (phages) being the most abundant viral component. Understanding the gut phageome, the collective set of phages in the gut, is crucial for elucidating its role in human health and disease. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics have enabled a more detailed characterization of the gut phageome, revealing its taxonomic structure and ecological functions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the factors affecting the variation of the human gut phageome, including age, diet, and geography, and discusses the implications of phageome alterations in various diseases. Age is a significant factor influencing the composition of the gut phageome. Infants and young children have a less stable and diverse gut microbiome compared to adults, which is reflected in their phageome. Early life colonization by phages is influenced by the mode of delivery (vaginal vs. cesarean), breastfeeding, and the infant's environment. As individuals age, the gut phageome becomes more stable and diverse, mirroring the maturation of the bacterial microbiome. However, older adults may experience a decline in phage diversity, which could be associated with age-related changes in the gut environment and immune function. Diet plays a critical role in shaping the gut phageome. Nutritional components can directly affect phage abundance and diversity by altering the availability of bacterial hosts. For example, a high-fiber diet promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria, which in turn supports a diverse phage population. Conversely, a Western diet, characterized by high fat and sugar content, can lead to a reduction in phage diversity and an increase in potentially pathogenic phages. These dietary effects on the phageome highlight the importance of a balanced diet in maintaining a healthy gut ecosystem. Geographical location is another factor that influences the gut phageome. Studies have shown that individuals from different regions of the world exhibit distinct phageome profiles, which can be attributed to variations in diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. For instance, rural populations often have a more diverse phageome compared to urban populations, likely due to differences in exposure to environmental microbes and dietary habits. These geographical differences underscore the need for region-specific approaches in studying the gut phageome. Alterations in the gut phageome have been observed in several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and colorectal cancer (CRC). In IBD, patients exhibit a dysbiotic phageome characterized by an increased abundance of specific phages and a decrease in overall phage diversity. This dysbiosis may contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in IBD by modulating the bacterial community and immune responses. Similarly, in IBS, changes in the phageome have been linked to altered gut motility and visceral hypersensitivity. In CRC, the presence of certain phages has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis, suggesting a potential role in cancer development. Despite these findings, the causal relationship between phageome alterations and disease remains unclear. Many studies have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of standardized methodologies, and confounding factors such as medication use and comorbidities. Standardization in sample collection, processing, and analysis is essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of phageome studies. Efforts to develop standardized protocols and databases, such as the Human Microbiome Project, are underway to address these challenges. In conclusion, the human gut phageome is a dynamic and complex component of the gut microbiome that is influenced by age, diet, and geography. Alterations in the phageome have been implicated in various diseases, but further research is needed to establish causality and understand the underlying mechanisms. Standardization in phageome research will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the gut phageome and its role in human health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Development of the human infant intestinal microbiota", "authors": "Atarashi, K., Tanoue, T., Shima, T., Imaoka, A., Kuwahara, T., Momose, Y., Cheng, G., Yamasaki, S., Saito, T., Ohba, Y., and Honda, K.", "journal": "PLoS Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "15", "first page": "e2003618", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.2003618"}, {"title": "Chimpanzees and humans harbour compositionally similar gut enterotypes", "authors": "Moeller, A.
