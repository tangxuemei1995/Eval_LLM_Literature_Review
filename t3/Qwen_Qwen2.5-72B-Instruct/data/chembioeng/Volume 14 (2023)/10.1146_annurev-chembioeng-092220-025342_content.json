{"Literature Review": "Thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures play a crucial role in various scientific and engineering applications, including chemical engineering, materials science, and environmental studies. However, the scarcity of experimental data necessitates the development of robust predictive models. Traditional physical models, such as molecular models, equations of state (EOS), and models of excess properties, have been widely used for this purpose. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these predictions. This literature review explores the integration of physical knowledge with ML in the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures, highlighting recent advancements and future directions. Traditional physical models, such as the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state (SRK EOS), have been extensively used to predict the thermophysical properties of pure fluids and mixtures. These models are based on fundamental principles of thermodynamics and provide a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. However, they often struggle with complex systems, especially those involving non-ideal behavior and multiple components. To address these limitations, researchers have turned to more sophisticated models, such as the cubic-plus-association (CPA) EOS, which accounts for hydrogen bonding and other specific interactions. Despite their advantages, physical models alone may not always capture the intricate behavior of fluid mixtures, particularly in cases where experimental data are limited or unavailable. This is where machine learning techniques come into play. ML algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests (RFs), have shown great potential in predicting thermophysical properties by learning from existing data. These algorithms can identify complex patterns and relationships in the data, leading to more accurate predictions. One of the key challenges in combining physical models with ML is the integration of physical knowledge into the ML framework. This is essential to ensure that the predictions are physically meaningful and consistent with the underlying thermodynamic principles. Hybrid models, which combine the strengths of both physical and ML approaches, have been proposed to address this challenge. For example, the work by Zhang et al. demonstrates the use of a hybrid model that integrates the PR EOS with an ANN to predict the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of binary mixtures. The hybrid model leverages the physical insights provided by the PR EOS while benefiting from the data-driven capabilities of the ANN, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness. Another approach to integrating physical knowledge with ML is through the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs are a class of deep learning models that incorporate physical laws and constraints directly into the training process. By doing so, PINNs can learn the underlying physical processes and make predictions that are consistent with the governing equations. This approach has been successfully applied to various thermodynamic problems, including the prediction of phase equilibria and transport properties. In addition to improving prediction accuracy, hybrid models can also enhance the interpretability of the results. Unlike black-box ML models, hybrid models provide insights into the physical mechanisms driving the observed phenomena. This is particularly important in scientific and engineering applications where understanding the underlying processes is crucial. The integration of physical knowledge with ML also opens up new possibilities for model optimization and parameter estimation. Traditional physical models often require the estimation of empirical parameters, which can be challenging and time-consuming. ML techniques can automate this process by optimizing the parameters based on available data. Despite the promising results, several challenges remain in the development and application of hybrid models. One of the main challenges is the need for high-quality and diverse training data. While ML algorithms can learn from large datasets, the quality and representativeness of the data are critical for the success of the models. Another challenge is the computational cost associated with training and deploying hybrid models, especially for large-scale and real-time applications. Efficient algorithms and hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, can help to mitigate this issue. Future developments in the field are likely to focus on addressing these challenges and expanding the scope of hybrid models. Advances in data acquisition and processing technologies, such as high-throughput experiments and sensor networks, will provide more comprehensive and reliable data for training ML models. Additionally, the integration of multi-scale and multi-physics models will enable the prediction of thermophysical properties across different length and time scales, opening up new opportunities for applications in areas such as nanotechnology and biotechnology. In conclusion, the combination of physical knowledge with machine learning offers a powerful approach to the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures. Hybrid models that integrate the strengths of both physical and ML approaches can improve prediction accuracy, enhance interpretability, and facilitate model optimization. As the field continues to evolve, we can expect to see more innovative and effective hybrid models that bridge the gap between traditional physical modeling and modern data-driven techniques.", "References": [{"title": "A New Two-Constant Equation of State", "authors": "D.
