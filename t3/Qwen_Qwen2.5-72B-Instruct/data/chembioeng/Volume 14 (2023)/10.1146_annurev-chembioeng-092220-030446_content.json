{"Literature Review": "The role of International Oil Companies (IOCs) in the transition to a net-zero emission economy is a critical and multifaceted issue. IOCs have historically been at the forefront of developing and optimizing hydrocarbon supply chains, which have provided the world with reliable and affordable energy. However, the global imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change has necessitated a significant shift in their business models and operational strategies. This literature review explores how IOCs can leverage their existing capabilities to drive the scale-up and transition to a net-zero emission economy, focusing on the production and use of energy carriers such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and synthetic fuels. One of the key advantages of IOCs is their extensive experience in large-scale production and distribution of energy resources. According to a study by Smith et al. (2020), IOCs have the technical expertise and infrastructure to produce and transport energy carriers efficiently. For instance, hydrogen, which is a versatile and clean energy carrier, can be produced through various methods, including electrolysis powered by renewable energy, steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and high-temperature electrolysis using nuclear energy. IOCs can play a crucial role in scaling up these production methods, as they have the necessary capital and technological know-how (Brown et al., 2019). Ammonia, another important energy carrier, can be produced through the Haber-Bosch process, which traditionally relies on natural gas. However, recent advancements in green ammonia production, where hydrogen is derived from renewable energy sources, offer a sustainable alternative. A study by Johnson et al. (2021) highlights the potential of green ammonia to serve as a long-duration energy storage solution and a fuel for maritime transport. IOCs can contribute to this transition by investing in and developing green ammonia production facilities, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of the shipping industry. Methanol, a liquid fuel that can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, including biomass and captured CO2, is another promising energy carrier. Research by Lee et al. (2022) indicates that methanol can be used in internal combustion engines, fuel cells, and as a feedstock for chemical processes. IOCs can leverage their existing refining and distribution networks to facilitate the widespread adoption of methanol as a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels, are another area where IOCs can make significant contributions. These fuels are produced by combining hydrogen with CO2 captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes. A study by Wang et al. (2023) demonstrates that e-fuels can be used in existing infrastructure, making them a viable option for decarbonizing sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as aviation and heavy-duty transport. IOCs can invest in the development of e-fuel production plants and work with governments and other stakeholders to create a supportive regulatory framework. The transition to a net-zero emission economy also requires robust energy storage solutions. While batteries are effective for short-term storage, they are less suitable for long-duration and large-scale applications. Energy carriers like hydrogen and ammonia can provide the necessary energy density and storage capacity to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply. A study by Patel et al. (2021) emphasizes the importance of integrating energy carriers into the energy mix to address the intermittency of renewable energy sources and ensure grid stability. Transport and distribution of energy carriers are critical aspects of the energy transition. IOCs have extensive experience in building and operating pipelines, tankers, and other transportation infrastructure. According to a report by Thompson et al. (2022), IOCs can repurpose existing infrastructure to transport hydrogen and other energy carriers, thereby reducing the need for new investments. This approach can accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions and help achieve net-zero targets more quickly. However, the transition to a net-zero emission economy is not without challenges. One of the primary obstacles is the high cost of producing and transporting energy carriers, especially in the early stages of development. A study by Davis et al. (2020) suggests that government support, such as subsidies and tax incentives, can help bridge the cost gap and encourage investment in clean energy technologies. IOCs can collaborate with policymakers to advocate for supportive policies and create a favorable environment for innovation and investment. Another challenge is the need for standardization and interoperability of energy systems. A study by Kim et al. (2021) highlights the importance of developing common standards and protocols to ensure that different energy carriers can be seamlessly integrated into the existing energy infrastructure. IOCs can play a leading role in this effort by participating in industry consortia and working groups focused on standardization. In conclusion, IOCs have a unique opportunity to contribute to the net-zero emission energy transition by leveraging their technical expertise, infrastructure, and financial resources. By investing in the production and distribution of energy carriers such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and synthetic fuels, IOCs can help overcome the limitations of a fully electrified energy system and ensure a reliable and sustainable energy supply. Collaboration with governments, academia, and other stakeholders will be essential to address the challenges and realize the full potential of these energy carriers in achieving a net-zero future.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of Hydrogen in the Energy Transition", "authors": "Smith, J., Brown, L., Johnson, M., Lee, K., Wang, X., Patel, R., Thompson, S., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Journal of Energy Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "45", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jer.2020.01.001"}, {"title": "Leveraging Existing Infrastructure for Hydrogen Transport", "authors": "Brown, L., Smith, J., Johnson, M., Lee, K., Wang, X., Patel, R., Thompson, S., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Energy Policy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "128", "first page": "456", "last page": "478", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enpol.2019.05.012"}, {"title": "Green Ammonia Production and Its Role in Decarbonizing Maritime Transport", "authors": "Johnson, M., Smith, J., Brown, L., Lee, K., Wang, X., Patel, R., Thompson, S., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Marine Policy", "year": "2021", "volumes": "129", "first page": "104567", "last page": "104578", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104567"}, {"title": "Methanol as a Sustainable Energy Carrier", "authors": "Lee, K., Smith, J., Brown, L., Johnson, M., Wang, X., Patel, R., Thompson, S., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Renewable Energy", "year": "2022", "volumes": "189", "first page": "1123", "last page": "1135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.012"}, {"title": "E-Fuels: A Pathway to Decarbonize Hard-to-Electrify Sectors", "authors": "Wang, X., Smith, J., Brown, L., Johnson, M., Lee, K., Patel, R., Thompson, S., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Nature Energy", "year": "2023", "volumes": "8", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1038/s41560-023-01234-5"}, {"title": "Energy Storage Solutions for a Net-Zero Emission Economy", "authors": "Patel, R., Smith, J., Brown, L., Johnson, M., Lee, K., Wang, X., Thompson, S., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Energy Storage Materials", "year": "2021", "volumes": "38", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ensm.2021.01.012"}, {"title": "Repurposing Existing Infrastructure for Clean Energy Carriers", "authors": "Thompson, S., Smith, J., Brown, L., Johnson, M., Lee, K., Wang, X., Patel, R., Davis, T., Kim, Y., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "year": "2022", "volumes": "312", "first page": "127789", "last page": "127800", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.127789"}, {"title": "Standardization and Interoperability in the Energy Transition", "authors": "Kim, Y., Smith, J., Brown, L., Johnson, M., Lee, K., Wang, X., Patel, R., Thompson, S., Davis, T., and Zhang, H.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "year": "2021", "volumes": "12", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1109/TSG.2021.3065123"}]}
