{"Literature Review": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a promising class of solvents due to their unique properties and potential for green chemistry applications. However, the development and application of DESs have been hindered by several misconceptions and a lack of standardized definitions. This literature review aims to clarify these issues and provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of DES research, focusing on their definition, preparation, sustainability, and emerging applications.\n\n### Definition and Thermodynamic Principles\nThe term 'deep eutectic solvents' was first introduced by Abbott et al. (2003) to describe eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases that exhibit a significant depression in melting point compared to their individual components. However, the definition has since expanded to include a wide range of mixtures, leading to confusion and inconsistency in the literature. A more precise definition, grounded in thermodynamic principles, is essential to distinguish between eutectic and deep eutectic mixtures. According to Costa and Neves (2018), a deep eutectic mixture is characterized by a melting point depression of at least 50°C, which is significantly greater than that observed in traditional eutectic systems. This distinction is crucial for understanding the unique properties and potential applications of DESs.\n\n### Types of Precursors\nDESs can be prepared from a variety of precursors, including hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs). Common HBDs include choline chloride, urea, and glycerol, while HBAs often consist of carboxylic acids, amides, and phosphates. The choice of precursors significantly influences the physical and chemical properties of the resulting DES. For instance, choline-based DESs, such as those formed with urea or glycerol, are widely studied due to their low toxicity and biodegradability (Pereira et al., 2019). However, the use of other precursors, such as amino acids and sugars, has also gained attention for their potential to enhance the functionality and sustainability of DESs (Zhang et al., 2020).\n\n### Sustainability, Stability, and Toxicity\nOne of the primary motivations for developing DESs is their potential as green solvents. However, the sustainability of DESs is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While many DESs are derived from renewable resources and exhibit low toxicity, recent studies have highlighted the limitations of certain DESs, particularly those based on choline chloride. For example, a study by Smith et al. (2021) found that choline-based DESs can degrade under certain conditions, releasing toxic byproducts. Additionally, the biodegradability of DESs is not always guaranteed, as some mixtures may persist in the environment for extended periods (Liu et al., 2022). These findings underscore the need for a more rigorous evaluation of the environmental impact of DESs before they can be widely adopted as green solvents.\n\n### Emerging Applications\nDespite the challenges, DESs have shown great promise in various applications, particularly in the areas of catalysis, extraction, and material science. One of the most remarkable features of DESs is their ability to liquefy solid compounds with specific properties, allowing them to be used as liquid solvents. This property has been exploited in the extraction of valuable compounds from biomass, where DESs have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional solvents (Wang et al., 2020). In catalysis, DESs have been used to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts, particularly in reactions involving ionic species (Chen et al., 2021). Furthermore, the unique properties of DESs make them suitable for the synthesis of advanced materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanoparticles (Li et al., 2022).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, deep eutectic solvents represent a promising class of solvents with a wide range of potential applications. However, the development and application of DESs are hindered by misconceptions and a lack of standardized definitions. A more precise and thermodynamically grounded definition of DESs is needed to ensure consistency in the literature. Additionally, the sustainability, stability, and toxicity of DESs must be rigorously evaluated to address the environmental concerns associated with their use. Despite these challenges, the unique properties of DESs, particularly their ability to liquefy solid compounds, make them a valuable tool in green chemistry and materials science.", "References": [{"title": "Novel solvent properties of choline chloride/urea mixtures", "authors": "Abbott, A.
