{"Literature Review": "Over the past decade, the study of mRNA modifications has gained significant traction, revealing a complex and dynamic layer of gene regulation known as the epitranscriptome. This review focuses on the proteins involved in writing, reading, and erasing mRNA modifications, with a particular emphasis on N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal mRNA modification. The discovery and characterization of these proteins have provided crucial insights into the mechanisms of mRNA modification and their functional implications. Writers: Methyltransferases The process of mRNA modification begins with the writers, which are enzymes responsible for adding specific chemical groups to RNA bases. For m6A, the primary writer is the methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) protein, which forms a complex with methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) and Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) to form the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC) (Liu et al., 2014). This complex catalyzes the addition of a methyl group to the adenosine base at position 6, resulting in the formation of m6A. The METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex has been shown to be essential for the deposition of m6A in various cellular contexts, including embryonic stem cell differentiation and neural development (Zhao et al., 2017). In addition to METTL3 and METTL14, other proteins such as KIAA1429 and RBM15 have been identified as components of the MTC, contributing to its stability and activity (Wang et al., 2014). These findings highlight the complexity of the m6A writer complex and suggest that multiple factors may influence its activity and specificity. Readers: m6A-Binding Proteins Once m6A modifications are deposited, they can be recognized by a variety of reader proteins that bind to the modified sites and mediate downstream effects. The YTH domain family (YTHDF) proteins, including YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3, are among the best-characterized m6A readers. YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 promote the translation of m6A-containing mRNAs, while YTHDF2 facilitates mRNA degradation (Du et al., 2016). These distinct functions of YTHDF proteins underscore the multifaceted roles of m6A in regulating gene expression. Other m6A readers include the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) and the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein (IGF2BP) family. HNRNPC has been shown to stabilize m6A-modified mRNAs, whereas IGF2BPs enhance mRNA stability and translation (Roundtree et al., 2017). The diversity of m6A readers and their varied functions suggest that m6A can exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on mRNA fate. Erasers: Demethylases The dynamic nature of the epitranscriptome is further highlighted by the presence of erasers, which are enzymes capable of removing m6A modifications. The fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) are the two main demethylases known to reverse m6A modifications (Jia et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013). FTO and ALKBH5 have been implicated in various biological processes, including stem cell maintenance, differentiation, and stress responses. For example, FTO has been shown to regulate the stability and translation of m6A-modified mRNAs involved in metabolic pathways (Han et al., 2013). The interplay between writers, readers, and erasers creates a dynamic and reversible system of mRNA modification, allowing cells to fine-tune gene expression in response to environmental cues and developmental signals. This dynamic regulation is particularly evident in the context of cellular stress, where rapid changes in m6A levels can modulate the expression of stress-responsive genes (Shi et al., 2017). Future Directions and Open Questions Despite significant progress in understanding the proteins involved in mRNA modification, several key questions remain unanswered. One major challenge is to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which m6A writers, readers, and erasers recognize and interact with their target mRNAs. High-throughput approaches, such as CLIP-seq and MeRIP-seq, have provided valuable insights into the genomic distribution of m6A, but more detailed studies are needed to understand the sequence and structural determinants of m6A recognition (Dominissini et al., 2012). Another important area of investigation is the functional consequences of m6A modifications in different cellular contexts. While many studies have focused on the role of m6A in embryonic development and differentiation, less is known about its functions in adult tissues and disease states. For example, aberrant m6A levels have been observed in various cancers, suggesting that dysregulation of m6A writers, readers, or erasers may contribute to tumorigenesis (Lin et al., 2016). Finally, the development of small molecules and genetic tools to specifically target m6A writers, readers, and erasers will be crucial for dissecting their roles in vivo and for therapeutic applications. Recent advances in CRISPR-Cas9 technology and chemical biology have opened new avenues for manipulating the epitranscriptome, providing exciting opportunities for future research (Chen et al., 2018). In conclusion, the study of mRNA modifications, particularly m6A, has revealed a rich and dynamic landscape of gene regulation. The proteins that write, read, and erase these modifications play critical roles in shaping the epitranscriptome and influencing cellular function. As the field continues to evolve, addressing the remaining questions and challenges will undoubtedly lead to a deeper understanding of the epitranscriptome and its impact on human health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability", "authors": "Jia, G., Fu, Y., Zhao, X., Dai, Q., Zheng, G., Yang, Y., ... & He, C.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2011", "volumes": "471", "first page": "616", "last page": "622", "DOI": "10.1038/nature09915"}, {"title": "N6-methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO", "authors": "Zheng, G., Dahlberg, J.
