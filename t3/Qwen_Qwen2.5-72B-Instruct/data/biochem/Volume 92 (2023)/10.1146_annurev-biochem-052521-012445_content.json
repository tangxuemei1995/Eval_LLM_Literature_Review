{"Literature Review": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in the maturation of transcripts, involving the cleavage of pre-mRNA and the addition of a poly(A) tail. This process is essential for the proper translation, stability, and localization of the mRNA. The machinery responsible for 3′-end processing includes a complex array of proteins, with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans and cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast playing central roles. CPSF and CPF are multi-subunit complexes that recognize specific sequences in the pre-mRNA, such as the AAUAAA hexamer, which is a conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signal (PAS). These complexes coordinate the cleavage of the pre-mRNA by an endonuclease and the subsequent addition of a poly(A) tail by poly(A) polymerase (PAP). The cleavage site is typically located 10-30 nucleotides downstream of the PAS, and the efficiency of cleavage is influenced by additional regulatory elements, such as upstream and downstream sequence elements (USEs and DSEs). Recent structural studies have provided detailed insights into the mechanisms of 3′-end processing. For example, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revealed the architecture of the human CPSF complex, showing how it interacts with the pre-mRNA and other factors. These studies have highlighted the importance of specific subunits, such as CPSF73, which acts as the endonuclease responsible for cleaving the pre-mRNA. Additionally, the interaction between CPSF and other components of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, such as cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), has been elucidated. The regulation of 3′-end processing is tightly linked to transcription. The phosphorylation state of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) plays a crucial role in this regulation. During transcription elongation, the CTD is hyperphosphorylated, which facilitates the recruitment of CPSF and other factors to the cleavage site. Conversely, dephosphorylation of the CTD during transcription termination helps to disassemble the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. This dynamic interplay between transcription and 3′-end processing ensures that the correct cleavage site is selected and that the poly(A) tail is added efficiently. The length of the poly(A) tail is another important aspect of 3′-end processing. The poly(A) tail is typically 200-250 nucleotides long and is added by PAP, which continues to add adenosine residues until it is inhibited by the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. The length of the poly(A) tail can influence the stability and translation efficiency of the mRNA. For instance, longer poly(A) tails generally enhance mRNA stability and translation, while shorter tails can lead to rapid degradation. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes, where a single gene can produce multiple mRNA isoforms with different 3′-ends. APA can result in the production of mRNAs with distinct coding sequences or 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), which can affect the stability, localization, and translation of the mRNA. The choice of cleavage site is influenced by various factors, including the presence of alternative PASs, the activity of regulatory proteins, and the cellular environment. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the comprehensive analysis of APA events across the transcriptome. These studies have revealed that APA is a common mechanism for regulating gene expression and that it can be influenced by cellular conditions, such as stress and differentiation. For example, stress-induced changes in the phosphorylation state of the Pol II CTD can alter the selection of cleavage sites, leading to the production of shorter or longer mRNA isoforms. Despite significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of 3′-end processing, several questions remain unresolved. For instance, the precise molecular mechanisms by which the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery is recruited to the pre-mRNA and how it is regulated in response to different cellular signals are still not fully understood. Additionally, the functional consequences of APA and the role of specific regulatory elements in controlling cleavage site selection are areas of ongoing investigation. In conclusion, the 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a multifaceted process that involves a complex interplay of protein factors, regulatory elements, and transcriptional control. Advances in structural biology and high-throughput sequencing have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of 3′-end processing, but further research is needed to fully understand the regulatory networks that govern this critical step in gene expression.", "References": [{"title": "Cleavage and polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs", "authors": "Yasushi Takagaki, James L.
