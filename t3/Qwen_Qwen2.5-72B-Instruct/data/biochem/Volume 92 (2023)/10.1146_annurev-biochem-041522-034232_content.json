{"Literature Review": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized form of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially repairs DNA damage on the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes. This mechanism was first identified in the 1980s when it was observed that UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were repaired more rapidly in the transcribed strand compared to the non-transcribed strand in mammalian cells (Sancar, 1994). Since then, TCR has been found to be a universal phenomenon across various model organisms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans (Hanawalt & Spivak, 2008).\n\nIn E. coli, the primary protein responsible for TCR is Mfd (Mutator frequency decline), also known as transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF). Mfd binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP) that is stalled at a DNA lesion and facilitates the recruitment of NER proteins to the site of damage (Selby & Sancar, 1993). This interaction is crucial for the efficient removal of the lesion and the resumption of transcription. The mechanism of Mfd in E. coli has been extensively studied and has been reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins, providing detailed insights into the molecular steps involved (Selby & Sancar, 1993).\n\nIn eukaryotes, the process of TCR is more complex and involves multiple proteins. In humans, the Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein plays a central role in TCR. CSB, along with its homolog XAB2, interacts with RNAP II and recruits NER factors to the site of damage (Tantin et al., 2004). Mutations in the CSB gene lead to Cockayne syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe neurological defects and hypersensitivity to UV light (Vermeulen et al., 2003). These symptoms highlight the critical importance of TCR in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular function.\n\nRecent advances in genome-wide next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have provided new insights into the dynamics of TCR. Studies using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq have shown that TCR is not limited to actively transcribed genes but can also occur in regions with low transcriptional activity (Feng et al., 2016). This suggests that the presence of RNAP alone may be sufficient to trigger TCR, rather than the level of transcription. Additionally, single-molecule analysis and cryo-electron microscopy have revealed the intricate interactions between RNAP, CSB, and NER proteins during the repair process (Liu et al., 2017).\n\nDrosophila melanogaster presents an interesting exception to the general TCR mechanism. While Drosophila exhibits TCR, it lacks an obvious homolog of Mfd or CSB. Instead, the Drosophila TCR pathway relies on a different set of proteins, including the XPD helicase, which is part of the TFIIH complex (Svejstrup, 2002). This alternative mechanism underscores the evolutionary flexibility of TCR and highlights the importance of context-specific adaptations in different organisms.\n\nThe impact of TCR on mutagenesis and cellular fitness is well-documented. In E. coli, mutations in the mfd gene result in increased mutagenesis following UV exposure, indicating that TCR is essential for preventing the accumulation of mutations (Selby & Sancar, 1993). Similarly, in humans, the loss of TCR function due to mutations in CSB leads to increased genomic instability and the development of severe neurological disorders (Vermeulen et al., 2003). These findings emphasize the critical role of TCR in maintaining genomic stability and preventing disease.\n\nMoreover, TCR has been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms. The circadian clock, which controls daily biological processes, is highly sensitive to DNA damage. Studies have shown that TCR is active in the promoter regions of circadian clock genes, ensuring that these genes are protected from UV-induced damage (Geyfman et al., 2012). This link between TCR and the circadian clock highlights the broader implications of TCR in cellular homeostasis and health.\n\nIn conclusion, TCR is a vital mechanism for the maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in actively transcribed regions. The involvement of specific proteins such as Mfd in E. coli and CSB in humans, along with the use of advanced techniques like NGS and cryo-EM, has significantly advanced our understanding of this process. Future research will likely continue to uncover new aspects of TCR, further elucidating its role in cellular function and disease prevention.", "References": [{"title": "Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints", "authors": "Aziz Sancar", "journal": "Annual Review of Biochemistry", "year": "1994", "volumes": "63", "first page": "39", "last page": "85", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.bi.63.070194.000351"}, {"title": "Transcription-coupled DNA repair and human disease", "authors": "Peter C.
