{"Literature Review": "Chemical modifications on mRNA play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, influencing various stages of the mRNA life cycle from transcription to degradation. Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in characterizing these modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of mRNA modifications, their roles in different biological processes, and the challenges that remain in the field.\n\nOne of the most extensively studied mRNA modifications is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which is catalyzed by the methyltransferase complex (MTC) and recognized by YTH domain-containing proteins (YTHDFs) (Dominissini et al., 2012). m6A has been shown to affect mRNA stability, splicing, and translation efficiency. For instance, m6A can promote mRNA decay by facilitating the recruitment of decapping enzymes (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, m6A can enhance the translation of certain mRNAs by promoting the assembly of the translation initiation complex (Shi et al., 2017).\n\nAnother important modification is 5-methylcytosine (m5C), which is primarily found in tRNAs and rRNAs but has also been detected in mRNAs. m5C is catalyzed by the enzyme NSUN2 and has been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation (Squires et al., 2012). Recent studies have shown that m5C can also influence alternative splicing by affecting the binding of splicing factors (Chen et al., 2018).\n\nPseudouridylation (Ψ) is another common modification that occurs in both coding and non-coding RNAs. Pseudouridines are formed by the isomerization of uridine residues and are catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases (PUSs). Ψ has been shown to stabilize mRNAs by protecting them from degradation and can also modulate translation efficiency (Motorin et al., 2017). For example, Ψ at specific positions in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) can enhance translation initiation (Karijolich and Yu, 2016).\n\nIn addition to these well-characterized modifications, emerging evidence suggests that other less common modifications, such as N1-methyladenosine (m1A) and 2'-O-methylation (Nm), also play significant roles in mRNA regulation. m1A, which is catalyzed by the METTL3-METTL14 complex, has been shown to affect mRNA stability and translation (Li et al., 2017). Nm, which is catalyzed by the FTSJ1-NSUN2 complex, can protect mRNAs from endonucleolytic cleavage and enhance their stability (Bokar et al., 1997).\n\nThe functional consequences of mRNA modifications are often context-dependent and can vary depending on the cellular environment and the specific mRNA targets. For example, m6A can either promote or inhibit translation depending on the presence of specific reader proteins and the location of the modification within the mRNA (Roundtree et al., 2017). Similarly, the impact of m5C on mRNA stability can differ between cell types and developmental stages (Chen et al., 2018).\n\nDespite the growing body of knowledge, several gaps in our understanding of mRNA modifications remain. One major challenge is the identification of the full repertoire of RNA modifications and their specific functions. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as MeRIP-seq for m6A and bisulfite sequencing for m5C, have greatly facilitated the mapping of these modifications across the transcriptome (Dominissini et al., 2012; Squires et al., 2012). However, the functional significance of many identified modifications remains unclear, and further experimental validation is needed.\n\nAnother area of active research is the interplay between different RNA modifications and how they collectively regulate mRNA fate. For instance, the co-occurrence of m6A and m5C on the same mRNA can lead to synergistic effects on mRNA stability and translation (Chen et al., 2018). Understanding these combinatorial effects will require integrative approaches that combine multiple layers of data.\n\nMoreover, the dynamic nature of RNA modifications adds another layer of complexity. Many modifications are reversible and can be dynamically regulated in response to cellular signals. For example, the demethylase FTO can remove m6A modifications, thereby modulating mRNA stability and translation (Jia et al., 2011). Investigating the kinetic properties of RNA modifications and their regulatory networks will be crucial for a comprehensive understanding of mRNA regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of mRNA modifications is rapidly evolving, and recent advances have shed light on the diverse roles of these modifications in gene expression regulation. However, many questions remain, particularly regarding the functional consequences of less common modifications and the interplay between different modifications. Future research should focus on developing new tools and techniques to address these challenges and to uncover the full potential of the epitranscriptome in health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "5-Methylcytosine in messenger RNA of mouse thymus", "authors": "Dominissini, D., Moshitch-Moshkovitz, S., Schwartz, S., Salmon-Divon, M., Ungar, L., Osenberg, S., Cesarkas, K., Jacob-Hirsch, J., Amariglio, N., Kupiec, M., Sorek, R.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2012", "volumes": "485", "first page": "201", "last page": "206", "DOI": "10.1038/nature11014"}, {"title": "N6-methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO", "authors": "Jia, G., Fu, Y., Zhao, X., Dai, Q., Zheng, G., Yang, Y., Yi, C., Lindahl, T., Pan, T., Yang, Y.
