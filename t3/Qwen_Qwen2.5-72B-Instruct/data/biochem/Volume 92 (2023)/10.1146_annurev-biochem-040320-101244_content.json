{"Literature Review": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is a pivotal enzyme in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, responsible for the majority of carbon fixation on Earth. Despite its critical role, Rubisco is known for its relatively slow catalytic rate and high oxygenase activity, which can lead to the wasteful photorespiratory pathway. This inefficiency has led to extensive research aimed at understanding the evolutionary constraints and biochemical mechanisms that govern Rubisco's function, as well as efforts to engineer more efficient variants. The evolutionary history of Rubisco provides insights into why it has not evolved to be a more efficient catalyst. Rubisco is an ancient enzyme, with origins dating back to the early stages of life on Earth. Its structure and function have been conserved across various organisms, including plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The conservation of Rubisco suggests that it has been optimized for its native environments, where the trade-offs between carboxylation and oxygenation activities are balanced to maximize overall efficiency. One of the primary trade-offs in Rubisco's function is the competition between CO2 and O2 for the active site. The oxygenase activity of Rubisco leads to the formation of 2-phosphoglycolate, which must be recycled through the photorespiratory pathway, consuming energy and reducing the net carbon gain. This trade-off is particularly pronounced in C3 plants, which lack specialized structures to concentrate CO2 around Rubisco, leading to higher rates of photorespiration. In contrast, C4 and CAM plants have evolved mechanisms to concentrate CO2, reducing the impact of Rubisco's oxygenase activity. The structural complexity of Rubisco further complicates efforts to improve its catalytic efficiency. Rubisco is a large, multi-subunit enzyme, typically consisting of eight large (L) subunits and eight small (S) subunits. The L subunits contain the active sites, while the S subunits play a regulatory role. The intricate arrangement of these subunits and the presence of multiple active sites make it challenging to engineer improvements without disrupting the enzyme's stability and function. Despite these challenges, numerous studies have explored the potential for engineering Rubisco to enhance its catalytic efficiency. One approach involves the introduction of mutations to the active site residues to reduce the oxygenase activity and increase the carboxylation rate. For example, the substitution of key residues in the active site of Rubisco from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) has been shown to improve the specificity factor (kcat/Km) for CO2. However, such mutations often come with trade-offs, such as reduced thermal stability or altered substrate binding affinity. Another strategy is to introduce Rubisco from organisms with naturally higher catalytic efficiencies into plants. Cyanobacterial Rubisco, for instance, has a higher carboxylation rate and lower oxygenase activity compared to plant Rubisco. However, the successful expression and assembly of cyanobacterial Rubisco in plants have proven difficult due to the complex post-translational modifications required for proper function. In addition to direct modification of Rubisco, researchers have explored the use of auxiliary proteins to enhance its performance. For example, the introduction of the cyanobacterial carboxysome, a protein shell that concentrates CO2 around Rubisco, has been shown to improve the efficiency of carbon fixation in engineered plants. Similarly, the overexpression of enzymes involved in the CBB cycle, such as sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and transketolase (TK), can help to alleviate bottlenecks in the pathway and increase overall carbon fixation rates. The integration of computational methods and high-throughput screening technologies has also accelerated the discovery of Rubisco variants with improved properties. Directed evolution and rational design approaches have identified mutations that enhance the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco while maintaining its stability. These advances have the potential to significantly impact agricultural productivity by improving the efficiency of photosynthesis in crops. In conclusion, the evolution and biochemistry of Rubisco present a complex interplay of trade-offs that have shaped its function over millions of years. While the inherent limitations of Rubisco pose significant challenges, ongoing research in enzyme engineering and synthetic biology holds promise for overcoming these constraints and enhancing the efficiency of carbon fixation in plants. Understanding the structural and mechanistic basis of Rubisco's function is crucial for developing strategies to improve its catalytic efficiency and ultimately promote plant growth and productivity.", "References": [{"title": "Evolutionary divergence of enzymatic properties of form I ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase", "authors": "F.R.
