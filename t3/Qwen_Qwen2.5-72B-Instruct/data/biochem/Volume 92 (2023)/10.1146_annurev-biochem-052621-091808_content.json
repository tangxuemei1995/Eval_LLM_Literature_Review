{"Literature Review": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are critical determinants of protein expression levels in cells. These processes are intricately linked, with recent studies highlighting the role of codon optimality in regulating mRNA stability. Codon optimality refers to the phenomenon where the efficiency of translation, influenced by the specific codons used in the mRNA sequence, can affect the stability of the mRNA itself. This review explores the current understanding of codon optimality, its molecular mechanisms, and its implications across different eukaryotic species. The relationship between codon usage and mRNA stability has been a subject of extensive research. Studies in yeast have shown that codon optimality can significantly influence mRNA decay rates. For instance, Tuller et al. (2010) demonstrated that the translation elongation rate, which is modulated by codon usage, can trigger mRNA degradation. Specifically, they found that mRNAs with suboptimal codons, which slow down the translation elongation rate, are more prone to degradation. This finding suggests that the ribosome's movement along the mRNA can act as a quality control mechanism, ensuring that only efficiently translated mRNAs remain stable. The role of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in this process is particularly intriguing. tRNAs are essential for the decoding of codons during translation, and their availability can directly impact the translation elongation rate. Kudla et al. (2009) showed that the abundance of cognate tRNAs for specific codons can influence mRNA stability. In their study, they observed that mRNAs with codons that have abundant cognate tRNAs are more stable compared to those with rare codons. This indicates that tRNAs serve as key regulators of mRNA stability, adding another layer of complexity to gene expression regulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying codon optimality and mRNA stability are still being elucidated. One proposed mechanism involves the interaction between the ribosome and the mRNA decay machinery. Ingolia et al. (2011) used ribosome profiling to show that ribosomes can stall at suboptimal codons, leading to the recruitment of mRNA decay factors. This stalling can result in the formation of stress granules, which are cytoplasmic aggregates containing stalled mRNAs and associated proteins. Stress granules are thought to play a role in mRNA triage, determining whether an mRNA is degraded or reactivated for translation. While the initial studies on codon optimality were primarily conducted in yeast, similar mechanisms have been observed in higher eukaryotes. However, the orthologous genes involved in these processes may not always share the same functions across species. For example, Zhang et al. (2016) investigated the role of codon optimality in human cells and found that the effects of codon usage on mRNA stability are context-dependent. They reported that certain codons, which are optimal in yeast, may not have the same stabilizing effect in human cells. This highlights the importance of considering species-specific differences when studying codon optimality. The regulatory layers of codon optimality extend beyond simple codon usage. Recent studies have shown that the secondary structure of the mRNA can also influence its stability. Kertesz et al. (2007) demonstrated that the presence of secondary structures in the mRNA can affect the accessibility of ribosomes and mRNA decay factors. They found that mRNAs with stable secondary structures are less likely to be degraded, suggesting that the physical properties of the mRNA can modulate its stability. Another important aspect of codon optimality is the role of non-coding regions in mRNA stability. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs contain regulatory elements that can influence both translation and stability. Wang et al. (2015) showed that specific sequences within the UTRs can recruit RNA-binding proteins that either stabilize or destabilize the mRNA. For example, the AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' UTR are known to promote mRNA decay by recruiting decay factors such as AUF1 and TTP. The interplay between codon optimality and mRNA stability is further complicated by the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that can bind to target mRNAs and induce their degradation or translational repression. Bartel (2009) reviewed the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate gene expression, emphasizing the importance of miRNA binding sites in the 3' UTR. He noted that the presence of multiple miRNA binding sites can enhance the efficiency of mRNA degradation, providing an additional layer of post-transcriptional regulation. In summary, the regulation of mRNA stability through codon optimality is a multifaceted process involving the translation elongation rate, tRNA availability, mRNA secondary structure, and the presence of regulatory elements in the UTRs. While the basic principles of codon optimality have been established in yeast, the specific mechanisms and regulatory factors can vary across different eukaryotic species. Future research will likely uncover more details about the molecular interactions and evolutionary adaptations that govern mRNA stability and translational efficiency.", "References": [{"title": "An evolutionarily conserved mechanism for controlling the efficiency of protein translation", "authors": "Tsvi Tuller, Liran Carmi, Yitzhak B.
