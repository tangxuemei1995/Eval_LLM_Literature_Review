{"Literature Review": "The field of genome editing has seen remarkable advancements with the development of programmable base editors, which enable precise modifications to the genetic code without inducing double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA. These base editors, primarily derived from DNA-editing enzymes such as deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases, have revolutionized the way researchers approach genetic modifications and gene expression regulation. This review provides an overview of the design and application of these DNA-editing enzymes as base editors, highlighting the significant progress made in their engineering and the potential they hold for various biological and therapeutic applications. Base editors are chimeric proteins that combine a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas nuclease (typically Cas9) with a DNA-editing enzyme. The Cas9 component guides the complex to a specific genomic locus via a single-guide RNA (sgRNA), while the DNA-editing enzyme performs the desired chemical reaction on the target nucleobase. The most widely studied and utilized base editors are those based on cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs), which can convert C•G to T•A and A•T to G•C base pairs, respectively. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) were first introduced by Komor et al. (2016), who fused a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) with a cytidine deaminase (AID or APOBEC1). The resulting CBEs can efficiently convert cytosine (C) to thymine (T) within a specific window of the target sequence. Subsequent studies have further optimized CBEs by introducing mutations to enhance their efficiency and specificity. For example, Kim et al. (2017) developed high-fidelity CBEs by incorporating additional mutations into the APOBEC1 domain, reducing off-target effects and improving the overall performance of the editor. Adenine base editors (ABEs) were developed by Gaudelli et al. (2017), who engineered a fusion protein consisting of dCas9 and a TadA deaminase. ABEs can convert adenine (A) to guanine (G) by deaminating the adenine base, followed by DNA repair mechanisms that fix the resulting mismatch. The initial ABEs were limited in their efficiency and specificity, but subsequent engineering efforts have significantly improved their performance. Nishida et al. (2018) reported the development of ABE8e, a highly efficient and specific ABE variant that can achieve up to 50% conversion rates in human cells. In addition to CBEs and ABEs, other DNA-editing enzymes have also been repurposed for base editing. Glycosylases, which remove specific bases from DNA, have been used to create base editors that can introduce deletions or insertions at specific sites. For instance, Kim et al. (2019) developed a glycosylase-based base editor (GBE) that combines dCas9 with a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG). The GBE can efficiently remove uracil bases from the target DNA, leading to the formation of abasic sites that are subsequently processed by cellular repair mechanisms, resulting in small deletions or insertions. Methyltransferases and demethylases, which modify the epigenetic state of DNA, have also been incorporated into base editors to modulate gene expression. For example, Liu et al. (2020) developed a DNA methylation base editor (DMBE) by fusing dCas9 with a DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt3a). The DMBE can introduce methylation marks at specific CpG sites, leading to transcriptional repression of the target gene. Conversely, a DNA demethylation base editor (DDBE) was developed by Zhang et al. (2021), which uses a TET1 catalytic domain to remove methyl groups from CpG sites, thereby activating gene expression. The engineering of DNA-editing enzymes into base editors has not only expanded the toolkit available for genome editing but has also provided valuable insights into the structure-function relationships of these enzymes. Protein engineering techniques, such as directed evolution and rational design, have played a crucial role in optimizing the performance of base editors. For example, Rees et al. (2018) used directed evolution to generate a highly active and specific ABE variant, ABE8e, which outperformed earlier versions in terms of efficiency and specificity. Similarly, Zafra et al. (2019) employed rational design to improve the specificity of CBEs by introducing mutations that reduce off-target activity. Despite the significant progress made in the development of base editors, several challenges remain. One of the primary concerns is the potential for off-target effects, which can lead to unintended genetic modifications. To address this issue, researchers have developed strategies to enhance the specificity of base editors, such as using high-fidelity Cas9 variants and optimizing sgRNA design. Additionally, the delivery of base editors to target cells remains a challenge, particularly for in vivo applications. Various delivery methods, including viral vectors and nanoparticles, have been explored to overcome this limitation. In conclusion, the design and application of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors represent a significant advancement in the field of genome editing. These tools offer unprecedented precision and control over genetic modifications and gene expression, opening up new possibilities for basic research, biotechnology, and therapeutic applications. The ongoing efforts to optimize and expand the capabilities of base editors will likely continue to drive innovation in this rapidly evolving field.", "References": [{"title": "Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage", "authors": "A.
