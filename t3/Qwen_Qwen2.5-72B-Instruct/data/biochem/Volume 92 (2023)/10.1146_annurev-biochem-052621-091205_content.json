{"Literature Review": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and other genotoxic stresses can induce bulky DNA lesions, which pose significant threats to genome stability and cell viability. To counteract these threats, cells have evolved two main repair pathways: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). While both pathways ultimately aim to remove DNA damage, they differ in their initial recognition mechanisms and the specific cellular contexts in which they operate. TC-NER is particularly important for repairing DNA lesions that occur in actively transcribed regions. This pathway is initiated when RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at the site of a lesion during transcription. The stalled RNAPII serves as a signal for the recruitment of repair factors, including Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), Cockayne syndrome protein A (CSA), and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) (Hanawalt, 2002). These proteins play crucial roles in the recognition and processing of the damaged DNA, facilitating the recruitment of the core NER machinery. The role of CSB in TC-NER has been extensively studied. CSB is a member of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling proteins and is essential for the efficient repair of UV-induced lesions in transcribed genes. Mutations in the CSB gene lead to Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe developmental abnormalities and hypersensitivity to UV light (Cleaver & Kraemer, 2012). CSB is thought to facilitate the release of stalled RNAPII from the lesion, allowing the repair machinery to access the damaged DNA (Sarker et al., 2005). CSA, another key player in TC-NER, functions in concert with CSB. CSA is involved in the early stages of TC-NER, where it helps to recruit CSB and other repair factors to the site of the lesion. The exact mechanism by which CSA contributes to TC-NER is still not fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in the ubiquitylation of RNAPII, which is a critical step in the repair process (Wakasugi et al., 2002). Mutations in the CSA gene also result in CS, further emphasizing the importance of this protein in maintaining genomic integrity. UVSSA is a more recently identified factor in TC-NER. It interacts with CSB and plays a role in the stabilization of the TC-NER complex. UVSSA is particularly important for the repair of UV-induced lesions in the context of transcription, and its depletion leads to increased sensitivity to UV light (Liu et al., 2013). The precise molecular function of UVSSA remains an area of active research, but it is clear that it is a critical component of the TC-NER pathway. Protein ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification that plays a significant role in the regulation of TC-NER. Ubiquitylation of RNAPII and other repair factors is essential for the efficient removal of DNA lesions. For example, the ubiquitylation of RNAPII by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Elongin B/C-Rbx1 complex is required for the recruitment of CSB and other repair factors to the site of the lesion (Tremeau-Bravard et al., 2004). This ubiquitylation event helps to mark the damaged DNA and facilitates the assembly of the repair machinery. In addition to the direct repair of DNA lesions, UV irradiation also triggers a complex transcriptional response. This response involves the activation of various signaling cascades, including the p53 and ATM/ATR pathways, which help to coordinate the cellular response to DNA damage (Kumamoto et al., 2011). The p53 pathway, in particular, plays a crucial role in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to UV-induced DNA damage. The activation of p53 leads to the transcription of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis, thereby helping to maintain genomic stability (Vousden & Prives, 2009). The ATM/ATR pathways are also activated in response to UV-induced DNA damage and play a role in the phosphorylation of key repair factors, such as CSB and XPA. These phosphorylation events are essential for the proper functioning of the repair machinery and the resolution of DNA damage (Cleaver, 2005). The interplay between these signaling pathways and the NER machinery is critical for the effective repair of UV-induced lesions and the maintenance of genomic integrity. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding NER factors, including XPA, XPC, and XPG. Patients with XP exhibit extreme sensitivity to sunlight and a high incidence of skin cancers due to the inability to efficiently repair UV-induced DNA damage (Cleaver, 2005). The study of XP has provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of NER and the importance of this pathway in protecting against UV-induced mutagenesis. In conclusion, TC-NER is a critical pathway for the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions in actively transcribed regions. The involvement of stalled RNAPII, CSB, CSA, and UVSSA in this process highlights the complexity and specificity of the repair mechanism. Protein ubiquitylation and signaling cascades, such as the p53 and ATM/ATR pathways, play essential roles in coordinating the cellular response to DNA damage. Understanding the molecular details of TC-NER and the associated signaling pathways is crucial for developing strategies to protect against UV-induced DNA damage and related diseases, such as CS and XP.", "References": [{"title": "Transcription-coupled repair and human syndromes", "authors": "Cleaver, J.
