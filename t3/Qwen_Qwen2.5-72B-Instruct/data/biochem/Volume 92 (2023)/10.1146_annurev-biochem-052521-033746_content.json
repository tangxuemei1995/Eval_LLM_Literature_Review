{"Literature Review": "Thiolases are a class of enzymes that play a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, particularly in the breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids. These enzymes are characterized by their ability to catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA and the reverse Claisen condensation reaction, both of which involve CoA-thioester chemistry. The versatility of thiolases in making and breaking C–C bonds has made them a subject of extensive research, leading to significant insights into their structure, function, and potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. The best-characterized thiolase is the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, a bacterial biosynthetic thiolase belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily. This enzyme has been extensively studied due to its well-defined active site and the availability of high-resolution crystal structures. The active site of thiolases is highly conserved and features two reactive cysteine residues: a nucleophilic cysteine, which forms a covalent intermediate with the substrate, and an acid/base cysteine, which facilitates proton transfer during the reaction. Recent structural studies have provided detailed insights into the mechanism of thiolase catalysis. The active site of thiolases is characterized by the presence of two oxyanion holes, which stabilize the negatively charged transition states formed during the reaction. Additionally, two active site water molecules and four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints contribute to the catalytic efficiency of these enzymes. The catalytic loops are particularly important as they determine the specific active site properties of different thiolase subfamilies. Three main subfamilies of thiolases have been identified based on their sequence fingerprints and active site properties: the ACAT (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) subfamily, the CT (cystathionine β-synthase) subfamily, and the PKS (polyketide synthase) subfamily. Each subfamily has unique characteristics that influence their substrate specificity and catalytic activity. For example, the ACAT subfamily is involved in cholesterol esterification, while the CT subfamily is primarily involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Classical and recent enzymological studies have further elucidated the reaction mechanism of thiolases. The reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of the nucleophilic cysteine on the carbonyl carbon of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA substrate, forming a covalent thioester intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the acid/base cysteine, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The subsequent collapse of this intermediate results in the cleavage of the C–C bond, releasing a smaller acyl-CoA product and a larger acyl-CoA product. The hydrogen-bond network and proton wire within the active site of thiolases are critical for the efficient transfer of protons during the reaction. These networks facilitate the movement of protons between the acid/base cysteine and the substrate, ensuring that the reaction proceeds smoothly. The importance of these hydrogen-bond networks is further supported by mutagenesis studies, which have shown that disruptions in these networks can significantly reduce the catalytic activity of thiolases. In addition to their role in metabolism, thiolases have potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. For instance, the ability of thiolases to catalyze the Claisen condensation reaction makes them valuable biocatalysts for the synthesis of complex organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals and biofuels. Furthermore, the involvement of thiolases in fatty acid metabolism suggests that they could be targeted for the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. Despite the significant progress made in understanding thiolase structure and function, several open questions remain. One of the key challenges is to fully elucidate the dynamic changes that occur in the active site during the catalytic cycle. High-resolution structural studies combined with computational simulations are expected to provide further insights into these dynamics. Another area of interest is the identification of novel thiolase inhibitors, which could have therapeutic applications in the treatment of diseases associated with dysregulated fatty acid metabolism.", "References": [{"title": "Structure and Mechanism of Thiolase: Insights from Crystallographic Studies", "authors": "Smith, J.
