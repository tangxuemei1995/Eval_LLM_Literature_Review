{"Literature Review": "Temperature is a critical environmental factor that significantly influences plant growth, development, and survival. Understanding the mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to temperature changes is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity. This review focuses on the recent advancements in the understanding of temperature sensing in plants, particularly in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, and highlights the major pathways involved: vernalization, cold stress, thermomorphogenesis, and heat stress. Vernalization is a process where prolonged exposure to low temperatures promotes flowering in certain plants. In Arabidopsis, vernalization involves the repression of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) through epigenetic modifications. Studies have shown that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays a central role in this process by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), leading to the stable silencing of FLC. The cold-induced recruitment of PRC2 to the FLC locus is mediated by the cold-responsive transcription factor VIN3, which is essential for the establishment of vernalization memory. Cold stress responses in plants are mediated by a complex network of signaling pathways that help plants survive freezing temperatures. The C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF) pathway is a well-characterized mechanism that confers cold tolerance. CBFs are transcription factors that activate the expression of COR (COLD-REGULATED) genes, which encode proteins that protect cells from freezing damage. Recent studies have also identified the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in fine-tuning the expression of CBFs and other cold-responsive genes, highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in cold stress responses. Thermomorphogenesis refers to the morphological changes that plants undergo in response to elevated temperatures. These changes include increased hypocotyl elongation, leaf expansion, and altered root architecture, which help plants optimize light capture and reduce heat stress. The phytohormone auxin plays a central role in thermomorphogenesis by promoting cell elongation and modulating gene expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) has been shown to interact with the heat shock factor HSF A2, linking auxin signaling to heat stress responses. Additionally, the circadian clock is tightly integrated with thermomorphogenesis, with temperature signals influencing the timing and amplitude of circadian rhythms. Heat stress is a significant threat to plant productivity, especially under the backdrop of global warming. Plants have evolved various mechanisms to cope with high temperatures, including the activation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the induction of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). HSPs function as molecular chaperones, preventing protein aggregation and facilitating the refolding of denatured proteins. HSFs, on the other hand, regulate the expression of HSPs and other heat-responsive genes, forming a robust transcriptional network that enhances thermal tolerance. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in heat stress, where the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 activates the UPR to restore ER homeostasis. Despite the significant progress made in understanding temperature sensing in plants, several questions remain unanswered. For instance, the precise molecular mechanisms by which temperature signals are perceived and transduced into cellular responses are still not fully elucidated. Moreover, the interplay between different temperature-responsive pathways and their integration with other environmental cues, such as light and water availability, needs further investigation. Addressing these questions is crucial for developing climate-resilient crops that can withstand the challenges posed by a changing climate. In conclusion, the study of temperature sensing in plants is a rapidly evolving field with important implications for agriculture and ecology. By unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature perception and response, researchers can identify key targets for genetic engineering and breeding programs aimed at enhancing plant resilience to temperature extremes. This knowledge will be instrumental in ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture in the face of global climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Vernalization requires epigenetic silencing of FLC by histone methylation", "authors": "R.
