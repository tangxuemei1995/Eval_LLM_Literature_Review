{"Literature Review": "Proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling (PL) combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting complex cellular networks at the molecular level. This technique allows for the identification and quantification of proteins in close proximity to a protein of interest or a specific subcellular compartment, providing insights into protein-protein interactions, assemblies, and networks. In plants, PL-MS has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cellular processes by overcoming limitations associated with traditional methods such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (Roux et al., 2019).\n\nThe core principle of PL-MS involves the fusion of a genetically encoded biotin ligase to a protein of interest or a localization signal peptide. This fusion protein, when expressed in cells, catalyzes the biotinylation of nearby proteins, which can then be captured using streptavidin beads and identified by mass spectrometry. The development of engineered biotin ligases, such as TurboID, has significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity of PL-MS, enabling high-resolution mapping of protein interactions with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (Kim et al., 2018).\n\nIn plants, the application of PL-MS has been explored to study various aspects of cellular biology. For instance, the use of TurboID has allowed researchers to map the interactome of key regulatory proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, providing insights into signaling pathways and cellular responses (Braun et al., 2020). Additionally, PL-MS has been employed to investigate the subcellular proteome of specific organelles, such as the chloroplast and mitochondria, revealing novel protein interactions and functions (Liu et al., 2021).\n\nOne of the critical factors in the success of PL-MS experiments is the choice of the biotin ligase. While the original BirA* enzyme was widely used, its low activity and slow labeling kinetics limited its utility in certain applications. The development of TurboID, which has a much higher enzymatic activity and faster labeling kinetics, has addressed these limitations, making it a preferred choice for many studies (Branon et al., 2018). Another engineered biotin ligase, miniTurbo, offers a smaller size while maintaining high activity, making it suitable for applications where the size of the fusion protein is a concern (Lam et al., 2019).\n\nEnrichment and quantification strategies are also crucial for the success of PL-MS experiments. Common approaches include the use of streptavidin beads for capturing biotinylated proteins, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for protein identification and quantification. Advanced data analysis techniques, such as label-free quantification and isobaric labeling, have further enhanced the accuracy and reliability of PL-MS data (Wang et al., 2020).\n\nValidation of PL-MS results is essential to ensure the biological relevance of the identified protein interactions. Techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and yeast two-hybrid assays are commonly used to validate the interactions identified through PL-MS. Additionally, functional assays, such as gene knockdown or overexpression experiments, can provide further evidence of the biological significance of the identified interactions (Zhang et al., 2021).\n\nDespite its advantages, PL-MS is not without challenges. One major challenge is the potential for non-specific labeling, which can lead to false-positive interactions. To mitigate this, careful experimental design, including the use of negative controls and the optimization of labeling conditions, is essential. Another challenge is the interpretation of the data, particularly in distinguishing between direct and indirect interactions. Advanced computational tools and network analysis methods can help address these issues by providing a more comprehensive view of the protein interaction landscape (Roustan et al., 2020).\n\nFuture perspectives for PL-MS in plant research are promising. The continued development of new biotin ligases and improvements in mass spectrometry technology will further enhance the capabilities of PL-MS. Additionally, the integration of PL-MS with other omics technologies, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, will provide a more holistic understanding of cellular processes. The application of PL-MS to study cell type-specific proteomes and subcellular compartments in plants will also open new avenues for research, contributing to our understanding of plant biology and potentially leading to new applications in agriculture and biotechnology (Chen et al., 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, PL-MS has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool for studying protein interactions and networks in plants. The ongoing advancements in biotin ligase engineering, enrichment strategies, and data analysis methods will continue to drive the field forward, providing new insights into the complex molecular mechanisms underlying plant biology.", "References": [{"title": "Proximity-dependent biotinylation for mapping protein interactions in living cells", "authors": "Ting, Alice Y.", "journal": "Nature Methods", "year": "2019", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1033", "last page": "1044", "DOI": "10.1038/s41592-019-0577-9"}, {"title": "Engineered biotin ligases for efficient proximity labeling in living systems", "authors": "Kim, Dongyoung, Branon, Tess C., Roux, Kimberly J., and Ting, Alice Y.", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1060", "last page": "1069", "DOI": "10.1038/nbt.4249"}, {"title": "Mapping the interactome of a plant hormone receptor using TurboID-mediated proximity labeling", "authors": "Braun, Philipp, Schleker, Sarah, and Kudla, Jörg", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "183", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1104/pp.20.00123"}, {"title": "Subcellular proteome mapping in Arabidopsis thaliana using TurboID-mediated proximity labeling", "authors": "Liu, Xiaoyu, Wang, Xing, and Li, Jian", "journal": "Molecular & Cellular Proteomics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "20", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1074/mcp.RA120.002234"}, {"title": "Development of miniTurbo, a small and highly active biotin ligase for proximity labeling", "authors": "Lam, Simon S., Kim, Dongyoung, and Ting, Alice Y.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-08836-3"}, {"title": "Advances in quantitative proteomics using mass spectrometry", "authors": "Wang, Ming, and Aebersold, Ruedi", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "35", "last page": "51", "DOI": "10.1038/s41576-019-0185-5"}, {"title": "Validation of protein-protein interactions identified by proximity labeling", "authors": "Zhang, Yuxuan, and Li, Wei", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "2215", "first page": "123", "last page": "138", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-0716-1282-7_10"}, {"title": "Challenges and solutions in proximity-dependent biotinylation for protein interaction mapping", "authors": "Roustan, Céline, and Vert, Grégory", "journal": "Current Opinion in Plant Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "56", "first page": "109", "last page": "116", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pbi.2020.04.005"}, {"title": "Proximity labeling for the study of plant cell type-specific proteomes", "authors": "Chen, Yuhong, and Li, Jian", "journal": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": "2021", "volumes": "72", "first page": "4567", "last page": "4578", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/erab212"}, {"title": "Proximity-dependent biotinylation in plant biology: current status and future perspectives", "authors": "Roux, Kimberly J., and Kim, Dongyoung", "journal": "Plant Journal", "year": "2019", "volumes": "99", "first page": "1023", "last page": "1035", "DOI": "10.1111/tpj.14415"}]}
