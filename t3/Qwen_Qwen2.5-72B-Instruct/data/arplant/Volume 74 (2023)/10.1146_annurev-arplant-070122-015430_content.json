{"Literature Review": "Between-plant signaling is a fascinating and complex phenomenon that involves the exchange of various biomolecules and systemic signals between plants through specialized structures such as haustoria and common mycelial networks (CMNs). This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms and implications of between-plant signaling, focusing on the roles of parasitic plants and mycorrhizal fungi. Parasitic plants, such as those in the genus *Orobanche* and *Striga*, utilize a specialized organ called the haustorium to attach to and penetrate host tissues, forming connections with the host's vascular system (Westwood et al., 2010). These connections allow for the transfer of water, nutrients, and a variety of biomolecules, including secondary metabolites, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), proteins, and systemic signals (Hohnjec et al., 2005). The haustorium acts as a bidirectional conduit, facilitating the movement of these molecules between the parasite and the host, and even among different hosts connected by the same parasite (Westwood et al., 2010). The transfer of mRNAs and ncRNAs is particularly intriguing, as it suggests a potential for gene regulation across species boundaries. Studies have shown that parasitic plants can acquire host mRNAs and ncRNAs, which may play roles in the parasite's development and pathogenicity (Kim et al., 2014). For example, the parasitic plant *Phelipanche aegyptiaca* has been found to express host-derived mRNAs, indicating that these molecules can be functional in the parasite (Kim et al., 2014). Similarly, the transfer of proteins and secondary metabolites can influence the physiology and defense responses of both the host and the parasite (Hohnjec et al., 2005). In addition to parasitic plants, mycorrhizal fungi, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, play a crucial role in between-plant signaling. AM fungi form extensive networks of hyphae, known as common mycelial networks (CMNs), which can connect multiple plants within a community (Bennett et al., 2017). These networks serve as conduits for the transfer of nutrients, water, and systemic signals, enabling plants to communicate and coordinate their responses to environmental stresses (Bennett et al., 2017). One of the most well-documented examples of CMN-mediated signaling is the transfer of stress-related signals. For instance, when a plant is attacked by herbivores or pathogens, it can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other systemic signals that are detected by neighboring plants connected through the CMN (Song et al., 2019). These signals can trigger defensive responses in the connected plants, enhancing their resistance to future attacks (Song et al., 2019). This phenomenon has been observed in various plant species, including maize and tomato, where CMNs have been shown to facilitate the transfer of defense signals and improve plant fitness (Bennett et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019). The ecological implications of between-plant signaling are significant. By facilitating the transfer of resources and signals, haustoria and CMNs can influence plant competition, symbiosis, and community dynamics (Bennett et al., 2017). For example, in resource-limited environments, the ability to share resources through CMNs can enhance the survival and growth of connected plants (Bennett et al., 2017). Conversely, parasitic plants can exploit these connections to extract resources from multiple hosts, potentially altering the competitive balance within plant communities (Westwood et al., 2010). Moreover, between-plant signaling can have broader impacts on ecosystem functioning. The transfer of systemic signals through CMNs can influence the timing and intensity of plant defenses, affecting the interactions between plants and their herbivores and pathogens (Song et al., 2019). Additionally, the movement of nutrients and water through CMNs can affect soil nutrient cycling and water availability, influencing the overall productivity and stability of ecosystems (Bennett et al., 2017). Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of between-plant signaling, several questions remain unanswered. For instance, the specific mechanisms by which biomolecules and signals are transferred through haustoria and CMNs are not fully understood (Hohnjec et al., 2005). Additionally, the extent to which these signaling pathways are conserved across different plant species and ecosystems is still under investigation (Kim et al., 2014). Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular and physiological bases of between-plant signaling and exploring its ecological and evolutionary significance. In conclusion, between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and CMNs represents a critical aspect of plant biology and ecology. The transfer of biomolecules and systemic signals through these structures can have profound effects on plant interactions with other organisms and their adaptation to environmental factors. Understanding the mechanisms and implications of between-plant signaling is essential for developing strategies to enhance plant health and productivity in agricultural and natural settings.", "References": [{"title": "The biology of parasitic plants: A review", "authors": "James H.
