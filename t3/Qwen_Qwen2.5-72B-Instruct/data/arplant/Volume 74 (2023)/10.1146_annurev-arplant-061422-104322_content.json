{"Literature Review": "The global challenge of increasing soil salinity poses a significant threat to agricultural productivity and food security. Salinity affects approximately 20% of irrigated land worldwide, leading to reduced crop yields and economic losses (FAO, 2015). Despite substantial advancements in understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms of salinity tolerance, the practical application of this knowledge to enhance crop resilience has been limited. This literature review aims to synthesize the current state of research on salt-tolerant crops, highlighting key strategies and challenges in their development and deployment. One of the primary approaches to improving salinity tolerance in crops has been the utilization of intraspecific variation. For instance, studies on rice (Oryza sativa) have identified natural genetic variations that confer enhanced salt tolerance. QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying specific genes and alleles responsible for salinity tolerance (Ren et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2010). These findings have facilitated the development of marker-assisted selection (MAS) techniques, which enable breeders to select for salt-tolerant traits more efficiently. However, the effectiveness of MAS is often constrained by the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying salinity tolerance, which involves multiple genes and environmental interactions (Liu et al., 2017). Another strategy involves the introgression of salt-tolerance traits from closely related wild relatives. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) are a valuable genetic resource that can provide novel alleles for improving crop resilience. For example, the introgression of salt-tolerant genes from wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) into cultivated barley has resulted in significant improvements in salinity tolerance (Munns et al., 2012). Similarly, the use of wild relatives in tomato breeding has led to the identification of QTLs associated with salt tolerance, which have been successfully introgressed into commercial varieties (Foolad and Lin, 2001). However, the process of introgression can be challenging due to linkage drag, where undesirable traits are co-introduced along with the desired ones, and the need for extensive backcrossing to recover the elite background (Kilian et al., 2014). In some cases, the introgression of traits from more distant relatives has also been explored. For instance, the transfer of salt-tolerance genes from non-crop species such as Thellungiella halophila, a model halophyte, has shown promise in enhancing the salinity tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana (Zhu, 2001). While this approach holds potential, it is often limited by the difficulty in achieving successful gene transfer and the potential for unintended pleiotropic effects (Zhang et al., 2018). Genetic modification (GM) offers another avenue for developing salt-tolerant crops. Transgenic approaches have been used to introduce specific genes that enhance salinity tolerance, such as those encoding for ion transporters, osmoprotectants, and stress-responsive transcription factors. For example, the overexpression of the AtNHX1 gene, which encodes a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter, has been shown to improve salt tolerance in various crops, including tobacco, rice, and wheat (Apse et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2001). However, the adoption of GM crops remains controversial due to public concerns and regulatory hurdles, which can impede their widespread use (James, 2016). A promising but underutilized technique is the use of grafting to combine the salt-tolerant rootstocks of wild species with the high-yielding scions of cultivated crops. Grafting has been successfully applied in horticultural crops such as tomatoes and cucumbers, where salt-tolerant rootstocks have significantly improved plant performance under saline conditions (Colla et al., 2013). This approach can bypass the challenges associated with genetic introgression and provide immediate benefits to farmers. However, the scalability and cost-effectiveness of grafting for major staple crops remain to be fully evaluated. Neodomestication, the domestication of wild species with inherent salt tolerance, represents a novel and potentially transformative approach to developing salt-tolerant crops. Advances in genomics and biotechnology have made it feasible to domesticate wild species, which can serve as a source of new crop varieties adapted to saline environments. For example, the domestication of wild relatives of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) and amaranth (Amaranthus spp.) has shown promise in producing salt-tolerant grain crops (Jarvis et al., 2017). Neodomestication can also contribute to biodiversity conservation by promoting the cultivation of underutilized species. Despite these advancements, the translation of research into practical solutions remains a significant challenge. One of the main barriers is the lack of prioritization of salinity tolerance in breeding programs. Breeders often focus on traits that directly impact yield and quality, such as disease resistance and drought tolerance, while salinity tolerance is considered a secondary trait. This prioritization reflects the immediate economic incentives for breeders and farmers, who may not perceive the long-term benefits of salinity tolerance (Munns and Tester, 2008). To overcome this barrier, there is a need for a coordinated effort involving researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to raise awareness of the importance of salinity tolerance and to develop incentives for its inclusion in breeding programs. In conclusion, the development of salt-tolerant crops is a multifaceted challenge that requires a combination of genetic, agronomic, and policy interventions. Utilizing intraspecific variation, introgression from wild relatives, genetic modification, grafting, and neodomestication are all viable strategies that can contribute to this goal. However, the success of these approaches depends on overcoming the technical, regulatory, and socio-economic barriers that currently limit their implementation. Closing the gap between research and delivery is essential to ensure that farmers have access to the tools they need to maintain productivity in the face of increasing soil salinity.", "References": [{"title": "A Quantitative Trait Locus for Tolerance of Soil Salinity in Rice", "authors": "Ren, Z.
