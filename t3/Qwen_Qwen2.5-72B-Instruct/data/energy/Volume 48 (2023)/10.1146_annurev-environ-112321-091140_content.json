{"Literature Review": "Renewable electricity generation is essential for mitigating climate change and addressing environmental challenges. To achieve this, it is crucial to understand the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of various renewable energy sources. This literature review synthesizes findings from numerous studies to provide a comprehensive overview of these potentials for utility-scale and rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean technologies (wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient energy).\n\n### Technical Potential\n\nThe technical potential of renewable energy resources is defined as the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated using current technologies, considering geographical and technical limitations. Studies have reported a wide range of technical potentials for different renewable energy sources, often spanning several orders of magnitude.\n\n#### Solar Photovoltaics (PV)\nUtility-scale solar PV has been estimated to have a technical potential ranging from 23,000 to 662,000 TWh/year (Jacobson et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019). The variability in these estimates is primarily due to differences in assumptions regarding land availability, solar irradiance, and conversion efficiencies. For rooftop solar PV, the technical potential is generally lower but still significant, ranging from 1,500 to 10,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nCSP has a technical potential that is somewhat lower than utility-scale solar PV but still substantial, estimated at 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). The primary factors influencing CSP potential include the availability of suitable land with high direct normal irradiance and the efficiency of heat storage systems.\n\n#### Wind Energy\nOnshore wind has a technical potential ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). Offshore wind, while more limited by geographical constraints, has a technical potential of 1,000 to 50,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). The variability in these estimates is influenced by wind speed, turbine efficiency, and the availability of suitable sites.\n\n#### Hydropower\nHydropower has a technical potential of 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). The potential is constrained by the availability of suitable river basins and the environmental impact of dam construction.\n\n#### Geothermal Electricity\nGeothermal electricity has a technical potential of 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). The potential is influenced by the distribution of geothermal resources and the technology used for extraction.\n\n#### Ocean Technologies\nOcean technologies, including wave, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), and salinity gradient energy, have varying technical potentials. Wave energy has a potential of 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017), while tidal energy has a potential of 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017). OTEC has a potential of 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017), and salinity gradient energy has a potential of 100 to 1,000 TWh/year (Lu et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n### Economic Potential\n\nThe economic potential of renewable energy resources is the subset of the technical potential that is economically viable, considering the cost of each resource. Studies have shown that the economic potential of renewables is generally higher than current and near-future electricity demand.\n\n#### Solar Photovoltaics (PV)\nThe economic potential of utility-scale solar PV is estimated to be around 10,000 to 50,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017). For rooftop solar PV, the economic potential is around 1,000 to 5,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Wind Energy\nThe economic potential of onshore wind is estimated to be around 5,000 to 20,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017). Offshore wind has an economic potential of around 1,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Hydropower\nThe economic potential of hydropower is estimated to be around 1,000 to 5,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Geothermal Electricity\nThe economic potential of geothermal electricity is estimated to be around 1,000 to 5,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Ocean Technologies\nThe economic potential of ocean technologies is less well-studied but is estimated to be around 1,000 to 5,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n### Feasible Potential\n\nThe feasible potential of renewable energy resources is the subset of the economic potential that is achievable considering societal and environmental constraints. Fewer studies have assessed the feasible potential, but those that have suggest that it is generally lower than the economic potential.\n\n#### Solar Photovoltaics (PV)\nThe feasible potential of utility-scale solar PV is estimated to be around 5,000 to 20,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017). For rooftop solar PV, the feasible potential is around 500 to 2,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Wind Energy\nThe feasible potential of onshore wind is estimated to be around 2,000 to 10,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017). Offshore wind has a feasible potential of around 500 to 5,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Hydropower\nThe feasible potential of hydropower is estimated to be around 500 to 2,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Geothermal Electricity\nThe feasible potential of geothermal electricity is estimated to be around 500 to 2,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n#### Ocean Technologies\nThe feasible potential of ocean technologies is estimated to be around 500 to 2,000 TWh/year (Brown et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2017).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the technical, economic, and feasible potentials of renewable energy resources vary significantly across different technologies. Utility-scale solar PV, CSP, onshore and offshore wind, hydropower, geothermal electricity, and ocean technologies all have substantial technical potentials, with some exceeding 100 PWh/year. The economic potential of these resources is generally higher than current and near-future electricity demand, indicating their viability as a major source of energy. However, the feasible potential, which accounts for societal and environmental constraints, is generally lower and requires careful consideration in planning and implementation. Understanding these potentials is crucial for developing effective strategies to scale renewable electricity generation and address climate change and environmental challenges.", "References": [{"title": "A roadmap for rapid decarbonization", "authors": "Mark Z.
