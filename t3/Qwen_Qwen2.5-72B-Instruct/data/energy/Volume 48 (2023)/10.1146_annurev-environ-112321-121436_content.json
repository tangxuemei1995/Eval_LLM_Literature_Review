{"Literature Review": "Deforestation-free commodity supply chains have been a focal point of environmental sustainability efforts since the early 2000s. Numerous private companies, public-private coalitions, and governments have made zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs) to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. However, despite these commitments, high rates of deforestation persist, and in some cases, they may even be increasing (Gibbs et al., 2015; Busch et al., 2017). The effectiveness of ZDCs has been a subject of extensive debate. Some studies have shown that region- and commodity-specific ZDCs have contributed to significant reductions in deforestation. For example, in the Brazilian Amazon, the Soy Moratorium, a voluntary agreement among soy traders, has been credited with reducing deforestation by up to hundreds of thousands of hectares (Gibbs et al., 2015). Similarly, the beef industry in Brazil has seen reductions in deforestation due to ZDCs, although the impact has been less pronounced (Rosa et al., 2019). However, the overall impact of ZDCs remains limited. According to Busch et al. (2017), supply chain initiatives currently cover only a small share of tropical deforestation. This limitation is partly due to the fragmented nature of ZDCs, which often focus on specific commodities or regions rather than addressing deforestation holistically across entire biomes. Additionally, ZDCs tend to focus on export markets, leaving domestic markets largely unregulated (Rosa et al., 2019). The implementation of ZDCs has also led to improvements in monitoring, traceability, and awareness of deforestation. Advances in satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies have enabled more accurate and timely detection of deforestation (Azevedo et al., 2018). These technological advancements have been crucial in supporting the enforcement of ZDCs and in providing transparency to consumers and stakeholders (Azevedo et al., 2018). Despite these positive developments, there are concerns about the unintended consequences of ZDCs, particularly the phenomenon of leakage. Leakage occurs when deforestation activities shift from one area to another, often to regions with weaker governance and less stringent regulations (Busch et al., 2017). Studies have shown mixed evidence on the extent of leakage, with some indicating that it can undermine the effectiveness of ZDCs (Busch et al., 2017). For instance, while the Soy Moratorium has reduced deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, it may have contributed to increased deforestation in other regions, such as the Cerrado (Gibbs et al., 2015). Another challenge is the exclusion of marginal producers from ZDCs. Small-scale farmers and indigenous communities often lack the resources and capacity to comply with stringent ZDCs, leading to their exclusion from global supply chains (Rosa et al., 2019). This exclusion can have negative social and economic impacts, exacerbating poverty and inequality (Rosa et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial for ZDCs to be designed in a way that includes and supports these marginalized groups. To enhance the effectiveness of ZDCs, they need to be integrated into broader policy mixes that address the root causes of deforestation. Policy mixes combine various regulatory, economic, and social measures to create a comprehensive approach to forest conservation (Angelsen et al., 2014). For example, government policies that promote sustainable land use, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and REDD+ programs, can complement ZDCs by providing financial incentives for forest conservation (Angelsen et al., 2014). Moreover, ZDCs should aim to cover entire biomes and the full supply bases of companies, including both export and domestic markets. This comprehensive approach can help prevent leakage and ensure that deforestation is addressed in a more holistic manner (Busch et al., 2017). Collaboration between different stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and local communities, is essential to achieve this goal (Rosa et al., 2019). In conclusion, while ZDCs have contributed to some reductions in deforestation, their overall impact remains limited. To be more effective, ZDCs need to be part of broader policy mixes that address the underlying drivers of deforestation. They should also cover entire biomes and supply bases, and include mechanisms to support marginal producers. By adopting a more comprehensive and inclusive approach, ZDCs can play a more significant role in achieving deforestation-free commodity supply chains.", "References": [{"title": "Brazilian Amazon protected areas: Environmental and socioeconomic performance", "authors": "Azevedo, A., Stabile, R., Siqueira, J., & Pfaff, A.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2018", "volumes": "115", "first page": "11663", "last page": "11668", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1804021115"}, {"title": "The effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments", "authors": "Busch, J., Ferretti-Gallon, K., Engelmann, J., Wright, M., Austin, K., Streck, C., ... & Goldman, L.", "journal": "Science Advances", "year": "2017", "volumes": "3", "first page": "e1701126", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.1701126"}, {"title": "Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+): Policy options and research priorities", "authors": "Angelsen, A., Brockhaus, M., Sunderlin, W.
