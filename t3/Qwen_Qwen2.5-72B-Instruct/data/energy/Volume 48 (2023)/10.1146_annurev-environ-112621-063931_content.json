{"Literature Review": "The transition to zero-carbon cities is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable development. However, the pathways to decarbonization must also consider broader societal outcomes, including well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R), collectively referred to as WHER outcomes. This literature review synthesizes existing research to assess the linkages between zero-carbon urban transitions and these co-benefits, highlighting the strengths and gaps in the current evidence base. Health (H) is one of the most extensively studied co-benefits of urban decarbonization. Numerous studies have demonstrated that reducing carbon emissions through measures such as increased public transportation, active travel, and green spaces can lead to significant improvements in public health. For instance, a study by Woodcock et al. (2009) found that promoting cycling and walking in urban areas can reduce the burden of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while also decreasing air pollution levels. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Markandya et al. (2018) concluded that the health benefits of reduced air pollution from decarbonization strategies outweigh the costs of implementation. These findings underscore the strong evidence for the positive health impacts of urban decarbonization. Well-being (W) is a more complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses physical, mental, and social dimensions. While some studies suggest that decarbonization can enhance well-being, the evidence is less robust compared to health. For example, a study by Gascon et al. (2015) found that exposure to green spaces, which are often promoted in decarbonization plans, can improve mental health and reduce stress. However, the relationship between decarbonization and well-being is influenced by various factors, including individual perceptions and social contexts. A review by White et al. (2010) highlighted the need for more comprehensive and context-specific research to fully understand the well-being impacts of urban decarbonization. Social equity (E) is a critical consideration in urban decarbonization, as the benefits and burdens of decarbonization strategies can be distributed unevenly across different population groups. Research has shown that without intentional design, decarbonization efforts can exacerbate existing inequalities. For instance, a study by Anguelovski et al. (2016) found that green gentrification, where the creation of green spaces leads to increased property values and displacement of low-income residents, can undermine the equity goals of decarbonization. To address this, a study by Bullard et al. (2000) emphasized the importance of participatory planning processes that involve marginalized communities in decision-making. These studies highlight the need for equitable urban decarbonization strategies that consider distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects of equity. Climate resilience (R) is another important co-benefit of urban decarbonization, but the evidence is more uncertain and context-dependent. Decarbonization strategies that enhance urban resilience, such as green infrastructure and adaptive water management, can help cities better withstand and recover from climate-related shocks. However, the effectiveness of these strategies varies depending on local conditions and the specific climate risks faced by each city. A study by McPhearson et al. (2016) found that green infrastructure can provide multiple benefits, including flood mitigation and heat island reduction, but the extent of these benefits depends on the design and maintenance of the infrastructure. Another study by Adger et al. (2005) emphasized the importance of social and institutional factors in building resilience, suggesting that decarbonization strategies must be integrated with broader resilience-building efforts. To advance the understanding of the WHER co-benefits of urban decarbonization, a transboundary urban metabolism framework is proposed. This framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, provides a holistic approach to connecting decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. The framework emphasizes the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks. Next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models are required to capture the complex interactions and trade-offs between decarbonization and WHER outcomes. A study by Kennedy et al. (2011) demonstrated the potential of urban metabolism models to inform sustainable urban planning, while a review by Seto et al. (2016) highlighted the importance of integrating social and environmental data in urban modeling. In conclusion, the evidence for co-beneficial decarbonization is strong for health, limited for well-being, uncertain for resilience, and requires intentional design to advance equity. Future research should focus on filling the knowledge gaps identified in this review, particularly in the areas of well-being, equity, and resilience. The development of a new urban nexus science, combining fine-scale data and advanced modeling techniques, will be crucial for enabling zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits.", "References": [{"title": "Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: transport", "authors": "Woodcock, J., Edwards, P., Tonne, C., Armstrong, B.
