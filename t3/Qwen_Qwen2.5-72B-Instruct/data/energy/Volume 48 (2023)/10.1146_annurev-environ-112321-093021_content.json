{"Literature Review": "Urban overheating, often referred to as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, is a critical issue exacerbated by global climate change. This phenomenon is characterized by higher temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings, primarily due to the concentration of heat-absorbing surfaces such as asphalt, concrete, and buildings. The magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating have been extensively studied, revealing significant variations across different cities and regions. For instance, studies in Tokyo have shown that urban areas can be up to 12°C warmer than surrounding rural areas during the night. The impact of urban overheating extends beyond thermal discomfort, affecting various aspects of urban life. One of the most immediate and severe impacts is on public health, particularly heat-related mortality and morbidity. Research has consistently shown that higher urban temperatures are associated with increased rates of heat-related illnesses and deaths, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. Beyond health, urban overheating also affects the energy supply and demand for buildings. Higher temperatures increase the demand for cooling, leading to higher energy consumption and, consequently, increased greenhouse gas emissions. The economic implications of urban overheating are also significant. Higher temperatures can reduce human productivity, particularly in outdoor and industrial settings. Environmental quality is another area impacted by urban overheating. Higher temperatures can lead to increased air pollution, as higher temperatures accelerate the formation of ground-level ozone and other pollutants. To mitigate the effects of urban overheating, several strategies have been developed and implemented. Innovative materials, such as cool roofs and pavements, reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat, thereby reducing surface temperatures. Advanced urban greenery, including green roofs and vertical gardens, provides shading and evapotranspiration, which can significantly lower ambient temperatures. Heat dissipation techniques, such as the use of fans and ventilation systems, can also help to reduce indoor temperatures. Evaporative cooling, which involves the use of water to cool the air, is another effective method. While these mitigation strategies have shown promise, their effectiveness can vary depending on local conditions and implementation. Adaptation measures are equally important, particularly for low-income populations who may lack the resources to implement mitigation strategies. Despite the progress made in understanding and addressing urban overheating, several challenges remain. Future research should focus on these areas to provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban overheating and to develop effective strategies to mitigate its impact on human life.", "References": [{"title": "The Urban Heat Island", "authors": "T.
