{"Literature Review": "Soils play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both stores and sinks for carbon. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a vital component of soil health, influencing plant growth, water retention, and nutrient cycling. Despite its importance, the dynamics of SOC are complex and influenced by various biophysical and socioeconomic factors. This literature review explores the expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of SOC transitions, drawing on a range of studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge. The geographic distribution of SOC is influenced by climate, soil type, land cover, and profile depth. Climate plays a significant role in determining the amount of SOC stored in soils. For instance, cooler climates generally favor higher SOC levels due to slower decomposition rates. Soil type also affects SOC storage, with clay-rich soils typically having higher SOC content due to their ability to protect organic matter from microbial degradation. Land cover and management practices further modulate SOC levels, with forests and grasslands generally storing more carbon than agricultural lands. Models such as the Century and Millennial models have been instrumental in simulating SOC dynamics. The Century model, developed by Parton et al., is a widely used tool for predicting SOC changes under different land use and management scenarios. It incorporates processes such as litter decomposition, root turnover, and microbial activity to estimate SOC stocks over time. The Millennial model, an extension of the Century model, includes additional processes and longer time horizons, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding SOC transitions. Land use change is a primary driver of SOC transitions. Conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural land often leads to a decline in SOC due to increased decomposition and reduced inputs of organic matter. Conversely, the adoption of conservation practices such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and organic amendments can enhance SOC sequestration. These practices reduce soil disturbance, increase organic matter inputs, and promote soil aggregation, which helps protect SOC from decomposition. The effectiveness of SOC sequestration strategies is a subject of ongoing debate. While many studies have demonstrated the potential for increasing SOC through improved land management, the actual impact can vary widely depending on local conditions and implementation practices. For example, the rate of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils is influenced by factors such as soil texture, climate, and the specific management practices employed. Additionally, the long-term sustainability of SOC gains is uncertain, as some studies suggest that the benefits of certain practices may diminish over time. Climate policy has increasingly recognized the importance of SOC in mitigating climate change. The Paris Agreement, for instance, emphasizes the need to enhance carbon sinks and reservoirs, including soils. However, the integration of SOC into national carbon accounting systems remains challenging. Accurate measurement and monitoring of SOC are essential for verifying the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, but these tasks are complicated by the spatial and temporal variability of SOC. Socioeconomic factors also play a critical role in SOC transitions. Land use decisions are influenced by economic incentives, policy frameworks, and social norms. For example, government subsidies for conservation practices can encourage farmers to adopt SOC-enhancing management techniques. However, the success of such policies depends on the willingness and capacity of land users to implement these practices, which can be constrained by factors such as financial resources, technical knowledge, and market conditions. The transition to higher SOC levels requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both biophysical and socioeconomic challenges. At the plot scale, practices such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and organic amendments can effectively increase SOC. At the landscape scale, integrated land use planning and ecosystem management are necessary to optimize SOC sequestration while maintaining other ecosystem services. Collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and land users is essential for developing and implementing effective SOC management strategies. In conclusion, soils are a critical component of the global carbon cycle, and understanding the dynamics of SOC is essential for addressing climate change. While the potential for SOC sequestration through improved land management is promising, the effectiveness of these strategies varies widely and is influenced by a range of biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Future research should focus on refining models, improving measurement and monitoring techniques, and developing policies that align with the needs and capabilities of land users. By addressing these challenges, we can better manage SOC transitions and contribute to global climate goals.", "References": [{"title": "What Controls Soil Organic Carbon?", "authors": "Eduardo G.
