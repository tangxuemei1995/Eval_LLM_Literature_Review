{"Literature Review": "Coastal regions are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their unique geographical and environmental characteristics. The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-induced hazards, such as sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events, pose significant risks to coastal critical infrastructure (CCI) systems. These systems, which include transportation networks, energy facilities, water supply systems, and communication networks, are essential for the functioning of modern societies and economies. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of these systems exacerbate the potential for cascading failures, leading to widespread and prolonged disruptions (Hallegatte et al., 2013).\n\nThe global significance of coastal areas cannot be overstated. Approximately 90% of all coastal areas will be affected by climate change to varying degrees (Nicholls & Cazenave, 2010). Nearly half of the world's major cities are located within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, with a steep rise over the years (Small & Nicholls, 2003). This rapid urbanization and population growth have led to the expansion of CCI, increasing the exposure and vulnerability of these systems to climate-induced hazards.\n\nSea level rise is one of the most significant threats to CCI. Projections indicate that global mean sea levels could rise by 0.26 to 0.77 meters by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario (IPCC, 2019). This rise can lead to chronic flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion, affecting the structural integrity and operational capacity of CCI. For example, coastal airports, which are often built on low-lying land, are particularly susceptible to flooding and storm surges (Wong et al., 2014). Similarly, energy infrastructure, such as power plants and substations, can be severely impacted by rising sea levels, leading to power outages and economic losses (EPA, 2016).\n\nStorm surges and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, further compound the risks to CCI. These events can cause immediate and severe damage to infrastructure, disrupt services, and trigger cascading failures. For instance, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused extensive damage to the New York City subway system, leading to prolonged service disruptions and significant economic costs (Blake et al., 2013). The interconnectedness of CCI systems means that failures in one sector can have far-reaching consequences across multiple sectors, amplifying the overall impact of the event (Rinaldi et al., 2001).\n\nThe resilience of CCI systems is crucial for mitigating the risks associated with climate change. Resilience involves the ability of a system to predict, prepare for, and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Building climate-resilient infrastructure requires a multi-faceted approach that includes robust planning, design, implementation, and operation. This approach should incorporate advanced modeling and simulation techniques to assess the vulnerabilities of CCI systems and identify potential failure points (Kwakkel et al., 2015).\n\nAdaptation strategies for CCI can be categorized into structural and non-structural measures. Structural measures involve physical modifications to infrastructure, such as elevating critical facilities, reinforcing structures, and constructing protective barriers. Non-structural measures include policy and regulatory frameworks, emergency response plans, and community engagement initiatives. Both types of measures are essential for enhancing the resilience of CCI systems (Aerts et al., 2018).\n\nHowever, the implementation of adaptation strategies faces several challenges. These include financial constraints, lack of political will, and limited public awareness of the risks posed by climate change. Additionally, the complexity and uncertainty associated with climate projections make it difficult to develop effective long-term adaptation plans (Brown et al., 2011). Despite these challenges, there are successful examples of climate-resilient infrastructure projects that can serve as models for future efforts. For instance, the Thames Barrier in London has been effective in protecting the city from tidal surges and flooding (Penning-Rowsell et al., 2006).\n\nIn conclusion, the risks to CCI from climate change are multifaceted and require a comprehensive and integrated approach to address. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of CCI systems necessitate a systems-level understanding of vulnerabilities and the development of adaptive strategies that enhance resilience. Future research should focus on improving the accuracy of climate projections, developing cost-effective adaptation measures, and promoting public and private sector collaboration to build climate-resilient infrastructure.", "References": [{"title": "Global and European Union vulnerability to climate change: An integrated assessment", "authors": "Hallegatte, S., Green, C., Nicholls, R.
