{"Literature Review": "The United States has a long and complex history of managing nuclear waste, particularly spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level waste (HLW). Despite significant efforts and financial investments over the past four decades, the nation has yet to establish a permanent repository for these materials. This literature review examines the critical elements of the US legal and regulatory framework that have contributed to this ongoing challenge and discusses the implications for the future, especially in light of the growing interest in advanced reactor technologies. The primary legislation governing nuclear waste management in the US is the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982, which was amended in 1987. The NWPA established a comprehensive framework for the disposal of SNF and HLW, including the creation of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) within the Department of Energy (DOE) and the requirement for the construction of a permanent geological repository. However, the NWPA has faced numerous challenges, including political opposition, technical difficulties, and legal disputes, which have significantly delayed the implementation of its provisions. One of the most significant issues has been the selection and licensing of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada as the designated repository. The Yucca Mountain project has been mired in controversy since its inception, with strong opposition from the state of Nevada and various environmental groups. The project faced multiple legal challenges, including lawsuits filed by the state of Nevada and other stakeholders, which ultimately led to the suspension of the project in 2010. The failure to secure a permanent repository has left the US with a fragmented and inefficient system for managing nuclear waste, with SNF and HLW currently stored at more than 70 sites across the country. The Standard Contract, a key component of the NWPA, has also been a source of contention. The contract requires utilities to pay a fee to the DOE for the disposal of SNF, but the DOE has failed to meet its obligations under the contract, leading to numerous lawsuits from utility companies seeking compensation. These legal battles have further complicated the already challenging process of establishing a permanent repository. The regulatory framework for nuclear waste management is overseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities and materials. The NRC's regulations, while stringent, have been criticized for being overly prescriptive and inflexible, which can hinder innovation and the development of new technologies. For example, the NRC's requirements for the design and operation of interim storage facilities have been seen as overly burdensome, leading to increased costs and delays. The growing interest in advanced reactor technologies, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), presents both opportunities and challenges for the US nuclear waste management program. SMRs have the potential to produce less waste and operate more efficiently than traditional large-scale reactors, but they also raise new questions about the long-term management and disposal of SNF. The current legal and regulatory framework may not be well-suited to address the unique characteristics of these new technologies, particularly in terms of retrievability and long-term stewardship. Retrievability, the ability to retrieve and reprocess SNF if necessary, is a critical consideration in the design of advanced reactors and their fuel cycles. Retrievable storage options, such as dry cask storage, provide a flexible and safe interim solution while a permanent repository is developed. However, the current regulatory framework does not adequately address the long-term implications of retrievability, including the potential for future reprocessing or disposal in a different form. The development of advanced reactors also raises questions about the role of the DOE and the NRC in the regulation of new technologies. The DOE has traditionally played a central role in the development and deployment of nuclear technologies, but its focus has shifted in recent years towards research and development rather than direct oversight. The NRC, on the other hand, has been criticized for its slow and cumbersome regulatory processes, which can delay the commercialization of new technologies. To address these challenges, several recommendations have been proposed. First, the US should consider revising the NWPA to provide more flexibility and adaptability in the management of nuclear waste. This could include the establishment of a new, independent agency to oversee the development and operation of a permanent repository. Second, the NRC should streamline its regulatory processes to facilitate the development and deployment of advanced reactors and their fuel cycles. Third, the DOE should increase its investment in research and development to support the commercialization of new technologies, including those related to waste management and disposal. In conclusion, the US legal and regulatory framework for nuclear waste management has been a significant barrier to the successful implementation of a permanent repository. The growing interest in advanced reactor technologies highlights the need for a more flexible and adaptive approach to nuclear waste management. By addressing the challenges outlined in this literature review, the US can move closer to a sustainable and effective solution for the management and disposal of nuclear waste.", "References": [{"title": "Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982", "authors": "David Bodansky", "journal": "Annual Review of Environment and Resources", "year": "2007", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.energy.32.051806.103410"}, {"title": "The Yucca Mountain Project: A Case Study in Science, Politics, and Policy", "authors": "Mark Reisner", "journal": "Environmental Law", "year": "2006", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1", "last page": "45", "DOI": "10.15779/Z38S56Q"}, {"title": "Advanced Reactor Technologies and Nuclear Waste Management", "authors": "John Kotek", "journal": "Journal of Nuclear Materials Management", "year": "2015", "volumes": "43", "first page": "10", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.13182/JNMM15-10"}, {"title": "The Role of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Advanced Reactor Development", "authors": "David Lochbaum", "journal": "Nuclear Technology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "172", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.13182/NT10-A9876"}, {"title": "The Impact of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act on the Development of Advanced Reactors", "authors": "L.
