{"Literature Review": "Buildings play a pivotal role in human activities and well-being, providing essential services such as shelter, comfort, and safety. However, they are also significant contributors to energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for approximately 36% of global final energy consumption and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions (IEA, 2020). Achieving low energy demand (LED) levels in buildings is crucial for meeting climate and sustainability targets. Building sector models have emerged as essential tools for decision-makers to develop and evaluate strategies aimed at reducing energy demand and GHG emissions. However, these models often fall short in accurately representing the complex transformations required to achieve LED futures. This literature review examines the current state of building sector models and identifies key areas for improvement, focusing on socio-behavioral, infrastructural, and technological interventions, as well as the impact of megatrends such as digitalization, the sharing economy, and the circular economy, and the importance of decent living standards.", "References": [{"title": "Energy Efficiency and Human Behavior: A Framework for Understanding and Changing Consumer Choices", "authors": "Sovacool, B.
