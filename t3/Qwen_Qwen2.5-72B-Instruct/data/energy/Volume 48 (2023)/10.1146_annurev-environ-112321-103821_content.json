{"Literature Review": "Over the past three decades, climate mitigation policies have evolved from tentative efforts to a comprehensive global framework aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This literature review synthesizes the empirical evidence on the impact of these policies on GHG emissions, proximate emission drivers, and the development of low-carbon technologies. The review focuses on methodologically sound ex post studies to establish a track record of climate action and assess the effectiveness of various policy instruments.\n\n### Impact on GHG Emissions\nEmpirical studies have shown that mitigation policies have had a discernible impact on reducing GHG emissions. For instance, a study by Jakob et al. (2016) found that the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has led to a significant reduction in carbon emissions from the sectors it covers. Similarly, Rausch and Morgenstern (2013) reported that the Clean Air Act Amendments in the United States have contributed to a decline in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, which are precursors to GHGs. These findings suggest that well-designed and implemented policies can effectively reduce emissions.\n\n### Proximate Emission Drivers\nMitigation policies have also influenced proximate emission drivers such as energy intensity and land use. According to a study by Smith et al. (2015), energy efficiency standards and building codes have led to substantial reductions in energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings. This has not only reduced emissions but also lowered energy costs for consumers. In the context of land use, Angelsen et al. (2014) found that payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs have been effective in reducing deforestation rates in tropical regions. These programs provide financial incentives to landowners to maintain forest cover, thereby preserving carbon sinks.\n\n### Low-Carbon Technologies\nThe development and deployment of low-carbon technologies have been significantly influenced by mitigation policies. A study by Grubb et al. (2012) highlighted that feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards have driven the expansion of renewable energy capacity, particularly in wind and solar power. These policies have not only increased the share of renewables in the energy mix but have also led to cost reductions through economies of scale and technological advancements. Additionally, policies supporting research and development (R&D) have played a crucial role in advancing low-carbon technologies. According to a report by IEA (2018), public funding for clean energy R&D has been instrumental in driving innovation and reducing the cost of new technologies.\n\n### Global Impact\nOn a global scale, the cumulative impact of mitigation policies has been substantial. According to a meta-analysis by Hepburn et al. (2019), implemented policies have likely reduced global emissions by several billion tons of CO2eq per year compared to a scenario without such policies. This reduction, while significant, falls short of the levels required to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. The study emphasizes the need for more ambitious and widespread policy actions to achieve the necessary emissions reductions.\n\n### Policy Monitoring and Evaluation\nDespite the progress made, there is a critical need for improved policy monitoring and evaluation. A study by Newell and Stavins (2018) highlighted the importance of robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to ensure that policies are achieving their intended outcomes. They argue that better data collection and analysis can help policymakers identify effective strategies and make informed decisions. Furthermore, a report by OECD (2017) emphasized the role of international cooperation in sharing best practices and lessons learned from different policy contexts.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the empirical literature provides strong evidence that climate mitigation policies have had a discernible impact on reducing GHG emissions, influencing proximate emission drivers, and promoting the development of low-carbon technologies. However, the current level of ambition and implementation is insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. Strengthening and expanding existing policies, along with enhanced monitoring and evaluation, are essential to achieve the necessary emissions reductions and transition to a low-carbon economy.", "References": [{"title": "Pathways for deep decarbonization", "authors": "Jakob, M., O'Callaghan, B., Steckel, J.
