{"Literature Review": "The transition to green technologies is a critical component of global efforts to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable development. However, this transition also presents significant challenges related to environmental justice, particularly in terms of equitable access to these technologies. This literature review explores the implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on disparities in access, the potential for exacerbating inequalities, and the need for integrated policy design and data-driven approaches to ensure a just transition.\n\nOne of the primary concerns in the energy transition is the uneven distribution of green technologies across different regions and demographic groups. Studies have shown that low-income communities and marginalized populations often face barriers to accessing renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. These barriers can include financial constraints, lack of information, and inadequate infrastructure. For instance, some areas lack the necessary grid infrastructure to support solar or wind energy installations, thereby perpetuating energy poverty. Similarly, some households may not have the upfront capital to invest in energy-efficient appliances, leading to higher energy bills and increased financial stress.\n\nThe energy transition also has the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities if not carefully managed. One key issue is the cost burden associated with maintaining legacy infrastructure. As more affluent communities adopt advanced technologies, less privileged groups may be left to bear the costs of outdated systems. This can lead to a regressive distribution of costs, where the most vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected. Additionally, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and other clean transportation options may widen the gap between those who can afford these technologies and those who cannot. While EVs offer significant environmental benefits, they are currently more expensive than conventional vehicles, making them inaccessible to many low-income households.\n\nTo address these challenges, integrated policy design is essential. The energy transition will create new interdependencies between sectors, such as buildings, the power sector, and transportation. Emphasizing the need for coordinated policies that consider the interactions between these sectors to ensure a holistic approach to sustainability. For example, integrating building energy efficiency measures with smart grid technologies can optimize energy use and reduce overall costs. Similarly, promoting public transportation and shared mobility options can provide equitable access to mobility without replicating the inefficiencies of individual car ownership.\n\nBroadening access to enabling technologies is another crucial aspect of ensuring a just transition. The adoption of green technologies often depends on the availability of supporting infrastructure, such as the Internet and payment systems. Highlighting how digital connectivity can facilitate the deployment of smart energy systems and enable remote monitoring and control of energy consumption. However, digital divides can hinder the adoption of these technologies, particularly in underserved communities. Therefore, policymakers must prioritize investments in digital infrastructure to ensure that all populations can benefit from the energy transition.\n\nData at higher resolutions and with broader coverage are essential for designing and evaluating equitable technology deployment strategies. High-resolution data can help identify specific areas and populations that are most in need of support. Advocating for the use of granular data to inform targeted interventions that address local needs and conditions. For example, detailed energy usage data can help identify households that could benefit most from energy efficiency upgrades. Moreover, data-driven approaches can help monitor the effectiveness of policies and adjust them as needed to ensure they are achieving their intended outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition to green technologies holds great promise for addressing environmental challenges, but it also poses significant risks to environmental justice. To ensure a just transition, policymakers must address disparities in access, manage the cost burden of legacy infrastructure, promote integrated policy design, broaden access to enabling technologies, and leverage high-resolution data. By taking a comprehensive and inclusive approach, it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable future.", "References": [{"title": "Energy Access and Poverty: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Baker, J., Sovacool, B.
