{"Literature Review": "Energy equity and justice have emerged as critical considerations in the global discourse on sustainable development and environmental policy. The integration of these principles into decision-making processes requires robust and reliable metrics that can effectively capture the multifaceted dimensions of energy justice. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on energy equity metrics, highlighting their definitions, applications, and limitations. Energy justice is a multidimensional concept that encompasses distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. Distributive justice focuses on the fair distribution of energy resources and benefits, ensuring that all individuals and communities have access to affordable and reliable energy services. Procedural justice emphasizes the importance of inclusive and transparent decision-making processes, where stakeholders have equal opportunities to participate and influence outcomes. Recognition justice addresses the need to acknowledge and respect the diverse cultural, social, and economic contexts of different communities, ensuring that their unique needs and perspectives are considered. To operationalize these principles, researchers and policymakers have developed a variety of metrics to assess energy equity. These metrics can be broadly categorized into several key areas: vulnerability, wealth creation, energy poverty, life cycle, and comparative country-level dynamics. Vulnerability metrics aim to identify and quantify the susceptibility of specific populations to energy-related risks and challenges. Wealth creation metrics focus on the economic benefits and opportunities generated by energy systems. Energy poverty metrics are designed to measure the extent to which households lack access to adequate and affordable energy services. Life cycle metrics consider the environmental and social impacts of energy systems throughout their entire lifecycle. Comparative country-level metrics allow for the evaluation of energy equity across different nations and regions. Despite the availability of these metrics, several limitations and gaps remain in the literature. One major challenge is the lack of standardization and consistency in the definitions and methodologies used to measure energy equity. Another limitation is the limited data availability and quality, particularly in developing countries and marginalized communities. In conclusion, the development and application of energy equity metrics are essential for promoting just and sustainable energy transitions.", "References": [{"title": "Energy justice: A conceptual review", "authors": "Jenkins, K., McCauley, D., Heffron, R., Stephan, H., and Rehman, I.", "journal": "Energy Research & Social Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "11", "first page": "174", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2015.12.013"}, {"title": "What is energy justice?
