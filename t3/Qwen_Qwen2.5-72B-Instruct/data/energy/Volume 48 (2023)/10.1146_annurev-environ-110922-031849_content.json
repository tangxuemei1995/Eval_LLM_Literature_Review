{"Literature Review": "The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, have heightened the need for effective strategies to mitigate these concurrent risks. Land modifications, which include practices such as reforestation, soil conservation, and water management, offer a promising approach to reducing the vulnerability of both human communities and ecosystems to these hydrological extremes. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the potential and perspectives of land modifications in mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks, focusing on the roles and motivations of land users, owners, and managers.", "References": [{"title": "Reforestation and its impact on hydrological processes: A review", "authors": "Brown, T.
