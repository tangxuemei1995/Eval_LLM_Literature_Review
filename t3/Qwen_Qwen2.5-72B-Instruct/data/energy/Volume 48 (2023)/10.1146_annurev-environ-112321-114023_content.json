{"Literature Review": "The global initiative known as 30×30 aims to protect at least 30% of the Earth's land and sea by 2030, marking a significant milestone in conservation efforts. However, this ambitious goal coincides with the ongoing and accelerating impacts of climate change, which are reshaping ecosystems and driving species to migrate in search of suitable habitats. This literature review examines the historical context and future directions of Climate Change–Integrated Conservation Strategies (CCICS), focusing on the evolution of these strategies over the past two decades and the challenges that lie ahead. The concept of integrating climate change into conservation strategies gained traction in the early 2000s with seminal works by Thomas et al. (2004) and Hannah et al. (2002). These studies highlighted the urgent need to consider climate change in conservation planning, particularly in light of the estimated extinction risks posed by rising temperatures. Thomas et al. (2004) provided the first comprehensive assessment of extinction risks due to climate change, estimating that 15-37% of species could be committed to extinction by 2050 if current trends continue. This alarming projection underscored the necessity of developing adaptive management strategies to mitigate these risks. Subsequent research has expanded on these initial findings, introducing key concepts such as the velocity of climate change and assisted migration. The velocity of climate change, as defined by Loarie et al. (2009), refers to the rate and direction at which climate conditions shift across the landscape. This concept has become crucial for understanding the spatial dynamics of species migration and for designing conservation corridors that facilitate movement. Assisted migration, proposed by McLachlan et al. (2007), involves the deliberate relocation of species to more favorable habitats, a controversial but increasingly considered strategy to prevent extinctions. Regional modeling of biodiversity change has also advanced significantly, providing valuable insights into the potential impacts of climate change on different ecosystems. For instance, Thuiller et al. (2005) used bioclimatic envelope models to predict shifts in species distributions under various climate scenarios. These models have informed the expansion of protected areas and the development of systematic conservation planning frameworks that account for future climate conditions. Systematic conservation planning, as outlined by Margules and Pressey (2000), emphasizes the need for a strategic and science-based approach to selecting and managing protected areas, ensuring that they remain effective under changing environmental conditions. Despite these advancements, several gaps remain in the implementation of CCICS. One critical area is the regional coordination of conservation efforts. While individual countries and organizations have made strides in incorporating climate change into their conservation plans, there is a lack of consistent and coordinated action across regions. This gap is particularly evident in transboundary conservation initiatives, where the movement of species across political boundaries necessitates collaborative management. A study by Hulme (2009) emphasized the importance of international cooperation in addressing the global nature of climate change impacts. Regional coordination can enhance the effectiveness of conservation efforts by ensuring that species on the move are managed consistently across their range, reducing the risk of fragmentation and isolation. Another challenge is the need to manage the double transition of warming and cooling. As the world struggles to meet the Paris Agreement targets, it is likely that global temperatures will exceed the 1.5°C threshold before stabilizing or even cooling back down. This double transition poses unique challenges for species and ecosystems, requiring adaptive management strategies that can respond to both warming and cooling phases. A study by Diffenbaugh et al. (2017) highlighted the importance of resilience and flexibility in conservation planning to cope with the uncertainties of future climate scenarios. In conclusion, the integration of climate change into conservation strategies has come a long way since the early 2000s, with significant progress in understanding the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and developing adaptive management tools. However, the 30×30 initiative presents a new set of challenges that require innovative solutions and enhanced regional coordination. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for ensuring the long-term success of conservation efforts in the face of a rapidly changing climate.", "References": [{"title": "Extinction risk from climate change", "authors": "Chris D.
