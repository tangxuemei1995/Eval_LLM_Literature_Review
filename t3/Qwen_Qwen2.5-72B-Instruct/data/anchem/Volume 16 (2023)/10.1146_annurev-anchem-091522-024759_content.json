{"Literature Review": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose significant challenges to public health, particularly in resource-limited settings where they are most prevalent. These diseases, caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths, thrive in tropical and subtropical regions characterized by poor sanitation, limited access to clean water, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. The rapid spread of NTDs in these areas exacerbates their impact, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods for NTDs often require sophisticated laboratory equipment and skilled personnel, which are scarce in many affected regions. Consequently, there is a pressing need for low-cost, portable, and user-friendly diagnostic tools that can be deployed at the point of care (POC).\n\nMicrofluidic systems have emerged as a promising solution to this challenge. These miniaturized devices integrate multiple laboratory functions on a single chip, enabling the manipulation and analysis of small volumes of fluids. The advantages of microfluidic systems include reduced sample and reagent consumption, faster processing times, and the potential for automation and multiplexing. These features make microfluidic devices particularly suitable for POC diagnostics in resource-limited settings.\n\nOne of the most widely used microfluidic technologies for NTD detection is paper-based microfluidics. Paper-based devices, such as lateral flow assays (LFAs), are simple, cost-effective, and easy to use, making them ideal for POC applications. LFAs typically consist of a nitrocellulose membrane that captures target analytes through specific binding interactions, followed by a colorimetric readout. For example, a paper-based LFA has been developed for the detection of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm responsible for schistosomiasis. This device uses a sandwich immunoassay format to detect circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine samples, providing results within 20 minutes.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are another common microfluidic technique used for NTD detection. ELISAs are highly sensitive and specific, but traditional ELISA formats are often too complex and time-consuming for POC use. Microfluidic ELISAs, however, offer a streamlined approach by integrating sample preparation, reaction, and detection steps on a single chip. A microfluidic ELISA has been developed for the detection of dengue virus antibodies, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional ELISAs. This device uses a microchannel network to facilitate rapid and efficient mixing of reagents, reducing the overall assay time.\n\nImmunochromatographic tests (ICTs) are similar to LFAs but often incorporate additional features to enhance performance. For instance, a microfluidic ICT has been developed for the detection of Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. This device uses a combination of magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles to capture and amplify the signal, achieving a detection limit of 1 pg/mL of parasite-specific antigens. The integration of magnetic beads allows for efficient sample concentration and purification, improving the sensitivity and reliability of the test.\n\nIn addition to paper-based and microfluidic ELISA technologies, digital microfluidics (DMF) has gained attention for its ability to manipulate discrete droplets of fluid using electric fields. DMF platforms offer high flexibility and programmability, enabling the execution of complex multi-step assays with minimal user intervention. A DMF system has been developed for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. This system integrates sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and real-time PCR amplification, providing a complete diagnostic workflow from sample to result. The compact and portable nature of DMF devices makes them well-suited for use in remote and resource-limited settings.\n\nDespite the significant progress made in the development of microfluidic systems for NTD detection, several challenges remain. One major issue is the need for robust and reliable sample preparation methods that can handle a wide range of sample types, including blood, urine, and saliva. Sample preparation is crucial for removing interfering substances and concentrating target analytes, but it often requires complex and time-consuming procedures. Recent advances in microfluidic sample preparation techniques, such as microfiltration and magnetic separation, have shown promise in addressing this challenge.\n\nAnother challenge is the integration of microfluidic devices with data analysis and communication systems. While microfluidic devices can provide rapid and accurate diagnostic results, the ability to transmit and interpret these results in real-time is essential for effective disease management. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as smartphones and wireless sensors, offer a potential solution by enabling the seamless integration of microfluidic devices with cloud-based data storage and analysis platforms. This integration can facilitate the monitoring of disease outbreaks and the tracking of patient outcomes, ultimately improving public health interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, microfluidic systems represent a transformative technology for the detection of NTDs in resource-limited settings. These devices offer a range of advantages, including portability, affordability, and ease of use, making them well-suited for POC applications. However, further research is needed to address the remaining challenges in sample preparation and data integration. By overcoming these obstacles, microfluidic systems have the potential to significantly improve the diagnosis and treatment of NTDs, ultimately contributing to the global effort to control and eliminate these diseases.", "References": [{"title": "A Handheld Centrifugal Microfluidic Platform for Rapid and Quantitative Detection of Dengue Virus Antibodies", "authors": "Choi, J.
