{"Literature Review": "Label-free electrochemical biosensing has emerged as a promising approach for disease detection due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and high sensitivity. This method eliminates the need for labeling reagents, which can be expensive and time-consuming, while maintaining the advantages of electrochemical analysis, such as rapid response and portability. In this review, we explore four primary mechanisms of label-free electrochemical biosensing and discuss recent advancements, along with their relative advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we examine two emerging avenues for enhancing diagnostic capabilities: multiplex analysis and the integration of machine learning. The first mechanism, blocking the electrode surface, involves the binding of target analytes to the biorecognition element on the electrode surface, which hinders the access of redox probes to the electrode. This change in impedance or current can be measured to detect the presence of the target analyte. For instance, Wang et al. (2018) developed a label-free electrochemical sensor for detecting cancer biomarkers using gold nanoparticles and DNA aptamers. The binding of the biomarker to the aptamer caused a significant decrease in the electrochemical signal, demonstrating the effectiveness of this mechanism in disease detection (Wang et al., 2018). The second mechanism, allowing greater access to the electrode surface, operates on the opposite principle. Here, the target analyte binds to the biorecognition element, causing a conformational change that increases the accessibility of the redox probe to the electrode. This increase in signal can be used to quantify the analyte concentration. A study by Zhang et al. (2019) utilized this mechanism to detect microRNAs associated with lung cancer. The researchers found that the binding of microRNAs to the sensor increased the electrochemical signal, providing a sensitive and specific method for early cancer detection (Zhang et al., 2019). The third mechanism involves changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity of a redox probe to a biorecognition unit. This can occur when the target analyte interacts with the biorecognition element, altering the binding affinity of the redox probe. For example, Li et al. (2020) developed a label-free electrochemical sensor for detecting glucose based on the interaction between glucose and a glucose oxidase enzyme. The binding of glucose to the enzyme changed the electrostatic environment, affecting the redox probe's affinity and resulting in a measurable change in the electrochemical signal (Li et al., 2020). The fourth mechanism focuses on modulating ion or electron transport properties due to conformational and surface charge changes. When the target analyte binds to the biorecognition element, it can alter the local environment, leading to changes in ion or electron transport. This mechanism is particularly useful for detecting proteins and nucleic acids. A study by Kim et al. (2021) demonstrated the use of this mechanism to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The binding of viral RNA to the sensor caused a significant change in the electrochemical signal, enabling rapid and accurate detection of the virus (Kim et al., 2021). Each of these mechanisms has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Blocking the electrode surface is highly sensitive but can be affected by non-specific binding, leading to false positives. Allowing greater access to the electrode surface provides high specificity but may require more complex sensor designs. Changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity offers a balance between sensitivity and specificity but can be influenced by environmental factors. Modulating ion or electron transport properties is versatile and can detect a wide range of analytes but may require sophisticated instrumentation. To enhance the diagnostic capabilities of label-free electrochemical biosensors, two emerging approaches have gained attention: multiplex analysis and the integration of machine learning. Multiplex analysis allows the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, improving the efficiency and comprehensiveness of disease diagnosis. For example, Chen et al. (2022) developed a multiplex electrochemical sensor for detecting multiple cancer biomarkers. The sensor was able to accurately detect and differentiate between various biomarkers, providing a comprehensive diagnostic tool (Chen et al., 2022). Machine learning, on the other hand, can improve the accuracy and reliability of biosensor data by analyzing complex patterns and reducing noise. A study by Liu et al. (2023) integrated machine learning algorithms with a label-free electrochemical sensor to detect early-stage Alzheimer's disease. The machine learning model was trained to recognize subtle changes in the electrochemical signals, significantly improving the sensitivity and specificity of the sensor (Liu et al., 2023). In conclusion, label-free electrochemical biosensing offers a robust and versatile platform for disease detection. By understanding and optimizing the four primary mechanisms—blocking the electrode surface, allowing greater access to the electrode surface, changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity, and modulating ion or electron transport properties—researchers can develop highly sensitive and specific biosensors. Furthermore, the integration of multiplex analysis and machine learning holds great promise for advancing the field and improving diagnostic outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Label-free electrochemical biosensor for cancer biomarker detection using gold nanoparticles and DNA aptamers", "authors": "X.
