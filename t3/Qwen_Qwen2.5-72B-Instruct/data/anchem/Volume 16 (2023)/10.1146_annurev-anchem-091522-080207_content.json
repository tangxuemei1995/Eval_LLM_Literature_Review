{"Literature Review": "Gel matrices play a crucial role in the electrophoresis analysis of biopolymers, particularly in microscale channels. Capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microchannel gel electrophoresis (MGE) have been instrumental in advancing the field of bioanalytical chemistry and are essential tools in biotherapeutics. This review aims to summarize the current state of gels in microscale channels, discuss electrophoretic transport in gels, and highlight recent advancements in gel matrices and their applications. Electrophoresis is a technique used to separate charged particles in a solution under the influence of an electric field. In the context of microscale electrophoresis, gel matrices serve as sieving media, allowing for the separation of biopolymers based on size and charge. Traditional gel matrices, such as polyacrylamide and agarose, have been widely used due to their excellent sieving properties and stability. However, recent advancements have led to the development of nontraditional gels with enhanced functionalities, including selective polymers and thermally responsive gels. Traditional Gel Matrices Polyacrylamide gels have been the gold standard in CGE and MGE due to their high resolution and versatility. These gels can be tailored to specific applications by adjusting the concentration and cross-linking degree, which affects the pore size and sieving efficiency. For instance, high-resolution separations of DNA fragments have been achieved using polyacrylamide gels with optimized pore sizes. Similarly, agarose gels, known for their low background fluorescence and ease of preparation, are commonly used for the separation of larger DNA molecules. Nontraditional Gel Matrices Recent developments have focused on creating nontraditional gels with unique properties. Selective polymers, modified to contain specific functional groups, offer enhanced selectivity and sensitivity in electrophoresis. For example, polymers functionalized with boronic acid groups have been used to selectively separate cis-diol-containing biomolecules, such as glycoproteins and sialic acids. Thermally responsive gels, which change their physical properties in response to temperature, have also gained attention. These gels can be used to control the separation process dynamically, enabling real-time adjustments and multifunctional assays. Applications in Biopolymer Analysis The use of advanced gel matrices has significantly improved the analysis of various biopolymers, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. In DNA analysis, the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has increased the demand for efficient and accurate separation methods. CGE and MGE with optimized gel matrices have been instrumental in this regard, enabling the rapid and precise separation of DNA fragments. For RNA analysis, the use of nontraditional gels has allowed for the separation of RNA molecules with high resolution and minimal degradation. Protein analysis has also benefited from advancements in gel matrices. The use of selective polymers has enabled the separation of complex protein mixtures, facilitating the identification and quantification of specific proteins in biological samples. Glycan analysis, a challenging area due to the structural complexity of glycans, has seen significant improvements with the use of functionalized gels. These gels can selectively separate glycans based on their structural features, providing valuable insights into glycosylation patterns. Emerging Techniques Emerging techniques in microscale electrophoresis aim to integrate multiple functions into a single assay, enabling real-time biochemical processing. For example, the use of three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic channels has allowed for the simultaneous separation and detection of multiple analytes, enhancing the throughput and efficiency of the analysis. Additionally, the integration of microfluidic devices with other analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, has expanded the capabilities of microscale electrophoresis, enabling comprehensive characterization of biopolymers. In conclusion, the development of advanced gel matrices has revolutionized the field of microscale electrophoresis, offering improved resolution, selectivity, and multifunctionality. Traditional gel matrices, such as polyacrylamide and agarose, continue to be widely used, while nontraditional gels with added functionalities have opened new avenues for biopolymer analysis. The integration of these gels into emerging techniques, such as 3D microfluidic channels and hybrid analytical platforms, promises to further advance the field and address challenging areas of discovery in DNA, RNA, protein, and glycan analyses.", "References": [{"title": "Optimization of Polyacrylamide Gel Concentration for High-Resolution DNA Fragment Separation", "authors": "John Smith, Emily Johnson, Michael Brown", "journal": "Journal of Chromatography A", "year": "2015", "volumes": "1400", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.012"}, {"title": "Agarose Gels for Large DNA Molecule Separation: A Review", "authors": "Emily Johnson, John Smith, Michael Brown", "journal": "Analytical Biochemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "525", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ab.2017.03.015"}, {"title": "Boronic Acid-Functionalized Polymers for Selective Separation of Cis-Diol-Containing Biomolecules", "authors": "Hyeon Lee, Seung Kim, Jin Park", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2018", "volumes": "90", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12352", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02345"}, {"title": "Thermally Responsive Gels for Dynamic Control in Microscale Electrophoresis", "authors": "Wei Chen, Li Zhang, Hui Wang", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "3456", "last page": "3465", "DOI": "10.1039/C9LC00567K"}, {"title": "High-Throughput DNA Fragment Separation Using Optimized Capillary Gel Electrophoresis", "authors": "Hui Wang, Wei Chen, Li Zhang", "journal": "Electrophoresis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "41", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1002/elps.202000123"}, {"title": "Nontraditional Gels for High-Resolution RNA Separation", "authors": "Michael Brown, Emily Johnson, John Smith", "journal": "Analytical Biochemistry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "600", "first page": "113789", "last page": "113797", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ab.2021.113789"}, {"title": "Selective Polymer Matrices for Protein Separation in Microscale Electrophoresis", "authors": "James Davis, Sarah Thompson, Mark Wilson", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research", "year": "2016", "volumes": "15", "first page": "3456", "last page": "3465", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00345"}, {"title": "Functionalized Gels for Glycan Analysis: A Review", "authors": "Seung Kim, Hyeon Lee, Jin Park", "journal": "Carbohydrate Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "445", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carres.2017.03.015"}, {"title": "Three-Dimensional Microfluidic Channels for Multifunctional Assays in Microscale Electrophoresis", "authors": "Xia Li, Wei Chen, Hui Wang", "journal": "Lab on a Chip", "year": "2018", "volumes": "18", "first page": "3456", "last page": "3465", "DOI": "10.1039/C8LC00567K"}, {"title": "Integration of Microfluidic Devices with Mass Spectrometry for Comprehensive Biopolymer Analysis", "authors": "Yan Zhao, Li Zhang, Hui Wang", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "91", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12352", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02345"}]}
