{"Literature Review": "Nondestructive 3D pathology, particularly through the use of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), represents a significant advancement in the field of medical diagnostics and translational research. Unlike traditional 2D histopathology, which provides a limited view of tissue sections, 3D pathology allows for the visualization of tissue structures in their natural volumetric context, offering a more comprehensive understanding of disease progression and cellular interactions (Keller & Dodt, 2012).\n\nRecent advancements in tissue preparation methods have been crucial in enabling 3D pathology. Techniques such as CLARITY (Chung & Deisseroth, 2013) and CUBIC (Susaki et al., 2015) have revolutionized the way tissues are processed, making them transparent while preserving their structural integrity. These methods allow for deep tissue imaging without the need for sectioning, thus maintaining the spatial relationships between cells and tissues. This is particularly important for understanding complex diseases where the spatial arrangement of cells can significantly influence disease outcomes (Tomer et al., 2014).\n\nLight-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful tool for 3D imaging due to its high-speed, low phototoxicity, and ability to image large volumes of tissue (Huisken & Stainier, 2007). LSFM works by illuminating the sample with a thin sheet of light, allowing for optical sectioning and reducing out-of-focus light, which improves image quality and resolution. This technique has been successfully applied to various biological systems, including whole organs and embryos, providing detailed insights into tissue architecture and function (Keller & Dodt, 2012).\n\nThe integration of computational tools is another critical aspect of 3D pathology. High-throughput 3D microscopy generates vast amounts of data, which require sophisticated algorithms for processing and analysis. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been increasingly employed to automate the segmentation and classification of cellular structures, enabling researchers to extract meaningful biological information from complex datasets (Janowicz et al., 2019). These computational tools not only enhance the efficiency of data analysis but also improve the accuracy and reproducibility of results (Peng, 2011).\n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of 3D pathology. One major challenge is the standardization of protocols for tissue preparation and imaging. Variability in these protocols can lead to inconsistencies in data quality and interpretation, hindering the comparability of results across different studies (Bria et al., 2018). Additionally, the computational demands of processing large 3D datasets can be significant, requiring substantial computational resources and expertise (Peng, 2011).\n\nAnother challenge is the integration of 3D pathology into clinical practice. While 3D imaging provides valuable insights, it must be validated and standardized to meet the rigorous requirements of clinical diagnostics. This includes ensuring the reliability and robustness of the techniques, as well as addressing regulatory and ethical considerations (Bria et al., 2018). Furthermore, the transition from research settings to clinical applications requires the development of user-friendly interfaces and workflows that can be easily adopted by pathologists and clinicians (Janowicz et al., 2019).\n\nThe future of 3D pathology holds great promise for translational research and clinical applications. In translational investigations, 3D pathology can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms, facilitating the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicine (Chung & Deisseroth, 2013). For example, in cancer research, 3D pathology can help identify tumor heterogeneity and microenvironmental factors that influence treatment response (Tomer et al., 2014).\n\nIn preclinical drug development, 3D pathology can offer a more physiologically relevant model for testing drug efficacy and toxicity. By visualizing the effects of drugs on tissue structure and function in a 3D context, researchers can gain insights that may not be apparent in 2D models (Huisken & Stainier, 2007). This can accelerate the drug discovery process and reduce the failure rate of drugs in clinical trials.\n\nIn clinical decision support, 3D pathology has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment decisions. For instance, in neurodegenerative diseases, 3D imaging can reveal the spatial distribution of pathological markers, providing a more precise diagnosis and better stratification of patients for targeted therapies (Susaki et al., 2015). Similarly, in surgical planning, 3D pathology can help surgeons visualize the extent of lesions and plan interventions more accurately, potentially improving patient outcomes (Keller & Dodt, 2012).\n\nIn conclusion, nondestructive 3D pathology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy represents a transformative approach in medical diagnostics and translational research. While challenges remain, ongoing advancements in tissue preparation, imaging technologies, and computational tools are paving the way for broader adoption and integration into clinical practice. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to revolutionize our understanding of disease and improve patient care (Peng, 2011).", "References": [{"title": "Multiview light-sheet microscope for rapid in toto imaging", "authors": "J.
