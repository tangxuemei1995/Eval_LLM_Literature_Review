{"Literature Review": "The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was one of the most significant environmental disasters in history, leading to a surge in research aimed at understanding the chemical and ecological impacts of oil spills. This literature review focuses on three emerging areas in the characterization of petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) following the Deepwater Horizon spill: excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\n\nExcitation-Emission Matrix (EEM) Spectroscopy:\nEEM spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing dissolved organic matter (DOM) in environmental samples. This technique involves measuring the fluorescence intensity of a sample at various excitation and emission wavelengths, producing a three-dimensional spectrum that can provide detailed information about the molecular composition and sources of DOM. In the context of the Deepwater Horizon spill, EEM spectroscopy has been used to differentiate between petrogenic and biogenic DOM, which is crucial for understanding the fate and transport of oil-derived compounds in the environment (Coble et al., 2013; Coble, 2014).\n\nFor instance, Coble et al. (2013) utilized EEM spectroscopy to analyze water samples collected from the Gulf of Mexico following the spill. They identified distinct fluorescence peaks that corresponded to oil-derived DOM, allowing them to track the movement of oil plumes and assess the extent of contamination. Similarly, Coble (2014) demonstrated that EEM spectroscopy could be used to monitor the degradation of oil-derived DOM over time, providing insights into the natural attenuation processes occurring in the marine environment.\n\nBlack Carbon Analysis:\nBlack carbon (BC) is a form of carbon produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. In the context of oil spills, BC can be a significant component of the particulate matter released into the environment. The analysis of black carbon is important for understanding the potential impacts of oil spills on air quality and human health. Recent studies have shown that BC can also serve as a tracer for the presence and distribution of oil-derived particles in the environment (Masiello et al., 2015; Masiello and Dittmar, 2016).\n\nMasiello et al. (2015) conducted a comprehensive analysis of black carbon in sediment samples collected from the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon spill. They found that the concentration of BC was significantly higher in areas affected by the spill, indicating that the spill had a substantial impact on the deposition of particulate matter. Masiello and Dittmar (2016) further explored the use of BC as a tracer for oil-derived particles, demonstrating that it could be used to distinguish between different sources of carbon in the environment.\n\nTrace Metal Analysis Using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS):\nInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a highly sensitive analytical technique used to determine the concentrations of trace metals in environmental samples. Trace metals can be released into the environment during oil spills and can have significant ecological and human health impacts. ICP-MS has been widely used in post-spill studies to monitor the levels of trace metals and assess their potential risks (Chen et al., 2017; Chen and Hu, 2018).\n\nChen et al. (2017) used ICP-MS to analyze water and sediment samples from the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon spill. They detected elevated levels of several trace metals, including arsenic, cadmium, and lead, in areas affected by the spill. These findings highlighted the need for continued monitoring of trace metal concentrations in the environment to ensure the safety of ecosystems and human populations. Chen and Hu (2018) extended this work by investigating the bioaccumulation of trace metals in marine organisms, demonstrating that certain species were more susceptible to metal contamination than others.\n\nIn conclusion, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill has spurred significant advancements in the analytical methods used to characterize petroleum and petroleum-derived DOM. EEM spectroscopy, black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using ICP-MS are three emerging areas that have shown great promise in providing new insights into the environmental impacts of oil spills. Continued research in these areas will be essential for improving our understanding of the complex processes involved in oil spill dynamics and for developing effective strategies for mitigating their effects.", "References": [{"title": "Characterization of dissolved organic matter in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy", "authors": "P.
