{"Literature Review": "CRISPR-based biosensing strategies represent a significant advancement in the field of molecular diagnostics. The CRISPR-Cas system, originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system, has been repurposed for various biotechnological applications, including biosensing. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the technical development and application prospects of CRISPR-based biosensing strategies, focusing on their core biochemical properties, recent advancements, and future challenges. The core biochemical properties of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as diverse reaction temperatures, programmability in design, high reaction efficiency, and recognition specificity, form the foundation of CRISPR-based biosensors. The Cas9 and Cas12a enzymes, in particular, have been extensively studied for their ability to recognize specific DNA sequences and cleave target nucleic acids. These enzymes can be programmed with guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target specific sequences, making them highly versatile tools for biosensing applications. For instance, the Cas12a enzyme exhibits collateral cleavage activity, which can be harnessed to amplify signals in biosensing assays. Recent efforts have focused on improving the sensitivity and quantification capabilities of CRISPR-based biosensors. One approach involves the use of isothermal amplification techniques, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), to enhance the detection of low-abundance targets. LAMP can amplify target sequences at a constant temperature, making it suitable for point-of-care testing. Another strategy involves the integration of CRISPR with other biosensing platforms, such as electrochemical sensors and fluorescence-based assays, to achieve higher sensitivity and specificity. Multiplexing is another critical aspect of CRISPR-based biosensing, allowing the simultaneous detection of multiple targets. This is particularly important in clinical settings where the identification of multiple pathogens or genetic mutations is necessary. Multiplex CRISPR assays have been developed using different gRNAs to target multiple sequences simultaneously, and these assays have shown promising results in detecting viral infections and cancer biomarkers. Convenience and ease of use are also crucial factors in the development of CRISPR-based biosensors. One-pot assays, which combine all the necessary reagents in a single reaction mixture, have been developed to simplify the detection process. These assays reduce the risk of contamination and make the technology more accessible for point-of-care applications. Additionally, the creation of advanced sensors, such as paper-based tests and microfluidic devices, has further enhanced the portability and user-friendliness of CRISPR-based biosensors. While CRISPR-based biosensing has primarily focused on nucleic acid detection, recent developments have extended its applications to non-nucleic acid targets, such as proteins and small molecules. For example, CRISPR-Cas systems have been used to detect protein-protein interactions and small molecule ligands by coupling the CRISPR machinery with other molecular recognition elements. These advancements broaden the scope of CRISPR-based biosensing and open up new possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Despite the rapid progress in CRISPR-based biosensing, several challenges remain before these technologies can be widely adopted. One major obstacle is the need for robust and reliable assay designs that can perform consistently across different samples and environments. Standardization of protocols and reagents is essential to ensure reproducibility and accuracy. Additionally, the cost and accessibility of CRISPR-based biosensors must be addressed to make them viable for widespread use, especially in resource-limited settings. In conclusion, CRISPR-based biosensing strategies offer a powerful and flexible platform for the detection of various targets, from nucleic acids to proteins and small molecules. Recent advancements in sensitivity, multiplexing, and convenience have significantly improved the performance of these biosensors. However, further research is needed to overcome existing challenges and fully realize the potential of CRISPR-based biosensing in clinical and environmental applications.", "References": [{"title": "Rationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity", "authors": "Ian M.
