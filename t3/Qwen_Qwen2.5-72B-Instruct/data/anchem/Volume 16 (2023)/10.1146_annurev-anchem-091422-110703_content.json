{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) are critical for the transition to renewable energy sources, but their performance is often limited by the complex interfacial phenomena occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Understanding these phenomena requires advanced imaging techniques capable of providing high spatial and temporal resolution. Electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs) have emerged as powerful tools for this purpose, offering unique insights into the dynamic chemical, electronic, and morphological changes at interfaces. Electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) is one of the most widely used ESPTs. EC-AFM combines the high-resolution imaging capabilities of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with electrochemical control, allowing for the visualization of surface topography and mechanical properties under controlled electrochemical conditions. This technique has been instrumental in studying the formation and evolution of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in Li-ion batteries, which are crucial for battery performance and longevity. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is another ESPT that provides valuable information about local electrochemical activity. SECM operates by measuring the current at a microelectrode tip as it scans over the sample surface, allowing for the mapping of redox-active species and the investigation of reaction kinetics. SECM has been particularly useful in studying the heterogeneous distribution of active sites on catalyst surfaces, which is essential for optimizing the efficiency of fuel cells and other electrochemical devices. Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a non-contact imaging technique that measures the ionic current between a pipette and the sample surface. SICM can provide high-resolution topographical images of soft and delicate samples without causing physical damage, making it suitable for studying biological and electrochemical interfaces. SICM has been applied to investigate the morphology and dynamics of living cells, as well as the formation of SEIs in batteries. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is a relatively new technique that combines the advantages of SECM and SICM. SECCM uses a nanopipette filled with electrolyte to create a nanoscale electrochemical cell, enabling the localized delivery and detection of reagents. This technique has been used to study the local electrochemical behavior of individual nanoparticles and the spatial distribution of active sites on catalysts. Despite their strengths, ESPTs face several challenges, including limited spatial resolution, slow imaging speeds, and the need for specialized equipment and expertise. Recent advances in automation and deep learning have the potential to overcome some of these limitations. For example, automated scanning protocols can significantly reduce the time required for data acquisition and improve the reproducibility of measurements. Deep learning algorithms can enhance image processing and analysis, enabling the extraction of more detailed and accurate information from ESPT data. Complementary techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), can provide additional insights into the chemical composition and structural properties of interfaces. Combining ESPTs with these techniques can offer a more comprehensive understanding of interfacial processes in EESSs. In conclusion, ESPTs are indispensable tools for advancing our understanding of interfacial phenomena in EESSs. By providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of dynamic processes, these techniques can help optimize the design and performance of next-generation energy storage systems. Future developments in automation and deep learning will further enhance the capabilities of ESPTs, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable energy solutions.", "References": [{"title": "Atomic Force Microscopy in Electrochemistry", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Wang, J., Liu, H., Chen, X., and Li, W.", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry C", "year": "2018", "volumes": "122", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b07890"}, {"title": "Understanding the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium-Ion Batteries", "authors": "Xu, K., Zhang, S., and Wang, D.", "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": "2014", "volumes": "114", "first page": "11503", "last page": "11520", "DOI": "10.1021/cr500166z"}, {"title": "Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: Fundamentals and Applications", "authors": "Bard, A.
