{"Literature Review": "Eating disorders (EDs) have historically been considered a predominantly female issue, leading to a significant underrepresentation of boys and men in research and clinical settings. However, the twenty-first century has seen a growing interest in understanding the prevalence, risk factors, and treatment outcomes of EDs in males. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the epidemiology of EDs and muscle dysmorphia (MD) in boys and men, identify specific groups at increased risk, explore sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors, and discuss male-specific assessment measures, prevention efforts, and treatment outcomes. Epidemiology of Eating Disorders and Muscle Dysmorphia in Boys and Men: The prevalence of EDs in boys and men has been increasingly recognized. According to a meta-analysis by Murray, Griffiths, and Mond (2017), the lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED) in males is approximately 0.3%, 0.5%, and 2.0%, respectively. These rates, while lower than those observed in females, highlight the significant burden of EDs in males. Muscle dysmorphia, a condition characterized by a pathological preoccupation with muscularity, is particularly relevant to males. Pope, Gruber, and Choi (1997) estimated that MD affects about 1% of the male population, with higher rates observed in specific subgroups such as bodybuilders and athletes. Specific Groups at Increased Risk: Certain groups of boys and men are at a higher risk for developing EDs. For instance, athletes, particularly those in sports that emphasize leanness or weight class, are more susceptible to EDs. Sundgot-Borgen and Torstveit (2004) found that the prevalence of EDs in male athletes is significantly higher than in the general male population. Additionally, gay and bisexual men are at increased risk for EDs, with studies indicating higher rates of BN and BED in these populations compared to heterosexual men (Feldman & Meyer, 2007). Sociocultural, Psychological, and Biological Vulnerability Factors: Sociocultural factors play a crucial role in the development of EDs in boys and men. The media's portrayal of idealized male bodies, often emphasizing muscularity and leanness, can contribute to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors (Perloff, 2014). Psychological factors, such as low self-esteem, perfectionism, and body dissatisfaction, are also significant risk factors. A study by Diedrichs and Frank (2015) found that body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem were strongly associated with ED symptoms in males. Biological factors, including genetic predispositions and hormonal influences, may also contribute to the risk of EDs. For example, genetic studies have identified specific genes associated with AN and BN (Bulik et al., 2010). Male-Specific Assessment Measures: The assessment of EDs in boys and men requires the use of gender-sensitive measures. Traditional ED assessment tools, which are often validated in female populations, may not accurately capture the unique experiences of males. The Male Body Attitudes Scale (MBAS) and the Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS) are two instruments specifically designed to assess body image concerns and muscle dysmorphia in males (McCreary & Sasse, 2000; Cafri et al., 2005). These tools have been validated and are widely used in research and clinical settings. Prevention Efforts and Treatment Outcomes: Prevention efforts for EDs in boys and men are still in their early stages. School-based programs that address body image and healthy eating habits have shown promise in reducing risk factors for EDs (Stice, Shaw, & Marti, 2009). However, more research is needed to develop and evaluate male-specific prevention programs. Treatment outcomes for EDs in males have been mixed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and family-based therapy (FBT) are effective treatments for AN and BN in males, but the evidence base is smaller compared to female populations (Le Grange et al., 2015). Additionally, the stigma associated with seeking help for EDs in males can be a significant barrier to treatment access and utilization. Mortality Risk: The mortality risk associated with EDs in males is a critical concern. A study by Arcelus, Mitchell, Wales, and Nielsen (2011) found that the standardized mortality ratio for males with AN is higher than that for females, highlighting the severity of the condition in males. This increased mortality risk underscores the importance of early identification and intervention for EDs in boys and men. Priorities for Future Research: Future research should focus on several key areas. First, including boys and men in epidemiological studies is essential to track changes in incidence and prevalence over time. Second, identifying (neuro)biological factors contributing to the risk of EDs in males can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of these disorders. Third, eliminating barriers to treatment access and utilization, such as stigma and lack of male-specific resources, is crucial. Finally, refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts is necessary to improve outcomes for boys and men with EDs. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding EDs and MD in boys and men, much work remains to be done. Addressing the unique challenges faced by males in this context is essential for improving their mental health and well-being.", "References": [{"title": "The prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in males: A systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "S.
