{"Literature Review": "Racism and its structural manifestations have been increasingly recognized as significant determinants of mental health, including the risk of developing psychosis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has explicitly identified racism as a serious threat to public health, emphasizing the need to address the systemic and interpersonal forms of racial discrimination that contribute to health disparities (CDC, 2021). This literature review explores the intersection of racism and social determinants of health, focusing on their impact on the risk of psychosis, particularly among Black and Latinx populations in the United States.Structural racism, defined as the normalization and legitimization of an array of practices, policies, and norms that systematically privilege White people and disadvantage people of color, is a fundamental cause of health inequities (Bailey et al., 2017). These inequities are deeply embedded in the social and economic structures of society, influencing access to education, employment, housing, and healthcare. For instance, Black and Latinx individuals are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty, environmental hazards, and limited access to resources, which can exacerbate stress and contribute to the development of mental health issues, including psychosis (Williams & Mohammed, 2013).Racial discrimination, a key component of structural racism, is a significant stressor that can lead to chronic psychological and physiological stress. Studies have shown that experiences of racial discrimination are associated with increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, and other biological markers of stress, which can have long-term negative effects on mental health (Gee et al., 2006). This chronic stress can contribute to the development of psychotic experiences, such as delusions and hallucinations, which are early indicators of psychosis (Kelleher et al., 2012).Food insecurity, another social determinant of health, is disproportionately experienced by Black and Latinx populations. Food insecurity is associated with poor nutritional status, which can affect brain development and function, potentially increasing the risk of mental health disorders, including psychosis (Seligman & Schillinger, 2010). Additionally, the stress and anxiety associated with food insecurity can exacerbate existing mental health issues, further contributing to the risk of psychosis.Police violence, a form of institutional racism, is another critical factor that disproportionately affects Black and Latinx communities. Exposure to police violence, either directly or indirectly, can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health conditions, which are risk factors for psychosis (James et al., 2018). The trauma and stress associated with police violence can also contribute to the development of psychotic experiences, particularly in individuals who are already at risk due to other social determinants of health.The impact of racism on mental health is not limited to the individual level; it also affects the next generation through intergenerational transmission. Black and Latina pregnant mothers who experience racial discrimination and other forms of stress are more likely to have children with higher levels of stress and inflammation, which can increase the risk of developing mental health disorders, including psychosis (Collins et al., 2004). This intergenerational transmission of stress and trauma underscores the need for interventions that address the root causes of racism and its impact on health.Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions have shown promise in improving outcomes for individuals at risk of developing psychosis. These interventions typically include a combination of pharmacological treatment, psychotherapy, and social support, and are designed to address the complex needs of individuals with early-stage psychosis (Marshall & Rathbone, 2011). However, access to these interventions remains a significant challenge, particularly for Black and Latinx populations, who are often underrepresented in mental health services due to systemic barriers and stigma (Vuong et al., 2017).To effectively address the social determinants of psychosis, it is essential to implement coordinated care models that are culturally sensitive and accessible to marginalized communities. This includes addressing the racism-specific adversities that many Black and Latinx individuals face in their neighborhoods and social environments. Community-based interventions that involve collaboration between healthcare providers, community organizations, and policymakers can help to create more equitable and supportive environments for individuals at risk of psychosis (Mays et al., 2007).In conclusion, the intersection of racism and social determinants of health plays a critical role in the risk of developing psychosis, particularly among Black and Latinx populations. Addressing these structural and interpersonal forms of racism is essential to reducing health disparities and improving mental health outcomes. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions, combined with efforts to dismantle discriminatory structures and create more equitable social environments, offer a promising approach to addressing the complex and multifaceted nature of this issue.", "References": [{"title": "Structural racism and health inequities in the USA: evidence and interventions", "authors": "Zinzi D.
