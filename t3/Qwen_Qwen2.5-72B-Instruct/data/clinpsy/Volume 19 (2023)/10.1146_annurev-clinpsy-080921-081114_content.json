{"Literature Review": "Supernatural attributions, encompassing beliefs in God, the devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma, are pervasive and deeply ingrained in human culture and psychology. These beliefs are not merely relics of ancient superstition but are actively engaged with in contemporary society, influencing a wide range of psychological processes and behaviors. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on supernatural attributions, highlighting their psychological relevance and the factors that contribute to their formation and maintenance.Research has consistently shown that supernatural beliefs can serve as coping mechanisms, particularly in times of stress and uncertainty. For instance, Pargament (1997) found that religious and spiritual coping strategies, including attributions to God or a higher power, can provide individuals with a sense of meaning and control, thereby reducing anxiety and enhancing resilience. Similarly, Koenig, McCullough, and Larson (2001) reported that religious involvement, which often includes supernatural attributions, is associated with better mental health outcomes, including lower rates of depression and anxiety.However, supernatural attributions are not always beneficial. They can also be sources of distress and psychopathology. For example, Luhrmann (2012) explored the experiences of individuals who hear voices, a phenomenon often attributed to supernatural entities. Her research revealed that these experiences can be distressing and may contribute to the development of psychotic disorders. Additionally, Pargament, Smith, Koenig, and Perez (1998) identified a phenomenon known as 'spiritual struggles,' where conflicts with supernatural beliefs can lead to increased psychological distress and even exacerbate existing mental health issues.Supernatural attributions can also serve as moral guides and decision-making tools. Hood, Hill, and Spilka (2009) noted that beliefs in God or a higher moral authority can influence ethical behavior and decision-making. For instance, individuals who attribute moral outcomes to divine intervention may be more likely to adhere to ethical norms and engage in prosocial behavior. This aligns with the broader literature on the role of religion in promoting social cohesion and moral behavior (Haidt, 2007).The formation and maintenance of supernatural attributions are influenced by a variety of factors, including contextual, cognitive, and social-cultural elements. Contextual factors, such as personal experiences and environmental conditions, play a significant role. For example, Hood et al. (2009) found that individuals who have had positive experiences with supernatural entities are more likely to maintain and reinforce these beliefs. Similarly, Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1992) highlighted the importance of social and cultural influences, noting that individuals are more likely to adopt supernatural beliefs that are prevalent in their social and cultural environments.Cognitive styles and personality traits also contribute to the formation of supernatural attributions. For instance, individuals with a more intuitive cognitive style, characterized by a preference for holistic and emotional processing, are more likely to endorse supernatural beliefs (Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2012). Personality traits, such as openness to experience and neuroticism, have also been linked to supernatural beliefs. For example, Hood et al. (2009) found that individuals high in openness to experience are more likely to engage in supernatural thinking, while those high in neuroticism may use supernatural attributions as a way to cope with anxiety and uncertainty.Psychopathology can also influence the formation and maintenance of supernatural attributions. For example, individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to experience and attribute their symptoms to supernatural entities (Luhrmann, 2012). This can lead to a vicious cycle where supernatural attributions exacerbate symptoms, and symptoms reinforce supernatural beliefs. Similarly, individuals with anxiety disorders may use supernatural attributions as a way to manage their anxiety, but these attributions can also contribute to the persistence of their symptoms (Pargament et al., 1998).In conclusion, supernatural attributions are a complex and multifaceted aspect of human psychology. They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, moral guides, and decision-making tools. The formation and maintenance of these attributions are influenced by a range of factors, including contextual, cognitive, and social-cultural elements. Clinical psychologists should be aware of the psychological relevance of supernatural attributions and consider them in their assessment and treatment of clients. By understanding the role of supernatural beliefs in human psychology, clinicians can better support individuals in their coping, moral reasoning, and overall mental health.", "References": [{"title": "Patterns of Positive and Negative Religious Coping with Major Life Stressors", "authors": "Kenneth I.
