{"Literature Review": "The mental health of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) is a critical area of study, given the unique sociopolitical and historical contexts that shape their experiences. This literature review updates and extends the work of Gone and Trimble (2012) by focusing on the intersection of evidence-based practice and alter-Native psy-ence in community mental health services for AI/AN populations. The review begins by defining AI/AN populations and the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations, followed by an updated summary of mental health issues, a review of recent literature on community mental health services, and a discussion on the integration of Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Defining AI/AN Populations and Political Citizenship American Indians and Alaska Natives are recognized as distinct populations in the United States, with a unique status as citizens of both the United States and their respective Tribal Nations. This dual citizenship is crucial for understanding the sociopolitical context in which AI/AN mental health services operate. Tribal Nations are semisovereign entities with their own governance structures, cultural practices, and health systems, which often differ significantly from mainstream American institutions (Gone & Trimble, 2012). The recognition of Tribal sovereignty is essential for the development and implementation of culturally appropriate mental health services (Gone, 2016). Mental Health Issues in AI/AN Communities AI/AN communities face significant mental health challenges, including higher rates of addiction, trauma, and suicide compared to the general U.S. population. These disparities are often linked to historical trauma, socioeconomic inequities, and ongoing structural barriers (Whitbeck et al., 2014). Historical trauma, defined as the cumulative emotional and psychological injury over the lifespan and across generations resulting from massive group trauma, is a key factor in the mental health of AI/AN populations (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998). The legacy of forced assimilation, boarding schools, and land dispossession has left a lasting impact on AI/AN communities, contributing to intergenerational trauma and postcolonial anomie (Gone, 2013). Community Mental Health Services for AI/AN Populations Recent literature has highlighted the importance of community-based mental health services that are culturally responsive and tailored to the needs of AI/AN populations. Since 2010, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effectiveness of mental health interventions in AI/AN communities. For example, a study by Gone et al. (2015) found that a culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program was effective in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among AI/AN youth. Similarly, a study by Whitbeck et al. (2014) demonstrated the efficacy of a family-based intervention in reducing substance use and improving mental health outcomes among AI/AN adolescents. Despite these promising findings, there is a need for more research on the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of these interventions. Additionally, the cultural adaptation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) remains a significant challenge. While EBPs have been shown to be effective in diverse populations, their applicability to AI/AN communities requires careful consideration of cultural values, beliefs, and practices (Gone, 2016). Alter-Native Psy-ence and Indigenized Therapies The concept of alter-Native psy-ence, as proposed by Gone (2013), offers a critical perspective on the mental health of AI/AN populations. Alter-Native psy-ence recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies, emphasizing the role of historical trauma and structural inequities in shaping mental health outcomes. This perspective challenges the dominant biomedical model of mental health and advocates for the integration of Indigenous knowledge and practices in mental health care. Indigenized therapies, which incorporate traditional healing practices and cultural values, have gained increasing attention in recent years. These therapies often involve community-based approaches that emphasize collective healing and the restoration of cultural identity. For example, a study by Gone and Trimble (2012) found that traditional healing practices, such as sweat lodge ceremonies and talking circles, were effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety among AI/AN adults. Similarly, a study by Whitbeck et al. (2014) highlighted the importance of family and community support in promoting mental health and resilience among AI/AN youth. Conclusion The mental health of AI/AN populations is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a holistic and culturally responsive approach. While evidence-based practices have shown promise in improving mental health outcomes, the integration of alter-Native psy-ence and Indigenized therapies is essential for addressing the unique needs and experiences of AI/AN communities. Tribal Nations must play a central role in determining how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for the wider community benefit. Future research should focus on the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of culturally tailored interventions, as well as the development of new approaches that honor the cultural heritage and resilience of AI/AN communities.", "References": [{"title": "American Indian Mental Health: Contemporary Challenges and Resilient Responses", "authors": "Gone, J.
