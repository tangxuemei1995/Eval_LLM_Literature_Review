{"Literature Review": "Parental incarceration is a pervasive and inequitable form of adversity affecting millions of children in the United States. This review synthesizes the existing literature on the risks and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, highlighting the adverse implications for children's emotional and behavioral well-being, and the factors that contribute to resilience. The review also offers a critical reframing of resilience research, emphasizing the need for contextualized approaches and social justice-informed recommendations for future research and practice.", "References": [{"title": "Children's antisocial behavior, mental health, drug use, and educational performance after parental incarceration: A systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Murray, J., Farrington, D.
