{"Literature Review": "Ethnomethodology, a field of sociological inquiry initiated by Harold Garfinkel with the publication of 'Studies in Ethnomethodology' in 1967, has significantly influenced various domains of social science research. This literature review explores the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, tracing its development and impact from its inception to the present day. Garfinkel's intellectual career was marked by a deep engagement with the works of Alfred Schütz, Talcott Parsons, and Max Weber. Schütz's phenomenology, which emphasizes the subjective meanings individuals attach to social actions, provided a foundational framework for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel extended this by focusing on the methods people use to make sense of their social world, a perspective that diverged from Parsons's systems theory, which emphasized macro-level structures and functions (Garfinkel, 1967). Weber's concern with meaning construction also resonated with ethnomethodology, particularly in the context of understanding how social actors interpret and act upon their environment (Weber, 1949). A central theme in ethnomethodology is the problem of contextuality, which Garfinkel addressed through the documentary method of interpretation, a concept borrowed and adapted from Karl Mannheim. The documentary method posits that individuals use documents—broadly defined as any form of communication or representation—to construct and understand social reality. This method has been instrumental in ethnomethodological studies, providing a lens through which researchers can examine the detailed processes by which social order is produced and maintained (Mannheim, 1952). Ethnomethodologically-related studies have proliferated across various domains, including conversation analysis (CA), membership categorization analysis (MCA), and the study of everyday life. CA, pioneered by Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff, and Gail Jefferson, focuses on the systematic examination of talk-in-interaction, revealing the intricate rules and practices that govern conversational exchanges (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). MCA, developed by membership categorization analysts, examines how social categories are constructed and used in interaction, highlighting the dynamic and negotiated nature of social identities (Heritage, 1984). Ethnomethodological research has also made significant contributions to the study of racial, gender, and other minoritized groups. By examining the micro-level interactions and practices that shape social experiences, ethnomethodologists have shed light on the ways in which power dynamics and social inequalities are reproduced and challenged in everyday life (Lynch, 1993). For example, studies have explored how racialized and gendered identities are constructed and negotiated in institutional settings, such as schools and workplaces (Hutchby & Wooffitt, 1998). Legal environments have been another fertile ground for ethnomethodological inquiry. Researchers have examined the practices and procedures of legal institutions, revealing the often taken-for-granted assumptions and routines that underpin legal decision-making (Button, 1993). These studies have highlighted the importance of context and interaction in understanding legal processes, challenging more abstract and formalistic approaches to law. Social problems and deviance have also been subjects of ethnomethodological investigation. By focusing on the practical activities and interactions involved in defining and responding to social issues, ethnomethodologists have provided insights into the social construction of deviance and the mechanisms through which it is managed and controlled (Maynard & Perlewitz, 1987). For instance, studies have examined the practices of police officers, social workers, and other professionals who deal with deviant behavior, revealing the complex and often contradictory nature of their work (Lynch, 1993). Ability differences have been another area of interest for ethnomethodologists. Research in this domain has explored how individuals with disabilities navigate and interact within social environments, highlighting the role of social practices and norms in shaping their experiences (Goodwin, 1994). These studies have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of disability, emphasizing the importance of context and interaction in defining and addressing ability differences. Instructed action and its implications for the sciences, technology, and organizations have also been subjects of ethnomethodological research. By examining the detailed processes through which instructions are given and followed, ethnomethodologists have provided insights into the organization of work and the management of tasks in various settings (Suchman, 1987). For example, studies have explored the practices of engineers, scientists, and other professionals, revealing the complex and often tacit knowledge involved in carrying out instructed actions (Lynch, 1993). The conduct of social sciences itself has been a longstanding concern for ethnomethodologists. By examining the methods and practices used in social research, ethnomethodologists have provided critical insights into the production of social scientific knowledge. Studies have explored the processes of coding, survey design, and standardization, revealing the often hidden and taken-for-granted assumptions that underpin these practices (Garfinkel, 1967). These insights have had important implications for the methodology and epistemology of social science, challenging more positivist and objectivist approaches. Many of these areas have given rise to thriving subfields, with dedicated journals and a growing body of research. For example, the journal 'Research on Language and Social Interaction' has become a key venue for CA and MCA studies, while 'Science, Technology, and Human Values' has published numerous ethnomethodological investigations of science and technology (Hutchby & Wooffitt, 1998). These subfields have not only advanced our understanding of specific domains but have also contributed to broader theoretical and methodological debates in the social sciences. In conclusion, ethnomethodology has left a profound legacy in the social sciences, influencing a wide range of research areas and methodologies. From its roots in phenomenology and the documentary method of interpretation to its current applications in conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and the study of everyday life, ethnomethodology continues to provide valuable insights into the organization of social life and the production of social order. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely to remain a vital and innovative force in sociological theory and research.", "References": [{"title": "A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation", "authors": "Harvey Sacks, Emanuel A.
