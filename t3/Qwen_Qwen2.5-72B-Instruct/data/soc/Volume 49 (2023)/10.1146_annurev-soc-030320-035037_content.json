{"Literature Review": "The legitimacy of science has become a critical issue in the face of global challenges such as the ongoing pandemic and the accelerating climate crisis. These crises have exposed the fragility of science's legitimacy, which is deeply intertwined with broader cultural understandings and institutional norms. This literature review explores the multifaceted nature of the legitimacy crisis in science, examining both internal and external threats to the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. The concept of scientific legitimacy is rooted in the public's trust and confidence in the scientific enterprise. According to Funtowicz and Ravetz (1993), the legitimacy of science is contingent upon its ability to produce reliable and robust knowledge that can be trusted by society. However, this trust is increasingly under threat due to a variety of factors. One of the primary internal threats to scientific legitimacy is the issue of fraud and misconduct. Studies have shown that instances of scientific fraud, while relatively rare, can have a disproportionate impact on public trust (Fanelli, 2009). The high-profile cases of scientific misconduct, such as the fabrication of data in stem cell research (Eisenberg et al., 2015), have eroded public confidence in the scientific process. Another significant internal threat is the replicability crisis, which has gained considerable attention in recent years. The inability to reproduce results from published studies has raised questions about the reliability of scientific findings (Baker, 2016). This crisis has been particularly pronounced in fields such as psychology and biomedical research, where replication efforts have often failed to confirm the original results (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). The lack of reproducibility undermines the credibility of scientific research and contributes to the erosion of public trust. In addition to fraud and replicability, the diffusion and equability of scientific knowledge pose further challenges to its legitimacy. The uneven distribution of scientific resources and opportunities across different regions and disciplines can lead to disparities in the quality and accessibility of scientific knowledge (Lamont, 2012). This inequality can exacerbate existing social and economic divides, thereby undermining the perceived fairness and inclusivity of the scientific enterprise. Disciplinary fragmentation is another internal threat to the legitimacy of science. The increasing specialization and siloing of scientific disciplines can hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of diverse perspectives (Nowotny et al., 2001). This fragmentation can limit the scope and impact of scientific research, making it less relevant to societal needs and less accessible to the broader public. External threats to the legitimacy of science are equally significant and multifaceted. Political polarization and the rise of authoritarianism have created a challenging environment for scientific discourse. In many countries, political leaders and interest groups have sought to undermine scientific consensus on issues such as climate change and public health (Oreskes and Conway, 2010). This politicization of science can lead to the marginalization of expert knowledge and the promotion of alternative narratives that are not supported by evidence. Religious beliefs and cultural values also play a role in shaping public attitudes toward science. In some communities, religious doctrines and traditional beliefs may conflict with scientific explanations, leading to resistance or skepticism toward scientific findings (Nisbet and Goidel, 2007). This cultural resistance can be particularly pronounced in areas such as evolution and reproductive health, where scientific knowledge may challenge deeply held beliefs. The rapid advancement of information technology has both positive and negative implications for the legitimacy of science. On one hand, the internet and social media have democratized access to scientific information, making it more widely available to the public (Shirky, 2008). On the other hand, these platforms have also facilitated the spread of misinformation and pseudoscience, which can undermine public trust in scientific authority (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). Economic factors, particularly the commanding financial flows to organized science, also influence the legitimacy of scientific research. The increasing reliance on private funding and corporate sponsorship can create conflicts of interest and bias in scientific research (Krimsky, 2013). This financial dependency can compromise the objectivity and independence of scientific inquiry, leading to concerns about the integrity of the scientific process. Sociology, as a discipline, is uniquely positioned to study the complex interplay between science and society. However, sociologists themselves face challenges in maintaining the legitimacy of their own research. The sociological study of science must navigate the same issues of fraud, replicability, and political influence that affect other scientific disciplines (Collins and Pinch, 1993). The legitimacy of sociological research is crucial for understanding and addressing the broader legitimacy crisis in science. In conclusion, the legitimacy of science is a multifaceted issue that involves both internal and external threats. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving the transparency and accountability of the scientific process, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and engaging with the broader public to build trust and understanding. The ongoing pandemic and climate crisis underscore the urgent need for a robust and legitimate scientific enterprise that can effectively address global challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Science for the post-normal age", "authors": "Silvio O.
