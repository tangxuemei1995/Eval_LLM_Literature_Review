{"Literature Review": "Policing and punishment are inherently spatial phenomena, with significant variations observed across different geographic areas. This literature review synthesizes existing research on the spatial-contextual analyses of the criminal legal system, focusing on how community conditions influence criminal justice outcomes and how multiple forms of criminal justice exposure (e.g., policing and punishment) co-vary in specific places. The review is organized around three major approaches: crime, urban ecology, and social control.", "References": [{"title": "Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas", "authors": "Clifford R.
