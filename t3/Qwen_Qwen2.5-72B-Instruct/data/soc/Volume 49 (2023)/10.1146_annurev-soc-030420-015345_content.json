{"Literature Review": "Causal inference has emerged as a critical tool in the social sciences, particularly in sociology, where understanding the causes and consequences of social phenomena is paramount. Recent developments in this field have been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have enhanced the ability to identify and estimate causal effects accurately. This literature review focuses on four broad areas: causal effect identification and estimation, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. Each area is discussed with a particular emphasis on the role of machine learning in advancing our understanding of causal relationships.", "References": [{"title": "Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects", "authors": "Susan Athey, Guido W.
