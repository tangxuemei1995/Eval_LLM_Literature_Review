{"Literature Review": "The study of how social contexts influence children’s well-being has been a focal point in sociology, education, and public policy. Traditionally, research has often examined the effects of neighborhoods and schools in isolation, leading to a fragmented understanding of the complex interplay between these two critical environments. However, a growing body of literature recognizes the importance of considering neighborhoods and schools jointly, highlighting the need for a more integrated approach to studying social contexts. Neighborhoods and schools are not isolated entities but are deeply interconnected. Neighborhoods provide the broader social and economic context in which schools operate, while schools can significantly shape the character and dynamics of the neighborhood. For instance, high-performing schools can attract families to move into a particular area, thereby influencing the demographic composition and socioeconomic status of the neighborhood. Conversely, neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime can negatively impact the quality of schools, creating a cycle of disadvantage. Despite the recognition of these interconnections, much of the existing literature tends to focus on determining whether neighborhoods or schools have a greater impact on children’s outcomes. This comparative approach, while useful, often overlooks the dynamic and reciprocal nature of the relationship between neighborhoods and schools. A more nuanced approach is needed to understand how neighborhoods and schools mutually constitute one another. This requires a shift from a comparative framework to a structural one, where the focus is on the ways in which families choose neighborhoods and schools and how these choices, in turn, shape the social and educational landscapes. For instance, the process of neighborhood and school selection is influenced by a range of factors, including housing markets, school district boundaries, and parental preferences. These selection processes can lead to patterns of residential and school segregation, which further exacerbate inequalities in educational and social outcomes. Research on neighborhood and school selection also highlights the role of institutional policies and practices in shaping these processes. For example, school choice policies, such as charter schools and magnet programs, can provide families with more options but may also contribute to greater segregation. Similarly, housing policies that promote affordable housing in diverse neighborhoods can help reduce residential segregation and improve access to high-quality schools. To fully understand the joint effects of neighborhoods and schools, it is essential to consider the concept of neighborhood–school structures. This concept refers to the ways in which families make decisions about where to live and which schools to attend, and how these decisions are influenced by and, in turn, influence the characteristics of neighborhoods and schools. By focusing on these structures, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which social contexts affect children’s well-being. One key aspect of neighborhood–school structures is the role of social networks and community ties. Families often rely on information and advice from friends, neighbors, and community organizations when making decisions about neighborhoods and schools. These social networks can provide valuable insights into the quality of schools and the safety and amenities of neighborhoods, but they can also perpetuate patterns of segregation if they are homogenous and insular. Another important consideration is the role of institutional actors, such as school districts and local governments, in shaping neighborhood–school structures. These institutions can implement policies and practices that either facilitate or hinder the integration of neighborhoods and schools. For example, school district boundary lines can create barriers to school choice and contribute to segregation, while policies that promote open enrollment and inter-district transfers can increase access to diverse educational opportunities. In conclusion, the study of neighborhood and school effects on children’s well-being requires a more integrated and structural approach. By focusing on neighborhood–school structures, researchers can better understand the complex and dynamic relationships between these social contexts. This approach not only enriches our understanding of the mechanisms through which neighborhoods and schools affect children’s outcomes but also provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners working to address issues of inequality and segregation. Future research should continue to explore the ways in which families navigate the choices and constraints of neighborhood and school selection, and how these processes can be leveraged to create more equitable and inclusive communities.", "References": [{"title": "Neighborhood and School Effects on Educational Outcomes", "authors": "Burdick-Will, J., Ludwig, J., Duncan, G.
