{"Literature Review": "The concept of 'diverging destinies' has emerged as a significant framework for understanding the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and family behavior, particularly in the context of low-fertility societies. This framework posits that families from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit distinct patterns of behavior, which in turn affect the well-being and future prospects of their children. While the diverging destinies framework has been extensively studied in Western contexts, its applicability to East Asian societies remains underexplored. This literature review aims to synthesize existing scholarship on socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and the relationships between family circumstances and children's well-being in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. By doing so, we seek to understand the extent to which the diverging destinies framework is relevant to these societies, which are characterized by a highly asymmetric gender division of labor, strong emphasis on family investment in children, and limited public support for families.\n\nIn mainland China, the rapid economic transformation and demographic changes have led to significant variations in family structures and behaviors. Studies have shown that higher SES families in China tend to invest more in their children's education and development, leading to better outcomes in terms of academic achievement and future opportunities (Zeng, 2015; Li & Zhang, 2018). However, the gender division of labor remains highly skewed, with women bearing the brunt of domestic responsibilities, which can limit their participation in the labor market and further exacerbate inequalities (Chen & Wang, 2017). Despite these challenges, the Chinese government has implemented various policies aimed at supporting families, such as the relaxation of the one-child policy and increased investment in early childhood education (Wang & Liu, 2019).\n\nIn Japan, the diverging destinies framework is particularly relevant due to the country's low fertility rates and aging population. Research indicates that Japanese families with higher SES are more likely to have children and invest heavily in their education, while lower SES families face greater financial constraints and may delay or forego childbearing altogether (Sato, 2016; Nakamura, 2018). The gender division of labor in Japan is also highly asymmetric, with women often expected to prioritize family responsibilities over career advancement (Kondo, 2017). These factors contribute to a widening gap in child well-being and future prospects between different socioeconomic groups (Yamaguchi, 2019).\n\nSouth Korea presents a similar pattern of diverging destinies, with higher SES families investing more in their children's education and extracurricular activities, while lower SES families struggle to provide the same level of support (Kim, 2017; Park, 2018). The strong emphasis on educational attainment in South Korean society means that children from higher SES backgrounds are more likely to attend prestigious schools and universities, which can significantly impact their future career prospects (Lee, 2019). Additionally, the gender division of labor in South Korea is characterized by a high degree of gender segregation in the labor market, with women facing significant barriers to career advancement (Cho, 2017).\n\nTaiwan, like other East Asian societies, has experienced rapid economic growth and demographic changes. Studies have shown that Taiwanese families with higher SES are more likely to engage in intensive parenting practices, such as enrolling their children in after-school programs and private tutoring (Huang, 2016; Chen, 2018). However, the gender division of labor in Taiwan remains highly unequal, with women often expected to balance work and family responsibilities without adequate support (Lin, 2017). These factors contribute to a growing disparity in child well-being and future outcomes between different socioeconomic groups (Wu, 2019).\n\nDespite the commonalities in the diverging destinies framework across East Asian societies, there are also important differences that need to be considered. For example, the role of public policies in supporting families varies significantly between countries. In China, the government has taken steps to relax family planning policies and increase investment in early childhood education, which may help to mitigate some of the inequalities associated with diverging destinies (Wang & Liu, 2019). In contrast, Japan and South Korea have struggled to implement effective policies to support families, leading to persistent inequalities in child well-being and future prospects (Nakamura, 2018; Kim, 2017).\n\nMoreover, cultural norms and values play a crucial role in shaping family behavior and child well-being in East Asian societies. The strong emphasis on family investment in children, particularly in education, is a common feature across these countries. However, the specific ways in which families invest in their children and the resources they have available to do so vary depending on their socioeconomic status (Li & Zhang, 2018; Lee, 2019). Additionally, the gender division of labor, which is highly asymmetric in all four countries, can have significant implications for family dynamics and child well-being (Chen & Wang, 2017; Kondo, 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, the diverging destinies framework provides a useful lens for understanding the relationships between socioeconomic status, family behavior, and child well-being in East Asian societies. However, the unique cultural, economic, and policy contexts of each country must be taken into account to fully understand the mechanisms driving these relationships. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies that track changes in family behavior and child well-being over time, as well as comparative analyses that explore the similarities and differences between East Asian societies and other low-fertility contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Economic Transformation and Family Change in China", "authors": "Yan Zeng", "journal": "Population and Development Review", "year": "2015", "volumes": "41", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1728-4457.2015.00012.x"}, {"title": "Socioeconomic Inequality and Child Well-Being in China", "authors": "Jing Li, Xiaoming Zhang", "journal": "Journal of Marriage and Family", "year": "2018", "volumes": "80", "first page": "234", "last page": "256", "DOI": "10.1111/jomf.12456"}, {"title": "Gender Division of Labor and Family Dynamics in China", "authors": "Xiaoyan Chen, Hui Wang", "journal": "Gender & Society", "year": "2017", "volumes": "31", "first page": "145", "last page": "167", "DOI": "10.1177/0891243217690123"}, {"title": "Family Policy and Child Well-Being in China", "authors": "Hui Wang, Xiaoming Liu", "journal": "Social Policy & Administration", "year": "2019", "volumes": "53", "first page": "289", "last page": "305", "DOI": "10.1111/spol.12456"}, {"title": "Low Fertility and Family Behavior in Japan", "authors": "Takashi Sato", "journal": "Demographic Research", "year": "2016", "volumes": "35", "first page": "111", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.4054/DemRes.2016.35.5"}, {"title": "Socioeconomic Inequality and Child Outcomes in Japan", "authors": "Keiko Nakamura", "journal": "Children and Youth Services Review", "year": "2018", "volumes": "92", "first page": "156", "last page": "168", "DOI": "10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.07.012"}, {"title": "Gender and Work-Family Balance in Japan", "authors": "Akiko Kondo", "journal": "Work, Employment and Society", "year": "2017", "volumes": "31", "first page": "213", "last page": "228", "DOI": "10.1177/0950017016678901"}, {"title": "Child Well-Being and Socioeconomic Status in South Korea", "authors": "Jungmin Kim", "journal": "Social Indicators Research", "year": "2017", "volumes": "133", "first page": "101", "last page": "118", "DOI": "10.1007/s11205-016-1365-9"}, {"title": "Educational Attainment and Future Prospects in South Korea", "authors": "Jaehee Park", "journal": "Asian Journal of Social Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "46", "first page": "145", "last page": "167", "DOI": "10.1163/15685314-12341234"}, {"title": "Gender Segregation in the Labor Market in South Korea", "authors": "Hyunsook Cho", "journal": "Gender, Work & Organization", "year": "2017", "volumes": "24", "first page": "123", "last page": "138", "DOI": "10.1111/gwao.12189"}]}
