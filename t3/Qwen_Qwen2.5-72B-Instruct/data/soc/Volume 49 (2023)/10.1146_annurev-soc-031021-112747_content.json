{"Literature Review": "The relationship between food and inequality is multifaceted and deeply embedded in various social, economic, and political structures. This literature review explores how food systems contribute to and are influenced by inequalities at multiple levels, from global to local, and how these inequalities intersect with other forms of social stratification. The global food system is a primary site where inequalities are produced and sustained. According to McMichael (2009), the industrialization of agriculture has led to the concentration of land ownership and control over agricultural inputs, disproportionately benefiting large agribusinesses while marginalizing small-scale farmers. This concentration of power exacerbates economic disparities and environmental degradation, particularly in developing countries. The global trade in agricultural commodities also perpetuates unequal power dynamics, as Northern countries often dictate terms of trade that disadvantage Southern producers (Wallerstein, 1974). In addition to land and labor, the global food system is characterized by unequal access to resources and markets. Smallholder farmers, who constitute a significant portion of the world's population, face numerous barriers to market entry and fair prices for their products (Borras et al., 2011). These barriers include limited access to credit, technology, and information, which further entrench their marginalization. The result is a cycle of poverty and food insecurity that disproportionately affects rural communities in the Global South. At the local level, food access and food insecurity are critical issues that reflect and reinforce social inequalities. Research by Alaimo et al. (2008) highlights the link between food insecurity and poor health outcomes, including higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These health disparities are particularly pronounced among low-income and minority populations, who often live in areas with limited access to healthy food options, known as 'food deserts' (Cummins & Macintyre, 2002). The lack of affordable and nutritious food in these areas contributes to a cycle of poor health and economic hardship. Intersectionality plays a crucial role in understanding the lived experiences of food insecurity. Intersectional analysis reveals how multiple forms of oppression—such as race, gender, and class—intersect to shape individuals' and communities' access to food (Crenshaw, 1989). For example, women, especially those from marginalized racial and ethnic groups, are more likely to experience food insecurity due to systemic barriers such as wage discrimination and lack of access to social services (Henderson et al., 2007). Similarly, children from low-income families are at higher risk of malnutrition and related health problems, which can have long-term consequences for their development and well-being (Drewnowski & Specter, 2004). The social meanings of food also contribute to inequalities. Food is not just a biological necessity but a cultural and symbolic resource that reflects and reinforces social hierarchies. For instance, the consumption of organic and locally sourced foods is often associated with higher socioeconomic status and a commitment to environmental sustainability (DuPuis & Goodman, 2005). Conversely, the reliance on processed and fast foods is stigmatized and linked to poverty and poor health. These social meanings can create barriers to healthy eating, as individuals may feel pressure to conform to certain dietary norms or may lack the resources to make healthier choices. Food justice and food sovereignty movements offer alternative visions of food systems that challenge existing inequalities. Food justice advocates argue for equitable access to healthy, culturally appropriate food and the elimination of structural barriers that prevent marginalized communities from participating in the food system (Alkon & Agyeman, 2011). These movements emphasize the importance of community-based solutions, such as urban gardens and cooperative grocery stores, which can provide fresh produce and build social capital in underserved areas. Food sovereignty, on the other hand, focuses on the right of peoples to control their own food and agriculture systems. This concept, developed by the international peasant movement La Via Campesina, emphasizes the need for local control over land, water, and seeds, as well as the protection of traditional knowledge and practices (Windfuhr & Jonsen, 2005). By promoting agroecological practices and resisting corporate control, food sovereignty movements aim to create more resilient and equitable food systems that prioritize the needs of local communities. In conclusion, sociological research on food and inequality is essential for understanding the complex ways in which food systems contribute to and are shaped by social, economic, and political structures. By examining the global and local dimensions of food inequality, as well as the intersections of race, gender, and class, researchers can inform policy initiatives that address the root causes of food insecurity and promote more just and sustainable food systems.", "References": [{"title": "A food regime genealogy", "authors": "Philip McMichael", "journal": "Journal of Peasant Studies", "year": "2009", "volumes": "36", "first page": "139", "last page": "169", "DOI": "10.1080/03066150902820354"}, {"title": "Global land grab: A new enclosure of the commons", "authors": "Santiago M.
