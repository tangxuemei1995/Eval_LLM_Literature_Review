{"Literature Review": "The study of cross-border politics, particularly the dynamics of diasporic mobilization and state responses, has evolved significantly over the past few decades. The transnational turn in the social sciences, which began in the late 20th century, marked a pivotal shift in how scholars approached the interconnectedness of migration and political engagement across borders. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key concepts, findings, and debates in this field, drawing on a range of interdisciplinary studies. The concept of transnationalism has been central to understanding the ways in which migrants maintain and develop ties with their countries of origin while also integrating into their new societies. Portes, Guarnizo, and Landolt (1999) define transnationalism as the processes by which immigrants forge and sustain multifaceted linkages with their homelands, including economic, social, and political connections. These linkages often lead to the formation of diasporic communities that engage in various forms of political mobilization, from advocacy and lobbying to more direct forms of political action. Diasporic mobilization can take many forms, ranging from grassroots activism to formal political participation. Levitt and Glick Schiller (2004) categorize these activities into three main types: homeland-oriented, hostland-oriented, and transnational. Homeland-oriented activities focus on influencing political outcomes in the country of origin, such as supporting opposition movements or participating in elections. Hostland-oriented activities involve engaging in the political processes of the host country, such as voting, running for office, or advocating for policy changes. Transnational activities bridge both contexts, involving simultaneous engagement in both the homeland and the hostland. The political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. Migrants and their descendants often face unique challenges and opportunities in their efforts to influence political outcomes. For instance, Basch, Glick Schiller, and Szanton Blanc (1994) highlight the role of identity and belonging in shaping diasporic political behavior. Diasporic communities may feel a strong sense of connection to their homeland, which can motivate them to engage in political activities aimed at promoting the interests of their country of origin. Conversely, they may also face barriers to political participation in both the hostland and the homeland, such as legal restrictions, discrimination, or lack of resources. State responses to diasporic mobilization vary widely, reflecting the diverse political and social contexts in which these activities occur. Home states may adopt a range of policies to engage with their diasporas, from encouraging political participation to actively suppressing it. Koser (2003) identifies several strategies that home states use to harness the potential of their diasporas, including the establishment of diaspora ministries, the creation of special voting rights, and the provision of financial incentives for investment in the homeland. However, these policies can also be used to control and co-opt diasporic communities, as seen in cases where home states seek to limit the influence of opposition groups abroad. Host states, on the other hand, may view diasporic mobilization with suspicion, particularly if it involves activities that are perceived as threatening to national security or social cohesion. Vertovec (2009) discusses the tensions that can arise when diasporic communities engage in homeland-oriented political activities, such as fundraising for armed conflicts or advocating for secessionist movements. In some cases, host states may impose restrictions on such activities, while in others, they may seek to facilitate them as a means of fostering positive relations with the home state. The changing geopolitical landscape has further complicated the study of cross-border politics. The rise of globalization, the increasing fluidity of borders, and the proliferation of communication technologies have all contributed to the intensification of transnational connections. However, these changes have also led to new challenges and opportunities for diasporic mobilization. For example, the Arab Spring and other recent political upheavals have demonstrated the potential for diasporic communities to play a significant role in shaping political outcomes in their homelands (Kaldor, 2013). Moreover, the increasing salience of issues such as climate change, economic inequality, and human rights has created new avenues for diasporic political engagement. Migrants and their descendants are increasingly involved in global movements that transcend national boundaries, such as the climate justice movement and the fight against systemic racism (De Genova, 2017). These movements highlight the importance of understanding cross-border politics within a broader context of global interconnectedness and shared challenges. In conclusion, the study of cross-border politics and diasporic mobilization remains a vibrant and evolving field. The transnational turn has provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of migration and political engagement, but it also raises important questions about the future of this research. As the world continues to change, scholars must remain attuned to the shifting geopolitical and social landscapes that shape the conditions for diasporic political mobilization and state responses. By doing so, we can better understand the ways in which cross-border movements contribute to the ongoing transformation of the global political order.", "References": [{"title": "Transnational Communities: Their Emergence and Significance in the Contemporary World", "authors": "Nancy Foner, Georges W.
