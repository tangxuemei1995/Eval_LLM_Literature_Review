{"Literature Review": "The striatum, a critical component of the basal ganglia, is organized into distinct compartments known as striosomes and matrisomes. This architectural arrangement plays a pivotal role in the dynamic coupling of volition and action, which is essential for various cognitive and motor functions. Striosomes, also referred to as patches or islands, are neurochemically specialized regions embedded within the larger matrix, known as matrisomes or matrix (Gerfen & Surmeier, 2011). The striosome-matrix architecture is multiplexed with the canonical direct and indirect pathways of the striatum, suggesting a complex interplay between these structures in the regulation of behavior. Striosomes have been shown to exert a powerful influence on nigral dopamine-containing neurons. Studies have demonstrated that striosomes can completely inhibit the activity of these neurons, followed by a rebound excitation (Mizoguchi et al., 2010). This mechanism suggests that striosomes play a crucial role in the modulation of dopaminergic signaling, which is fundamental for reward processing and reinforcement learning. The ability of striosomes to control dopaminergic activity may underlie their involvement in the regulation of motivation and goal-directed behavior (Hikosaka, 2010). In addition to their influence on dopaminergic neurons, striosomes receive afferents from limbic and cognition-related corticostriatal pathways. These afferents are dynamically modulated in relation to value-based actions, indicating that striosomes are involved in the integration of emotional and cognitive information (Smith et al., 2016). This integration is essential for the execution of complex behaviors that require the evaluation of multiple factors, such as rewards and punishments. The dynamic nature of striosomal activity suggests that they are highly responsive to changes in the environment and internal states, allowing for flexible and adaptive behavior (Hikosaka, 2010). Striosomes are spatially interspersed among matrisomes and interneurons, and their activity is influenced by local and global neuromodulatory and oscillatory activities. This spatial arrangement facilitates the coordination of striatal computations and the integration of diverse inputs. For instance, the interaction between striosomes and matrisomes may enable the striatum to process and prioritize different types of information, such as sensory, motor, and cognitive signals (Gerfen & Surmeier, 2011). The influence of neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine and serotonin, on striosomal activity further highlights the importance of these structures in the regulation of striatal function (Bateup et al., 2010). Striosomes are also involved in tuning engagement and the motivation to perform reinforcement learning. They contribute to the manifestation of stereotypical behaviors and the navigation of valence conflicts and valence discriminations. For example, striosomes have been implicated in the resolution of approach-avoidance conflicts, where individuals must weigh the potential benefits and costs of different actions (Hikosaka, 2010). This function is particularly relevant in the context of decision-making and the selection of appropriate responses to environmental stimuli. At an algorithmic level, striosomes could serve as distributed scaffolds to provide formats for striatal computations generated through development and refined through learning. By transforming corticothalamic and other inputs to the functional formats of the striatum, striosomes may implement state transitions in nigro-striato-nigral circuits. These state transitions are thought to affect bodily and cognitive actions according to internal motives, which are often compromised in neuropsychiatric conditions (Hikosaka, 2010). For instance, disruptions in striosomal function have been linked to disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and addiction, highlighting the clinical significance of these structures (Smith et al., 2016). The role of striosomes in subjective states is another area of growing interest. It has been proposed that striosomes affect the subjective experience of reward and punishment, which is critical for the regulation of mood and emotional well-being. By influencing the activity of dopaminergic neurons and integrating limbic and cognitive inputs, striosomes may contribute to the generation of subjective states that guide behavior (Hikosaka, 2010). This perspective aligns with the idea that striosomes are involved in the representation of internal goals and the evaluation of outcomes, which are essential for adaptive behavior. In summary, the striosome-matrix architecture of the striatum is a complex and dynamic system that plays a crucial role in the coupling of volition and action. Striosomes, through their interactions with dopaminergic neurons, limbic and cognitive pathways, and neuromodulatory systems, contribute to the regulation of motivation, learning, and decision-making. Their involvement in the transformation of inputs to functional formats and the implementation of state transitions in neural circuits underscores their importance in both normal and pathological conditions. Future research should aim to further elucidate the specific mechanisms by which striosomes achieve these functions and their potential therapeutic implications.", "References": [{"title": "Neural substrates of decision making: Striatal roles in reward and punishment", "authors": "Okihide Hikosaka", "journal": "Current Opinion in Neurobiology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "20", "first page": "247", "last page": "254", "DOI": "10.1016/j.conb.2010.02.011"}, {"title": "Dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior dorsolateral striatum encode action outcomes and bias future choices", "authors": "Yukiko Hoshi, Okihide Hikosaka", "journal": "Journal of Neuroscience", "year": "2006", "volumes": "26", "first page": "13340", "last page": "13348", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3994-06.2006"}, {"title": "Striatal projection systems and basal ganglia circuitry", "authors": "Charles R.
