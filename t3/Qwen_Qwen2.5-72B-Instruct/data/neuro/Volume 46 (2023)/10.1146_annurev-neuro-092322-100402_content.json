{"Literature Review": "Flexible behavior in complex environments relies heavily on the ability to create, update, and express memories in a context-dependent manner. Recent advances in computational modeling have highlighted the critical role of contextual inference, particularly under conditions of uncertainty, which has been a less explored aspect of context-dependent learning. This literature review synthesizes findings from various levels of brain organization, including circuits, systems, and behavior, and across multiple brain regions, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the computational and neural bases of context-dependent learning. Context-dependent learning involves the integration of environmental cues to guide behavior appropriately. Early studies focused on the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation and memory formation. The hippocampus is known for its involvement in encoding and retrieving context-specific information, which is crucial for tasks requiring spatial and temporal context. However, the hippocampus alone cannot account for the full spectrum of context-dependent learning, as other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), also play significant roles. The PFC is essential for executive functions, including working memory, decision-making, and cognitive flexibility. It is particularly involved in the maintenance and manipulation of context-relevant information, allowing for adaptive behavior in changing environments. Studies have shown that the PFC interacts with the hippocampus to integrate context and guide behavior. For instance, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is implicated in the evaluation of context-based outcomes, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is involved in the selection and updating of context-appropriate actions. Recent computational models have introduced Bayesian inference as a framework for understanding context-dependent learning under uncertainty. Bayesian models posit that the brain maintains probabilistic representations of the environment and updates these representations based on incoming sensory information. This approach has been applied to explain how the brain can infer the most likely context given ambiguous or noisy inputs. For example, studies have shown that the brain can use prior knowledge and current sensory data to make optimal decisions in uncertain contexts. The thalamus, often considered a relay station for sensory information, also plays a crucial role in context-dependent learning. Thalamic nuclei, such as the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), have been shown to modulate the flow of information between the PFC and other brain regions, facilitating the integration of context-relevant information. This modulation is particularly important for tasks requiring rapid adaptation to new contexts, as the MDT can dynamically adjust the strength of connections between the PFC and other areas. Motor cortices, including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the premotor cortex (PMC), are also involved in context-dependent learning, particularly in the execution of context-appropriate motor actions. These regions receive input from the PFC and the hippocampus, integrating context-relevant information to guide motor output. For example, the PMC is involved in the preparation and selection of motor actions based on contextual cues, while M1 is responsible for the execution of these actions. Continual learning, the ability to learn and adapt over time without catastrophic forgetting, is another critical aspect of context-dependent learning. Recent studies have suggested that the brain employs mechanisms such as synaptic consolidation and replay to maintain and update memories in a context-dependent manner. These mechanisms allow the brain to integrate new information with existing knowledge, ensuring that learning is both flexible and stable. In summary, context-dependent learning is a multifaceted process that involves the integration of environmental cues and the maintenance of context-relevant information across multiple brain regions. Computational models, particularly those based on Bayesian inference, provide a framework for understanding how the brain can make optimal decisions under uncertainty. The PFC, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortices work together to support this process, enabling flexible and adaptive behavior in complex environments. Future research should continue to explore the interactions between these brain regions and the computational principles underlying context-dependent learning to further our understanding of this fundamental aspect of cognition.", "References": [{"title": "The Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory", "authors": "Howard Eichenbaum", "journal": "Annual Review of Neuroscience", "year": "2004", "volumes": "27", "first page": "277", "last page": "302", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144139"}, {"title": "An Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function", "authors": "Earl K.
