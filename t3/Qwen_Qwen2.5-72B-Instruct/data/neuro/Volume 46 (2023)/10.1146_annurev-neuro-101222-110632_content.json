{"Literature Review": "Cognition, traditionally studied through the lenses of language and introspection, has often overlooked the evolutionary and physiological underpinnings that shape cognitive processes. This review explores the concept that cognition, including memory, can be understood as an exaptation and expansion of neural circuits originally evolved for bodily functions. This perspective emphasizes the body-brain partnership and highlights how regulatory and protective mechanisms for metabolic and energetic processes have been repurposed for cognitive tasks. The evolutionary roots of cognitive mechanisms suggest that early brain circuits were primarily involved in regulating and protecting the body's metabolic and energetic states. These circuits required sophisticated computational abilities to predict and prepare for future changes in the environment, ensuring the organism's survival (Sternson & Rothman, 2014). For instance, the regulation of glucose levels, a critical aspect of homeostasis, involves complex neural networks that monitor and adjust metabolic processes in response to environmental cues (Dallman et al., 2003). As these circuits evolved, they were exapted for more advanced cognitive functions. Exaptation refers to the process by which a trait or structure originally evolved for one function is later used for a different purpose (Gould & Vrba, 1982). In the context of cognition, this means that neural circuits initially responsible for basic bodily functions were repurposed for higher-order cognitive tasks such as memory and planning. For example, the hippocampal system, which plays a crucial role in spatial navigation and memory, has been shown to have dual functions in both endocrine-homeostatic regulation and memory formation (Buzsáki, 2015). The hippocampus, a key structure in the brain, is particularly well-suited for this exaptation. It is involved in the formation and consolidation of episodic memories, which are memories of specific events and experiences (Eichenbaum, 2017). During wakefulness, the hippocampus integrates sensory information and spatial cues to create a cognitive map of the environment, allowing the organism to navigate and explore its surroundings effectively (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978). This cognitive map is not just a static representation but a dynamic model that can be updated and refined based on new experiences. Moreover, the hippocampus continues to play a crucial role in memory consolidation during sleep. Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), a type of high-frequency oscillation observed in the hippocampus during sleep, are thought to facilitate the transfer of information from the hippocampus to the neocortex, a process essential for long-term memory storage (Buzsáki, 2015). SWRs are believed to replay recent experiences, reinforcing the neural connections that encode these memories (Ji & Wilson, 2007). This replay mechanism not only strengthens existing memories but also integrates them with prior knowledge, enhancing the organism's ability to make predictions and plan for future events. The exaptation of the hippocampal system for cognitive functions is further supported by its involvement in mental time travel. Mental time travel refers to the ability to mentally reconstruct past events (episodic memory) and imagine future scenarios (prospective memory) (Suddendorf & Corballis, 2007). The hippocampus's role in creating and updating the cognitive map of the environment provides a foundation for mental time travel, allowing the organism to use past experiences to inform future actions. This ability is crucial for adaptive behavior, as it enables the organism to anticipate and prepare for potential challenges and opportunities (Schacter et al., 2007). In addition to its cognitive functions, the hippocampus also contributes to the regulation of homeostatic processes. For example, the hippocampus is involved in the regulation of stress responses and the release of stress hormones such as cortisol (McEwen, 2007). Chronic stress can impair hippocampal function, leading to deficits in memory and cognitive performance (Lupien et al., 2009). This interplay between cognitive and homeostatic functions underscores the importance of the body-brain partnership in shaping cognitive processes. The exaptation of neural circuits for cognitive functions is not limited to the hippocampus. Other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, also exhibit dual functions in both cognitive and homeostatic regulation. The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions such as decision-making, working memory, and inhibitory control (Miller & Cohen, 2001). It also plays a role in the regulation of metabolic processes and energy balance (Kanoski & Grill, 2010). This suggests that the exaptation of neural circuits for cognitive functions is a widespread phenomenon, reflecting the evolutionary pressures that shaped the brain's architecture. In conclusion, the exaptation and expansion of neural circuits originally evolved for bodily functions provide a compelling framework for understanding the origins and mechanisms of cognition. By recognizing the body-brain partnership, we can gain deeper insights into how the brain's computational abilities have been repurposed for higher-order cognitive tasks. This perspective not only enriches our understanding of cognition but also opens new avenues for research and therapeutic interventions in cognitive disorders.", "References": [{"title": "The neuroendocrinology of stress and the metabolic syndrome", "authors": "Dallman, M.
