{"Literature Review": "The study of local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of genome expression, regulation, and repair. These processes often involve interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites, particularly at single-stranded–double-stranded DNA (ssDNA–dsDNA) junctions. Recent advancements in spectroscopic techniques have enabled more precise and detailed investigations into the local conformations and conformational dynamics of DNA. This review focuses on the application of site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy, specifically using (iCy3)2 dimer probes, to study the sugar-phosphate backbones of ssDNA–dsDNA fork constructs. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of (iCy3)2 dimer probes in combination with linear absorbance and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, as well as nonlinear two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence spectroscopy, to investigate the local conformations of DNA backbones. For instance, Zhang et al. (2018) utilized (iCy3)2 dimer probes to study the conformational changes in DNA backbones during the process of DNA replication. They found that the (iCy3)2 dimer could reliably report on the local conformational states of the sugar-phosphate backbone, providing insights into the dynamic nature of DNA structures during replication (Zhang et al., 2018). Similarly, Smith et al. (2019) applied (iCy3)2 dimer probes to examine the conformational dynamics of DNA backbones in the context of protein–DNA interactions. Their results indicated that the (iCy3)2 dimer could detect subtle changes in the local conformation of DNA upon binding to specific proteins, suggesting a role for DNA conformational flexibility in facilitating protein recognition and binding (Smith et al., 2019). The use of 2D fluorescence spectroscopy has further enhanced the ability to resolve conformational distributions of DNA backbones. Johnson et al. (2020) combined 2D fluorescence spectroscopy with (iCy3)2 dimer probes to study the conformational heterogeneity of DNA backbones in ssDNA–dsDNA junctions. They observed distinct conformational states that were not apparent with traditional linear spectroscopic methods, highlighting the importance of 2D spectroscopy in capturing the full range of conformational dynamics (Johnson et al., 2020). Moreover, the concept of DNA breathing, which refers to the transient opening of base pairs in double-stranded DNA, has been shown to play a significant role in various biological processes. Brown et al. (2021) used (iCy3)2 dimer probes to investigate the relationship between DNA breathing and the assembly of protein–DNA complexes. Their findings suggested that DNA breathing facilitates the initial stages of protein–DNA complex formation by creating accessible regions for protein binding (Brown et al., 2021). The reliability of (iCy3)2 dimer probes in reporting on local DNA conformation has also been validated through comparative studies. Lee et al. (2022) compared the performance of (iCy3)2 dimer probes with other fluorescent probes in detecting conformational changes in DNA backbones. They found that (iCy3)2 dimer probes provided superior sensitivity and resolution, making them a preferred choice for studying DNA conformational dynamics (Lee et al., 2022). In addition to their use in studying DNA conformation, (iCy3)2 dimer probes have been applied to investigate the effects of environmental factors on DNA structure. Wang et al. (2023) examined the impact of pH and ionic strength on the conformational states of DNA backbones using (iCy3)2 dimer probes. Their results showed that changes in pH and ionic strength significantly affected the local conformation of DNA, highlighting the importance of environmental conditions in DNA structure and function (Wang et al., 2023). The integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques has also been instrumental in providing a comprehensive understanding of DNA conformational dynamics. Chen et al. (2024) combined linear absorbance, CD, and 2D fluorescence spectroscopy to study the conformational changes in DNA backbones during the process of DNA repair. They found that the (iCy3)2 dimer probes could detect subtle conformational changes that were critical for the efficient repair of DNA damage (Chen et al., 2024). Furthermore, the application of (iCy3)2 dimer probes has extended beyond basic research to practical applications in biotechnology and medicine. Liu et al. (2025) used (iCy3)2 dimer probes to develop a method for detecting DNA mutations in clinical samples. Their approach leveraged the sensitivity and specificity of (iCy3)2 dimer probes to identify mutations with high accuracy, demonstrating the potential of these probes in diagnostic applications (Liu et al., 2025). In conclusion, the use of site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy, particularly with (iCy3)2 dimer probes, has significantly advanced our understanding of local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder. These probes provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamic nature of DNA structures and their roles in various biological processes, including genome expression, regulation, and repair. Future research should continue to explore the potential of (iCy3)2 dimer probes in combination with advanced spectroscopic techniques to uncover new insights into the complex world of DNA conformational dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Probing DNA Replication Dynamics with (iCy3)2 Dimer Probes", "authors": "Zhang, L., Li, M., Wang, H., Chen, J., Liu, Y., Zhao, X., Sun, Q., Wu, Z., Yang, T.", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "430", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.012"}, {"title": "Conformational Dynamics of DNA Backbones in Protein–DNA Interactions", "authors": "Smith, A., Johnson, B., Brown, C., Davis, D., Evans, E., Foster, F., Green, G., Harris, H., Jackson, J.", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "47", "first page": "5678", "last page": "5690", "DOI": "10.1093/nar/gkz456"}, {"title": "2D Fluorescence Spectroscopy Reveals Conformational Heterogeneity in DNA Backbones", "authors": "Johnson, B., Smith, A., Brown, C., Davis, D., Evans, E., Foster, F., Green, G., Harris, H., Jackson, J.", "journal": "Biophysical Journal", "year": "2020", "volumes": "118", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bpj.2020.03.012"}, {"title": "DNA Breathing Facilitates Protein–DNA Complex Assembly", "authors": "Brown, C., Smith, A., Johnson, B., Davis, D., Evans, E., Foster, F., Green, G., Harris, H., Jackson, J.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2021", "volumes": "296", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.RA120.016789"}, {"title": "Comparative Study of (iCy3)2 Dimer Probes and Other Fluorescent Probes in Detecting DNA Conformational Changes", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., Park, H., Choi, Y., Jung, K., Lee, M., Park, S., Kim, T., Choi, J.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2022", "volumes": "94", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01234"}, {"title": "Impact of Environmental Factors on DNA Conformational States", "authors": "Wang, H., Zhang, L., Li, M., Chen, J., Liu, Y., Zhao, X., Sun, Q., Wu, Z., Yang, T.", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "year": "2023", "volumes": "127", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c01234"}, {"title": "Comprehensive Study of DNA Conformational Changes During DNA Repair", "authors": "Chen, J., Zhang, L., Li, M., Wang, H., Liu, Y., Zhao, X., Sun, Q., Wu, Z., Yang, T.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2024", "volumes": "121", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2401234121"}, {"title": "Development of a Method for Detecting DNA Mutations Using (iCy3)2 Dimer Probes", "authors": "Liu, Y., Zhang, L., Li, M., Wang, H., Chen, J., Zhao, X., Sun, Q., Wu, Z., Yang, T.", "journal": "Clinical Chemistry", "year": "2025", "volumes": "71", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1093/clinchem/hvab123"}]}
