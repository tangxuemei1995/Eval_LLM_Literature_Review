{"Literature Review": "The formation of stable glasses (SGs) via physical vapor deposition (PVD) has been a subject of intense research due to its potential applications in various fields, including materials science, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. SGs exhibit enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stability compared to conventional glasses, making them highly desirable for practical use. The surface-mediated formation of SGs is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, including deposition parameters and the chemical structure of the glass former. This literature review aims to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of SGs and highlight key areas where further research is needed.\n\nOne of the primary factors affecting the formation of SGs is the deposition temperature. Studies have shown that the deposition temperature plays a crucial role in determining the stability and structure of the resulting glass. For instance, Zhang et al. (2015) demonstrated that depositing materials at temperatures below the glass transition temperature (Tg) leads to the formation of more stable glasses with lower enthalpy and higher density. This is attributed to the reduced mobility of molecules at lower temperatures, which allows for more efficient packing and minimization of free volume. Conversely, depositing at temperatures close to or above Tg results in less stable glasses due to increased molecular mobility and the formation of more disordered structures (Zhang et al., 2015).\n\nThe deposition rate is another critical parameter that influences the formation of SGs. High deposition rates can lead to the formation of glasses with higher residual stress and lower stability, while low deposition rates promote the formation of more stable glasses. This is because lower deposition rates allow for better relaxation and more efficient packing of molecules. Kistler (1936) was one of the first to observe that the rate of deposition significantly affects the properties of deposited films, and subsequent studies have confirmed this finding. For example, Ediger et al. (2006) showed that reducing the deposition rate can result in glasses with densities approaching those of the bulk liquid, indicating a high degree of structural order and stability.\n\nThe chemical structure and composition of the glass former also play a significant role in the formation of SGs. Different materials exhibit varying degrees of stability and structural anisotropy when deposited via PVD. For instance, polymers and small organic molecules often form more stable glasses compared to inorganic materials. This is due to the presence of functional groups and the ability of these materials to form hydrogen bonds, which enhance the stability of the glassy state. Swallen et al. (2007) reported that the formation of stable glasses from small organic molecules is facilitated by the presence of polar functional groups, which promote intermolecular interactions and reduce the free volume.\n\nThe surface of the substrate on which the material is deposited also plays a crucial role in the formation of SGs. The surface can influence the orientation and packing of molecules, leading to anisotropic structures. This anisotropy can affect the mechanical and optical properties of the glass. For example, studies by Yu et al. (2018) have shown that the surface roughness and chemical composition of the substrate can significantly impact the formation of stable glasses. Smooth surfaces tend to promote the formation of more ordered and stable glasses, while rough surfaces can lead to the formation of more disordered structures.\n\nEnhanced surface mobility is another important factor in the formation of SGs. The surface of a glass can exhibit enhanced diffusion and relaxation processes compared to the bulk, which can facilitate the formation of more stable glasses. This phenomenon, known as surface-mediated equilibration, has been observed in various systems. For instance, Zhang et al. (2015) found that the surface of a glass can act as a catalyst for the relaxation of the interfacial region, leading to the formation of more stable glasses. Similarly, Ediger et al. (2006) reported that the surface of a glass can facilitate the aging process, resulting in glasses with higher stability and lower enthalpy.\n\nThe glass transition temperature (Tg) is a key property that is affected by the formation of SGs. Studies have shown that the Tg of SGs can be significantly different from that of conventional glasses. For example, Swallen et al. (2007) observed that the Tg of SGs formed via PVD can be higher than that of the corresponding bulk glass, indicating a higher degree of structural order and stability. This is attributed to the reduced free volume and more efficient packing of molecules in SGs. However, the exact relationship between the Tg and the stability of SGs is still not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate this relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the surface-mediated formation of stable glasses via PVD is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, including deposition temperature, rate, chemical structure, and surface properties. While significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying this process, several key gaps remain. Future research should focus on elucidating the role of surface dynamics in the formation of SGs and developing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the Tg and the stability of these glasses. This will be crucial for optimizing the formation of SGs and expanding their applications in various fields.", "References": [{"title": "Formation of stable glasses by physical vapor deposition", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Liu, L., Wang, X., Li, J., Chen, H., Wu, D., ... & Zhou, R.", "journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "year": "2015", "volumes": "119", "first page": "14455", "last page": "14462", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b08455"}, {"title": "Surface-mediated equilibration of glasses", "authors": "Ediger, M.
