{"Literature Review": "Responsive, nurturing parenting is crucial for the socioemotional development of infants and young children, fostering secure, organized attachments and adequate self-regulatory capabilities (Bowlby, 1988; Ainsworth et al., 1978). However, when parents face challenges such as mental health issues, poverty, or lack of social support, their ability to provide responsive care can be significantly compromised (Cicchetti & Toth, 2009). This literature review provides an overview of interventions designed to enhance parental responsiveness and discusses three interventions with strong evidence of effectiveness: the Circle of Security (COS), Video Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD), and Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC). The Circle of Security (COS) is a group-based intervention that aims to improve parental sensitivity and understanding of their child's emotional needs (Powell et al., 2014). The intervention consists of 8 to 10 sessions and uses a video-based approach to help parents recognize and respond to their child's signals. Research has shown that COS significantly improves parental sensitivity and child attachment security (Hartman et al., 2015). For instance, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by Cooper et al. (2006) found that parents who participated in COS showed increased sensitivity and their children exhibited more secure attachment behaviors compared to a control group. Video Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) is another evidence-based intervention that focuses on enhancing parental sensitivity through video feedback (Juffer et al., 2005). VIPP-SD typically involves 6 to 8 sessions and is delivered in the home or clinic setting. The intervention uses video recordings of parent-child interactions to provide immediate feedback and guidance to parents. Studies have consistently shown that VIPP-SD leads to improvements in parental sensitivity and child attachment security (Juffer et al., 2005; Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2003). An RCT by Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. (2003) demonstrated that parents who received VIPP-SD were more sensitive and their children showed more secure attachment behaviors compared to those in the control group. Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) is a home-based intervention designed to promote sensitive caregiving and reduce harsh or intrusive parenting behaviors (Dozier et al., 2006). ABC consists of 10 sessions and is particularly effective for high-risk families, including those with maltreated children. The intervention focuses on helping parents understand and respond to their child's cues, thereby promoting secure attachment and reducing behavioral problems. Research has shown that ABC leads to significant improvements in parental sensitivity and child attachment security (Dozier et al., 2006; Bernard et al., 2012). An RCT by Bernard et al. (2012) found that children whose parents received ABC had higher levels of attachment security and fewer behavioral problems compared to those in the control group. While these interventions have strong evidence of effectiveness, there are challenges in disseminating them in community settings. One major challenge is ensuring that interventions are accessible and culturally appropriate for diverse populations (Cicchetti & Toth, 2009). Additionally, training and supervision of interventionists are critical to maintaining fidelity and effectiveness (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2003). Another challenge is sustaining funding and support for ongoing implementation and evaluation (Cooper et al., 2006). In conclusion, interventions such as COS, VIPP-SD, and ABC have demonstrated strong evidence of effectiveness in enhancing parental responsiveness and improving child outcomes. These interventions vary in duration and delivery method but share a common focus on promoting sensitive, responsive caregiving. Despite the challenges in dissemination, these interventions offer promising strategies for supporting the socioemotional development of infants and young children in at-risk families.", "References": [{"title": "Circle of Security: A Developmentally-Based Intervention for Caregivers of Young Children", "authors": "Bert Powell, Kent Hoffman, Glenn I.
