{"Literature Review": "Life-course epidemiology (LCE) is a field dedicated to understanding how exposures throughout an individual's life, from gestation to old age, influence health outcomes. These exposures can include environmental, social, and biological factors, and their effects can manifest years or even decades after the initial exposure. Despite the sophisticated models developed by LCE researchers, the field has been relatively slow to adopt robust causal inference methods, particularly quasi-experimental designs. This narrative review aims to address the tensions between these two areas by discussing the unique challenges for causal inference in LCE, the contributions of quasi-experimental methods, and potential solutions to bridge the gap between modern causal inference and LCE. The primary challenge in applying causal inference methods to LCE is the complexity and temporality of the exposures and outcomes. Unlike many other fields where exposures and outcomes are more immediate and direct, LCE often deals with long-term, cumulative, and multifaceted exposures. For instance, the impact of early-life adversity on later-life mental health can be confounded by numerous intervening factors, such as socioeconomic status, education, and social support. Traditional observational studies in LCE are prone to biases, including selection bias, confounding, and reverse causality, which can undermine the validity of causal claims. Quasi-experimental methods, such as instrumental variables (IVs), regression discontinuity designs (RDDs), and difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses, offer a way to strengthen causal inference by mimicking the random assignment of treatments found in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These methods have been increasingly applied in LCE to test life-course theories. For example, studies using IVs have leveraged genetic variants as instruments to estimate the causal effect of obesity on cardiovascular disease, thereby addressing potential confounding by lifestyle and environmental factors. Similarly, RDDs have been used to evaluate the impact of policy interventions, such as changes in school entry age, on educational and health outcomes. However, the application of quasi-experimental methods in LCE is not without limitations. One major limitation is the availability and quality of instruments. In the context of IV analysis, finding valid instruments that are strongly associated with the exposure but not directly related to the outcome can be challenging. For instance, while genetic variants can serve as strong instruments for certain exposures, they may not capture the full range of environmental and social factors that are central to LCE. Additionally, the assumptions underlying these methods, such as the exclusion restriction in IV analysis, can be difficult to verify in practice. Another limitation is the generalizability of findings from quasi-experimental studies. These methods often rely on specific contexts or populations, which may limit the external validity of the results. For example, a study using an RDD to evaluate the impact of a policy change in one country may not be generalizable to other settings with different contextual factors. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of life-course exposures and outcomes can complicate the interpretation of quasi-experimental results. Longitudinal data are essential for capturing the cumulative and dynamic nature of these exposures, but such data are often limited in scope and availability. To bridge the gap between modern causal inference and LCE, several solutions can be considered. First, redefining estimands to focus on public health impact can help align the goals of causal inference with those of LCE. Estimands that capture the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) or the population average treatment effect (PATE) can provide more actionable insights for public health interventions. Second, advanced statistical models, such as marginal structural models (MSMs) and structural nested models (SNMs), can account for time-varying confounders and intermediate outcomes, thereby improving the accuracy of causal estimates. These models have been successfully applied in LCE to estimate the causal effects of time-varying exposures, such as smoking cessation, on health outcomes. Third, longitudinal instrumental variables approaches can leverage detailed residential histories and other linked data to identify valid instruments for long-term exposures. For example, residential mobility patterns can serve as instruments for neighborhood-level exposures, such as air pollution or access to healthcare. Fourth, triangulation across multiple methods, including both quasi-experimental and traditional observational approaches, can enhance the robustness of causal inferences. Adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference, where multiple lines of evidence are considered, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships in LCE. In conclusion, while the integration of causal inference methods into LCE presents significant challenges, it also offers substantial opportunities to advance our understanding of the life-course determinants of health. By addressing the limitations of quasi-experimental methods and leveraging advanced statistical techniques, researchers can bridge the divide between these two areas and contribute to more effective public health interventions.", "References": [{"title": "A life course approach to chronic disease epidemiology", "authors": "Ben-Shlomo, Y., Kuh, D.", "journal": "Annual Review of Public Health", "year": "2002", "volumes": "23", "first page": "329", "last page": "365", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140535"}, {"title": "Causal Inference", "authors": "Hernán, M.
