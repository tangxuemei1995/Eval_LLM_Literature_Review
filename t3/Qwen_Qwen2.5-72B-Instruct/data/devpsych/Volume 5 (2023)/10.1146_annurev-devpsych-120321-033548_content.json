{"Literature Review": "The representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy has been a subject of extensive research, revealing that infants possess sophisticated abilities to infer the intentions and goals of others. However, the mechanisms underlying these inferences remain poorly understood. This literature review aims to synthesize current findings and propose a framework for understanding how infants interpret helping actions. Infants' ability to understand helping actions has been well-documented through various experimental paradigms. For instance, Warneken and Tomasello (2006) demonstrated that 18-month-old infants can recognize and respond to the needs of others, offering help when an adult is struggling to achieve a goal. Similarly, Hamlin et al. (2007) found that even younger infants, at 6 months of age, show a preference for characters who help others over those who hinder them. These findings suggest that infants have a rudimentary understanding of helping behavior from a very early age. To understand how infants come to grasp helping actions, it is essential to consider the cognitive prerequisites involved. One key aspect is goal attribution, the ability to infer the goals of others. Csibra and Gergely (2009) proposed that infants use teleological reasoning to interpret actions, attributing goals to agents based on the outcomes of their behaviors. This ability is crucial for understanding helping, as it allows infants to recognize that one agent's actions are directed towards facilitating another's goals. However, the mature concept of helping involves more than just goal attribution. It also requires a second-order understanding, where the helper's actions are seen as aimed at increasing the utility of the helpee's goal-directed action. This mature concept involves a complex interplay of goal attribution and utility calculus, which may not be fully developed in infancy. Instead, infants might rely on simpler alternatives to interpret helping actions. One such alternative is the concept of helping as enabling. According to this view, helping is understood as an action that enables the helpee to achieve their goal, without necessarily involving a detailed utility calculus. This simpler form of goal attribution is sufficient for infants to recognize helping behavior. For example, Woodward (1998) showed that 6-month-old infants can distinguish between goal-directed and non-goal-directed actions, suggesting that they can attribute goals to agents and recognize actions that facilitate these goals. Another alternative is the concept of helping as joint action. This perspective emphasizes the efficiency of actions and the coordination between agents. Infants might interpret helping as a form of joint action where the helper and helpee work together to achieve a common goal. This interpretation does not require second-order goal attribution but focuses on the efficiency and coordination of actions. Meltzoff and Moore (1994) found that infants as young as 14 months can imitate the actions of others, indicating an early understanding of coordinated actions. While these simpler concepts provide a foundation for understanding helping actions, they do not fully capture the mature concept of helping. The developmental pathway from these simpler concepts to the mature concept remains an open question. One possibility is that infants gradually build on their initial understanding of enabling and joint action, developing a more sophisticated concept of helping over time. This process may involve the integration of goal attribution and utility calculus, leading to a more nuanced understanding of helping behavior. Several studies support this developmental trajectory. For example, Baillargeon et al. (2010) found that 3-month-old infants can track the goals of agents and predict their future actions, suggesting an early sensitivity to goal-directed behavior. As infants grow older, their understanding of helping becomes more refined. Paulus et al. (2013) showed that 18-month-old infants can differentiate between helpful and unhelpful actions, indicating a more advanced understanding of the utility of actions. However, the transition from simpler to more complex concepts of helping is not well-understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms that drive this development. One approach is to investigate the role of social experience in shaping infants' understanding of helping. For instance, Kuhlmeier et al. (2003) found that infants' exposure to social interactions influences their ability to attribute goals to others. This suggests that social experience plays a crucial role in the development of helping concepts. In conclusion, while infants demonstrate an early understanding of helping actions, the mechanisms underlying this understanding are still being explored. The mature concept of helping, which involves second-order goal attribution and utility calculus, may develop gradually from simpler concepts such as enabling and joint action. Future research should focus on identifying the cognitive and social factors that contribute to this developmental trajectory, providing a more comprehensive account of how infants come to understand helping interactions.", "References": [{"title": "Altruistic helping in human infants and young chimpanzees", "authors": "Felix Warneken, Michael Tomasello", "journal": "Science", "year": "2006", "volumes": "311", "first page": "1301", "last page": "1303", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1121448"}, {"title": "Social evaluation by preverbal infants", "authors": "J.
