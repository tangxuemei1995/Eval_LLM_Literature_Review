{"Literature Review": "Adolescence is a critical period marked by significant biological, psychological, and social changes. This stage of life is characterized by rapid brain development, which is influenced by both internal and external factors. The neuroecosocial perspective integrates insights from neuroscience, ecology, and social sciences to provide a comprehensive understanding of adolescent development and mental health. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors that shape adolescent mental health, with a particular focus on socioeconomic inequality, urbanicity, and eco-anxiety. Recent advances in developmental cognitive neuroscience have elucidated the neural mechanisms underlying adolescent brain development. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions such as decision-making, impulse control, and emotional regulation, undergoes significant maturation during adolescence. This protracted development is thought to contribute to the heightened risk of mental health issues observed in this age group. For instance, disruptions in the development of the prefrontal cortex have been linked to increased vulnerability to conditions such as depression and anxiety. Socioeconomic inequality is a pervasive social determinant of adolescent mental health. Research has consistently shown that adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at higher risk for mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. The mechanisms through which socioeconomic status (SES) influences mental health are multifaceted, encompassing factors such as chronic stress, limited access to healthcare, and exposure to adverse environments. Chronic stress, in particular, can have detrimental effects on brain development, leading to alterations in the structure and function of key brain regions involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control. Urbanicity, or the degree of urbanization, is another important factor that impacts adolescent mental health. Studies have found that adolescents living in urban areas are more likely to experience mental health issues compared to their rural counterparts. Urban environments are often characterized by high levels of noise, pollution, and social isolation, which can contribute to increased stress and mental health problems. Additionally, the lack of green spaces and natural environments in urban settings may exacerbate these negative effects. Eco-anxiety, or the chronic fear of environmental doom, is an emerging concern among adolescents. The increasing awareness of climate change and its potential consequences can lead to feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and depression. Research has shown that eco-anxiety is particularly prevalent among younger generations, who are more likely to perceive the threat of climate change as an immediate and personal issue. The psychological impact of eco-anxiety is further compounded by the lack of effective coping mechanisms and support systems, which can exacerbate mental health problems. Youth-led methods have emerged as a promising approach to addressing the mental health challenges faced by adolescents. These methods empower young people to take an active role in research and intervention design, ensuring that their unique perspectives and needs are taken into account. By involving adolescents in the decision-making process, youth-led methods can enhance the relevance and effectiveness of mental health interventions. For example, a study by Flicker et al. demonstrated that youth-led participatory action research can lead to more culturally sensitive and contextually appropriate mental health programs. In conclusion, the neuroecosocial perspective provides a valuable framework for understanding the complex interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors that shape adolescent mental health. Socioeconomic inequality, urbanicity, and eco-anxiety are critical social determinants that can significantly impact the well-being of young people. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, researchers and practitioners can develop more holistic and effective strategies to promote mental health and resilience among adolescents.", "References": [{"title": "The social brain in adolescence", "authors": "Sarah-Jayne Blakemore", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "269", "last page": "280", "DOI": "10.1038/nrn.2018.14"}, {"title": "The storm and stress of adolescence: Insights from human imaging and mouse genetics", "authors": "B.J.
