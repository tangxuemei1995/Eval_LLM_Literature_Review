{"Literature Review": "Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a well-documented temperament profile characterized by heightened reactivity to sensory stimuli in infancy, reticence toward social cues in childhood, and the later emergence of social anxiety in adolescence (Kagan, Reznick, & Snidman, 1988). Over four decades, extensive research has explored the antecedents and consequences of BI, yet a comprehensive understanding of the developmental pathways from temperament to disorder remains elusive. This review proposes a two-hit model to elucidate these pathways, focusing on critical periods in infancy and adolescence where specific stressors or 'hits' can significantly influence the trajectory from BI to anxiety disorders. The first hit occurs during infancy, encompassing both prenatal and early postnatal periods. Caregiver distress, including maternal stress and anxiety during pregnancy, has been shown to have profound effects on the developing fetus. Prenatal exposure to maternal stress is associated with altered neurodevelopment, particularly in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which are key regions involved in emotional regulation and social behavior (Buss et al., 2017). Postnatally, caregiver distress can manifest as inconsistent or insensitive caregiving, which can further exacerbate the infant's reactivity and contribute to the development of BI (Crockenberg & Leerkes, 2006). Research has consistently demonstrated that infants who exhibit BI show heightened physiological arousal and attentional biases toward threat-related stimuli (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols, & Ghera, 2005). These attentional biases are thought to be mediated by the amygdala, which plays a crucial role in the processing of emotional information. The amygdala's hyperactivity in BI infants may be a result of early life stress, such as caregiver distress, which can lead to a sensitized fear response and increased vigilance to potential threats (Bar-Haim, Lamy, Pergamin, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2007). The second hit occurs during adolescence, a period marked by significant social and cognitive changes. Adolescents with a history of BI are particularly vulnerable to social reorientation, a process where they must navigate new social environments and peer relationships. Social reorientation can be challenging for individuals with BI, as it requires them to engage in social interactions that may be perceived as threatening or anxiety-provoking (Pine, 2007). This period is also characterized by the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions such as impulse control, decision-making, and emotional regulation (Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005). Adolescents with BI may experience heightened social anxiety due to the interplay between their pre-existing attentional biases and the demands of social reorientation. The prefrontal cortex, which is still developing during adolescence, may struggle to regulate the amygdala's hyperactivity, leading to an overactive fear response and increased anxiety (Paus, Keshavan, & Giedd, 2008). This dysregulation can be exacerbated by social stressors, such as peer rejection or bullying, which are common during this developmental stage (Hawker & Boulton, 2000). The two-hit model posits that the combination of early life stress (hit 1) and social reorientation (hit 2) creates a unique developmental challenge for individuals with BI. The first hit sensitizes the individual to threat-related stimuli, while the second hit amplifies the anxiety response through the demands of social reorientation. This model provides a framework for understanding how specific stressors at different developmental stages can interact to influence the trajectory from BI to anxiety disorders. However, several open questions remain in this conceptual model. For instance, the mechanisms underlying the transition from BI to anxiety disorders are not fully understood. While attentional biases and amygdala hyperactivity are well-documented, the role of other cognitive processes, such as working memory and cognitive flexibility, in this transition remains unclear (Eisenberg, Spinrad, & Eggum, 2010). Additionally, the model does not account for individual differences in resilience and protective factors that may mitigate the impact of early life stress and social reorientation. Future research should aim to address these gaps by examining the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the transition from BI to anxiety disorders. Longitudinal studies that track individuals from infancy through adolescence can provide valuable insights into the developmental trajectories and the factors that influence these pathways. Furthermore, interventions that target attentional biases and social skills in early childhood and adolescence may help to reduce the risk of developing anxiety disorders in individuals with BI (Dadds, Barrett, Rapee, & Ryan, 1997). In conclusion, the two-hit model offers a promising framework for understanding the complex developmental pathways from BI to anxiety disorders. By focusing on critical periods in infancy and adolescence, this model highlights the importance of early life stress and social reorientation in shaping the trajectory from temperament to disorder. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms and moderators of these pathways to inform prevention and intervention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Maternal stress modulates human fetal neurobehavioral development", "authors": "Buss, C., Davis, E.
