{"Literature Review": "The acquisition and application of norms by children have been a focal point of interdisciplinary research, integrating insights from developmental psychology, cognitive science, and anthropology. Norms, defined as collectively shared rules or standards that guide behavior, play a crucial role in promoting social coordination and cooperation (Haidt, 2007). Recent studies have highlighted that children exhibit a sophisticated understanding of norms from a very young age, suggesting that the foundations of norm psychology are deeply rooted in early development. Recent developmental research has shown that children as young as two years old can distinguish between moral and conventional norms (Turiel, 2002). Turiel's work has been instrumental in delineating the different types of norms and how children perceive them. Moral norms, which concern issues of harm and fairness, are seen as more binding and universal, while conventional norms, such as table manners, are understood to be context-dependent and less obligatory (Turiel, 2002). This distinction is critical because it reflects children's ability to navigate complex social environments by recognizing the varying degrees of normativity. Moreover, children not only recognize norms but also actively enforce them. Studies by Killen and Smetana (2003) have demonstrated that children as young as three years old will intervene when they observe others violating norms, even if they are not directly affected by the violation. This behavior indicates that children possess a sense of justice and a desire to maintain social order, which is a fundamental aspect of norm psychology. For instance, children will often correct peers who are not following the rules during a game, even if the game is not important to them personally (Killen & Smetana, 2003). The enforcement of norms extends beyond direct interactions to include third-party situations. Research by Vaish, Carpenter, and Tomasello (2012) has shown that children as young as three years old will protest when they see a third party being treated unfairly, even if they are not part of the interaction. This behavior suggests that children have a generalized sense of normativity that goes beyond personal interests. Vaish et al. (2012) argue that this early sensitivity to third-party norm violations is a key component of human cooperation and social cohesion. Children's ability to infer norms from minimal cues is another significant aspect of their norm psychology. Studies by Rakoczy, Warneken, and Tomasello (2008) have shown that children can quickly learn and apply new norms based on subtle social signals. For example, when adults perform an action in a specific way, children will often imitate the exact method, even if it is not the most efficient way to achieve the goal. This phenomenon, known as overimitation, suggests that children are not just learning the actions themselves but are also internalizing the underlying norms (Rakoczy et al., 2008). The role of cultural context in the development of norm psychology cannot be overlooked. Cross-cultural studies by Henrich et al. (2010) have revealed that while the basic mechanisms of norm acquisition and enforcement are universal, the specific norms and their applications can vary significantly across cultures. For instance, children in some cultures may place a higher value on obedience to authority figures, while children in other cultures may prioritize individual autonomy. These cultural differences highlight the importance of considering the broader social and cultural environment in which children develop their norm psychology (Henrich et al., 2010). The development of norm psychology is also influenced by children's social-cognitive abilities. Research by Wellman and Liu (2004) has shown that the development of theory of mind, or the ability to understand that others have beliefs and intentions that may differ from one's own, is closely linked to the acquisition of norms. Children who have a better understanding of others' mental states are more likely to recognize and enforce norms, as they can better predict and interpret the social consequences of their actions (Wellman & Liu, 2004). Furthermore, the role of language in the development of norm psychology is increasingly recognized. Language provides a powerful tool for transmitting norms and discussing normative concepts. Studies by Harris (2000) have shown that children's exposure to normative language, such as discussions of right and wrong, helps them internalize and apply norms more effectively. Harris (2000) argues that language serves as a scaffold for the development of normative reasoning, allowing children to articulate and reflect on their understanding of social rules. In conclusion, the literature on children's acquisition and application of norms reveals a complex and multifaceted process that begins in early childhood. Children's ability to distinguish between different types of norms, enforce them in various social contexts, and infer new norms from minimal cues demonstrates the deep roots of norm psychology in human development. Understanding these processes not only sheds light on the ontogenetic origins of norm psychology but also contributes to our broader understanding of human cooperation and social cohesion. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between biological, cognitive, and cultural factors in the development of norm psychology, providing deeper insights into the unique aspects of human social behavior.", "References": [{"title": "The New Synthesis in Moral Psychology", "authors": "Jonathan Haidt", "journal": "Science", "year": "2007", "volumes": "316", "first page": "998", "last page": "1002", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1137650"}, {"title": "Children's Social Reasoning About Intergroup Situations Involving Equality, Need, and Merit", "authors": "May Ling Halim, Melanie Killen, Judith G.
