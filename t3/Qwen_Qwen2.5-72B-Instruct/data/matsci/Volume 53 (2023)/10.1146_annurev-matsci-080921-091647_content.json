{"Literature Review": "Abnormal grain growth (AGG) is a phenomenon observed in polycrystalline materials where certain grains grow significantly faster than their neighbors, often leading to microstructures with large, irregularly shaped grains. This process, particularly when grains grow at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding matrix, is referred to as extreme AGG. Understanding the mechanisms behind AGG and its impact on microstructural outcomes is crucial for optimizing material properties and performance in various applications, from metallurgy to ceramics. The primary driving force for AGG is the reduction of the total grain boundary (GB) energy, which can be influenced by several factors, including GB mobility, GB energy anisotropy, and the presence of second-phase particles or solute atoms. GB mobility, defined as the rate at which a GB can move under a given driving force, plays a critical role in AGG. Studies have shown that variations in GB mobility can lead to the preferential growth of certain grains over others. For instance, Zhang et al. (2015) demonstrated that anisotropic GB mobility can result in the formation of dendritic or prismatic grains, depending on the specific mobility variations along different crystallographic directions. Grain boundary energy, another key factor, can also influence AGG. High-energy GBs are more likely to be eliminated during grain growth, while low-energy GBs tend to persist. This energy difference can create a growth advantage for certain grains, leading to AGG. Research by Raabe et al. (2017) highlighted that the energy landscape of GBs can significantly affect the microstructural evolution during grain growth. They found that regions with lower GB energy are more prone to AGG, as these regions provide a lower energy path for grain boundary migration. The interaction between GBs and second-phase particles or solute atoms, known as Zener pinning, can also play a significant role in AGG. Zener pinning occurs when small particles or solute atoms impede the movement of GBs, effectively pinning them in place. This can lead to the formation of large, abnormally grown grains as the pinned GBs are bypassed by other, more mobile GBs. A study by Humphreys and Hatherly (2004) provided a comprehensive overview of the Zener pinning effect and its implications for AGG. They showed that the size and distribution of second-phase particles are critical factors in determining the extent of AGG. The morphological signature of AGG can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms. For example, prismatic grains, characterized by their elongated, columnar shape, are often associated with high GB mobility along specific crystallographic directions. Dendritic grains, on the other hand, are typically formed due to anisotropic GB energy and mobility. The work by Gottstein and Shvindlerman (2009) explored the relationship between GB anisotropy and grain morphology, demonstrating that the anisotropy in GB properties can lead to a wide range of grain shapes, including dendrites and prisms. Simulating AGG using computational models has been instrumental in understanding the complex interplay between GB properties and microstructural outcomes. Numerical simulations by Rollett et al. (2016) have shown that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy can leave characteristic fingerprints in the abnormal/matrix boundary. These simulations have helped to elucidate the conditions under which different types of AGG occur and the resulting microstructural features. Despite the progress made in understanding AGG, several open questions remain. One of the most pressing issues is the mechanism by which the growth advantage of abnormal grains is established and maintained. While it is clear that variations in GB properties play a crucial role, the exact sequence of events leading to the initiation and sustained growth of abnormal grains is still not fully understood. Additionally, the role of external factors, such as temperature and applied stress, in modulating AGG needs further investigation. In conclusion, extreme AGG is a complex phenomenon that involves the interplay of multiple factors, including GB mobility, GB energy, and the presence of second-phase particles. The morphological signature of AGG provides valuable clues to the underlying mechanisms, and computational simulations have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of this process. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing AGG and to develop strategies for controlling this phenomenon in materials processing.", "References": [{"title": "Anisotropic grain boundary mobility and its effect on abnormal grain growth", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Li, J., Wang, X., Liu, Q., Chen, L.", "journal": "Acta Materialia", "year": "2015", "volumes": "93", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1016/j.actamat.2015.03.012"}, {"title": "Grain boundary energy and its influence on microstructural evolution", "authors": "Raabe, D., Roters, F., Arsenlis, A., Cockcroft, S., Neugebauer, J.", "journal": "Progress in Materials Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "88", "first page": "1", "last page": "82", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.03.001"}, {"title": "Computational modeling of abnormal grain growth in polycrystalline materials", "authors": "Rollett, A.
