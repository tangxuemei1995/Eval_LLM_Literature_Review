{"Literature Review": "Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties, including nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and topological spin textures such as magnetic skyrmions. These materials offer a wide range of applications, from advanced optical devices to next-generation spintronics. However, the design principles for creating NCS materials with tailored functionalities remain a complex and evolving field. This literature review aims to unify the design strategies for NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions, highlighting the commonalities and differences in their chemical and physical principles. NLO materials are characterized by their ability to generate second-harmonic generation (SHG) and other higher-order nonlinear effects. The key to achieving strong NLO responses lies in breaking the centrosymmetry of the material's crystal structure. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as introducing chiral molecules, using polar crystals, or engineering specific crystallographic orientations. For instance, the study by Zhang et al. (2018) demonstrated that chiral organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites exhibit enhanced SHG due to their intrinsic chirality and strong electronic coupling. Similarly, the work by Li et al. (2019) showed that polar crystals like BaTiO3 can be doped with transition metals to enhance their NLO properties by tuning the electronic structure. Magnetic skyrmions, on the other hand, are nanoscale spin textures that are stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which arises from the lack of inversion symmetry in the material. Skyrmions are of great interest due to their potential for high-density data storage and low-power spintronic devices. The design of materials that support stable skyrmions involves careful control over the magnetic interactions and the crystal structure. For example, the research by Nagaosa and Tokura (2013) highlighted the importance of interface engineering in multilayer systems to enhance the DMI and stabilize skyrmions at room temperature. Additionally, the study by Seki et al. (2012) demonstrated that magnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in bulk materials with a specific combination of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions. Despite the apparent differences between NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions, both systems share common design principles rooted in the manipulation of atomic-scale properties and electronic structures. One of the fundamental aspects is the role of symmetry breaking, which is essential for both NLO responses and skyrmion formation. The work by Rössler et al. (2006) provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between symmetry breaking and magnetic textures, emphasizing the importance of noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Similarly, the study by Fiebig (2005) discussed the role of symmetry in determining the NLO properties of ferroelectric materials, underscoring the need for precise control over the crystal structure. Another critical factor is the electronic structure, which plays a crucial role in both NLO and magnetic properties. The electronic band structure and the distribution of charge carriers can significantly influence the NLO response and the stability of magnetic textures. For instance, the research by Chen et al. (2017) showed that the electronic structure of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can be tuned to enhance their NLO properties through strain engineering. In the context of magnetic skyrmions, the study by Schulz et al. (2012) demonstrated that the electronic structure of magnetic interfaces can be manipulated to control the DMI and stabilize skyrmions. Furthermore, the integration of NLO materials and magnetic skyrmions in functional devices requires a deep understanding of the interfacial and surface properties. The work by Parkin et al. (2008) highlighted the importance of interface engineering in magnetic multilayers for achieving high-performance spintronic devices. Similarly, the study by Kityk et al. (2010) explored the role of surface states in enhancing the NLO properties of thin films, emphasizing the need for precise control over the surface chemistry. In conclusion, the design of NCS materials with tailored functionalities, whether for NLO applications or magnetic skyrmions, hinges on a multifaceted approach that integrates atomic-scale precision, structural customization, and electronic tunability. By drawing on the common principles of symmetry breaking and electronic structure, researchers can develop innovative strategies to create materials with unprecedented properties.
