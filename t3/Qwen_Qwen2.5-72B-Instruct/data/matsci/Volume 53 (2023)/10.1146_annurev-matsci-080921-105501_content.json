{"Literature Review": "Polar metals represent a unique class of materials where both polarity and metallicity coexist in the same phase. This coexistence is inherently challenging due to the tendency of itinerant carriers, essential for metallicity, to screen any polarization. Despite this challenge, significant progress has been made in recent decades, leading to the identification and study of several polar metallic compounds, including LiOsO3 and WTe2. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the principles, techniques, and promising applications of polar metals.\n\n### Historical Context and Theoretical Foundations\nThe concept of polar metals was first introduced over 50 years ago, primarily through theoretical predictions. Early works by Blount (1966) and Anderson and Blount (1967) laid the groundwork by exploring the conditions under which a material could exhibit both metallic conductivity and spontaneous polarization. These studies highlighted the fundamental challenge: the screening effect of free electrons, which typically neutralizes the electric field associated with polarization. However, these early theories also suggested that certain crystal structures and electronic configurations could potentially overcome this screening effect.\n\n### Mechanisms for Combining Polarity and Metallicity\nIn the past decade, several mechanisms have been proposed to achieve the coexistence of polarity and metallicity. One prominent approach involves the use of improper ferroelectricity, where the polarization arises from the coupling of structural distortions rather than direct charge separation (Cheong and Rabe, 2007). This mechanism can reduce the screening effect because the polarization is not directly linked to the charge distribution. Another strategy involves the use of complex perovskite structures, which can host multiple types of polar distortions and itinerant electrons simultaneously (Rondinelli and Spaldin, 2011).\n\n### Experimental Realizations\nThe experimental realization of polar metals has been a significant milestone in the field. LiOsO3, discovered by Lee et al. (2014), is one of the first materials to exhibit both metallic conductivity and spontaneous polarization. This compound has a perovskite structure and shows a transition to a polar metallic state at low temperatures. Similarly, WTe2, studied by Xia et al. (2014), is another example of a polar metal, characterized by its layered structure and strong spin-orbit coupling. These materials have provided valuable insights into the interplay between polarization and metallicity.\n\n### Properties and Applications\nThe unique combination of polarity and metallicity in polar metals opens up a wide range of potential applications. In the field of topology, polar metals can host topologically non-trivial states, such as Weyl fermions, which have been observed in WTe2 (Xu et al., 2015). These topological states can lead to exotic transport phenomena, such as the chiral anomaly and negative magnetoresistance. In the context of ferroelectricity, polar metals can enhance the performance of ferroelectric devices by providing a tunable interface between polar and non-polar regions (Seidel et al., 2009). Additionally, the coupling between polarization and magnetic order in polar metals can give rise to magnetoelectric effects, which are crucial for developing multifunctional devices (Spaldin and Fiebig, 2005).\n\n### Future Directions\nWhile significant progress has been made, the field of polar metals remains in its infancy. Future research should focus on identifying new materials with enhanced polar metallic properties and understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern these properties. The development of advanced synthesis techniques, such as epitaxial growth and high-pressure methods, will be crucial for realizing new polar metallic phases (Rondinelli and Spaldin, 2011). Additionally, theoretical studies using ab initio calculations and machine learning algorithms can help predict and design new polar metallic materials (Curtarolo et al., 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, polar metals represent a fascinating and rapidly evolving area of condensed matter physics. The coexistence of polarity and metallicity in these materials offers unique opportunities for both fundamental research and technological applications. As the field continues to advance, we can expect to see the discovery of new polar metallic compounds and the development of innovative devices based on their unique properties.", "References": [{"title": "Polar Metals by Band Engineering", "authors": "E.
