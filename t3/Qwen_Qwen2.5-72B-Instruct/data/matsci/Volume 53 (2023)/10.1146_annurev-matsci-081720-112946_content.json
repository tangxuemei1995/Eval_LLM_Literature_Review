{"Literature Review": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of crystal morphology engineering and control, primarily through their ability to bind specifically to crystal surfaces via stereo-chemical recognition. While the use of TMAs has been extensively studied in solution-based crystal growth, their application in melt-grown molecular crystals remains less explored. This review aims to highlight the potential and challenges of using TMAs in melt crystallization processes, focusing on how these additives influence growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. In solution-based crystal growth, the driving force is typically governed by solute supersaturation, which represents the deviation from equilibrium conditions. This deviation can be finely controlled by adjusting the concentration of the solute and the solvent, allowing for precise manipulation of crystal growth parameters. TMAs in solution can effectively bind to specific crystal faces, altering the growth rates and leading to the formation of well-defined morphologies. However, the situation is more complex in melt crystallization, where undercooling becomes the primary thermodynamic parameter influencing crystallization outcomes. Undercooling, defined as the temperature difference between the melting point of the material and the actual temperature at which crystallization occurs, plays a crucial role in determining the growth kinetics and morphology of melt-grown crystals. When the undercooling is small, the driving force for crystallization is relatively low, and diffusion processes dominate. In such conditions, TMAs can effectively interact with the growing crystal surfaces, similar to their behavior in solution. This interaction can lead to the formation of well-faceted single crystals with rich stereochemical features, as observed in solution growth. However, as the undercooling increases, the driving force for crystallization becomes significantly larger, leading to rapid nucleation and growth. Under these conditions, the growth of crystals can become more chaotic, often resulting in the formation of spherulitesâ€”radial ensembles of crystals that can mask the stereochemical information provided by TMAs. This phenomenon poses a significant challenge in understanding and controlling the influence of TMAs on melt-grown crystals. To overcome this challenge, new optical tools and techniques are required to probe the early stages of crystal growth and to visualize the interactions between TMAs and the growing crystal surfaces. One of the key applications of TMAs in melt crystallization is the control of chirality and polarity. Chiral molecules can form crystals with distinct handedness, and TMAs can be designed to selectively bind to one enantiomeric form, thereby promoting the growth of crystals with a specific chirality. This is particularly important in pharmaceutical and materials science, where the chirality of a molecule can significantly affect its properties and performance. Similarly, TMAs can influence the polarity of crystals by binding to specific polar axes, which can be crucial for applications in optoelectronics and nonlinear optics. Despite the challenges, several studies have demonstrated the successful use of TMAs in melt crystallization. For example, Chen et al. reported the use of TMAs to control the growth of twisted crystals in a melt, achieving well-defined morphologies that were not possible without the additives. Similarly, Zhang et al. showed that TMAs could be used to promote the growth of single crystals with specific chirality, even under moderate undercooling conditions. These studies highlight the potential of TMAs in melt crystallization and suggest that with further optimization and the development of new analytical tools, TMAs can play a significant role in the engineering of melt-grown molecular crystals. In conclusion, while the use of TMAs in melt crystallization presents unique challenges due to the dominance of undercooling as the driving force, it also offers exciting opportunities for the precise control of crystal morphology, chirality, and polarity. Future research should focus on developing a deeper understanding of the interactions between TMAs and growing crystal surfaces under different undercooling conditions, as well as on the development of advanced optical tools to visualize these interactions. By addressing these challenges, the full potential of TMAs in melt crystallization can be realized, opening new avenues for the design and synthesis of advanced materials.", "References": [{"title": "Tailor-made additives for the control of crystal morphology in solution", "authors": "A.
