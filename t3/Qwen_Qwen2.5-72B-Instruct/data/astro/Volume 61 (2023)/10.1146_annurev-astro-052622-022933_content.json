{"Literature Review": "Circumbinary accretion is a complex and dynamic process that plays a crucial role in the evolution of various astrophysical systems, from stellar binaries to supermassive black hole binaries. This review synthesizes recent findings on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, focusing on time variability, angular momentum transfer, and the secular evolution of these systems. Time variability in circumbinary accretion is a well-documented phenomenon, often modulated by the binary period Pb or approximately 5Pb, depending on the binary's eccentricity eb and mass ratio qb (Artymowicz & Lubow, 1994; Muñoz & Lai, 2016). This variability arises from the interaction between the binary and the circumbinary disk, leading to periodic changes in the accretion rate. For example, simulations by Artymowicz and Lubow (1994) showed that the accretion rate can vary significantly over the binary period, with peaks occurring when the binary components are closest to each other. More recent work by Muñoz and Lai (2016) further refined these models, demonstrating that the variability can also be influenced by the disk's eccentricity and the binary's mass ratio. The inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structures, which can modulate the accretion and affect physical processes within the disk. These structures are particularly important for understanding the formation and migration of planets in circumbinary systems (Paardekooper et al., 2012; Lines et al., 2014). Paardekooper et al. (2012) used hydrodynamic simulations to show that the eccentricity of the inner disk can significantly affect the migration rates of planets, potentially leading to different outcomes compared to single-star systems. Lines et al. (2014) extended this work by exploring the long-term evolution of circumbinary disks and found that the eccentricity can persist over long timescales, influencing the overall disk structure and planet formation. Over long timescales, circumbinary accretion can steer binaries toward equal masses, but it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution of the binary depends on its parameters, such as eb and qb, as well as the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas (Shi et al., 2012; Rafikov, 2016). Shi et al. (2012) conducted numerical simulations to study the mass transfer and angular momentum exchange in circumbinary disks, finding that the binary's mass ratio can evolve toward unity, driven by the accretion process. However, Rafikov (2016) noted that the outcome can vary depending on the initial conditions and the properties of the gas, highlighting the complexity of these systems. Misaligned disks around low-eccentricity binaries tend to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation, but when the binary has a significant eccentricity, the disk can evolve toward 'polar alignment,' where the disk plane is perpendicular to the binary plane (Facchini et al., 2013; Nixon et al., 2013). Facchini et al. (2013) used magnetohydrodynamic simulations to explore the evolution of misaligned disks and found that the alignment process is driven by the interplay between viscous torques and gravitational torques from the binary. Nixon et al. (2013) further investigated the conditions under which polar alignment occurs, showing that it is more likely for high-eccentricity binaries. Observations of protoplanetary disks provide valuable insights into the dynamics of circumbinary accretion. For instance, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed several circumbinary disks with distinct morphologies, including gaps and rings, which are consistent with theoretical predictions (Jensen & Mathieu, 1997; Kraus et al., 2012). Jensen and Mathieu (1997) conducted a comprehensive survey of young binary systems and found that circumbinary disks are common, with many showing signs of ongoing accretion. Kraus et al. (2012) used ALMA to observe the circumbinary disk around the young binary system GG Tau A, providing detailed images of the disk structure and confirming the presence of a gap, likely carved by the binary's gravitational influence. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in large disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks (Bartos et al., 2017; McKernan et al., 2017). Bartos et al. (2017) proposed that the dynamical interactions within AGN disks can drive the inspiral and eventual merger of black hole binaries, contributing to the observed population of gravitational wave sources. McKernan et al. (2017) further explored the implications of this scenario, suggesting that the accretion process in AGN disks can enhance the merger rate by providing additional angular momentum loss mechanisms. In summary, circumbinary accretion is a multifaceted process that influences the dynamics and evolution of a wide range of astrophysical systems. Recent studies have shed light on the time variability, angular momentum transfer, and secular evolution of these systems, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior. Observational evidence from protoplanetary disks and theoretical models of AGN disks further support the importance of circumbinary accretion in shaping the universe.", "References": [{"title": "Dynamics of Circumbinary Disks", "authors": "P.
