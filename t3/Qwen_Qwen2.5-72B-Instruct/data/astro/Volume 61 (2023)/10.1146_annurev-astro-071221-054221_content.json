{"Literature Review": "Interstellar interlopers, or objects that originate from outside our Solar System and pass through it, have recently become a focal point of astronomical research due to the discovery of 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects provide a unique opportunity to study the composition and dynamics of materials from other star systems, offering insights into the processes of planetary formation and the distribution of matter in the galaxy. The first interstellar interloper, 1I/‘Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017 by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope (Meech et al., 2017). Its elongated shape and lack of detectable cometary activity initially puzzled astronomers, leading to various hypotheses about its origin and nature. ‘Oumuamua's trajectory and speed indicated that it was not bound to the Sun, confirming its interstellar origin. The object's unusual properties, including its high aspect ratio and non-gravitational acceleration, suggested that it might be a fragment of a larger body or a product of a unique formation process (Bannister et al., 2019). In contrast, 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, exhibited more typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and a tail composed of gas and dust (Fitzsimmons et al., 2019). This object's cometary features aligned more closely with what astronomers expected from an interstellar visitor, reinforcing the idea that interstellar objects can vary significantly in their physical properties. Borisov's detection also highlighted the importance of continued monitoring and rapid response to transient astronomical events (Knight et al., 2020). The differences between ‘Oumuamua and Borisov raise questions about the diversity of interstellar objects and the conditions under which they form. Both objects showed evidence of non-gravitational forces, which could be attributed to outgassing or other mechanisms (Trujillo & Sheppard, 2014). This phenomenon is not uncommon in comets within our Solar System, but its presence in interstellar objects suggests that similar processes may occur in other star systems. The estimated number density of interstellar interlopers in the Milky Way is approximately 0.1 AU−3 (Do et al., 2018). If this density is uniform across the galactic disk, it implies the existence of 10^25 to 10^26 similar objects in the Milky Way. This vast population of interstellar objects provides a new frontier for understanding the distribution and evolution of matter in the galaxy. The formation and ejection of interstellar interlopers are believed to occur in protoplanetary disks around young stars. Numerical simulations suggest that gravitational interactions during the early stages of planetary system formation can eject large numbers of small bodies into interstellar space (Raymond et al., 2018). These simulations help explain the observed properties of ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, although the exact mechanisms responsible for their diverse characteristics remain a subject of ongoing research. Observations of interstellar interlopers also have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life. While neither ‘Oumuamua nor Borisov has shown signs of biological activity, the potential for interstellar objects to carry organic molecules or even microbial life cannot be ruled out (Lingam & Loeb, 2019). Future missions and telescopes, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), are expected to increase the rate of discovery of interstellar objects, providing more data to test these hypotheses (Ivezić et al., 2019). In conclusion, the study of interstellar interlopers represents a new and exciting area of astronomical research. The discovery of ‘Oumuamua and Borisov has opened a window into the properties and origins of objects from other star systems, challenging existing models of planetary formation and the distribution of matter in the galaxy. Continued observations and theoretical advancements will be crucial in unraveling the mysteries of these interstellar visitors.", "References": [{"title": "A brief visit from a red and extremely elongated interstellar asteroid", "authors": "K.
