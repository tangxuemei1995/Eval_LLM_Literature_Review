{"Literature Review": "The study of the first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III) stars, is crucial for understanding the early stages of galaxy formation and the chemical enrichment of the universe. These stars form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts z ~ 30 and below, dominating the cosmic star-formation history until z ~ 15-20, when the formation of metal-enriched Population II stars becomes more prevalent (Bromm & Larson, 2004). The formation of Pop III stars is primarily driven by the collapse of metal-free gas clouds in the early universe. The absence of metals, which are efficient coolants, leads to higher temperatures and pressures within these clouds, resulting in a different star formation process compared to later generations of stars (Glover & Abel, 2008). Theoretical models predict that primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation, leading to the formation of small clusters of Pop III stars with a logarithmically flat mass function (Clark et al., 2011). This suggests that Pop III stars can form with a wide range of masses, from a few solar masses to several hundred solar masses. The properties of Pop III stars are significantly different from those of later generations due to their unique formation environment. Massive Pop III stars, with masses ranging from 10 to 1000 solar masses, are expected to have very short lifetimes, typically a few million years (Schaerer, 2002). These stars are also expected to be very luminous, with surface temperatures reaching up to 100,000 K, making them strong sources of ionizing radiation (Tumlinson & Shull, 2000). In extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 10^5 M_âŠ™. These supermassive stars could be the progenitors of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars (Regan & Haehnelt, 2009). The formation of such massive stars is still a subject of ongoing research, with various mechanisms proposed, including direct collapse from massive gas disks (Begelman et al., 2006). Feedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation. The intense radiation and supernova explosions from these stars can heat and ionize the surrounding gas, inhibiting further star formation (Whalen et al., 2008). However, the exact nature and extent of this feedback remain uncertain. For example, the impact of photoionization and photoheating on the interstellar medium (ISM) is still debated, with some models suggesting that the feedback can create large HII regions around Pop III stars (Wise & Abel, 2007). Direct observations of Pop III stars in the early universe remain extremely challenging due to their high redshift and faintness. However, indirect constraints from various observational methods provide valuable insights into the properties and impact of Pop III stars. One promising method is the global 21-cm signal, which can trace the neutral hydrogen in the early universe and provide information about the reionization epoch (Furlanetto et al., 2006). Gravitational waves from the mergers of black hole remnants of Pop III stars can also offer indirect evidence of their existence (Sesana et al., 2009). Stellar archeological surveys, which focus on the chemical abundances of old, metal-poor stars in the Milky Way, provide another avenue for constraining the properties of Pop III stars. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae, which would have left distinct chemical signatures (Ishigaki et al., 2018). This finding has important implications for the initial mass function (IMF) of Pop III stars and the chemical enrichment of the early universe. The study of Pop III stars is a rapidly evolving field, with significant progress made in recent years. Theoretical models and simulations continue to refine our understanding of the formation, properties, and impact of these stars. While direct observations remain challenging, indirect methods such as the global 21-cm signal and stellar archeology provide valuable constraints. Future observations with next-generation telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will likely shed more light on the elusive first stars and their role in the early universe.", "References": [{"title": "The First Stars", "authors": "Volker Bromm, Richard B.
