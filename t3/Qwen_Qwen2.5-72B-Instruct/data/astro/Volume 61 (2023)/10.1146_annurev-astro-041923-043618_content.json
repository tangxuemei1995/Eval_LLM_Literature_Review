{"Literature Review": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in the study of galaxy formation and evolution within the ΛCDM cosmogony. These simulations aim to model the complex interplay between dark matter, baryonic matter, and various physical processes that shape the observable properties of galaxies. Over the past few decades, significant advancements have been made, leading to a better understanding of the galaxy population. However, several challenges remain, particularly in accurately modeling the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the effects of feedback processes. One of the most notable successes of hydrodynamical simulations is their ability to reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies. Early simulations often struggled to match the large-scale structure of the universe, but recent advancements have significantly improved this aspect. For instance, the IllustrisTNG suite of simulations has demonstrated a remarkable agreement with observational data on the clustering of galaxies across different scales (Nelson et al., 2019). Similarly, the EAGLE project has shown that the simulated galaxy distribution closely matches the observed two-point correlation function, a key statistic for measuring spatial clustering (Schaye et al., 2015). Another area where hydrodynamical simulations have made significant strides is in reproducing the distributions of key galaxy properties such as stellar mass, size, and star formation rate (SFR). The IllustrisTNG simulations, for example, have successfully reproduced the observed stellar mass function and the size-mass relation for galaxies (Pillepich et al., 2018). The SIMBA simulations have also shown good agreement with the observed SFR functions and the main sequence of star-forming galaxies (Davé et al., 2019). These achievements provide strong evidence for the validity of the underlying physical models and the numerical methods employed. However, despite these successes, several challenges persist. One of the most significant is the accurate modeling of the CGM, which plays a crucial role in regulating the accretion of gas onto galaxies and the outflow of material driven by feedback processes. The CGM is a complex and dynamic environment, and its properties are highly sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used in simulations. For example, the FIRE-2 simulations have highlighted the importance of resolving the multiphase nature of the CGM and the impact of supernova feedback on the thermal and chemical state of the gas (Hopkins et al., 2018). In contrast, the SIMBA simulations, which use a different approach to modeling feedback, predict a more extended and diffuse CGM (Davé et al., 2019). This discrepancy underscores the need for further refinement of subgrid models and a better understanding of the physical processes governing the CGM. Feedback processes, including those from supernovae, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and stellar winds, are essential for regulating star formation and shaping the properties of galaxies. However, these processes are challenging to model due to their subgrid nature and the wide range of scales involved. The IllustrisTNG simulations have incorporated advanced AGN feedback models, which have led to a better reproduction of the observed black hole-galaxy scaling relations and the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies (Weinberger et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these models can vary depending on the specific implementation, and there is ongoing debate about the optimal approach to modeling feedback (Vogelsberger et al., 2014). Another challenge is the accurate prediction of the properties of dwarf galaxies, which are known to be sensitive to the details of feedback and reionization. The FIRE-2 simulations have shown that resolving the multiphase ISM and including detailed feedback prescriptions can lead to a better match with the observed properties of dwarf galaxies, such as their sizes and star formation histories (Fitts et al., 2017). However, other simulations, such as those from the NIHAO project, have also achieved success in this area by focusing on high-resolution simulations of individual galaxies (Wang et al., 2015). The diversity of approaches and results highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies. In addition to these challenges, there is a growing need to incorporate more sophisticated treatments of chemical enrichment and dust physics into hydrodynamical simulations. The chemical composition of galaxies and the distribution of dust can significantly affect their observable properties, such as their colors and spectral energy distributions. The SIMBA simulations have taken a step in this direction by including a detailed treatment of metallicity and dust, leading to a better match with the observed colors of galaxies (Davé et al., 2019). However, further work is needed to fully capture the complexities of chemical enrichment and dust physics. In conclusion, hydrodynamical simulations have made significant progress in modeling the galaxy population, achieving broad agreement with observations on many fronts. However, several challenges remain, particularly in accurately modeling the CGM, feedback processes, and the properties of dwarf galaxies. Addressing these challenges will require continued advancements in both the physical models and the numerical methods used in simulations. The next generation of hydrodynamical simulations holds the promise of providing even deeper insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies within the ΛCDM cosmogony.", "References": [{"title": "The IllustrisTNG simulations: public data release", "authors": "Nelson, D., Pillepich, A., Springel, V., Hernquist, L., Naiman, J., Pakmor, R., Genel, S., Vogelsberger, M., Marinacci, F., Torrey, P.", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "623", "first page": "A131", "last page": "A131", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201834018"}, {"title": "The EAGLE project: Simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments", "authors": "Schaye, J., Crain, R.
