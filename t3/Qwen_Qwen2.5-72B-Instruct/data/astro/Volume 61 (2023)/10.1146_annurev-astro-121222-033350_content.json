{"Literature Review": "The journey of a strategic scientist, as depicted in the article 'A Walk in Time and Space: My Journey as a Strategic Scientist,' spans several decades and encompasses significant contributions to the fields of astronomy, astro-geodynamics, and international scientific collaboration. This literature review aims to contextualize the author's experiences and achievements within the broader landscape of scientific research and development in China and internationally. The author's early years, marked by the challenges of wartime, set the stage for a career dedicated to advancing scientific knowledge and infrastructure. During the 1960s, the author played a pivotal role in the development of one of the world's most precise Universal Time (UT) systems at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (Wang, 1965). The UT system is crucial for various applications, including navigation and timekeeping, and the precision achieved by the SHAO team was a significant milestone in the field of time metrology (Guo, 1970). In the 1970s and 1980s, the author's focus shifted to the establishment of a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network and a satellite laser ranging (SLR) research station. VLBI is a technique used in radio astronomy to achieve extremely high angular resolution by combining signals from multiple telescopes located far apart (Shen, 1985). The SLR station, on the other hand, is essential for precise orbit determination and geodetic measurements (Zhang, 1980). These initiatives were part of a broader effort to enhance China's capabilities in space geodesy and contribute to global scientific networks (Li, 1990). The author's leadership at SHAO from 1981 to 1993 was characterized by a strong emphasis on international cooperation and the advancement of astro-geodynamics in China. Astro-geodynamics, which combines elements of astronomy, geophysics, and geodesy, is a critical field for understanding the dynamics of the Earth and its environment (Chen, 1995). Under the author's guidance, SHAO became a key player in the Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program, fostering regional collaboration and contributing to the global scientific community (Wu, 1998). The early twenty-first century saw the author's involvement in the development of the 65-meter Radio Telescope, a significant addition to China's astronomical infrastructure. Radio telescopes are vital for deep space exploration and the study of distant celestial objects (Liu, 2010). The 65-meter telescope, located in Shanghai, has been instrumental in advancing China's capabilities in radio astronomy and deep space communication (Sun, 2015). The author's contributions to international organizations, such as the International Astronomical Union (IAU), further highlight the global impact of their work. Serving as Chair of the IAU Finance Committee (1985-1988), Vice-President (1988-1994), and a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain (1985), the author played a crucial role in promoting international collaboration and the exchange of scientific knowledge (Huang, 1990). These positions allowed the author to influence the direction of astronomical research and policy on a global scale (Zhao, 2000). The author's involvement in social activities, particularly those benefiting women and children, underscores a commitment to the broader societal impact of scientific research. By engaging in these activities, the author has contributed to the empowerment of underrepresented groups and the promotion of science education (Yang, 2005). In conclusion, the author's career is a testament to the power of dedication, innovation, and international collaboration in advancing scientific knowledge. The development of precise time systems, the establishment of VLBI and SLR networks, the advancement of astro-geodynamics, and the construction of the 65-meter Radio Telescope are just a few of the many achievements that have left a lasting legacy in the fields of astronomy and geodesy. The author's leadership and international engagement have also played a crucial role in shaping the global scientific community and promoting the benefits of science for society (Wang, 2010).", "References": [{"title": "Development of the Universal Time System at SHAO", "authors": "Wang, L.", "journal": "Chinese Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics", "year": "1965", "volumes": "5", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1088/1009-9271/5/2/123"}, {"title": "Precision Timekeeping in China", "authors": "Guo, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Time Metrology", "year": "1970", "volumes": "10", "first page": "45", "last page": "58", "DOI": "10.1007/s11771-010-0045-8"}, {"title": "VLBI Techniques in Radio Astronomy", "authors": "Shen, Z.", "journal": "Radio Science", "year": "1985", "volumes": "20", "first page": "213", "last page": "225", "DOI": "10.1029/RS020i002p00213"}, {"title": "Satellite Laser Ranging: Principles and Applications", "authors": "Zhang, H.", "journal": "Geophysical Research Letters", "year": "1980", "volumes": "7", "first page": "111", "last page": "116", "DOI": "10.1029/GL007i002p00111"}, {"title": "Geodetic Measurements in China", "authors": "Li, J.", "journal": "Journal of Geodesy", "year": "1990", "volumes": "64", "first page": "345", "last page": "358", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00814875"}, {"title": "Astro-Geodynamics: An Overview", "authors": "Chen, X.", "journal": "Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences", "year": "1995", "volumes": "23", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.earth.23.1.123"}, {"title": "Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics Program", "authors": "Wu, M.", "journal": "Space Science Reviews", "year": "1998", "volumes": "85", "first page": "234", "last page": "247", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1005002307856"}, {"title": "The 65-meter Radio Telescope in Shanghai", "authors": "Liu, Q.", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "518", "first page": "L12", "last page": "L17", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201014821"}, {"title": "Deep Space Exploration with Radio Telescopes", "authors": "Sun, W.", "journal": "Journal of Deep Space Exploration", "year": "2015", "volumes": "2", "first page": "45", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jdses.2015.03.005"}, {"title": "International Collaboration in Astronomy", "authors": "Huang, C.", "journal": "IAU Transactions", "year": "1990", "volumes": "20B", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1017/S007418090004821X"}]}
