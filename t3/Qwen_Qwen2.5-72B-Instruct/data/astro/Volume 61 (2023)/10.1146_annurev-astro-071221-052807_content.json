{"Literature Review": "Spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, exhibit large-scale magnetic fields with significant energy densities. The prevailing theory posits that these magnetic fields are generated and maintained by a large-scale dynamo mechanism. This literature review aims to summarize the current status of dynamo theory and highlight key findings from various numerical simulations that have been conducted to understand the complexities of galactic magnetic fields. The concept of a galactic dynamo was first introduced to explain the observed large-scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies. The dynamo mechanism operates by converting kinetic energy from turbulent motions into magnetic energy through a process known as the α-Ω dynamo (Parker, 1955). In this model, the α-effect represents the generation of poloidal magnetic fields from toroidal fields due to the helicity of turbulent motions, while the Ω-effect describes the stretching of magnetic fields by differential rotation. However, the detailed mechanisms and the conditions under which these processes operate remain subjects of ongoing research. One of the primary challenges in dynamo theory is understanding the saturation of magnetic fields. Idealized direct numerical simulations (DNS) have shown that the saturation energy density of mean magnetic fields tends to decline with increasing magnetic Reynolds number (Reynolds, 2008). This phenomenon is counterintuitive because higher magnetic Reynolds numbers typically indicate stronger turbulence, which should enhance dynamo action. The decline in saturation energy density suggests that there are additional physical processes at play, such as magnetic flux expulsion or the destruction of helical magnetic fields, which need to be better understood (Brandenburg & Subramanian, 2005). Another critical aspect of galactic dynamos is the role of small-scale dynamos. Small-scale dynamos are believed to be active throughout a galaxy's life and are thought to provide strong seed fields at early stages (Schekochihin et al., 2004). These seed fields are essential for the operation of large-scale dynamos, as they provide the initial magnetic flux that can be amplified and organized into coherent structures. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that small-scale dynamos can efficiently generate magnetic fields with microgauss strengths, which are comparable to the observed magnetic fields in galaxies (Brandenburg & Subramanian, 2005). The circumgalactic medium (CGM) has emerged as a crucial component in the study of galactic dynamos. The CGM is a vast reservoir of gas and magnetic fields surrounding galaxies, and it plays a significant role in driving dynamo action at both small and large length scales (Heesen et al., 2018). Interactions between the galactic disk and the CGM can lead to the ejection of helical magnetic fields, which helps maintain the large-scale magnetic field structure (Fujita et al., 2004). Additionally, the CGM can act as a source of turbulent energy, which can be converted into magnetic energy through dynamo processes (Vazza et al., 2017). Recent numerical simulations have focused on reproducing the global magnetic field structure of galaxies, taking into account the complex interplay between the galactic disk and the CGM. These simulations have shown that the inclusion of realistic boundary conditions, such as those derived from observations of the CGM, can significantly improve the accuracy of dynamo models (Gressel et al., 2013). For example, simulations that incorporate the effects of galactic outflows and accretion have demonstrated the importance of these processes in shaping the magnetic field structure of galaxies (Hanasz et al., 2013). Despite these advances, several open questions remain in the field of galactic dynamos. One of the most pressing issues is the role of magnetic flux expulsion in the saturation of large-scale magnetic fields. While some simulations suggest that flux expulsion can help maintain the coherence of large-scale fields, others indicate that it may lead to a decline in magnetic energy density (Sur et al., 2010). Resolving this discrepancy will require more detailed and comprehensive simulations that can capture the full range of physical processes involved. Another area of active research is the cosmological history of galaxies and its impact on dynamo action. Observations of high-redshift galaxies have revealed that magnetic fields were already present in the early universe, suggesting that dynamo processes were active even during the formation of the first galaxies (Beck, 2016). Understanding how these early magnetic fields evolved over cosmic time and how they influenced the subsequent evolution of galaxies remains a significant challenge. In conclusion, the study of galactic dynamos is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field. While significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that generate and maintain large-scale magnetic fields, many open questions remain. Future research will likely focus on the cosmological history of galaxies and the interactions between the galactic disk and the CGM, as these factors are expected to provide important insights into the operation of galactic dynamos. As observational data continue to improve and computational resources become more powerful, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated models that will help us unravel the mysteries of galactic magnetic fields.", "References": [{"title": "Hydromagnetic Dynamo Models", "authors": "E.
