{"Literature Review": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a critical component in the lifecycle of galaxies, acting as a reservoir for gas that can either fuel star formation or be expelled through galactic winds. Over the past decade, significant advancements in both observational and computational techniques have deepened our understanding of the CGM's physical processes. This review synthesizes key findings from recent studies, highlighting the interplay between various physical mechanisms that shape the CGM. One of the primary factors influencing the properties of the CGM is the balance between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling timescales are longer than free-fall timescales, the gas remains at high temperatures, typically around the virial temperature of the galaxy halo (T ∼ 10^6 K). Conversely, if cooling is rapid, the gas can cool to much lower temperatures (T ∼ 10^4 K), forming cold clouds and filaments. This dichotomy is crucial for understanding the multiphase nature of the CGM, where hot and cold gas coexist and interact. Gas inflows and outflows are essential components of the CGM's dynamics. Infalling gas, often in the form of cold streams, can provide the necessary fuel for star formation in galaxies. These cold streams are influenced by the large-scale structure of the universe, which can collimate and impart angular momentum to the gas. Outflows, driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN), can expel gas from galaxies, enriching the CGM with metals and altering its thermodynamic state. The interaction between the hot and cold phases of the CGM is a complex process involving continuous mass, energy, and momentum exchange. Turbulent mixing and radiative cooling play critical roles in this interaction. Turbulence can fragment and coagulate cold gas, leading to the formation of a broad spectrum of cold gas structures, from kiloparsec-scale filaments to subparsec-scale clouds. Radiative cooling, particularly in the presence of metallicity gradients, can further enhance the formation and stability of these cold structures. Magnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays also significantly influence the behavior of the CGM. Magnetic fields can stabilize cold gas against thermal instabilities and affect the dynamics of gas flows. Thermal conduction can smooth out temperature gradients, potentially reducing the efficiency of cooling and affecting the multiphase structure of the CGM. Cosmic rays, energetic particles produced by supernovae and AGN, can heat the gas and drive turbulence, further complicating the interaction between the hot and cold phases. Despite these advances, several key questions remain open. One of the most pressing issues is understanding the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics. How do the properties of cold gas clouds, formed through fragmentation and coagulation, influence the overall dynamics of the CGM? Additionally, the role of the CGM in the evolution of galaxies, particularly in regulating star formation and feedback processes, remains an area of active research. In conclusion, the CGM is a dynamic and complex environment shaped by a variety of physical processes. Future research will need to address the microphysical uncertainties and the intricate coupling between different scales to fully understand the CGM's role in galaxy evolution.", "References": [{"title": "Cooling Flows in Clusters of Galaxies", "authors": "G.
