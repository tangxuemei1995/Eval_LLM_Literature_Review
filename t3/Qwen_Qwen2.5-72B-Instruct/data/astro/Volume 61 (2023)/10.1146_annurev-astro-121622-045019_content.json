{"Literature Review": "Optical/Infrared (O/IR) interferometry has undergone significant advancements over the past few decades, leading to revolutionary improvements in observational capabilities. This literature review summarizes these advances and their impact on various fields of astronomy, including the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei (AGN), young stellar objects (YSOs), and stellar physics.\n\nOne of the most notable advancements in O/IR interferometry is the development of the GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). GRAVITY combines light from four 8-meter telescopes, achieving a sensitivity that is a thousand times better than earlier interferometers (Eisenhauer et al., 2017). This enhanced sensitivity allows for the observation of objects as faint as 19th magnitude, which was previously unattainable. The VLTI's ability to achieve submilliarcsecond resolution and microarcsecond precision in astrometry has led to groundbreaking results, particularly in the study of the Galactic Center (Gravity Collaboration et al., 2018).\n\nThe Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) array has also played a crucial role in advancing O/IR interferometry. With its six 1-meter telescopes and up to 330-meter baselines, CHARA offers high-resolution imaging and aperture synthesis capabilities (ten Brummelaar et al., 2005). These features have been instrumental in studying a wide range of astronomical objects, from exoplanets to YSOs and AGN (Monnier et al., 2014).\n\nThe technical advancements that have driven these improvements include the use of single-mode beam combiners, which can now combine light from up to six telescopes (Millour et al., 2013). Image reconstruction software has also evolved significantly, drawing on techniques developed for radio interferometry (Thiebaut et al., 2016). These advancements have enabled more accurate and detailed imaging of celestial objects.\n\nAdaptive optics (AO) and fringe tracking have further enhanced the performance of O/IR interferometers. AO corrects for atmospheric turbulence, improving the quality of the collected data, while fringe tracking ensures that the interference fringes remain stable during observations (Perrin et al., 2006). The combination of these technologies has been particularly effective in the GRAVITY instrument, where dual-beam interferometry has further boosted sensitivity (Eisenhauer et al., 2017).\n\nThe future of O/IR interferometry looks promising with the potential for even greater improvements. Laser guide star AO is expected to provide another order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity (Foy & Labeyrie, 1985). When combined with large separation fringe tracking, this technology will enable complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets (Perrin et al., 2006).\n\nThese advancements have had a profound impact on various areas of astronomy. For instance, the study of the Galactic Center has benefited greatly from the high-resolution and high-precision capabilities of modern interferometers. Observations of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way have provided insights into its properties and the dynamics of the surrounding environment (Gravity Collaboration et al., 2018). Similarly, the study of exoplanets has been revolutionized by the ability to directly image and characterize these distant worlds (Quanz et al., 2015).\n\nIn the realm of AGN, O/IR interferometry has allowed for the direct imaging of the inner regions of these powerful objects, providing valuable information about their structure and activity (Kishimoto et al., 2009). YSOs have also been studied in unprecedented detail, revealing the processes involved in star formation and the evolution of protoplanetary disks (Monnier et al., 2014). Finally, the study of stellar physics has been enhanced by the ability to resolve the surfaces of stars and study their atmospheres and magnetic fields (Che et al., 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, the rapid advancements in O/IR interferometry have transformed our ability to observe and understand the universe. The combination of large telescopes, advanced beam combining techniques, AO, and fringe tracking has led to a new era of high-resolution and high-sensitivity astronomy. Future developments, such as laser guide star AO, promise to further expand the capabilities of O/IR interferometry, opening up new frontiers in astronomical research.", "References": [{"title": "GRAVITY: An interferometric instrument for the combined coude focus of the VLT", "authors": "Eisenhauer, F., Schödel, R., Genzel, R., Ott, T., Abuter, R., Alexander, T., ... & Lutz, D.", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2008", "volumes": "492", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361:200810286"}, {"title": "Detection of the gravitational redshift in the orbit of the star S2 near the Galactic centre massive black hole", "authors": "Gravity Collaboration, Abuter, R., Amorim, A., Bauböck, M., Bertram, L., Blind, N., ... & Zins, G.", "journal": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "615", "first page": "L15", "last page": "L22", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201833281"}, {"title": "First results from the CHARA Array.
