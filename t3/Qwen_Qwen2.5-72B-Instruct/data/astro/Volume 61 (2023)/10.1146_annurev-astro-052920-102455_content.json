{"Literature Review": "Quasars at cosmic dawn, defined as the period when the universe was less than one billion years old, offer unique insights into the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). The discovery of hundreds of quasars at redshifts z ~ 7.6 has significantly advanced our understanding of these early cosmic phenomena (Fan et al., 2019). One of the key findings from observations of high-redshift quasars is the exponential decline in the number density of luminous quasars at z > 5. This suggests that the earliest quasars likely emerged at z ~ 10. The lack of significant evolution in the average spectral energy distribution (SED) of these quasars indicates a rapid buildup of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) environment, which is crucial for the formation and growth of SMBHs (Willott et al., 2010). Another critical observation is the presence of billion-solar-mass black holes at z > 7.5. These SMBHs must form and grow within the first 700 million years of the universe's history, a timescale that poses significant challenges to current models of black hole formation and growth. The most plausible explanation involves the combination of massive early black hole seeds with highly efficient and sustained accretion rates (Mortlock et al., 2011). This rapid growth is often accompanied by strong star formation and feedback activity in the host galaxies, which exhibit diverse morphological and kinetic properties. Notably, the dynamical masses of these host galaxies are typically lower than those implied by the local black hole/galaxy scaling relations, suggesting that the early universe had different conditions and processes governing galaxy and black hole co-evolution (Venemans et al., 2015). The study of the IGM during the EoR is another critical aspect of quasar research. HI absorption in quasar spectra provides valuable information about the state of the IGM at z ~ 5.3-6. These observations indicate that the midpoint of the EoR occurred between 6.9 < z < 7.6, with significant spatial fluctuations in IGM ionization. This variability suggests that the reionization process was not uniform across the universe, but rather proceeded in a patchy and complex manner (Becker et al., 2015). Additionally, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around high-redshift quasars shows evidence of evolving ionization structures and metal enrichment during the EoR. Observations of heavy element absorption lines in quasar spectra reveal that the CGM was already enriched with metals at these early epochs, indicating that star formation and supernova feedback were active processes even in the young universe (Dodorico et al., 2013). The rapid growth of SMBHs and the associated star formation and feedback activities in their host galaxies have profound implications for the early universe. These processes likely played a crucial role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe and the properties of the IGM. For instance, the energy and momentum injected by AGN feedback can regulate star formation and influence the thermal and chemical state of the IGM (Haiman & Loeb, 2001). Theoretical models and simulations have been developed to understand the formation and growth of SMBHs in the early universe. These models suggest that the initial seeds of SMBHs could have formed through various mechanisms, including direct collapse of massive gas clouds or the merger of stellar-mass black holes. Once formed, these seeds would need to undergo rapid accretion to reach the observed masses at high redshifts (Volonteri, 2010). Observational constraints on the growth of SMBHs and the properties of the IGM during the EoR are continuously improving with the advent of new telescopes and instruments. Future surveys, such as those planned with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will provide even more detailed insights into the early universe, potentially revealing new populations of quasars and further refining our understanding of the processes that shaped the cosmos during its infancy (Bañados et al., 2018). In summary, quasars at cosmic dawn serve as powerful probes of the early universe, providing critical insights into the formation and growth of SMBHs, the evolution of the IGM, and the processes of galaxy and structure formation during the EoR. Ongoing and future observations will continue to refine our understanding of these fundamental aspects of cosmology.", "References": [{"title": "Observational Constraints on the Evolution of Quasars at High Redshift", "authors": "X.
