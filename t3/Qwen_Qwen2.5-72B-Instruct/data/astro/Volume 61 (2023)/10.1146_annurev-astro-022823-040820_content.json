{"Literature Review": "Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, where gas and dust evolve through complex chemical and physical processes to form planetary systems. Understanding the chemistry of these disks is crucial for elucidating the conditions under which planets form and the compositions they inherit. This review focuses on the chemical evolution of volatile elements—H, O, C, N, S, and P—in protoplanetary disks, the methods used to study them, and the implications for planet formation. The chemical composition of protoplanetary disks is influenced by both inherited material from the parent molecular cloud and in situ chemical reactions. The initial composition of the disk reflects the chemical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) from which it formed. Studies have shown that the ISM contains a rich variety of molecules, including simple and complex organic species. As the disk evolves, these molecules undergo further chemical processing, leading to the formation of more complex organic molecules. One of the key aspects of disk chemistry is the distribution and evolution of volatile elements. Hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P) are particularly important because they are the building blocks of organic molecules and water, which are essential for life. Observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed that the gas and solid phases of these elements often exhibit elemental ratios that differ from those of the central star. This deviation is attributed to various processes, including the condensation of molecular carriers, chemical reactions, and dynamical effects. For instance, the condensation of water ice onto dust grains can significantly alter the O/H ratio in the disk midplane, while the photoevaporation of gas from the disk surface can change the C/O ratio. Additionally, the radial and vertical mixing of disk material can lead to variations in the elemental abundances at different locations within the disk. The study of disk chemistry relies on a combination of observational and theoretical methods. Spectroscopic observations, particularly in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength ranges, provide direct measurements of the molecular content of disks. These observations have been instrumental in identifying a wide range of molecules, including CO, HCN, HCO+, and CH3OH. However, interpreting these observations requires detailed chemical models that account for the complex interplay between gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry, as well as the effects of radiation and turbulence. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging have also enabled the spatial mapping of molecular distributions in disks, providing insights into the chemical structure and dynamics of these systems. The close relationship between chemical, physical, and dynamical processes in protoplanetary disks presents both challenges and opportunities for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. On one hand, the complexity of these interactions makes it difficult to disentangle the various factors that influence disk chemistry. On the other hand, the strong coupling between chemistry and dynamics provides a powerful tool for probing the internal structure and evolution of disks. Moreover, the chemical composition of protoplanetary disks has direct implications for the compositions of the planets that form within them. The elemental and molecular inventories of disks are thought to be reflected in the bulk compositions of planets, particularly in the case of gas giants, which accrete large amounts of gas from the disk. The study of exoplanet atmospheres has provided evidence for a diverse range of compositions, suggesting that the chemical diversity observed in disks is preserved in the final planetary systems. In conclusion, the chemistry of protoplanetary disks is a rich and dynamic field that encompasses a wide range of processes and phenomena. The chemical evolution of volatile elements in disks is shaped by a combination of inherited material and in situ reactions, leading to complex spatial and temporal variations in elemental abundances. Observational and theoretical studies have provided valuable insights into the chemical structure and dynamics of disks, and these findings have important implications for our understanding of planet formation and the origins of planetary systems.", "References": [{"title": "Ice Formation and Destruction in Interstellar and Circumstellar Environments", "authors": "S.
