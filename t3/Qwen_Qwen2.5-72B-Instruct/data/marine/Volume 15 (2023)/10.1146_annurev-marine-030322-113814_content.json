{"Literature Review": "Fishing plays a crucial role in global food security, providing a significant source of protein for millions of people worldwide. However, the environmental impact of fishing, particularly industrial fishing, has raised serious concerns about the sustainability and biodiversity of marine and freshwater ecosystems. The Sea Around Us project, initiated to address the limitations of official fisheries statistics, has emerged as a vital resource for civil society, policymakers, and researchers. This literature review examines the importance of comprehensive fisheries data, the limitations of existing data sources, and the contributions of the Sea Around Us project in enhancing our understanding of human impacts on oceans. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is the primary source of global fisheries statistics, but these data have been criticized for their inaccuracies and incompleteness. According to Zeller et al. (2016), the FAO data often underreport small-scale and artisanal fisheries, leading to a skewed perception of the true scale and impact of global fishing activities. Small-scale fisheries, which are critical for local communities and food security, are frequently overlooked in official statistics, contributing to the underestimation of total catches and the associated environmental impacts (Pauly & Zeller, 2016). To address these shortcomings, the Sea Around Us project was established to reconstruct and provide more accurate and comprehensive fisheries data. The project uses a combination of historical records, scientific literature, and local knowledge to create a database that includes catches, catch-derived indicators, and other relevant information from 1950 to the present (Pauly & Zeller, 2016). This database is freely accessible to the public, making it a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations. One of the key contributions of the Sea Around Us project is its focus on the spatial and temporal distribution of catches. By providing data at a finer geographical resolution than the FAO, the project offers a more detailed picture of fishing activities and their impacts on specific ecosystems. For example, Sumaila et al. (2012) used Sea Around Us data to analyze the economic and ecological impacts of overfishing in different regions, highlighting the need for region-specific management strategies. Similarly, Cheung et al. (2013) utilized the project's data to assess the effects of climate change on global fisheries, demonstrating the importance of considering both human and environmental factors in fisheries management. The Sea Around Us project also emphasizes the importance of catch-derived indicators in understanding the broader impacts of fishing. These indicators include measures of biodiversity loss, changes in fish population sizes, and the ecological footprint of fishing activities. Pauly et al. (2013) demonstrated how catch-derived indicators can be used to track the depletion of fish stocks and the degradation of marine ecosystems over time. By providing these indicators, the project helps to inform conservation efforts and sustainable fishing practices. Another significant aspect of the Sea Around Us project is its commitment to open data. The project's website (https://www.seaaroundus.org) offers a user-friendly interface for accessing and visualizing the data, making it accessible to a wide range of users. This openness is crucial for fostering transparency and accountability in fisheries management. According to Jacquet et al. (2010), the availability of transparent and reliable data is essential for building trust between stakeholders and ensuring effective governance of marine resources. The project's data have been widely used in various research studies, further validating its importance. For instance, Watson et al. (2013) used Sea Around Us data to investigate the global trends in marine biodiversity, while Belhabib et al. (2014) applied the data to assess the socio-economic impacts of fishing in developing countries. These studies highlight the versatility and relevance of the Sea Around Us data in addressing a wide range of research questions. Despite its contributions, the Sea Around Us project faces challenges in maintaining the accuracy and completeness of its data. The project relies on a combination of data sources, including government reports, scientific publications, and local knowledge, which can vary in quality and reliability. To address these challenges, the project continuously updates its methods and data sources, incorporating new information and feedback from the scientific community (Zeller et al., 2018). In conclusion, the Sea Around Us project has significantly advanced our understanding of the human impacts on marine and freshwater ecosystems. By providing comprehensive and accessible fisheries data, the project supports civil society, policymakers, and researchers in their efforts to promote sustainable fishing practices and protect marine biodiversity. As the global demand for seafood continues to grow, the need for accurate and transparent data will only become more critical. The Sea Around Us project stands as a model for how data science can serve the public good in the twenty-first century.", "References": [{"title": "Rebuilding global fisheries", "authors": "D.
