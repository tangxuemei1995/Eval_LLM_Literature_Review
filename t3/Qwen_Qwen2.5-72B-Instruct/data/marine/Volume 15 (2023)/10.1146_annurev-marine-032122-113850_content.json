{"Literature Review": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) has emerged as a promising yet controversial approach to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The ocean plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, absorbing approximately 25% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions annually (Sabine et al., 2004). However, enhancing the ocean's carbon sequestration capacity through OCDR poses significant challenges and requires a comprehensive sociotechnical assessment. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on OCDR, focusing on technical feasibility, financial considerations, public perception, and ethical implications. Technical Feasibility: Several OCDR methods have been proposed, including ocean alkalinity enhancement, artificial upwelling, and iron fertilization. Ocean alkalinity enhancement involves adding alkaline substances to the ocean to increase its capacity to absorb CO2 (Renforth & Henderson, 2017). This method has shown promise in laboratory settings but faces significant challenges in scaling up due to the large quantities of alkaline materials required and potential environmental impacts (Renforth & Henderson, 2017). Artificial upwelling, which involves bringing nutrient-rich deep water to the surface to stimulate phytoplankton growth, has also been explored (Keller et al., 2014). While this method can enhance carbon uptake, it may lead to unintended consequences such as oxygen depletion and changes in marine biodiversity (Keller et al., 2014). Iron fertilization, which involves adding iron to the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton blooms, has been studied extensively (Buesseler et al., 2008). Despite initial optimism, recent research suggests that the long-term effectiveness of iron fertilization in sequestering carbon is limited (Buesseler et al., 2008). Financial Considerations: The economic viability of OCDR is a critical factor in its potential deployment. The costs associated with different OCDR methods vary widely. For instance, ocean alkalinity enhancement is estimated to be relatively expensive due to the high cost of alkaline materials and the energy required for their transport and distribution (Renforth & Henderson, 2017). In contrast, iron fertilization is considered more cost-effective, but its long-term benefits are uncertain (Buesseler et al., 2008). Additionally, the lack of a clear regulatory framework and market mechanisms for carbon credits complicates the financial landscape of OCDR (Minx et al., 2018). Establishing a robust financial model that accounts for both direct and indirect costs, as well as potential revenue from carbon credits, is essential for the successful implementation of OCDR projects. Public Perception: Public acceptance is a crucial factor in the deployment of OCDR technologies. Public perception studies have shown that while there is some support for OCDR, concerns about environmental risks and the unknown long-term effects of these interventions are prevalent (Pidgeon et al., 2013). Transparency and stakeholder engagement are vital to building trust and ensuring that OCDR projects are socially acceptable (Pidgeon et al., 2013). Effective communication strategies that clearly explain the benefits and risks of OCDR can help address public concerns and foster a more informed dialogue (Pidgeon et al., 2013). Ethical Implications: The ethical dimensions of OCDR are complex and multifaceted. One of the primary ethical concerns is the potential for unintended consequences, such as ecosystem disruption and harm to marine life (Jamieson, 2014). There is also a debate about the moral responsibility of current generations to address climate change and whether OCDR represents a form of geoengineering that could be seen as a last resort or a necessary intervention (Jamieson, 2014). Additionally, the distributional impacts of OCDR must be considered, as the benefits and risks may not be evenly distributed across different regions and communities (Rayner et al., 2013). Ensuring that OCDR does not exacerbate existing inequalities and that vulnerable populations are protected is a key ethical imperative. Conclusion: In conclusion, OCDR holds potential as a tool for mitigating climate change, but its deployment requires a thorough sociotechnical assessment. Technical feasibility, financial considerations, public perception, and ethical implications are all critical factors that must be carefully evaluated. A multidisciplinary approach that integrates scientific, economic, social, and ethical perspectives is essential for making informed decisions about the future of OCDR. By addressing these considerations, stakeholders can work towards developing OCDR strategies that are effective, sustainable, and socially responsible.", "References": [{"title": "The oceanic sink for anthropogenic CO2", "authors": "C.
