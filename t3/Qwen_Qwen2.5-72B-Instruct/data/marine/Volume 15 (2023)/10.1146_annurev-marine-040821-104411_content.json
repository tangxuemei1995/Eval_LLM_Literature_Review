{"Literature Review": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which began on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico, was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history, releasing approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil into the environment (National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, 2011). The spill had profound environmental and economic impacts, affecting over 1,000 kilometers of shoreline and resulting in economic losses exceeding $50 billion (Cicchetti et al., 2012). Understanding the transport and transformation of oil following such a significant event is crucial for effective response and mitigation strategies. This literature review aims to track the Deepwater Horizon oil from its initial release at the Mississippi Canyon block 252 (MC252) wellhead, through its dispersion and transport, to its eventual fate in the environment.\n\n### Formation of the Oil and Gas Plume\nThe initial release of oil and gas from the MC252 wellhead created a complex plume structure. The high pressure and temperature at the wellhead led to the formation of a multiphase plume consisting of oil droplets, gas bubbles, and dissolved hydrocarbons (Camilli et al., 2010). The size distribution of oil droplets is a critical factor in determining the plume's behavior and the subsequent transport of oil. Smaller droplets tend to remain suspended in the water column, while larger droplets rise to the surface more quickly (Paris et al., 2012). The use of chemical dispersants, such as Corexit, further influenced droplet size and distribution, enhancing the mixing of oil with seawater and increasing the surface area for biodegradation (Zhao et al., 2011).\n\n### Behavior of Oil on the Water Surface\nOnce the oil reached the surface, it formed slicks that were subject to various physical processes, including spreading, evaporation, and emulsification. The presence of waves significantly affected the behavior of oil slicks. Waves can break up oil slicks into smaller patches, increasing the surface area exposed to air and water, which enhances evaporation and dissolution (Lehr et al., 2002). Additionally, wave action can lead to the formation of oil-in-water emulsions, which are more stable and less likely to evaporate or disperse (Fingas, 2016). These processes are crucial for understanding the fate of oil in the marine environment and for developing effective response strategies.\n\n### Massive Drifter Experiments in the Gulf of Mexico\nTo better understand the transport of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, several large-scale drifter experiments were conducted. These experiments involved deploying hundreds of drifters to track the movement of water masses and, by extension, the movement of oil (Laxague et al., 2018). The data collected from these experiments provided valuable insights into the role of ocean currents and eddies in the transport of oil. For example, the Loop Current and its associated eddies played a significant role in the transport of oil from the spill site to the Florida Keys and beyond (Liu et al., 2013). These findings highlight the importance of considering large-scale oceanographic features in oil spill response planning.\n\n### Impact of the Mississippi River on Oil Transport\nThe Mississippi River, one of the largest river systems in North America, also played a significant role in the transport and fate of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill. The river's discharge, which can vary significantly depending on seasonal and climatic conditions, influences the circulation patterns in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Wang et al., 2014). During the spill, the river's freshwater outflow created a barrier that helped to deflect some of the oil away from the coast, reducing the impact on sensitive coastal ecosystems (Dukhovskoy et al., 2015). However, the river's influence was not uniform, and in some cases, it may have contributed to the accumulation of oil in certain areas.\n\n### Formation of Oil-Particle Aggregates\nAnother important aspect of oil transport is the formation of oil-particle aggregates (OPAs). OPAs are formed when oil interacts with particulate matter in the water column, such as sediment particles or biological debris (Passow et al., 2012). These aggregates can sink to the seafloor, where they can have long-term impacts on benthic ecosystems. The formation of OPAs is influenced by factors such as the type and concentration of particulate matter, the viscosity of the oil, and the presence of surfactants (Chandrasekara and Hughes, 2017). Understanding the mechanisms of OPA formation is essential for predicting the long-term fate of oil in the environment and for assessing the potential ecological impacts.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill presented a unique opportunity to study the transport and transformation of oil in a large-scale, real-world setting. The formation of the oil and gas plume, the behavior of oil on the water surface, the impact of ocean currents and the Mississippi River, and the formation of oil-particle aggregates are all critical aspects of oil transport. While physical processes can be modeled numerically, this review has focused on providing a conceptual understanding of these processes to enhance communication among scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders. Future research should continue to explore the complex interactions between oil and the marine environment, with a particular focus on the long-term ecological impacts of oil spills.", "References": [{"title": "Initial distribution of submerged oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico", "authors": "R.
