{"Literature Review": "Tidal marshes and mangroves have gained significant attention as nature-based solutions for mitigating the impacts of coastal storms, including flooding and shoreline erosion. These ecosystems provide valuable services by reducing wave energy and stabilizing sediments, thereby enhancing coastal resilience. However, their effectiveness in hazard mitigation is context-dependent and varies based on storm characteristics, wetland properties, and broader coastal landscape dynamics. Several studies have highlighted the role of tidal wetlands in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves. For instance, Möller et al. (2014) demonstrated that salt marshes can significantly reduce wave heights, with the reduction increasing as the marsh width increases. Similarly, Spalding et al. (2014) found that mangroves can dissipate wave energy by up to 66% over a distance of just 100 meters. This wave attenuation is primarily due to the dense vegetation and complex root systems that create friction and turbulence, thereby reducing wave energy. However, the effectiveness of tidal wetlands in mitigating long-period storm surges is more limited. Storm surges, which can elevate sea levels by several meters and last for extended periods, are less effectively attenuated by wetlands. Zhang et al. (2018) noted that while mangroves and marshes can provide some level of surge reduction, the impact is generally modest compared to wave attenuation. This is because storm surges are driven by large-scale atmospheric pressure changes and wind patterns, which are not as easily influenced by local vegetation. The ability of tidal wetlands to limit erosion is another critical aspect of their protective function. Studies have shown that the roots and stems of marsh plants and mangroves help stabilize sediments, reducing erosion during storms. For example, Kirwan et al. (2016) found that salt marshes can significantly reduce sediment loss during high-energy events. However, storm damage to vegetation can compromise this protective function. Mangroves, in particular, are vulnerable to severe damage from strong winds and storm surges, which can lead to tree mortality and reduced vegetation cover. Alongi (2008) reported that mangroves can suffer substantial damage during intense storms, with recovery times ranging from months to years. The long-term persistence of tidal wetlands is also influenced by various stressors, including climate change and human activities. Climate change, characterized by rising sea levels and increased storm intensity, poses significant challenges to the sustainability of these ecosystems. Craft et al. (2009) highlighted that rising sea levels can lead to the drowning of marshes and mangroves, particularly in areas with low sediment supply. Additionally, human activities such as land reclamation, pollution, and altered hydrology can further degrade wetland health and reduce their capacity to provide protective services. Adaptive management strategies are essential for ensuring the continued effectiveness of nature-based coastal defense projects. These strategies involve monitoring and adjusting management practices in response to changing conditions and new information. For example, Temmerman et al. (2013) proposed a framework for adaptive management of tidal wetlands, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and flexible planning. By adopting such approaches, coastal managers can better address the uncertainties associated with wetland-based storm protection. In conclusion, while tidal marshes and mangroves offer valuable nature-based solutions for coastal storm mitigation, their effectiveness is context-dependent. Short-period waves are effectively attenuated, but long-period storm surges and erosion control are more challenging. The long-term persistence of these ecosystems is threatened by climate change and human activities, necessitating adaptive management strategies to ensure their continued resilience and protective functions.", "References": [{"title": "Saltmarsh vegetation and the effect of grazing on sedimentation and erosion", "authors": "Möller, I., Kudella, M., Rupprecht, F., Spencer, T., Paul, M., van Wesenbeeck, B.
