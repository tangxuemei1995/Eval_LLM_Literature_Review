{"Literature Review": "Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, thriving in nutrient-poor tropical waters through efficient material retention and recycling. Central to this process are microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM), which play a crucial role in maintaining the health and resilience of coral reefs. This literature review synthesizes current understanding of the microbial processes involved in DOM transformation and recycling, highlighting their importance in various reef functions. Microbes in coral reefs are highly diverse and dynamic, contributing to the ecosystem's productivity and nutrient cycling. The microbial community in coral reefs is influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors, including water temperature, pH, and the presence of specific coral species. These microbes are responsible for the breakdown and transformation of DOM, which is a complex mixture of organic compounds derived from various sources, including coral mucus, phytoplankton exudates, and detritus. DOM serves as a critical resource for microorganisms, providing energy and nutrients necessary for their survival and growth. The microbial processing of DOM is essential for the maintenance of reef health, as it influences the availability of nutrients for other organisms and helps regulate the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. For instance, the decomposition of DOM by bacteria releases inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can be utilized by primary producers like algae and corals. The spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial processes in coral reefs are complex and vary across different habitats within the reef system. In the water column, planktonic microbes play a significant role in the initial stages of DOM degradation, while benthic microbes, associated with sediments and reef surfaces, are involved in more advanced stages of decomposition and nutrient cycling. These processes are further influenced by environmental conditions, such as light availability and water flow, which can affect the rate and efficiency of DOM processing. Microbial interactions with DOM also have implications for the trophic transfer of nutrients within the reef ecosystem. The transformation of DOM by microbes can lead to the production of bioavailable forms of nutrients, which can be assimilated by higher trophic levels, including fish and invertebrates. This trophic transfer is essential for maintaining the food web and supporting the high biodiversity characteristic of coral reefs. In addition to nutrient cycling, microbial processing of DOM is crucial for the structural integrity of coral reefs. The accretion of calcium carbonate by corals and other calcifying organisms is influenced by the availability of organic carbon, which is partially derived from DOM. Microbes play a role in this process by mediating the flux of organic carbon and influencing the chemical environment around coral skeletons, thereby affecting the rate of calcification. However, the resilience of coral reefs is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities and global climate change. Habitat degradation, such as increased sedimentation and pollution, can alter the composition and function of microbial communities, leading to changes in DOM processing and nutrient cycling. For example, elevated levels of nutrients from land-based sources can stimulate the growth of harmful algal blooms, which can outcompete corals for resources and produce toxins that are detrimental to reef health. Moreover, rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification can disrupt the delicate balance of microbial processes in coral reefs. Elevated temperatures can lead to coral bleaching, which reduces the production of DOM and alters the microbial community structure. Ocean acidification can also impact the ability of corals to calcify, further compromising the structural integrity of the reef. In conclusion, microbial interactions with DOM are central to the functioning and resilience of coral reefs. These processes are essential for nutrient cycling, trophic transfer, and the structural integrity of the reef. However, the ongoing degradation of reef habitats and the impacts of global climate change pose significant challenges to the maintenance of these critical microbial processes. Understanding and mitigating these threats is crucial for the conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "Reversal of ocean acidification enhances net coral reef calcification", "authors": "R.
