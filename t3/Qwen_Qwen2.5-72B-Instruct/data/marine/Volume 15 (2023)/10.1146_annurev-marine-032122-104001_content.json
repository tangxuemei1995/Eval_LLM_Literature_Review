{"Literature Review": "Nitrogen is a critical element in the marine environment, influencing biological productivity and, consequently, global climate cycles and biodiversity. Understanding the historical variations in nitrogen cycling is essential for predicting future changes in ocean biogeochemistry. Fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes, preserved within biominerals such as diatoms, foraminifera, and corals, offer a unique window into past nitrogen dynamics. These archives provide insights into large-scale nitrogen inventory changes, local sources and processing, and the ecological and physiological traits of organisms over various timescales, from seasonal to millions of years. Diatoms, unicellular algae with silica cell walls, are one of the most abundant and well-studied groups of microfossils. Their frustules can preserve organic matter, including nitrogen, which can be analyzed for isotopic composition. Studies have shown that diatom-bound nitrogen isotopes (δ¹⁵N) reflect the nitrogen source and cycling processes in the water column. For instance, higher δ¹⁵N values in diatom frustules often indicate increased denitrification or nitrate utilization, while lower values suggest more nitrogen fixation or reduced denitrification. This makes diatoms valuable for reconstructing past changes in the nitrogen cycle, particularly in regions with significant upwelling and nutrient cycling. Foraminifera, single-celled organisms with calcium carbonate tests, are another important group of microfossils used in paleoceanographic studies. The nitrogen isotopes in foraminiferal tests can provide information about the nitrogen cycle in the water column and sediments. Research has demonstrated that foraminiferal δ¹⁵N values can reflect changes in the nitrogen inventory and the balance between nitrogen fixation and denitrification. For example, during glacial periods, lower δ¹⁵N values in foraminifera suggest a reduction in denitrification due to decreased ocean ventilation. This is crucial for understanding the role of the nitrogen cycle in global climate change. Corals, with their calcium carbonate skeletons, also serve as valuable archives of past environmental conditions. Coral-bound nitrogen isotopes can provide high-resolution records of nitrogen inputs and cycling in reef environments. Studies have shown that coral δ¹⁵N values can be influenced by anthropogenic inputs, such as agricultural runoff and sewage, which can lead to eutrophication and changes in the nitrogen cycle. For instance, elevated δ¹⁵N values in corals from the Great Barrier Reef have been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities. This highlights the utility of corals in monitoring and understanding the impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems. Recent methodological advancements have significantly improved the ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen. Techniques such as thermal conversion elemental analysis (TCEA) and continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS) have enabled high-precision measurements of δ¹⁵N in small samples. These methods have expanded the range of applications for fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes, allowing for more detailed and accurate reconstructions of past nitrogen cycling. High-resolution evidence from fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes has provided valuable insights into anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the oceans. For example, studies using diatom and foraminiferal δ¹⁵N records have documented increases in nitrogen loading in coastal waters due to human activities. These findings are crucial for assessing the impacts of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs on marine ecosystems and for developing strategies to mitigate these impacts. Fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes have also been used to assess changes in the nitrogen inventory on glacial–interglacial timescales. For instance, foraminiferal δ¹⁵N records from deep-sea sediments have revealed significant changes in the nitrogen cycle during the last glacial period, with lower δ¹⁵N values indicating reduced denitrification and a smaller nitrogen inventory. This suggests that the nitrogen cycle played a role in modulating atmospheric CO₂ levels and global climate during glacial–interglacial transitions. Additionally, fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes have provided evidence for enhanced CO₂ drawdown in the high-latitude ocean. Studies using diatom δ¹⁵N records have shown that increased nitrogen fixation and reduced denitrification in the Southern Ocean during glacial periods led to higher biological productivity and CO₂ drawdown. This highlights the importance of the nitrogen cycle in regulating the global carbon cycle and climate. Future directions in the study of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes include expanding method development, characterizing ecological and physiological variation, and exploring extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history. Improved methods for measuring trace amounts of nitrogen isotopes will enhance the resolution and accuracy of paleo-reconstructions. Additionally, a better understanding of the ecological and physiological factors that influence nitrogen isotope fractionation in different organisms will improve the interpretation of fossil-bound nitrogen isotopes. Finally, extending the temporal range of nitrogen isotope records will provide a more comprehensive view of the nitrogen cycle throughout Earth's history, contributing to our understanding of long-term biogeochemical processes and their impact on global climate and biodiversity.", "References": [{"title": "The Marine Nitrogen Isotope Record and Its Relationship to Productivity and Denitrification", "authors": "Mark A.
