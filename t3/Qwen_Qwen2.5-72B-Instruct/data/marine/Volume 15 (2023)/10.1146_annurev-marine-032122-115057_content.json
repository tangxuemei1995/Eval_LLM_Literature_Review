{"Literature Review": "The nearshore region, defined as the area extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, plays a critical role in the exchange of various materials, including plankton, pollutants, and particles. This exchange is influenced by a multitude of physical processes, which can significantly impact the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast, as well as the transport and dispersal of larvae. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting and managing coastal ecosystems and water quality. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms driving cross-shore exchange, focusing on winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. Winds are a primary driver of cross-shore exchange, influencing surface currents and wave dynamics. According to Lentz and Fewings (2009), wind-driven currents can transport particles and pollutants over significant distances, particularly during strong wind events. These currents are often aligned with the direction of the wind, leading to onshore or offshore transport depending on the wind direction. Additionally, wind-generated waves can create a surface current known as Stokes drift, which can further enhance cross-shore transport. Stokes drift is particularly important for small, buoyant particles that remain near the surface (Stokes, 1847). Rip currents are another significant mechanism for cross-shore exchange. These narrow, fast-moving channels of water flow seaward from the shore, often forming in areas where waves break unevenly. Rip currents can transport large volumes of water and suspended particles offshore, making them a crucial factor in the dispersal of larvae and pollutants. MacMahan et al. (2006) found that rip currents can reach speeds of up to 2 meters per second, significantly affecting the transport of particles and organisms. The formation and strength of rip currents are influenced by factors such as wave height, beach slope, and bathymetry. Internal waves, which occur at the interface between layers of different densities in the water column, also play a role in cross-shore exchange. These waves can transport particles and nutrients vertically and horizontally, contributing to the mixing of water masses. Internal waves are particularly important in stratified waters, where they can enhance the vertical transport of nutrients from deeper layers to the surface (Alford, 2003). This process can have significant implications for primary productivity and the distribution of plankton in the nearshore region. Diurnal heating and cooling cycles can also influence cross-shore exchange by creating thermal gradients that drive vertical and horizontal currents. During the day, solar radiation heats the surface layer of the water, causing it to become less dense and rise. At night, the surface layer cools and becomes denser, leading to sinking and the formation of a thermocline. These thermal gradients can generate currents that transport particles and nutrients across the nearshore region (Kilpatrick and Walsh, 1995). The magnitude of these currents is influenced by factors such as the intensity of solar radiation and the thermal properties of the water. Turbulence is a key factor in the horizontal spreading of particles in the nearshore region. Turbulent mixing can disperse particles over a wide area, reducing their concentration and affecting their transport patterns. The degree of turbulence is influenced by factors such as wind speed, wave action, and the presence of obstacles such as reefs or structures. Turbulence can be quantified using an exchange diffusivity, which measures the rate at which particles spread horizontally (Fong and Giddings, 2014). This parameter is particularly important for particles that do not have sufficient vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. The behavior of particles and organisms also plays a crucial role in cross-shore exchange. Different types of particles and organisms exhibit varying degrees of vertical movement and horizontal dispersion. For example, some plankton species can actively swim to maintain their position in the water column, while others are passively transported by currents (Durham et al., 2009). The vertical and horizontal movements of particles can be influenced by factors such as light availability, nutrient concentrations, and predation pressure. Understanding these behaviors is essential for accurately modeling cross-shore exchange processes. In summary, the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles across the nearshore region is a complex process influenced by multiple physical mechanisms. Winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling all contribute to the transport and dispersion of materials in this region. The behavior of particles and organisms further complicates these processes, highlighting the need for a comprehensive framework to estimate the relative importance of different exchange mechanisms. This framework can help researchers and managers better understand and predict the dynamics of coastal ecosystems and water quality.", "References": [{"title": "Observations of inner shelf circulation driven by alongshore winds", "authors": "S.J.
