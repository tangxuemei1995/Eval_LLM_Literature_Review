{"Literature Review": "The Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) has been a focal point in climate science due to its significant impact on regional and global climate patterns. Traditionally, PDV is characterized by statistical patterns of variance, reflecting the ocean's integration of atmospheric forcing (Mantua et al., 1997). However, these patterns alone do not fully capture the complex dynamical processes underlying PDV. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of atmospheric and ocean teleconnections, as well as coupled feedbacks, in driving the evolution of PDV anomalies (Newman et al., 2016).\n\nThe North Pacific–central Pacific (NP-CP) mode and the Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) mode are two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes that have been identified as key drivers of PDV (Alexander et al., 2010). The NP-CP mode captures interannual to decadal-scale variability, primarily influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its teleconnections (Deser et al., 2010). This mode is characterized by a seesaw pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies between the North Pacific and the central Pacific, which can persist for several years (Mantua and Hare, 2002).\n\nOn the other hand, the KOE mode is associated with decadal to multidecadal variability and is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV (Qiu, 2003). The KOE mode is driven by the interaction between the Kuroshio Current and the Oyashio Current, which influences the SST and ocean circulation in the North Pacific (Minobe, 1997). This mode is also influenced by the South Pacific, highlighting the importance of tropical-extratropical teleconnections in shaping PDV (Fedorov and Philander, 2000).\n\nThe NP-CP and KOE modes are interconnected through two-way tropical-extratropical teleconnection dynamics. For instance, ENSO events can trigger changes in the atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific, which in turn affect the KOE mode (Deser et al., 2010). Conversely, anomalies in the KOE mode can influence the development and propagation of ENSO events (Newman et al., 2016). These teleconnections are crucial for understanding the synchronization and energization of the basin-scale footprint of PDV (Alexander et al., 2010).\n\nEmpirical dynamical models constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies have been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms behind PDV. These models show that the PDV modes of variance result from the interplay between the NP-CP and KOE modes (Newman et al., 2016). The reddening of atmospheric forcing, where the ocean integrates high-frequency atmospheric signals into lower-frequency variability, is a key process in this context (Mantua et al., 1997).\n\nClimate change further complicates the dynamics of PDV. Studies suggest that anthropogenic warming may alter the frequency and intensity of PDV modes, potentially leading to more extreme climate events (Deser et al., 2010). For example, increased greenhouse gas concentrations can enhance the warming in the North Pacific, affecting the KOE mode and altering the basin-scale SST patterns (Fedorov and Philander, 2000).\n\nIn conclusion, the modes and mechanisms of Pacific decadal-scale variability are multifaceted, involving complex interactions between atmospheric and oceanic processes. The NP-CP and KOE modes, driven by tropical-extratropical teleconnections, are fundamental to understanding the evolution of PDV. Future research should focus on integrating these modes into climate models to better predict and mitigate the impacts of PDV on regional and global climate systems.", "References": [{"title": "A Pacific interdecadal climate oscillation with impacts on salmon production", "authors": "Nathan J.
