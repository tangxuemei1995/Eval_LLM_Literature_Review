{"Literature Review": "Eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) are critical components of the global ocean, contributing significantly to marine productivity and providing essential ecosystem services. These systems, which include the California Current, Humboldt Current, Canary Current, and Benguela Current, are characterized by strong coastal upwelling driven by wind patterns that bring nutrient-rich deep waters to the surface. This upwelling supports high levels of primary production, which in turn sustains diverse and productive marine ecosystems. However, the impacts of climate change on EBUSs are a growing concern, as they have the potential to alter the physical, biogeochemical, and ecological dynamics of these regions. The physical changes in EBUSs due to climate change are multifaceted. One of the most consistent trends observed is the intensification of upwelling in poleward regions. This intensification is driven by changes in wind patterns, which are influenced by shifts in atmospheric circulation. For example, the California Current System has experienced increased upwelling intensity, particularly in the northern region, which has been linked to changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Similarly, the Humboldt Current System has shown signs of upwelling intensification, although the spatial patterns are more complex due to the influence of local topography and mesoscale eddies. Despite the general trend of upwelling intensification, there are regional variations and uncertainties. In some areas, such as the southern California Current, upwelling has weakened, possibly due to changes in the strength and direction of the winds. These regional differences highlight the complexity of climate impacts on EBUSs and the need for detailed, localized studies. Biogeochemical changes in EBUSs are also significant. One of the most notable effects is the mitigation of warming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies. This cooling effect can counteract the broader trend of ocean warming, leading to a more stable thermal environment for marine organisms. However, this cooling is not uniform and can vary seasonally and spatially. Additionally, the upwelling of deeper, nutrient-rich waters can lead to increased primary productivity, but it can also bring up waters that are low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide, potentially exacerbating issues such as hypoxia and ocean acidification. The ecological impacts of these physical and biogeochemical changes are profound. Enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer can reduce the vertical mixing of nutrients, which may limit primary production in some areas. This can have cascading effects on higher trophic levels, including fish populations and marine mammals. For instance, changes in the timing and intensity of upwelling can affect the availability of prey for commercially important fish species, such as sardines and anchovies. These changes can also impact the distribution and abundance of top predators, such as seabirds and marine mammals, which rely on these fish for food. Despite the growing body of research, several key uncertainties remain. One of the most significant is the interaction between upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification. These factors can have competing or synergistic effects on productivity and ecosystem structure, making it challenging to predict future changes. For example, while increased upwelling can bring more nutrients to the surface, it can also bring up waters that are low in oxygen, potentially leading to hypoxic conditions that can harm marine life. Another area of uncertainty is the role of mesoscale processes in modulating the impacts of climate change. Mesoscale features, such as eddies and fronts, can influence the distribution of nutrients and organisms, and their behavior can be affected by changes in wind patterns and ocean currents. Understanding these processes is crucial for accurately projecting the future state of EBUSs. In conclusion, the impacts of climate change on EBUSs are complex and multifaceted, involving changes in physical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. While some trends, such as upwelling intensification in poleward regions, are well-documented, there are significant uncertainties in how these changes will interact and affect the overall productivity and structure of these systems. Future research should focus on addressing these uncertainties through a combination of observational studies, modeling efforts, and interdisciplinary approaches. By improving our understanding of the mechanisms driving these changes, we can better predict and adapt to the impacts of climate change on EBUSs, ensuring the continued provision of ecosystem services to human societies.", "References": [{"title": "Climate change and the world's largest upwelling systems", "authors": "A.
