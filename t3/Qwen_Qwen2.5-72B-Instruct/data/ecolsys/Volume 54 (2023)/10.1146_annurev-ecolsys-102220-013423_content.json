{"Literature Review": "Functional trait variation plays a crucial role in understanding the mechanisms underlying animal invasions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how functional traits influence the success of invasive animal species at different stages of the invasion process, from introduction to establishment and spread. The integration of functional trait-based approaches into invasion ecology has shown significant promise, paralleling the advancements made in plant invasion biology (Richardson et al., 2000; Pyšek & Richardson, 2010).\n\nRecent theoretical and empirical studies have highlighted several key functional traits that contribute to the success of invasive animals. Broad environmental tolerances, which allow species to thrive in a wide range of conditions, are a common characteristic among successful invaders (Lockwood et al., 2005). For example, the Asian carp (Cyprinus carpio) has been able to invade numerous freshwater systems due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and oxygen levels (Kolar & Lodge, 2001).\n\nLife history traits, particularly those associated with rapid growth and high reproductive rates, are also critical for invasion success. Species with short generation times and high fecundity can quickly establish populations and outcompete native species (Sakai et al., 2001). The cane toad (Rhinella marina), for instance, has invaded multiple regions due to its high reproductive rate and rapid development (Shine, 2010).\n\nPhenotypic plasticity, the ability of a species to alter its phenotype in response to environmental changes, is another important trait that enhances invasion success. Invasive species with high phenotypic plasticity can adapt to new environments more effectively, increasing their chances of survival and spread (Davidson et al., 2011). The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) exemplifies this trait, as it can adjust its behavior and physiology to different salinity levels and food availability (Grosholz & Ruiz, 2005).\n\nDespite the growing body of research on functional traits in animal invasions, there are still significant gaps in our understanding. Interspecific comparisons incorporating comparative phylogenetic approaches are relatively rare, limiting our ability to generalize findings across different taxa (Losos, 2011). Additionally, studies that examine entire assemblages of invasive species are scarce, making it difficult to understand the community-level impacts of invasions (Simberloff & Von Holle, 1999).\n\nTime since introduction is another critical factor that is often overlooked in invasion studies. The duration of time a species has been present in a new environment can significantly affect its population dynamics and ecological impact (Williamson & Fitter, 1996). Long-term studies are essential for capturing the temporal dynamics of invasions and understanding how traits influence the success of invasive species over time (Pyšek & Richardson, 2010).\n\nThe introduction effort, defined as the number of individuals introduced and the frequency of introductions, remains one of the most important factors affecting the success of invasive species (Lockwood et al., 2005). High introduction effort increases the likelihood of establishment and spread, regardless of the specific functional traits of the species (Simberloff & Von Holle, 1999). However, the interaction between introduction effort and functional traits can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving invasion success (Sakai et al., 2001).\n\nIn conclusion, the functional trait-based approach to studying animal invasions has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the ecological processes underlying invasions. By integrating functional traits with other ecological and evolutionary factors, researchers can develop more comprehensive models of invasion dynamics. Future research should focus on filling the gaps in our knowledge, particularly through interspecific comparisons and long-term studies, to better predict and manage the impacts of invasive species on native ecosystems.", "References": [{"title": "A global assessment of the impacts of invasive species on threatened species", "authors": "Davidson, A.
