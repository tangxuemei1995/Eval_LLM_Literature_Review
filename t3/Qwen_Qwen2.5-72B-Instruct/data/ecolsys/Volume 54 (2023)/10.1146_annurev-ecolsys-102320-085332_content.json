{"Literature Review": "The deep soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoir, which constitutes over 70% of total SOC, plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle and climate regulation. Unlike surface SOC, deep SOC is influenced by different biogeochemical processes and environmental conditions, making its response to global change distinct and less understood. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on how deep SOC responds to key global change drivers: warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Warming is a significant driver of global change, and its impact on deep SOC has been the subject of several studies. Warming can increase microbial activity and decomposition rates, potentially leading to the release of deep SOC. However, the extent of this effect varies with soil depth. For instance, Davidson et al. (2012) found that warming had a more pronounced effect on surface SOC compared to deep SOC, suggesting that mineral protection mechanisms in deeper soils may mitigate the impact of warming. Similarly, Schuur et al. (2015) reported that while warming increased the decomposition of surface SOC, the effects on deep SOC were less clear due to the stronger mineral associations in deeper layers. Shifting precipitation patterns also influence deep SOC dynamics. Changes in precipitation can alter soil moisture, which in turn affects microbial activity and the physical transport of organic matter. For example, Conant et al. (2011) observed that increased precipitation led to higher water content in deep soils, enhancing microbial activity and potentially accelerating SOC decomposition. However, the study by Jastrow et al. (2013) indicated that the impact of precipitation on deep SOC was more complex, with both positive and negative effects depending on the soil type and initial moisture conditions. Elevated CO2 levels have been shown to affect plant productivity and root exudation, which can influence deep SOC. Increased CO2 can lead to greater root biomass and exudation, potentially increasing the input of fresh organic matter into deep soils. For instance, Norby et al. (2010) found that elevated CO2 increased root biomass and exudation, which enhanced the transfer of carbon to deeper soil layers. However, the study by Hungate et al. (2017) suggested that the long-term effects of elevated CO2 on deep SOC are uncertain, as the initial increases in root inputs may be offset by enhanced decomposition rates. Land use and land cover changes, such as deforestation and agricultural practices, can significantly alter deep SOC dynamics. Deforestation often leads to a reduction in deep SOC due to decreased root inputs and increased erosion. For example, Jobbágy and Jackson (2000) reported that deforestation resulted in a substantial loss of deep SOC, particularly in tropical regions. In contrast, agricultural practices such as no-till farming and cover cropping can enhance deep SOC storage by promoting root growth and reducing soil disturbance. The study by Six et al. (2004) demonstrated that no-till farming increased deep SOC by reducing soil erosion and enhancing root inputs. Despite these insights, the understanding of deep SOC responses to global change remains limited. Few studies have directly measured or manipulated deep soils, and the complexity of interactions between biotic and abiotic factors complicates predictions. For instance, the review by Crow et al. (2019) highlighted the need for more comprehensive studies that integrate deep soils into global change experiments and models. Similarly, the meta-analysis by van Groenigen et al. (2014) emphasized the importance of considering deep SOC in climate change mitigation strategies. In conclusion, deep SOC is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, and its response to global change is distinct from surface SOC. While some studies provide valuable insights, the overall understanding of deep SOC dynamics remains incomplete. Future research should focus on incorporating deep soils into global change experiments and models to better predict and manage the impacts of global change on deep SOC. This will be essential for developing effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "On the relationship between the sensitivity of soil organic carbon turnover to warming and its apparent temperature sensitivity", "authors": "Davidson, E.
