{"Literature Review": "Extreme heat events (EHEs) pose significant public health risks, including acute heat illness, exacerbation of chronic diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a variety of injuries. These events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, leading to an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality. Consequently, there is a growing need for robust public health preparedness strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance the resilience of health systems. Public health preparedness for EHEs is a multifaceted approach that involves a range of activities aimed at reducing vulnerability and improving response capabilities. One of the most effective strategies is the implementation of heat action plans (HAPs), which are comprehensive frameworks designed to coordinate and integrate various interventions before, during, and after an EHE. HAPs typically include primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention activities, each tailored to specific phases of the event. Primary prevention activities are crucial in the pre-event phase and focus on reducing the underlying vulnerabilities of populations at risk. These activities may include public education campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of heat exposure, the development of early warning systems, and the establishment of cooling centers. For example, the city of Philadelphia implemented a successful public education campaign that significantly reduced heat-related mortality by providing residents with information on how to stay cool and recognize the signs of heat-related illnesses. Secondary prevention activities are essential during the early stages of an EHE and aim to reduce the immediate risks and impacts. This includes the activation of emergency response protocols, the distribution of heat advisories, and the provision of medical care to those affected. In Europe, the implementation of HAPs following the 2003 heatwave led to a marked reduction in heat-related deaths during subsequent EHEs. For instance, France's HAP, which included a national heat health watch warning system and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, was credited with saving thousands of lives. Tertiary prevention activities are vital in the later stages of an EHE and focus on recovery and long-term resilience. These activities may involve the provision of ongoing medical care, the restoration of disrupted services, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the HAP. Post-event evaluations, such as after-action reports, are crucial for identifying strengths and weaknesses in the response and informing future improvements. Climate-resilient health systems are better equipped to handle the challenges posed by EHEs. These systems incorporate climate change adaptation measures into their planning and operations, ensuring that they can maintain functionality and provide essential services during extreme weather events. For instance, the integration of climate data into public health surveillance systems allows for more accurate predictions of heat-related health risks and timely interventions. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) principles are also integral to EHE preparedness. DRR emphasizes the importance of reducing the underlying risks and vulnerabilities that contribute to disaster impacts. By adopting a DRR approach, public health officials can work to address the social, economic, and environmental factors that increase susceptibility to heat-related harm. This may involve improving housing conditions, enhancing urban green spaces, and promoting community-based initiatives that build social cohesion and resilience. In conclusion, public health preparedness for EHEs is a critical component of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The implementation of HAPs, which encompass primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention activities, is a proven strategy for reducing the health impacts of extreme heat. By investing in climate-resilient health systems and adopting a DRR approach, communities can better protect their populations from the growing threat of EHEs.", "References": [{"title": "Relation between elevated ambient temperature and mortality: A review of the epidemiologic evidence", "authors": "Rupa Basu, Jonathan M.
