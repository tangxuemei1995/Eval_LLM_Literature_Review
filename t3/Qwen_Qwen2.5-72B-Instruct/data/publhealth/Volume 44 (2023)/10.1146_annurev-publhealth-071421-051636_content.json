{"Literature Review": "Drought, a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, has significant implications for public health, particularly in the context of climate change. As global temperatures rise, the frequency and intensity of droughts are expected to increase, exacerbating existing health risks and creating new challenges (IPCC, 2014). This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the public health implications of drought, focusing on its impact on water- and food-borne diseases, malnutrition, cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, mental health, and mortality. It also examines the factors that influence vulnerability and the need for integrated risk management strategies.\n\n### Water- and Food-Borne Diseases\nDrought conditions can lead to a reduction in water availability, which may compromise water quality and increase the risk of water-borne diseases. For instance, a study by Checkley et al. (2000) found that reduced water supply during drought periods was associated with higher incidences of diarrheal diseases in children. Similarly, drought can affect food security by reducing crop yields and livestock productivity, leading to an increased risk of food-borne illnesses. A study by Brown et al. (2018) highlighted that drought-induced food shortages can lead to the consumption of contaminated or undercooked food, further exacerbating the risk of gastrointestinal infections.\n\n### Malnutrition\nDrought has a profound impact on agricultural productivity, which can lead to food scarcity and malnutrition. According to a report by FAO (2015), drought is one of the leading causes of food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Malnutrition, especially in children, can have long-term health consequences, including stunted growth and cognitive impairments. A study by WFP (2017) found that children in drought-affected regions were more likely to suffer from malnutrition and related health issues compared to those in non-drought areas.\n\n### Cardiovascular and Respiratory Illnesses\nDrought can also contribute to cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Reduced water availability can lead to increased dust and particulate matter in the air, which can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A study by Bell et al. (2004) found that particulate matter levels were significantly higher during drought periods, leading to an increase in hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses. Additionally, heat stress, which often accompanies drought, can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions (Hajat et al., 2002).\n\n### Mental Health\nThe psychological impact of drought is another critical aspect of its public health implications. Drought can lead to economic hardship, social disruption, and loss of livelihood, all of which can contribute to mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. A study by Berry et al. (2010) found that farmers in drought-affected regions reported higher levels of psychological distress compared to those in non-drought areas. The stress and uncertainty associated with prolonged drought can also lead to increased rates of suicide, particularly among male farmers (Page et al., 2007).\n\n### Mortality\nDrought can directly and indirectly contribute to increased mortality rates. Directly, it can lead to deaths from dehydration and heatstroke, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Indirectly, it can increase mortality through the exacerbation of other health conditions, such as malnutrition and infectious diseases. A study by Guha-Sapir et al. (2012) estimated that drought-related mortality is often underreported and may be higher than currently recognized.\n\n### Factors Influencing Vulnerability\nThe impact of drought on public health varies significantly among different populations and regions. Socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and age are key factors that influence vulnerability. For example, low-income communities often lack the resources to cope with the effects of drought, making them more susceptible to health risks (Ebi et al., 2006). Gender also plays a role, with women and girls often bearing a disproportionate burden of water collection and household responsibilities, which can increase their exposure to health risks (UNICEF, 2019).\n\n### Risk Management and Proactive Action Plans\nTo mitigate the public health impacts of drought, integrated risk management strategies are essential. These strategies should include early warning systems, improved water management practices, and enhanced healthcare services. Developing countries, which are often the most vulnerable to the effects of drought, require significant support to build resilience and reduce risk. A study by UNDP (2018) emphasized the importance of transferring resources and technology to these countries to help them adapt to the changing climate.\n\nIn conclusion, drought poses significant public health challenges, particularly in the context of climate change. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that considers the complex interplay of environmental, social, and economic factors. Proactive and integrative risk management strategies are crucial to reducing the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with drought.", "References": [{"title": "The effects of El Ni√±o on diarrheal disease in Peruvian children", "authors": "William Checkley, Robert H.
