{"Literature Review": "Mass incarceration has emerged as a critical public health issue in the United States, exacerbating health disparities and perpetuating systemic inequalities. The roots of mass incarceration are deeply intertwined with historical and sociostructural factors, including the legacy of slavery, racial discrimination, and economic exploitation (Alexander, 2010). This literature review synthesizes current research on the intersection of public health and prisons, focusing on the health impacts of incarceration and potential strategies for improvement. The historical context of mass incarceration is crucial for understanding its contemporary implications. Alexander (2010) argues that the War on Drugs and tough-on-crime policies have disproportionately affected communities of color, leading to a dramatic increase in the prison population. This surge in incarceration rates has been driven by political and economic forces that have marginalized certain populations, particularly Black and Latinx individuals (Western, 2006). The criminal justice system's focus on punishment over rehabilitation has created a cycle of recidivism and poor health outcomes (Clear, 2007). Prison conditions significantly impact the health of incarcerated individuals. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and limited access to healthcare contribute to the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV (Moss, 2018). Mental health issues are also prevalent among prisoners, with high rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Fazel & Danesh, 2002). Substance use disorders are another significant concern, often exacerbated by the lack of adequate treatment programs within correctional facilities (Kariminia et al., 2008). Chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, are more common among incarcerated individuals due to poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and inadequate medical care (Binswanger et al., 2009). These conditions are further compounded by the stress and trauma associated with incarceration, leading to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality (Binswanger et al., 2009). The transition from prison to community also poses significant health challenges, as many individuals face barriers to accessing healthcare and social services upon release (Petersilia, 2003). Public health interventions in prisons aim to address these health disparities and improve the well-being of incarcerated individuals. Telemedicine and telehealth services have shown promise in providing remote access to medical care, reducing the need for in-person visits and improving continuity of care (Wang et al., 2018). Mental health screening and early intervention programs can help identify and treat mental health issues before they become more severe (Fazel & Danesh, 2002). Substance use disorder treatment programs, including medication-assisted therapy, have been effective in reducing recidivism and improving health outcomes (Kariminia et al., 2008). Decarceral solutions, which focus on reducing the number of people in prisons, are essential for addressing the root causes of mass incarceration and promoting public health. Community-based alternatives to incarceration, such as diversion programs and restorative justice practices, can provide support and resources to individuals without the negative health consequences of imprisonment (Clear, 2007). Policy reforms, such as sentencing reform and the decriminalization of non-violent offenses, can also play a crucial role in reducing the prison population (Western, 2006). Research on the health impacts of incarceration highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that addresses both the immediate health needs of incarcerated individuals and the broader structural issues that contribute to mass incarceration. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions in prisons and exploring innovative decarceral strategies that prioritize health and dignity (Binswanger et al., 2009). Collaboration between health scholars, practitioners, and activists is essential for advancing this agenda and creating a more just and equitable society.", "References": [{"title": "The Effects of Incarceration on Public Health", "authors": "Todd R.
