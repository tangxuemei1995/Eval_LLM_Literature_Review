{"Literature Review": "Cancer prevention is a multifaceted endeavor that hinges on the identification and management of modifiable risk factors. These factors, which include tobacco smoking, occupational exposures, infections, air pollution, alcohol consumption, and diet and obesity, play significant roles in the etiology of various cancers. Understanding the population attributable fraction (PAF) of these risk factors is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the associations between modifiable risk factors and cancer, highlighting both successes and challenges in cancer control. Tobacco smoking remains one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco use is responsible for approximately 22% of all cancer deaths globally (World Health Organization, 2019). Studies have consistently shown that smoking is strongly associated with lung, laryngeal, esophageal, and bladder cancers, among others (Doll & Peto, 1981). Despite the well-documented risks, tobacco control efforts have faced numerous challenges, including the addictive nature of nicotine and the powerful influence of the tobacco industry. However, comprehensive tobacco control policies, such as taxation, advertising bans, and smoke-free laws, have been effective in reducing smoking rates in many countries (Jha et al., 2013). Occupational exposures to carcinogens also contribute significantly to the cancer burden. For instance, exposure to asbestos, benzene, and silica has been linked to lung, mesothelioma, and hematological cancers, respectively (Siemiatycki et al., 2004). Occupational cancer prevention strategies often involve regulatory measures, such as setting exposure limits and requiring protective equipment. While these measures have reduced occupational cancer incidence in some industries, they remain underutilized in many low- and middle-income countries (Driscoll et al., 2005). Infections caused by certain viruses and bacteria are another important class of modifiable risk factors. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a leading cause of cervical cancer, and vaccination programs have shown promise in reducing the incidence of this disease (Paavonen et al., 2009). Similarly, hepatitis B and C viruses are major risk factors for liver cancer, and antiviral treatments can effectively prevent the progression to cancer (Lok & McMahon, 2007). However, the global coverage of these interventions remains suboptimal, particularly in resource-limited settings. Air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), is a growing concern in cancer prevention. Epidemiological studies have established a link between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and an increased risk of lung cancer (Pope et al., 2002). Urbanization and industrialization have exacerbated air pollution levels in many regions, necessitating stringent regulations and public health interventions to mitigate this risk. Despite these efforts, air quality remains a significant issue in many parts of the world, contributing to a substantial burden of lung cancer (Loomis et al., 2013). Alcohol consumption is another modifiable risk factor with a well-established association with several cancers, including those of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, and breast (Bagnardi et al., 2015). Public health campaigns and policy interventions, such as increased taxation and restrictions on marketing, have been implemented to reduce alcohol consumption. However, the effectiveness of these measures varies across different cultural and socioeconomic contexts, and more targeted approaches may be necessary to achieve broader impact (Rehm et al., 2017). Diet and obesity are complex risk factors that influence cancer risk through multiple mechanisms. High body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including postmenopausal breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancers (Lauby-Secretan et al., 2016). Dietary patterns, such as high intake of red and processed meats and low consumption of fruits and vegetables, also contribute to cancer risk (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research, 2018). Public health initiatives aimed at promoting healthy diets and physical activity have shown some success, but sustained behavior change remains a challenge. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in identifying and managing modifiable risk factors for cancer, the current understanding of avoidable causes is still incomplete. Comprehensive and tailored prevention strategies are essential to address the diverse and evolving landscape of cancer risk factors. Continued research and collaboration across disciplines are necessary to refine our knowledge and develop more effective interventions to reduce the global burden of cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Smoking, smoking cessation, and lung cancer in the UK since 1950: combination of national statistics with two case-control studies", "authors": "R.
