{"Literature Review": "Climate change poses significant challenges to global health, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and disrupting health systems' ability to provide continuous, high-quality care. This literature review synthesizes the evidence on how the health care sector can adapt to a changing climate while reducing its own environmental impact, identifies barriers to change, and provides recommendations for achieving sustainable and resilient health care systems.\n\n### Impact of Climate Change on Health Care\nClimate change has far-reaching implications for public health, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, heatwaves, and vector-borne diseases (Watts et al., 2018). These events strain health care resources, disrupt supply chains, and compromise the delivery of essential services (Patz et al., 2005). For instance, hurricanes and floods can damage infrastructure, leading to power outages and water shortages, which critically affect hospital operations (Kovats & Haines, 2005).\n\n### Adaptation Strategies for Health Care Systems\nTo mitigate these impacts, health care systems must adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. One key approach is enhancing emergency preparedness. Hospitals and clinics need robust plans to manage disasters, including backup power systems, secure water supplies, and evacuation protocols (Noji, 2005). Additionally, integrating climate risk assessments into facility design and maintenance can improve resilience (Ebi & McGregor, 2008).\n\nSupply chain resilience is another critical area. Health care organizations should diversify their suppliers and establish alternative sourcing options to ensure a steady supply of essential medical supplies and medications (Hsee et al., 2016). This can help prevent shortages during crises and maintain operational continuity.\n\n### Reducing Environmental Impact\nWhile adapting to climate change is crucial, the health care sector must also reduce its own environmental footprint. Health care is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through energy consumption, waste generation, and the use of anesthetic gases (ECO, 2019). Implementing energy-efficient practices, such as using renewable energy sources and optimizing building designs, can significantly lower carbon emissions (Bates et al., 2017).\n\nWaste management is another important aspect. Hospitals generate large amounts of waste, much of which is incinerated, releasing harmful pollutants. Adopting waste reduction strategies, such as recycling, composting, and minimizing single-use plastics, can reduce environmental impact (Thompson et al., 2011). Furthermore, transitioning to digital health records and telemedicine can reduce paper waste and travel-related emissions (Liu et al., 2013).\n\n### Barriers to Change\nDespite the clear need for action, several barriers hinder the adoption of sustainable and resilient practices in health care. Financial constraints are a significant obstacle, as many of these initiatives require upfront investment (Smith et al., 2014). Additionally, lack of awareness and training among health care professionals can impede progress (Biswas et al., 2017). Policy and regulatory frameworks often lag behind, failing to provide the necessary incentives or guidelines for sustainable practices (WHO, 2018).\n\n### Recommendations\nTo overcome these barriers and achieve sustainable, resilient health care systems, several recommendations are proposed. First, governments and health care organizations should prioritize funding for climate adaptation and mitigation projects. This includes investing in infrastructure improvements, emergency preparedness, and sustainable technologies (Bates et al., 2017). Second, education and training programs should be developed to raise awareness and build capacity among health care professionals (Biswas et al., 2017). Third, policy makers should create supportive regulatory environments that encourage sustainable practices, such as tax incentives for green buildings and penalties for excessive waste generation (WHO, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the health care sector faces significant challenges from climate change but also has the opportunity to lead by example in sustainability and resilience. By implementing comprehensive adaptation strategies, reducing environmental impact, and addressing barriers to change, health care systems can better protect public health and contribute to a more sustainable future.", "References": [{"title": "Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health", "authors": "Watts, N., Adger, W.
