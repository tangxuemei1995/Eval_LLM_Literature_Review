{"Literature Review": "Physical activity (PA) is a critical determinant of health, contributing to the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. While PA research and promotion have traditionally been rooted in high-income countries (HICs), the unique context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) necessitates a nuanced approach. In HICs, PA is often framed within a choice-based model, where individuals voluntarily engage in activities such as gym workouts, recreational sports, and structured exercise programs. However, in LMICs, a significant portion of PA is driven by economic necessity rather than personal choice. This literature review explores the necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models and their implications for research, policy, and practice in LMICs. The necessity-based model of PA in LMICs is characterized by activities that are essential for daily living, such as walking or cycling to work, fetching water, and agricultural labor. These activities are not typically considered 'exercise' in the conventional sense but are integral to the lives of many individuals in LMICs. For instance, a study by Bauman et al. (2012) found that active transport, including walking and cycling, is a primary source of PA in many LMICs. Similarly, a study by Hallal et al. (2012) highlighted the importance of occupational PA, particularly in rural areas where manual labor is prevalent. Despite the high levels of necessity-driven PA, the conditions under which these activities occur are often suboptimal. Poor infrastructure, unsafe environments, and limited access to resources can make necessity-driven PA more challenging and less sustainable. For example, a study by Sallis et al. (2016) noted that inadequate pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in many LMICs poses significant barriers to active transport. Additionally, a study by Bull et al. (2020) emphasized the need for safe and accessible public spaces to support both necessity-driven and leisure-time PA. The choice-based model, on the other hand, emphasizes voluntary engagement in PA for health and well-being. This model is more aligned with the context of HICs, where structured exercise programs and recreational activities are more common. However, the choice-based model can be less relevant in LMICs, where economic constraints limit access to such opportunities. A study by Pratt et al. (2014) found that leisure-time PA is lower in LMICs compared to HICs, highlighting the need to develop strategies that increase access to leisure-time PA in these settings. To promote equity and improve health outcomes, it is crucial to integrate both necessity- and choice-based models in PA research and promotion efforts in LMICs. This requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the structural and environmental factors influencing PA. For instance, a study by Guthold et al. (2018) recommended the development of policies that improve urban planning and transportation systems to support active transport. Similarly, a study by Ekelund et al. (2017) suggested the implementation of community-based interventions to enhance access to safe and affordable PA opportunities. Moreover, cultural and social norms play a significant role in shaping PA behaviors in LMICs. A study by Lee et al. (2012) highlighted the importance of culturally appropriate interventions that respect local traditions and values. For example, community-led initiatives that incorporate traditional dance and physical activities can be effective in promoting PA among diverse populations. A study by Brownson et al. (2019) further emphasized the need for participatory approaches that engage communities in the design and implementation of PA programs. In conclusion, the necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models provide a valuable framework for understanding and promoting PA in LMICs. By recognizing the unique context of necessity-driven PA and addressing the structural barriers to both necessity- and choice-based activities, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can develop more effective and equitable strategies to improve health outcomes in these settings.", "References": [{"title": "Correlates of physical activity: why are some people physically active and others not?", "authors": "Adrian E.
