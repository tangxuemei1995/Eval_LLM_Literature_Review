{"Literature Review": "The relationship between air pollution and the severity and spread of COVID-19 has been a subject of intense research since the early stages of the pandemic. This literature review synthesizes findings from 139 studies, 127 of which report a statistically significant positive association between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. The review highlights the statistical challenges inherent in this field and provides recommendations for future research, complemented by an open-source data visualization tool to facilitate ongoing evidence synthesis.", "References": [{"title": "Particulate matter air pollution and cardiovascular disease: An update to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association", "authors": "Robert D.
