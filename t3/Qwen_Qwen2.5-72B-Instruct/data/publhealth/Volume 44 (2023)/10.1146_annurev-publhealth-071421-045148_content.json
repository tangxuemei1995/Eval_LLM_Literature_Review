{"Literature Review": "The intersection of climatic and environmental changes, migration, and health has become a critical area of study, particularly as the impacts of climate change intensify. This review synthesizes recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change–mobility–health nexus, focusing on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. The literature highlights both the risks and opportunities associated with climate-related mobility and underscores the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care. Climate change is increasingly recognized as a significant driver of human mobility. Sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other environmental changes are forcing people to move within their own countries or across borders. While migration can serve as an adaptive strategy, it often exposes individuals to new health risks. Recent studies have documented the health consequences of climate-induced displacement. In Bangladesh, for example, frequent flooding has led to internal displacement, resulting in higher rates of malnutrition and waterborne diseases among displaced populations. Similarly, in the Pacific Islands, where sea-level rise threatens coastal communities, relocation efforts have been associated with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive health interventions that address both physical and mental health needs. Planned relocation, a strategy used to move populations from areas at high risk of climate impacts to safer locations, has also been studied. Research in the Solomon Islands has shown that while planned relocation can reduce immediate physical risks, it can also disrupt social networks and cultural practices, leading to psychosocial stress. This highlights the importance of community engagement and culturally sensitive approaches in relocation planning. Migration into areas of climate risk is another dimension of the climate-mobility-health nexus. In many cases, migrants move to urban areas that are already vulnerable to climate impacts, exacerbating existing health challenges. Addressing these health risks requires integrated urban planning and public health strategies that consider the unique vulnerabilities of migrant populations. The health impacts of climate-related mobility are not uniform and can vary based on factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Women and children, for example, are often disproportionately affected by displacement and migration. Despite the challenges, there are also opportunities for improving health outcomes through climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive policies. For instance, integrating climate resilience into healthcare systems can enhance the ability of communities to cope with climate impacts. Such initiatives demonstrate the potential for local solutions to mitigate health risks associated with climate change. In conclusion, the literature on the climate change–mobility–health nexus highlights the complex interplay between environmental changes, human movement, and health outcomes. While climate-related mobility presents significant health challenges, it also offers opportunities for adaptive strategies that can improve the well-being of affected populations. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of migrant and displaced populations, ensuring that health care is both climate-sensitive and inclusive.", "References": [{"title": "Migration, Environment, and Climate Change: Assessing the Evidence", "authors": "Richard Black, Stephen R.
