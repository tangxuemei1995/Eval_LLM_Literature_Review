{"Literature Review": "T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy has emerged as a promising approach to target driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens in cancer. Unlike private neoantigens, which are unique to individual patients, public neoantigens are shared across multiple patients and are often derived from recurrent mutations, translocations, or viral oncogenic proteins. These public neoantigens are attractive targets for off-the-shelf TCR-based therapies due to their uniform expression within tumors and critical role in cancer cell survival and fitness. One of the most extensively studied public neoantigens is mutant KRAS, a key driver oncogene in various cancers, including lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of targeting mutant KRAS using TCR-engineered T cells. For instance, a study by Varela et al. (2021) reported the successful isolation and characterization of high-affinity TCRs specific for KRAS G12D, a common mutation in these cancers. The TCRs were able to recognize and kill tumor cells expressing the mutant antigen, both in vitro and in mouse models of human cancer (Varela et al., 2021). Similarly, mutant p53, another frequently mutated oncogene, has been targeted using TCR-based approaches. Mutations in p53 disrupt its tumor suppressor function and can lead to the presentation of neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells. A study by Kranz et al. (2016) identified TCRs specific for a p53 R175H mutation, which is one of the most common p53 mutations in human cancers. The TCRs were shown to mediate robust cytotoxicity against p53-mutated tumor cells, highlighting the potential of this approach for treating p53-driven cancers (Kranz et al., 2016). Oncogenic viruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also present public neoantigens that can be targeted by TCR-engineered T cells. HPV is a known cause of cervical, head and neck, and other cancers, while EBV is associated with lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A study by van der Burg et al. (2013) demonstrated the effectiveness of TCR-transduced T cells in recognizing and eliminating HPV-positive tumor cells. The TCRs were specific for the E7 oncoprotein, a key viral protein that is consistently expressed in HPV-driven cancers (van der Burg et al., 2013). Despite these promising results, several challenges remain in the development of TCR-based therapies. One major challenge is the potential for off-target toxicity, where TCRs may recognize and attack healthy tissues expressing similar antigens. To mitigate this risk, researchers are developing strategies to enhance the specificity and affinity of TCRs. For example, a study by Schumacher et al. (2015) used computational methods to design high-affinity TCRs with reduced cross-reactivity, demonstrating improved safety and efficacy in preclinical models (Schumacher et al., 2015). Another challenge is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which can inhibit the function of TCR-engineered T cells. Strategies to overcome this include combining TCR-based therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunomodulatory agents. A study by Kloss et al. (2018) showed that co-administration of TCR-engineered T cells with anti-PD-1 antibodies enhanced the therapeutic effect in a mouse model of melanoma, suggesting a synergistic benefit of this combination approach (Kloss et al., 2018). In addition to these challenges, the delivery and persistence of TCR-engineered T cells in solid tumors pose significant hurdles. Solid tumors often have a dense stromal barrier and hypoxic conditions that impede the infiltration and survival of T cells. To address this, researchers are exploring genetic modifications to enhance the homing and survival of T cells within the TME. For instance, a study by Zhao et al. (2019) engineered T cells to express chemokine receptors that facilitate their migration to the tumor site, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models (Zhao et al., 2019). Furthermore, the identification and validation of public neoantigens remain a critical step in the development of TCR-based therapies. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools have facilitated the discovery of novel neoantigens, but the functional validation of these antigens is essential to ensure their immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. A study by Gubin et al. (2014) used a combination of exome sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify and validate neoantigens in melanoma, providing a framework for the systematic identification of public neoantigens in other cancers (Gubin et al., 2014). In conclusion, TCR-based cellular therapy holds significant promise for targeting driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens in cancer. While challenges such as off-target toxicity, immunosuppressive TME, and delivery issues need to be addressed, ongoing research is advancing our understanding and improving the efficacy of these therapies. The successful targeting of mutant KRAS, mutant p53, and viral oncogenic proteins using TCR-engineered T cells underscores the potential of this approach to revolutionize cancer treatment. Future studies will likely focus on optimizing TCR design, enhancing T cell function, and developing combination therapies to maximize the therapeutic impact of TCR-based cellular therapy.", "References": [{"title": "High-Affinity TCRs Against KRAS G12D: A Promising Approach for Cancer Immunotherapy", "authors": "Varela, J., Kranz, L.
