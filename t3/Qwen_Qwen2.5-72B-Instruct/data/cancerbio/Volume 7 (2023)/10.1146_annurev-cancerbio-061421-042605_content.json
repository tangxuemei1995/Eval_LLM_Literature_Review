{"Literature Review": "Immune cell metabolism plays a crucial role in the efficacy of immuno-oncology treatments, particularly in the context of cancer immunotherapy. The success of immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cellular therapies has highlighted the importance of understanding the metabolic interactions between cancer cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the metabolic programs of cancer and immune cells, the role of metabolic checkpoints in immune evasion, and potential strategies to target these checkpoints to enhance antitumor immune responses. Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support rapid proliferation and survival. Key metabolic pathways include glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid synthesis (FAS). The TME is a complex and dynamic environment that includes various cell types, extracellular matrix components, and soluble factors. Cancer cells can manipulate the TME to create an immunosuppressive environment, which hinders the effectiveness of immune responses. Immune cells, particularly T cells, also undergo metabolic reprogramming in response to activation and environmental cues. Metabolic checkpoints are key regulatory points that control the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes in cells. In the context of immuno-oncology, these checkpoints can be exploited by cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Strategies to target metabolic checkpoints in the TME aim to restore the metabolic fitness of immune cells and inhibit the metabolic advantages of cancer cells. In conclusion, the interplay between cancer cell metabolism and immune cell metabolism is a critical determinant of the success of immuno-oncology treatments. Understanding the metabolic programs of cancer and immune cells, as well as the role of metabolic checkpoints in immune evasion, provides a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies. By targeting these checkpoints, it is possible to not only inhibit tumor growth but also enhance antitumor immune responses, thereby expanding the scope and effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy.", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic regulation of T cell responses", "authors": "Chang, C.
