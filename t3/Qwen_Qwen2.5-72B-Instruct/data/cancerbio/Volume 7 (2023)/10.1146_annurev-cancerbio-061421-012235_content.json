{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy represents a groundbreaking approach in cancer immunotherapy, offering significant therapeutic benefits for various malignancies, particularly hematological cancers. However, the emergence of resistance to CAR T cell therapies poses a critical challenge to their long-term efficacy. This literature review explores the mechanisms of resistance to CAR T cell therapies, categorized into intrinsic, extrinsic, and acquired factors, and discusses potential strategies to overcome these challenges. Intrinsic resistance refers to factors within the CAR T cells themselves that can impede their function. One key issue is the persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in vivo. Studies have shown that the ability of CAR T cells to persist and expand is crucial for sustained antitumor activity. Factors such as the choice of costimulatory domains, the presence of exhaustion markers, and the metabolic state of the T cells can significantly influence their persistence and function. For instance, the inclusion of 4-1BB costimulatory domains has been associated with improved persistence and antitumor activity compared to CD28 costimulatory domains. Extrinsic resistance involves factors external to the CAR T cells, primarily within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is a complex network of cells and molecules that can modulate the effectiveness of CAR T cells. Tumor cells can develop resistance through mechanisms such as antigen loss or downregulation. Antigen loss occurs when tumor cells lose the expression of the target antigen recognized by the CAR T cells, rendering them invisible to the therapy. This phenomenon has been observed in clinical trials, where patients initially respond to CAR T cell therapy but later relapse due to the emergence of antigen-negative tumor cells. Additionally, the TME contains various immunosuppressive cells and molecules that can inhibit CAR T cell function. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to create an immunosuppressive environment that hinders the efficacy of CAR T cells. MDSCs and Tregs can secrete immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-Î², which can dampen the activation and proliferation of CAR T cells. CAFs can also contribute to the physical barrier that prevents CAR T cells from accessing the tumor site. Acquired resistance refers to changes in the tumor cells that occur during or after CAR T cell therapy. One common mechanism is the development of antigen heterogeneity, where tumor cells express different levels of the target antigen. This heterogeneity can lead to the selection of antigen-negative or low-expressing tumor cells, which can evade CAR T cell recognition. Another mechanism is the upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can engage with PD-1 on CAR T cells and inhibit their function. To address these resistance mechanisms, several strategies are being explored. One approach is to enhance the persistence and function of CAR T cells through genetic modifications. For example, incorporating genes that promote T cell survival and metabolism, such as those encoding for IL-7 and CCL19, can improve the persistence and antitumor activity of CAR T cells. Another strategy is to target multiple antigens simultaneously using bispecific or trispecific CAR T cells, which can reduce the likelihood of antigen escape. Additionally, combining CAR T cell therapy with other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, can help overcome the immunosuppressive TME. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, can block the inhibitory signals that suppress CAR T cell function, thereby enhancing their antitumor activity. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of CAR T cells with checkpoint inhibitors can lead to synergistic antitumor effects. In conclusion, while CAR T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating certain cancers, the development of resistance remains a significant hurdle. Understanding the mechanisms of intrinsic, extrinsic, and acquired resistance is crucial for developing effective strategies to overcome these challenges. By enhancing CAR T cell persistence, targeting multiple antigens, and combining CAR T cell therapy with other immunotherapies, we can improve the long-term efficacy and widespread use of this promising cancer therapy.", "References": [{"title": "Adoptive transfer of allogeneic gene-modified T cells in humans results in persistent engraftment and antitumor activity", "authors": "James N.
