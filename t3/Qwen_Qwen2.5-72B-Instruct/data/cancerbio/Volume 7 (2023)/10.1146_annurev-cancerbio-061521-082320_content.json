{"Literature Review": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of certain hematological malignancies, particularly those expressing CD19. However, the development of CAR natural killer (NK) cells offers a promising alternative with unique advantages, including the potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. This literature review provides an overview of the sources of CAR NK cells, gene transfer methods, and manufacturing processes, while also discussing recent advancements and challenges in their clinical application. The primary sources of CAR NK cells include peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and cell lines such as NK-92. Peripheral blood NK cells are readily available and can be isolated using standard techniques, but their expansion ex vivo is limited, which can hinder large-scale production. Umbilical cord blood is another viable source, offering a more abundant and less immunogenic population of NK cells. However, the variability in cell quality and quantity from different donors remains a challenge. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a promising source for generating CAR NK cells due to their unlimited self-renewal capacity and ability to differentiate into various cell types. iPSC-derived NK cells can be genetically modified to express CARs and expanded to large numbers, making them suitable for off-the-shelf applications. The NK-92 cell line, derived from a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is highly proliferative and can be easily engineered to express CARs. However, concerns about the tumorigenic potential of these cells necessitate careful safety evaluations. Gene transfer methods play a crucial role in the successful engineering of CAR NK cells. Viral vectors, such as lentiviruses and retroviruses, are commonly used for stable integration of CAR genes into the genome of NK cells. Lentiviral vectors are preferred due to their high transduction efficiency and ability to integrate into non-dividing cells. Non-viral methods, such as electroporation and transposon systems, offer alternatives that avoid the risks associated with viral integration. Electroporation can efficiently deliver plasmid DNA or mRNA encoding CARs into NK cells, although the transient expression may limit their therapeutic potential. The manufacturing process for CAR NK cells involves several steps, including cell isolation, activation, transduction, expansion, and quality control. Cell activation is essential for enhancing the transduction efficiency and promoting cell proliferation. Cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 are commonly used to activate and expand NK cells ex vivo. After transduction, CAR NK cells must be expanded to achieve the required cell numbers for clinical use. Bioreactor systems and feeder-free cultures have been developed to optimize the expansion process, ensuring consistent and scalable production. Recent advancements in CAR NK cell therapy have demonstrated promising results in preclinical and early clinical trials. For instance, CAR NK cells targeting CD19 have shown significant antitumor activity against B-cell malignancies, with reduced risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity compared to CAR T cells. Additionally, CAR NK cells engineered to target other antigens, such as NKG2D ligands, have shown efficacy in solid tumors, highlighting their versatility in treating a broader range of cancers. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the development of CAR NK cell therapy. One major issue is the limited persistence of NK cells in vivo, which can affect their long-term therapeutic efficacy. Strategies to enhance NK cell persistence, such as genetic modifications to improve survival and homing, are being explored. Another challenge is the potential for immune evasion by tumor cells, which can downregulate or lose the targeted antigen. Combining CAR NK cells with other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, may help overcome this limitation. In conclusion, CAR NK cells represent a promising alternative to CAR T cells, offering unique advantages such as the potential for off-the-shelf products and reduced toxicity. While significant progress has been made in their development, further research is needed to address challenges related to cell persistence, immune evasion, and large-scale manufacturing. As the field continues to evolve, CAR NK cell therapy is poised to become a valuable addition to the arsenal of cancer treatments.", "References": [{"title": "Peripheral blood NK cells for adoptive cellular immunotherapy", "authors": "Mace, E.
