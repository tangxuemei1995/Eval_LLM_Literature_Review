{"Literature Review": "Histopathology is a critical component of cancer diagnosis and subtyping, providing essential information for treatment planning and prognosis. Traditional histopathological evaluation relies heavily on manual inspection by expert pathologists, which can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. However, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues for improving diagnostic workflows and clinical outcomes in cancer pathology. This literature review explores the recent applications of AI in computational pathology, focusing on its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and the identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have enabled the development of sophisticated algorithms capable of analyzing complex histopathological images. These algorithms can detect subtle patterns and features that may be difficult for human pathologists to discern, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. For instance, a study by Coudray et al. (2018) demonstrated that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) could classify lung cancer subtypes with high accuracy, comparable to that of expert pathologists. Similarly, Bejnordi et al. (2017) showed that DL models could achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detecting breast cancer metastases in lymph node sections, outperforming some pathologists in certain scenarios. One of the key advantages of AI in computational pathology is its ability to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, allowing pathologists to focus on more complex cases. For example, a study by Sirinukunwattana et al. (2016) developed a DL-based method for nuclei segmentation in histopathological images, which significantly reduced the time required for manual annotation. This automation not only improves workflow efficiency but also reduces the risk of human error, leading to more consistent and reliable diagnoses. Moreover, AI has shown promise in predicting genetic alterations and identifying prognostic and predictive biomarkers directly from routine tissue slides. A study by Gao et al. (2019) used a DL model to predict microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating the potential of AI to guide treatment decisions. Another study by Xu et al. (2020) applied a DL approach to predict the presence of specific gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which could inform targeted therapy selection. In addition to improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI can also enhance the interpretability of histopathological findings. A study by Janowczyk and Madabhushi (2016) developed a DL framework for quantifying tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer, providing valuable insights into the immune response and patient prognosis. This level of detail can be crucial for personalized treatment planning and monitoring. However, the integration of AI into clinical practice faces several challenges. One major challenge is the need for large, well-annotated datasets to train robust ML and DL models. A study by Litjens et al. (2017) highlighted the importance of data quality and quantity in developing accurate AI models for medical imaging. Additionally, the interpretability and explainability of AI models remain significant concerns, as clinicians require transparent and understandable results to make informed decisions. A study by Tellez et al. (2019) explored the use of attention mechanisms in DL models to highlight relevant regions in histopathological images, enhancing the interpretability of AI predictions. Another challenge is the regulatory and ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in healthcare. Ensuring the safety, efficacy, and fairness of AI systems is crucial for their widespread adoption. A study by Esteva et al. (2019) discussed the regulatory landscape for AI in dermatology, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation and clinical trials before deployment in real-world settings. Similar considerations apply to the use of AI in computational pathology, where patient safety and data privacy are paramount. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI in computational pathology are substantial. By automating routine tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and identifying clinically relevant biomarkers, AI can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of cancer diagnosis and treatment. As the field continues to evolve, ongoing research and collaboration between computer scientists, pathologists, and clinicians will be essential to address the remaining challenges and fully realize the potential of AI in computational pathology. In conclusion, AI has the potential to revolutionize cancer histopathology by improving diagnostic workflows and clinical outcomes. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of AI to automate repetitive tasks, predict genetic alterations, and identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers. While challenges remain, the continued development and integration of AI in computational pathology hold great promise for advancing precision oncology and improving patient care.", "References": [{"title": "Classification and mutation prediction from non-small cell lung cancer histopathology with deep learning", "authors": "N.
