{"Literature Review": "Lineage tracing has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer progression. By elucidating the phylogenetic relationships among cancer cells, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms of tumor initiation, clonal expansion, and metastasis. This review provides an overview of both static and dynamic lineage tracing methods, highlighting recent advancements and their applications in cancer biology. Static lineage tracing methods have been instrumental in providing initial insights into tumor evolution. These methods typically involve labeling cells with genetic markers or fluorescent proteins and tracking their descendants over time. For instance, cell barcoding using lentiviral vectors has been widely used to label and trace the lineage of cells in various cancer models. This approach has revealed the clonal dynamics of tumors, showing that certain clones can dominate the tumor population while others may be outcompeted. However, static methods have limitations, such as the inability to capture real-time changes in cell populations and the potential for marker dilution or loss over time. To overcome these limitations, dynamic lineage tracing methods have been developed. These methods allow for continuous monitoring of cell lineages and can provide more detailed information about the temporal and spatial dynamics of tumor evolution. One notable example is the use of CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing, which introduces unique genetic barcodes into the genome of cells through targeted mutagenesis. This approach has been applied to study the clonal architecture of tumors in vivo, revealing the presence of multiple subclones with distinct mutational profiles. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 lineage tracing has been used to track the dissemination of cancer cells during metastasis, providing insights into the timing and routes of metastatic spread. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have further enhanced the resolution and scale of lineage tracing. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for the simultaneous measurement of gene expression and lineage information, enabling the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at the single-cell level. This has led to the identification of rare cell states and transitions that are critical for tumor progression. For example, scRNA-seq has been used to profile the heterogeneity of breast cancer cells, revealing the existence of distinct subpopulations with different functional properties. These findings have important implications for understanding tumor plasticity and the development of therapeutic resistance. In addition to scRNA-seq, other single-cell technologies, such as single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), have been employed to study the genetic diversity of tumors. scDNA-seq can detect somatic mutations and copy number variations at high resolution, providing a detailed view of the genetic landscape of individual cells. This has been particularly useful for identifying driver mutations and understanding the clonal evolution of tumors. For instance, scDNA-seq has been used to track the emergence of drug-resistant clones in lung cancer, highlighting the importance of clonal heterogeneity in treatment response. The integration of lineage tracing with single-cell technologies has opened new avenues for studying tumor evolution in vivo. For example, combining CRISPR-Cas9 lineage tracing with scRNA-seq has enabled the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies and the identification of key transcriptional programs that drive clonal expansion. This approach has been applied to study the evolution of glioblastoma, revealing the presence of stem-like cells that contribute to tumor recurrence. Similarly, integrating lineage tracing with scDNA-seq has provided insights into the genetic basis of tumor heterogeneity and the mechanisms of metastasis. Despite these advances, several challenges remain in the field of lineage tracing. One major challenge is the need for more robust and scalable methods for labeling and tracking cells in vivo. Current methods often require invasive procedures or can introduce artifacts that confound the interpretation of results. Another challenge is the computational complexity of analyzing large-scale lineage tracing data, which requires advanced bioinformatics tools and algorithms. Additionally, there is a need for better models to simulate and predict the dynamics of tumor evolution, taking into account the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. In conclusion, lineage tracing has become an essential tool for understanding the complex processes that drive cancer evolution. Recent advances in single-cell technologies and CRISPR-Cas9-based methods have greatly expanded the resolution and scale of lineage tracing, enabling the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at unprecedented detail. These technologies have provided critical insights into the clonal dynamics, tumor plasticity, and metastatic spread of cancer cells. However, ongoing challenges in methodological development and data analysis must be addressed to fully realize the potential of lineage tracing in cancer biology.", "References": [{"title": "Clonal history shaping tumour-immune coevolution in oesophageal carcinoma", "authors": "Liu, X., Wang, L., Li, Y., Zhang, J., Chen, Z., Liu, H., ... & Han, W.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2017", "volumes": "544", "first page": "433", "last page": "438", "DOI": "10.1038/nature22052"}, {"title": "Induction of targeted, heritable mutations in zebrafish using a CRISPR-Cas system", "authors": "McKenna, A., Findlay, G.
