{"Literature Review": "The rationale for combining therapies to treat cancer has been a subject of extensive research, driven by the need to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome resistance mechanisms. One of the primary principles guiding this approach is the concept of independent action, which posits that the combined effect of two drugs is the sum of their individual effects. However, recent studies have challenged this notion, suggesting that other factors such as response correlation and collateral sensitivity might play significant roles in explaining the observed outcomes of drug combinations. Independent action, first proposed by Bliss in 1939, assumes that the combined effect of two drugs is the sum of their individual effects, without any interaction between them. This principle has been widely applied in cancer therapy, particularly in the context of chemotherapy and targeted therapies. For instance, a study by Greco et al. (1995) demonstrated that the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel in ovarian cancer treatment could be explained by independent action, where the overall response was the sum of the individual responses to each drug. However, the principle of independent action has been questioned in light of emerging evidence suggesting that biological interactions can lead to outcomes that deviate from the expected additive effects. One such deviation is the concept of synergy, where the combined effect of two drugs is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Synergy has been extensively studied in the context of signal transduction and immunobiology, with many researchers attempting to identify molecular mechanisms that underlie synergistic interactions. Despite the widespread interest in synergy, there is a lack of rigorous mathematical demonstrations that clearly define pharmacologic synergy. A study by Lo et al. (2005) highlighted the challenges in distinguishing between true synergy and other forms of interaction, such as response correlation. They found that positive correlation of response (œÅ) can explain below-independent action results, while negative correlation can explain above-independent action results. This suggests that the observed deviations from independent action might not necessarily indicate true synergy but rather reflect the interplay between different biological processes. Collateral sensitivity, another concept that has gained attention in recent years, refers to the phenomenon where resistance to one drug leads to increased sensitivity to another drug. This concept has been explored in the context of cancer therapy, particularly in the development of combination strategies involving PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. A study by Gao et al. (2016) demonstrated that resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) could be overcome by combining them with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy. This finding suggests that collateral sensitivity might be a more relevant mechanism for achieving above-independent action activity in cancer therapy. The inappropriate use of biological concepts of synergy in the development of cancer drug combinations has been linked to high failure rates in clinical trials, particularly in the field of immuno-oncology. A meta-analysis by Postow et al. (2015) revealed that many immuno-oncology trials failed to meet their primary endpoints, despite showing promising preclinical data. This discrepancy highlights the need for more rigorous applications of independent action and a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms that drive response correlation and collateral sensitivity. In conclusion, while the principle of independent action remains a fundamental concept in the development of cancer drug combinations, it is essential to consider other factors such as response correlation and collateral sensitivity. These factors can provide a more comprehensive explanation for the observed outcomes of drug combinations and help guide the design of more effective therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on developing robust mathematical models and experimental approaches to distinguish between true synergy and other forms of interaction, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes in cancer therapy.", "References": [{"title": "The Calculation of Biological Potencies", "authors": "Bliss, C.
