{"Literature Review": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy by harnessing the body's immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells. However, the efficacy of ICIs is limited to a subset of patients, with approximately 20% of all cancers responding positively to these treatments (Dong et al., 2013). The majority of patients exhibit natural resistance to ICIs, which is often attributed to the creation of immune-resistant microenvironments within tumors. This review aims to explore the key factors contributing to immune resistance and highlight emerging strategies to convert immune-resistant (cold) tumors into immune-sensitive (hot) tumors, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapies. One of the primary mechanisms by which tumors evade the immune system is through the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is characterized by the presence of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which collectively inhibit the activation and function of effector T cells (Teffs) (Gajewski et al., 2013). Additionally, the expression of inhibitory ligands, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), on tumor cells and stromal cells can engage the PD-1 receptor on Teffs, leading to T cell exhaustion and impaired antitumor immunity (Topalian et al., 2012). To overcome these barriers, several strategies have been developed to modulate the TME and enhance the responsiveness of cold tumors to immunotherapies. One approach involves the use of combination therapies that target multiple aspects of the TME. For example, combining ICIs with agents that deplete or inhibit the function of immunosuppressive cells has shown promise in preclinical models and early clinical trials (Kryczek et al., 2015). Specifically, the depletion of Tregs using anti-CD25 antibodies or the inhibition of MDSCs with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to improve the efficacy of ICIs in various cancer types (Quezada et al., 2011; Gabrilovich et al., 2012). Another strategy focuses on the activation of innate immune responses to stimulate the recruitment and activation of Teffs. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, such as imiquimod and resiquimod, have been used to activate dendritic cells (DCs) and promote the presentation of tumor antigens to T cells (Klinman et al., 2004). Similarly, the use of oncolytic viruses, which selectively infect and lyse tumor cells while simultaneously activating the immune system, has shown potential in converting cold tumors into hot tumors (Heo et al., 2013). These viruses can induce the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and cytokines, which attract immune cells and enhance the local inflammatory response. In addition to these approaches, the modulation of the tumor vasculature has emerged as a promising strategy to improve the delivery of immune cells to the tumor site. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, can normalize the tumor vasculature, reducing hypoxia and improving the infiltration of immune cells (Jain, 2005). Furthermore, the use of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) can selectively target and destroy the abnormal blood vessels within the tumor, leading to the collapse of the TME and the exposure of tumor cells to immune attack (O'Reilly et al., 1997). Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have also provided insights into the genetic and molecular alterations that contribute to immune resistance. For instance, mutations in genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, such as beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), can impair the ability of tumor cells to present antigens to T cells, leading to immune evasion (Zaretsky et al., 2016). Similarly, the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules can prevent the recognition of tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (van der Burg et al., 2016). Targeting these genetic alterations with precision therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors or gene editing technologies, may help to restore the sensitivity of tumors to immunotherapies. The development of neoantigen-based vaccines represents another innovative approach to enhancing the immune response against cold tumors. Neoantigens are unique peptides derived from somatic mutations in tumor cells and can be recognized by the immune system as foreign. By identifying and targeting specific neoantigens, personalized vaccines can elicit a robust and specific immune response against the tumor (Ott et al., 2017). Clinical trials evaluating neoantigen-based vaccines in combination with ICIs have shown promising results, with some patients achieving complete responses (Sahin et al., 2017). In conclusion, the conversion of cold tumors into hot tumors is a critical challenge in the field of cancer immunotherapy. By understanding the mechanisms that drive immune resistance and developing multifaceted strategies to modulate the TME, it is possible to enhance the efficacy of ICIs and expand the number of patients who benefit from these life-saving treatments. Future research should focus on optimizing combination therapies and personalized approaches to address the heterogeneity of immune resistance across different cancer types.", "References": [{"title": "PD-1 and its ligands in tolerance and immunity", "authors": "Lieping Chen, Daniel J.
