{"Literature Review": "Fusion oncoproteins (FOs) are chimeric proteins resulting from in-frame chromosomal translocations, which are frequently observed in various aggressive cancers. These FOs play a critical role in cancer progression by altering cellular processes such as transcription, signaling, and chromatin biology. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the oncogenic functions of FOs, where they form biomolecular condensates that can either be nuclear or cytoplasmic, depending on the specific FO involved. Nuclear condensates formed by FOs are particularly significant in altering chromatin biology and gene expression. For instance, the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, commonly found in Ewing's sarcoma, forms nuclear condensates that recruit transcriptional coactivators and chromatin modifiers to enhance the expression of target genes. Similarly, the NPM-ALK fusion protein, associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, also forms nuclear condensates that promote the activation of downstream signaling pathways. These condensates are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and folded domains that facilitate the assembly of multi-protein complexes, thereby amplifying the oncogenic effects. Cytoplasmic condensates, on the other hand, are crucial for promoting aberrant signaling pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK pathway. The BCR-ABL fusion protein, a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), forms cytoplasmic condensates that activate the RAS/MAPK pathway, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. Another example is the TFE3-PRCC fusion protein, which forms cytoplasmic condensates in renal cell carcinoma and enhances the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. These condensates often contain IDRs that enable dynamic interactions with signaling molecules, contributing to the sustained activation of oncogenic pathways. The sequence features of FOs that promote LLPS are well-characterized. IDRs, which are highly flexible and lack a stable secondary structure, are essential for the formation of biomolecular condensates. These regions can engage in multivalent interactions with other biomolecules, facilitating the assembly of condensates. Additionally, folded domains, such as coiled-coil motifs and SH3 domains, provide structural stability and specificity to the interactions within the condensates. The presence of low-complexity sequences (LCSs) and aromatic residues, such as tyrosine and phenylalanine, further enhance the propensity for LLPS. Interestingly, some FOs can also inhibit physiological LLPS in normal cells, leading to the disruption of essential cellular functions. For example, the PAX5-FOXO1 fusion protein, found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), disrupts the formation of physiological condensates required for proper B-cell development. This disruption can lead to impaired differentiation and increased proliferation, contributing to the malignant transformation of cells. The therapeutic potential of targeting LLPS in FO-driven cancers is an emerging area of research. Small molecules that disrupt the formation of biomolecular condensates or interfere with the interactions within the condensates are being explored as potential therapeutic agents. For instance, compounds that target the IDRs of FOs or the interfaces between FOs and their binding partners have shown promise in preclinical studies. Additionally, strategies to modulate the cellular environment, such as altering the concentration of ions or osmolytes, can also affect the stability of condensates and may be exploited for therapeutic benefit. In conclusion, the role of LLPS in the oncogenic functions of FOs is a rapidly evolving field. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and function of biomolecular condensates in cancer can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of FO-driven cancers and open avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific sequence features and interactions that drive LLPS in different types of FOs and to identify effective targets for intervention.", "References": [{"title": "Biological condensates: organizing principles of liquid-like matter", "authors": "S.F.
