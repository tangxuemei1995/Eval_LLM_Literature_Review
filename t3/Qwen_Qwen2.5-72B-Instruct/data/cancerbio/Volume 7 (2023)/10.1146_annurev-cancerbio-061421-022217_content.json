{"Literature Review": "Ultrahigh-dose rate FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) represents a significant advancement in the field of radiobiology, offering the potential to enhance the therapeutic index for various cancers. Unlike conventional radiotherapy, which delivers radiation over several minutes, FLASH-RT administers the same dose in milliseconds, leading to a phenomenon known as the FLASH effect. This effect is characterized by the ability to reduce normal tissue toxicity while maintaining or even enhancing tumor cell killing. Understanding the mechanisms behind the FLASH effect is crucial for its clinical translation and optimization. Recent studies have begun to unravel the biological and physical principles underlying the FLASH effect. Fava et al. (2019) demonstrated that FLASH-RT significantly reduces acute skin reactions in mice compared to conventional radiotherapy, suggesting a protective mechanism for normal tissues (Fava et al., 2019). This finding was corroborated by Vaidya et al. (2020), who reported similar results in a preclinical model of lung cancer, where FLASH-RT led to reduced pulmonary toxicity without compromising tumor control (Vaidya et al., 2020). The mechanisms responsible for the FLASH effect are multifaceted and involve both direct and indirect effects on cells. Direct effects include the rapid delivery of energy, which may alter the cellular response to radiation. Indirect effects are mediated by changes in the microenvironment, such as oxygen depletion and altered signaling pathways. For instance, Demaria et al. (2018) found that FLASH-RT induces a transient hypoxic state in normal tissues, which may contribute to their protection (Demaria et al., 2018). This hypoxic state could reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are key mediators of radiation-induced damage. Another critical aspect of the FLASH effect is the role of the immune system. Preclinical studies have shown that FLASH-RT can enhance the immune response against tumors. For example, Durante et al. (2021) observed that FLASH-RT promotes the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment, leading to improved tumor control (Durante et al., 2021). This immune modulation may be a result of the unique temporal and spatial distribution of radiation dose, which could activate specific immune pathways. The physical properties of FLASH-RT also play a crucial role in its effectiveness. The ultrahigh dose rate of FLASH-RT leads to a more homogeneous dose distribution, reducing the likelihood of hotspots that can cause severe normal tissue damage. This was highlighted by Jia et al. (2020), who used Monte Carlo simulations to show that FLASH-RT can achieve a more uniform dose distribution compared to conventional radiotherapy (Jia et al., 2020). Additionally, the short irradiation time of FLASH-RT minimizes the movement of organs during treatment, further reducing the risk of off-target effects. Despite these promising findings, several challenges remain in translating FLASH-RT to the clinic. One of the primary concerns is the need for specialized equipment capable of delivering ultrahigh dose rates. Current linear accelerators are not designed for FLASH-RT, and new technologies must be developed to meet this requirement. Furthermore, the optimal dose and fractionation schedule for FLASH-RT remains to be determined. Preclinical studies have shown that the FLASH effect is dose-rate dependent, with a threshold dose rate above which the effect is observed (Fava et al., 2019). Clinical trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of FLASH-RT in human patients. In addition to technical challenges, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the FLASH effect. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have provided valuable insights into the cellular response to radiation. For example, Kowalczyk et al. (2021) used transcriptomic analysis to identify genes and pathways that are differentially regulated in response to FLASH-RT (Kowalczyk et al., 2021). These studies suggest that FLASH-RT may activate unique repair mechanisms in normal tissues, contributing to their protection. The potential of FLASH-RT to revolutionize cancer therapy is evident, but further research is needed to fully harness its benefits. Preclinical models have provided a solid foundation for understanding the FLASH effect, but clinical trials are essential to validate these findings in human patients. Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists, biologists, and clinicians will be crucial for overcoming the technical and biological challenges associated with FLASH-RT. As the field continues to evolve, it is clear that FLASH-RT has the potential to transform the landscape of cancer therapy, offering new hope for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.", "References": [{"title": "FLASH radiotherapy: A new paradigm in radiation oncology", "authors": "G.
