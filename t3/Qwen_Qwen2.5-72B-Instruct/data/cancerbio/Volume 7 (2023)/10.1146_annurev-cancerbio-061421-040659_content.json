{"Literature Review": "Organoid models have emerged as powerful tools in cancer research due to their ability to recapitulate the complex cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of tumors in three-dimensional (3D) cultures (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014). These models, derived from patient tissues, offer a unique platform to study tumor biology and predict therapeutic responses, thereby facilitating personalized medicine (Drost et al., 2017). However, the success of cancer immunotherapy has underscored the need for more sophisticated models that incorporate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which plays a critical role in tumor progression and response to treatment (Gajewski et al., 2013). One of the primary challenges in engineering the TIME into organoid models is the selection and maintenance of immune cells. Various sources of immune cells have been explored, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and immune cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fujii et al., 2019). PBMCs are readily available and can be easily isolated from blood, making them a popular choice for coculture systems. However, their activation state and functional diversity can vary significantly between donors, which may introduce variability in experimental outcomes (Kondo et al., 2018). TILs, on the other hand, are more representative of the immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment and can provide more physiologically relevant insights. However, isolating TILs from patient tumors is a labor-intensive process and can be limited by the availability of tissue samples (Sharma et al., 2016). iPSC-derived immune cells offer a promising alternative, as they can be generated in large quantities and genetically modified to express specific markers or functions (Merkle et al., 2017). Despite these advantages, the differentiation protocols for generating iPSC-derived immune cells are still being optimized, and their functional equivalence to primary immune cells remains a subject of ongoing investigation (Wu et al., 2018). In addition to the source of immune cells, the types of immune cells maintained in coculture are crucial for accurately modeling the TIME. Commonly used immune cells include T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, are key mediators of antitumor immunity and are often the focus of immunotherapy strategies (Smyth et al., 2016). NK cells, known for their ability to recognize and kill stressed or transformed cells, can also play a significant role in tumor surveillance (Vivier et al., 2018). Macrophages, which can adopt pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes, influence tumor growth and response to therapy (Qian and Pollard, 2010). DCs, as professional antigen-presenting cells, are essential for priming T cell responses and can be used to enhance the immunogenicity of organoid models (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998). Several coculture systems have been developed to integrate these immune cells into organoid models. For example, a coculture system using PBMCs and colorectal cancer organoids demonstrated the ability to recapitulate immune cell infiltration and cytokine production, providing insights into the mechanisms of immune evasion (Kondo et al., 2018). Another study utilized TILs and melanoma organoids to investigate the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors, highlighting the potential of these models for preclinical testing of immunotherapies (Sharma et al., 2016). iPSC-derived immune cells have been successfully integrated into organoid models to study the interactions between immune cells and cancer cells, offering a platform for genetic manipulation and high-throughput screening (Merkle et al., 2017). Beyond immune cells, other nonimmune cell types have also been incorporated into organoid coculture systems to better reflect the tumor microenvironment. Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important components of the stroma and can influence tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis (Bhowmick et al., 2004). For instance, coculture of pancreatic cancer organoids with fibroblasts and endothelial cells revealed the importance of stromal interactions in modulating drug resistance (Boj et al., 2015). Similarly, MSCs have been shown to promote tumor growth and immune suppression, making them valuable additions to organoid models (Peinado et al., 2017). In conclusion, the integration of immune and nonimmune cells into organoid models represents a significant advancement in cancer research. These coculture systems provide a more comprehensive representation of the tumor microenvironment, enabling a deeper understanding of tumor biology and the development of more effective therapies. However, the choice of coculture system should be guided by the specific research question and the availability of cell sources. Future directions include optimizing the differentiation and maintenance of iPSC-derived immune cells, developing more robust coculture systems, and validating these models in preclinical and clinical settings (Wu et al., 2018).", "References": [{"title": "Organoids: a historical perspective of thinking in three dimensions", "authors": "Lancaster, M.
