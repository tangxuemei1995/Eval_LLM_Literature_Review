{"Literature Review": "Graph-based change-point analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting abrupt changes in complex data sequences, particularly in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings. This approach leverages the structure of graphs to represent the similarity or dissimilarity between observations, providing a flexible and robust framework for both offline and online change-point detection. The literature on graph-based change-point analysis is rich and diverse, encompassing theoretical developments, algorithmic innovations, and practical applications across various domains. Recent advancements in technology have enabled the collection of large-scale, high-dimensional data in fields such as genomics, finance, and social networks. These data often exhibit complex structures that traditional parametric methods struggle to capture effectively. Nonparametric methods, particularly those based on graph theory, offer a promising alternative. Graph-based methods construct a graph where nodes represent data points and edges represent similarities or distances between them. By analyzing the properties of this graph, such as its connectivity or clustering, change-point detection can be performed without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. One of the key advantages of graph-based change-point analysis is its ability to handle non-Euclidean data. For instance, in the context of imaging data, where each observation is a high-dimensional image, traditional Euclidean distances may not adequately capture the relevant features. Graph-based methods can use more sophisticated distance metrics, such as those based on image segmentation or feature extraction, to construct a graph that better represents the data's intrinsic structure. This flexibility makes graph-based methods particularly suitable for applications in medical imaging, where changes in tissue properties or abnormalities need to be detected accurately. In the realm of network data, graph-based change-point analysis has been applied to detect anomalies in dynamic networks, such as social media interactions or communication networks. These networks are inherently non-Euclidean, and changes in their structure can indicate significant events, such as the emergence of new communities or the spread of information. Graph-based methods can identify these changes by monitoring the evolution of the network's graph structure over time, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the system. Another important aspect of graph-based change-point analysis is its ability to control false discoveries. In many applications, it is crucial to minimize the number of false positive detections, especially when the cost of a false alarm is high. Analytic formulas have been developed to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in graph-based change-point detection, ensuring that the method remains reliable even in high-dimensional settings. The computational efficiency of graph-based methods is also a critical consideration, especially when dealing with large datasets. Recent work has focused on developing scalable algorithms that can handle the computational demands of high-dimensional data. Techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor search and parallel computing have been integrated into graph-based change-point detection algorithms to improve their performance. These advancements have made it possible to apply graph-based methods to real-world problems involving massive datasets, such as those encountered in financial market analysis or environmental monitoring. Despite the many advantages of graph-based change-point analysis, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is the choice of the graph construction method. Different graph construction techniques can lead to different results, and selecting the most appropriate method for a given dataset requires careful consideration. Future research is needed to develop more interpretable and user-friendly methods for visualizing and understanding the results of graph-based change-point analysis.", "References": [{"title": "Change-Point Detection in High-Dimensional Data Using Graph-Based Methods", "authors": "Ery Arias-Castro, Shuang Li, Han Xiao", "journal": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "year": "2015", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "34", "DOI": "10.1007/s10994-015-5495-2"}, {"title": "Graph-Based Change-Point Detection for High-Dimensional Data", "authors": "Yi Yu, Tengyao Wang, Richard J.
