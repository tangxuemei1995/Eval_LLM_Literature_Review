{"Literature Review": "Simulation-based Bayesian analysis has evolved significantly over the past few decades, driven by advancements in computational methods and the development of specialized software. This review traces the evolution of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, from the early days of Gibbs sampling to the current state-of-the-art techniques, including gradient-based methods and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). We also discuss the role of statistical software in making Bayesian inference accessible to a broader audience. The origins of modern MCMC methods can be traced back to the late 1980s with the introduction of Gibbs sampling. Gelfand and Smith (1990) were among the first to popularize Gibbs sampling, demonstrating its effectiveness in Bayesian inference for complex models. Gibbs sampling is a special case of MCMC where the target distribution is sampled by iteratively drawing from the conditional distributions of each parameter given the others. This method was particularly useful for models with high-dimensional parameter spaces, as it allowed for efficient exploration of the posterior distribution. As the complexity of models increased, so did the need for more sophisticated sampling techniques. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, introduced by Hastings (1970), provided a general framework for constructing MCMC samplers. This algorithm allows for the proposal of new states based on a proposal distribution, which can be tailored to the specific characteristics of the target distribution. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm has been widely used in various applications, from physics to economics, and remains a fundamental tool in Bayesian computation. The development of software for Bayesian inference has played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of MCMC methods. One of the earliest and most influential software packages was BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling), developed by Lunn et al. (2000). BUGS provided a user-friendly interface for specifying complex Bayesian models and performing MCMC sampling. It was particularly notable for its ability to handle a wide range of models, including hierarchical and non-linear models, making it a valuable tool for applied statisticians. In the early 2000s, the introduction of JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) by Plummer (2003) further simplified the process of Bayesian modeling. JAGS extended the capabilities of BUGS by allowing users to define their own distributions and functions, providing greater flexibility in model specification. Both BUGS and JAGS have been instrumental in democratizing Bayesian inference, enabling researchers without extensive programming skills to perform complex analyses. The next major advancement in MCMC methods came with the development of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and its implementation in the Stan software package. HMC, introduced by Duane et al. (1987), leverages the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics to propose new states in the parameter space. This approach can significantly reduce the correlation between samples, leading to more efficient exploration of the posterior distribution. Stan, developed by Carpenter et al. (2017), provides a powerful and flexible platform for Bayesian modeling, supporting a wide range of models and offering advanced features such as automatic differentiation and adaptive step size selection. In recent years, there has been growing interest in gradient-based MCMC methods, which utilize the gradient of the log-posterior to guide the sampling process. These methods, including the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) and the Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC), have shown promise in improving the efficiency and robustness of MCMC sampling. NUTS, developed by Hoffman and Gelman (2014), automatically tunes the parameters of the HMC algorithm to avoid the need for manual tuning, making it more user-friendly. RMHMC, introduced by Girolami and Calderhead (2011), incorporates geometric information about the parameter space to adaptively adjust the proposal distribution, leading to more efficient sampling in complex models. Another emerging area in MCMC research is the use of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). PDMPs, such as the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS) and the Zig-Zag Sampler, offer a different approach to MCMC by using continuous-time dynamics to explore the parameter space. These methods have been shown to be particularly effective in high-dimensional settings, where traditional MCMC methods can struggle. Bouchard-Côté et al. (2018) demonstrated the potential of PDMPs in Bayesian inference, highlighting their ability to efficiently sample from complex distributions. The development of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods has also contributed to the advancement of simulation-based Bayesian analysis. ABC methods, such as those described by Beaumont et al. (2002), allow for Bayesian inference in models where the likelihood function is intractable or computationally expensive to evaluate. By approximating the likelihood using summary statistics, ABC methods have found applications in fields such as population genetics and systems biology. In parallel with the development of MCMC methods, there has been significant progress in the integration of Bayesian inference with other computational techniques. For example, the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method, introduced by Rue et al. (2009), provides a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC for a class of latent Gaussian models. INLA avoids the need for MCMC sampling by using deterministic approximations to the posterior distribution, making it particularly suitable for large datasets and real-time applications. The future of simulation-based Bayesian analysis is likely to be shaped by ongoing research into new MCMC methods and the continued development of user-friendly software. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to play a significant role in this evolution, with the potential to automate many aspects of the modeling process. As the complexity of models continues to grow, the need for efficient and scalable inference methods will become increasingly important. The development of new software packages that incorporate these advances will be crucial in ensuring that Bayesian inference remains accessible and relevant to a wide range of scientific disciplines. In conclusion, the evolution of MCMC methods and the development of specialized software have been instrumental in advancing the field of simulation-based Bayesian analysis. From the early days of Gibbs sampling to the current state-of-the-art techniques, these developments have enabled researchers to tackle increasingly complex models and datasets. As research into new MCMC methods continues, it is likely that future generations of software will incorporate these innovations, further enhancing the user experience and expanding the applicability of Bayesian inference.", "References": [{"title": "Sampling-Based Approaches to Calculating Marginal Densities", "authors": "Alan E.
