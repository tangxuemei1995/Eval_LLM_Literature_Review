{"Literature Review": "The three-decision method (3DM) offers a compelling alternative to the traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) framework. Unlike NHST, which often reduces complex data to a binary decision (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis), 3DM allows researchers to make one of three decisions: assert the parameter is positive, assert the parameter is negative, or remain agnostic. This approach aligns more closely with the practical needs of many scientific inquiries, where the direction of an effect is often of primary interest (Tukey, 1960).\n\nThe foundational work of Tukey (1960) laid the groundwork for 3DM by emphasizing the importance of considering the sign of a parameter relative to a specified null value. This method provides a more nuanced and practical interpretation of statistical results, particularly in fields where the direction of an effect has significant implications. For instance, in medical research, determining whether a treatment has a positive or negative effect can be crucial for clinical decision-making.\n\nOne of the key advantages of 3DM is its ability to integrate seamlessly with other statistical tools. For example, Bayesian methods can be adapted to fit within the 3DM framework. Berger and Sellke (1987) demonstrated that Bayesian posterior probabilities can be used to make three-decision inferences, providing a robust alternative to frequentist p-values. This integration allows researchers to leverage the strengths of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, enhancing the interpretability and reliability of their results.\n\nPower calculations, a critical component of study design, can also be enhanced using 3DM. Traditional power calculations focus on the ability to detect a significant effect, but 3DM extends this by considering the power to detect the direction of the effect. This extension is particularly useful in exploratory studies where the primary goal is to identify the direction of an effect rather than just its presence (Cohen, 1988). By incorporating directionality, 3DM provides a more comprehensive assessment of the study's ability to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nConfidence intervals, another fundamental tool in statistical inference, can be interpreted within the 3DM framework. Greenland (2017) argued that confidence intervals should be used to assess the range of plausible values for a parameter, including the possibility that the parameter could be zero. This interpretation aligns well with 3DM, as it allows researchers to make informed decisions about the direction of the effect based on the interval's position relative to the null value. This approach enhances the transparency and interpretability of statistical results, making them more accessible to non-statisticians.\n\nMultiple testing corrections, a common challenge in large-scale data analysis, can also benefit from the 3DM framework. Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) introduced the false discovery rate (FDR) as a method to control the expected proportion of false positives among rejected hypotheses. However, 3DM can further refine this approach by considering the direction of the effects. By focusing on the directionality of multiple tests, researchers can better understand the overall pattern of results and avoid over-interpreting individual findings (Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001).\n\nSensitivity analysis, a technique used to assess the robustness of statistical conclusions, can also be enhanced using 3DM. Ioannidis (2005) highlighted the importance of sensitivity analysis in evaluating the reliability of research findings. By incorporating 3DM, researchers can perform sensitivity analyses that consider the direction of the effect, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the study's robustness. This approach helps to identify potential sources of bias and uncertainty, ensuring that conclusions are well-founded.\n\nThe 3DM framework has been applied to various types of statistical models, including linear regression and generalized linear models. For example, Gelman and Carlin (2014) demonstrated how 3DM can be used to interpret the coefficients in regression models, providing a clear and intuitive understanding of the direction and magnitude of the effects. This application is particularly useful in social sciences, where the relationships between variables are often complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn summary, the three-decision method offers a sensible and practical approach to statistical testing. By allowing researchers to make decisions about the direction of an effect, 3DM enhances the interpretability and reliability of statistical results. This framework can be integrated with other statistical tools, including Bayesian methods, power calculations, confidence intervals, multiple testing corrections, and sensitivity analysis, providing a comprehensive and flexible approach to data analysis. As the scientific community continues to grapple with issues of reproducibility and interpretability, 3DM represents a valuable tool for improving the quality and impact of research.", "References": [{"title": "The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons", "authors": "John W.
