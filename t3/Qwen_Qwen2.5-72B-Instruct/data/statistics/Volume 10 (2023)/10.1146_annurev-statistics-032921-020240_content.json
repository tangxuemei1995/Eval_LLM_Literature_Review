{"Literature Review": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are essential components in the process of validating and refining statistical models. These tasks are particularly important when dealing with quantile-based forecasts, which are widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, and meteorology. This literature review focuses on the methodologies and tools used for evaluating the performance of quantile-based models, emphasizing both in-sample diagnostics and out-of-sample forecast evaluation. Quantile-based forecasts provide a comprehensive view of the distribution of future outcomes, allowing for the assessment of different levels of uncertainty. Unconditional calibration, which is often referred to as coverage criteria, is a fundamental concept in this context. It ensures that the predicted quantiles cover the actual outcomes at the specified probability levels. For instance, a 90% prediction interval should contain the true value 90% of the time. This concept has been extensively studied in the literature, with methods such as coverage plots being commonly used to visualize the performance of quantile forecasts. However, unconditional calibration alone is insufficient for a thorough evaluation of model performance. Conditional calibration, which assesses the accuracy of quantile forecasts given specific conditions or covariates, provides a more stringent test of model adequacy. Conditional calibration can be visualized using quantile reliability diagrams, which plot the observed frequency of outcomes against the predicted quantiles. These diagrams help identify systematic biases and miscalibrations in the model. Consistent scoring functions play a crucial role in the comparative assessment and ranking of quantile-based models. The most widely used scoring function in this context is the asymmetric piecewise linear score, also known as the pinball loss. This scoring function penalizes over- and under-predictions differently, depending on the quantile level. The pinball loss is a proper scoring rule, meaning that it encourages honest and accurate predictions. Other consistent scoring functions, such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), have also been proposed and are gaining popularity due to their flexibility and robustness. The coefficient of determination (R²) and skill scores are additional metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of quantile-based models. The R² measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model, while skill scores compare the performance of a model to a reference or benchmark model. These metrics provide a standardized way to assess the relative improvement of a new model over existing ones. To illustrate the practical application of these tools, we consider three case studies: Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Engel's food expenditure data, a classic dataset in econometrics, has been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of quantile regression in capturing the heterogeneity in expenditure patterns across different income levels. The Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, a large-scale forecasting challenge, highlighted the importance of probabilistic forecasting and the use of consistent scoring functions in evaluating model performance. The US COVID-19 Forecast Hub, a platform for aggregating and evaluating forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths, has provided valuable insights into the challenges and best practices of real-time forecasting during a global pandemic. In conclusion, model diagnostics and forecast evaluation for quantiles involve a combination of unconditional and conditional calibration, consistent scoring functions, and performance metrics such as R² and skill scores. These tools are essential for ensuring that quantile-based models are reliable, accurate, and useful in practical applications. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated methods for conditional calibration and exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to improve the performance of quantile-based forecasts.", "References": [{"title": "Strictly Proper Scoring Rules, Prediction, and Estimation", "authors": "Tilmann Gneiting, Adrian E.
