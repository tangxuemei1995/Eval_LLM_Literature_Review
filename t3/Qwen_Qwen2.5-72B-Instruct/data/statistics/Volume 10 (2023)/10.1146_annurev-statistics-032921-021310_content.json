{"Literature Review": "Survival analysis is a critical tool in biostatistics and epidemiology, particularly when dealing with complex data structures such as clustered or recurrent events. Frailty models, which incorporate random effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity, have become a popular method for handling dependent survival data. This review aims to summarize recent advances in shared frailty methods, focusing on their application in various settings, including clustered data, competing events, and recurrent events. One of the primary contexts where frailty models are applied is in clustered survival data, where observations are grouped into clusters such as families or medical centers. The presence of clustering can lead to correlated survival times within the same cluster, violating the assumption of independence in standard survival models. To address this, shared frailty models introduce a random effect, or frailty, that captures the unobserved heterogeneity within clusters. The Cox proportional hazards model with a shared frailty term has been widely used in this context. For instance, Ripatti and Palmgren (2000) proposed a method for fitting Cox models with a gamma-distributed frailty, which has since been implemented in several statistical software packages, including R. The coxme package in R, developed by Therneau (2021), provides a flexible framework for fitting Cox models with mixed effects, including shared frailties. In addition to the Cox model, the accelerated failure time (AFT) model is another popular choice for survival analysis. The AFT model assumes that the effect of covariates is to accelerate or decelerate the time to event. When dealing with clustered data, the AFT model can be extended to include a shared frailty term. Hougaard (2000) provided a comprehensive overview of AFT models with frailties, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate distributions for the frailty term. The frailtypack package in R, developed by Rondeau et al. (2012), offers a range of functions for fitting AFT models with shared frailties, supporting various frailty distributions such as gamma and inverse Gaussian. Competing events, where multiple types of events can occur, pose another challenge in survival analysis. In such scenarios, the occurrence of one event may preclude the occurrence of others, leading to competing risks. Frailty models can be adapted to handle competing risks by incorporating a shared frailty term that accounts for the dependence between different types of events. Geskus (2011) discussed the use of frailty models in the context of competing risks, emphasizing the need to carefully specify the model to ensure valid inference. The cmprsk package in R, developed by Gray (2014), provides tools for analyzing competing risks data, including the ability to fit frailty models. Recurrent events, where individuals can experience multiple events over time, are another important application of frailty models. In this setting, the frailty term captures the individual-specific risk of experiencing recurrent events. Liu and Huang (2008) proposed a semiparametric frailty model for recurrent events, which allows for flexible modeling of the baseline hazard function. The survival package in R, developed by Therneau and Grambsch (2000), includes functions for fitting frailty models to recurrent event data, making it a valuable resource for researchers in this area. Regression trees and random survival forests have gained popularity in recent years as non-parametric methods for survival analysis. These methods can handle complex interactions and non-linear relationships between covariates and survival outcomes. Ishwaran et al. (2008) introduced the concept of random survival forests, which extend the idea of random forests to survival data. The randomForestSRC package in R, developed by Ishwaran and Kogalur (2021), provides an implementation of random survival forests that can incorporate frailty terms to account for dependence in the data. Estimation methods for frailty models have also seen significant advancements. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) remains a common approach, but it can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets. Penalized likelihood methods, which add a penalty term to the likelihood function to regularize the estimates, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency. Rizopoulos (2012) discussed the use of penalized likelihood methods in the context of frailty models, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing bias and improving convergence. The JM package in R, developed by Rizopoulos (2016), provides functions for fitting joint models with frailties using penalized likelihood methods. Bayesian methods offer an alternative approach to estimating frailty models, providing a natural way to incorporate prior information and handle complex dependencies. Ibrahim et al. (2001) provided a comprehensive overview of Bayesian methods for survival analysis, including frailty models. The rstan package in R, developed by Stan Development Team (2021), allows researchers to fit Bayesian frailty models using the Stan probabilistic programming language, offering a flexible and powerful tool for complex survival data analysis. In conclusion, shared frailty models have evolved significantly in recent years, with a wide range of applications in clustered data, competing events, and recurrent events. Advances in estimation methods, including MLE, penalized likelihood, and Bayesian approaches, have made these models more accessible and computationally feasible. The availability of specialized R packages, such as coxme, frailtypack, cmprsk, survival, randomForestSRC, and JM, has further facilitated their use in practical applications. As survival data continue to become more complex, the development and refinement of frailty models will remain an important area of research.", "References": [{"title": "Cox regression with fixed covariates and random effects", "authors": "S.
