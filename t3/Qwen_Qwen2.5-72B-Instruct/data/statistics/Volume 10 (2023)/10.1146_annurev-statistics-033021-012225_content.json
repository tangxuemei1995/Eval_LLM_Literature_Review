{"Literature Review": "The detection of exoplanets using radial velocity (RV) measurements has been a cornerstone of modern astronomy, providing valuable insights into the architecture of planetary systems and the properties of individual exoplanets. RV methods measure the Doppler shift in the spectrum of a star caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets, allowing for the determination of planetary masses and orbital parameters. Despite its significance, RV data analysis is fraught with challenges, particularly due to the presence of complex, temporally correlated instrumental and astrophysical noise, and the need to explore a large parameter space efficiently. One of the primary challenges in RV data analysis is the presence of correlated noise. This noise can arise from both instrumental sources, such as variations in the spectrograph's performance, and astrophysical sources, such as stellar activity and granulation. Traditional methods often assume white noise, which can lead to biased parameter estimates and incorrect confidence intervals. To address this, several advanced statistical techniques have been developed. For instance, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been widely used to model correlated noise in RV data. GPs provide a flexible framework for capturing the temporal correlations and can be adapted to different noise structures. However, the choice of the GP kernel and hyperparameters remains a critical issue, as it can significantly affect the accuracy of the noise model. Another significant challenge is the efficient exploration of the parameter space. RV data are typically unevenly sampled and can span a wide range of timescales, making the optimization of model parameters computationally intensive. Bayesian methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, have become popular for this purpose. MCMC allows for the exploration of the posterior distribution of model parameters, providing a robust way to estimate uncertainties and compare different models. However, the computational cost of MCMC can be high, especially for models with many parameters. To mitigate this, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and variational inference (VI) have been proposed as faster alternatives. Model comparison is another crucial aspect of RV data analysis. Given the complexity of the data, it is essential to evaluate the relative merits of different models, including those with varying numbers of planets and different noise structures. Information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are commonly used for model selection. However, these criteria can be sensitive to the choice of prior distributions and may not always provide a clear ranking of models. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) offers a more comprehensive approach by considering multiple models simultaneously and weighting their contributions based on their posterior probabilities. The issue of model misspecification is also a concern in RV data analysis. If the assumed model does not accurately capture the underlying physical processes, the parameter estimates can be biased. This is particularly relevant when dealing with complex noise sources and multi-planet systems. Techniques such as cross-validation and out-of-sample testing can help assess the robustness of the model and identify potential misspecifications. Additionally, incorporating physical priors and constraints can improve the reliability of the model. The analysis of multivariate time series is another important consideration in RV data analysis. RV measurements are often accompanied by other types of data, such as photometric observations, which can provide additional constraints on the system. Joint modeling of these data can lead to more accurate and robust parameter estimates. For example, combining RV and transit data can help break degeneracies between the planet's mass and radius. However, the integration of multiple data streams requires careful consideration of the correlations and dependencies between them. In summary, the detection and characterization of exoplanets using RV data present a range of methodological and numerical challenges. Advanced statistical techniques, such as Gaussian processes, Bayesian methods, and model comparison tools, have been developed to address these challenges. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the areas of noise modeling, efficient parameter exploration, and the integration of multiple data streams. Future research should focus on developing more robust and computationally efficient methods to fully exploit the potential of RV data in the search for Earth-like exoplanets.", "References": [{"title": "Detection of exoplanets by Doppler spectroscopy", "authors": "R.
