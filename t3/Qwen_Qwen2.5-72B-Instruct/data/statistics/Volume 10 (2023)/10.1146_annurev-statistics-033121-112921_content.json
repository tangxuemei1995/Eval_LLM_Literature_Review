{"Literature Review": "Statistical data privacy (SDP) has emerged as a critical field in response to the growing tension between the demand for open data sharing and the need to protect sensitive information. This review aims to explore the statistical foundations common to two dominant frameworks in SDP: statistical disclosure control (SDC) and differential privacy (DP). Both frameworks address the challenge of releasing data while ensuring that individual privacy is maintained, but they differ in their approaches and theoretical underpinnings. SDC is a well-established framework that focuses on modifying datasets to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. Techniques within SDC include data masking, data swapping, and noise addition. The primary goal of SDC is to balance the utility of the released data with the risk of re-identification. One of the key challenges in SDC is defining and measuring disclosure risk. Differential privacy, introduced by Dwork et al. (2006), provides a formal mathematical framework for privacy protection. Unlike SDC, which focuses on specific datasets, DP guarantees that the inclusion or exclusion of any individual's data in the dataset has a negligible impact on the output of a statistical analysis. This strong privacy guarantee is achieved through the addition of carefully calibrated noise to the data or the results of queries. The ε-differential privacy model, where ε is a privacy parameter, quantifies the level of privacy protection. Despite their different approaches, SDC and DP share common statistical problems at their core. Both frameworks aim to design optimal release mechanisms and associated estimators that satisfy bounds on disclosure risk measures. Valid statistical inferences from mechanism outputs require uncertainty quantification that accounts for the effect of the sanitization mechanism. While significant progress has been made in SDP, several open research problems remain. One of the most pressing issues is the development of efficient and practical algorithms for high-dimensional data. High-dimensional datasets pose unique challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, which can exacerbate the trade-off between privacy and utility. Another area of active research is the integration of machine learning with SDP. Machine learning models can be highly sensitive to the quality of the input data, and ensuring that these models are trained on differentially private data without sacrificing performance is a significant challenge. Statistical data privacy is a rapidly evolving field that addresses the critical need to balance data utility with individual privacy. Both SDC and DP offer valuable tools for achieving this balance, and their common statistical foundations provide a solid basis for further research. As the demand for open data sharing continues to grow, the development of more efficient and practical SDP methods will be essential. Future research should focus on addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional data and the integration of machine learning, as well as exploring new applications of SDP in various domains.", "References": [{"title": "A Method for Quantifying the Risk of Re-Identification in De-Identified Health Data", "authors": "Khaled El Emam, Fida Dankar", "journal": "Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association", "year": "2008", "volumes": "15", "first page": "639", "last page": "646", "DOI": "10.1197/jamia.M2712"}, {"title": "Calibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data Analysis", "authors": "Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim, Adam Smith", "journal": "Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC)", "year": "2006", "volumes": "3876", "first page": "265", "last page": "284", "DOI": "10.1007/11681878_14"}, {"title": "Mechanism Design via Differential Privacy", "authors": "Frank McSherry, Kunal Talwar", "journal": "48th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)", "year": "2007", "first page": "94", "last page": "103", "DOI": "10.1109/FOCS.2007.66"}, {"title": "No Free Lunch in Data Privacy", "authors": "Daniel Kifer, Ashwin Machanavajjhala", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data", "year": "2011", "first page": "193", "last page": "204", "DOI": "10.1145/1989323.1989343"}, {"title": "A Statistical Framework for Differential Privacy", "authors": "Larry Wasserman, Shuheng Zhou", "journal": "Journal of the American Statistical Association", "year": "2010", "volumes": "105", "first page": "375", "last page": "389", "DOI": "10.1198/jasa.2009.tm08659"}, {"title": "Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds", "authors": "Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke", "journal": "Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC)", "year": "2016", "volumes": "9986", "first page": "635", "last page": "658", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-662-53644-5_24"}, {"title": "Deep Learning with Differential Privacy", "authors": "Martín Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, H.
