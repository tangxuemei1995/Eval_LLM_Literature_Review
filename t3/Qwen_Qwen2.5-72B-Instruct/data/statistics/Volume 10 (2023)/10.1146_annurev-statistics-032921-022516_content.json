{"Literature Review": "Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in models defined on positive and negative integers. These models are particularly relevant in various application areas where data are differences between positive integers. Examples include price changes measured discretely in financial applications, pre- and post-treatment measurements of discrete outcomes in clinical trials, the difference in the number of goals in sports events, and differencing of count-valued time series. This review aims to bring together a wide range of models that have appeared in the literature in recent decades, focusing on discrete distributions, univariate and multivariate time-series models, and specific classes of models such as autoregressive models, stochastic processes, and ARCH-GARCH-type models. Discrete distributions defined for integer data are fundamental to modeling integer-valued data. One of the most well-known distributions is the Skellam distribution, which is the distribution of the difference of two independent Poisson-distributed random variables (Skellam, 1946). The Skellam distribution has been widely used in various fields, including sports analytics (Karlis & Ntzoufras, 2003) and financial econometrics (Al-Osh & Alzaid, 1987). Another important distribution is the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution, which generalizes the Poisson distribution and can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion (Shmueli et al., 2005). Univariate time-series models for integer data have also received significant attention. Autoregressive (AR) models are a common choice for modeling integer-valued time series. For instance, the integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) model, introduced by McKenzie (1985), extends the classical AR model to integer-valued data. The INAR model uses a thinning operator to ensure that the process remains integer-valued. Extensions of the INAR model, such as the INAR(p) model, have been developed to capture higher-order dependencies (Al-Osh & Alzaid, 1992). Stochastic processes for integer data are another important class of models. The Poisson process is a fundamental example, but it assumes that the data are non-negative. To model integer-valued data, the Skellam process, which is the difference of two independent Poisson processes, has been proposed (Kedem & Fokianos, 2002). The Skellam process is particularly useful for modeling the difference in counts over time, such as the net change in stock prices or the difference in the number of goals scored by two teams in a sports event. Multivariate time-series models for integer data are essential for capturing dependencies between multiple integer-valued time series. The multivariate integer-valued autoregressive (MINAR) model, introduced by Heinen (2003), extends the INAR model to the multivariate case. The MINAR model uses a matrix of thinning operators to capture the dependencies between the different series. This model has been applied in various fields, including finance (Heinen & Rengifo, 2007) and epidemiology (Fokianos & Kedem, 2003). ARCH-GARCH-type models have also been adapted for integer-valued data. The integer-valued GARCH (INGARCH) model, introduced by Ferland et al. (2006), extends the classical GARCH model to integer-valued data. The INGARCH model captures the conditional heteroskedasticity in integer-valued time series, making it suitable for modeling financial data with discrete price changes. Extensions of the INGARCH model, such as the zero-inflated INGARCH (ZIINGARCH) model, have been developed to handle excess zeros in the data (Cui & Zhu, 2006). In conclusion, the literature on models for integer data is rich and diverse, encompassing a wide range of distributions, univariate and multivariate time-series models, and specific classes of models such as INAR, Skellam, and INGARCH. These models have found applications in various fields, including finance, sports analytics, and epidemiology. Future research could focus on developing more flexible and computationally efficient models, as well as exploring new application areas for integer-valued data.", "References": [{"title": "The frequency distribution of the difference between two Poisson variates belonging to different populations", "authors": "J.
