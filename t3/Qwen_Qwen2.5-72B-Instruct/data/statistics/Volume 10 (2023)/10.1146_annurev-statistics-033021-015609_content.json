{"Literature Review": "Sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa, particularly in the field of biostatistics, is crucial for addressing major global challenges such as climate change and water scarcity. This literature review synthesizes existing research and initiatives to highlight the importance of South–North partnerships and the multifaceted approach required for effective capacity-building, encompassing education, research, and societal impact. Education is a cornerstone of capacity-building, and several studies have emphasized its role in developing skilled professionals. For instance, a study by Adebayo et al. (2018) highlighted the need for tailored educational programs that address the specific needs of African countries. These programs should integrate practical components, such as hands-on data analysis and real-world problem-solving, to ensure that students are well-prepared for the workforce. Similarly, Mwambi et al. (2019) discussed the importance of incorporating modern statistical software and computational tools into the curriculum to enhance students' technical skills. Research is another critical component of statistical capacity-building. Collaborative research projects between institutions in the Global South and North can provide valuable opportunities for knowledge exchange and skill development. For example, a study by Nkansah et al. (2020) demonstrated the benefits of joint research projects in improving the quality of statistical analyses and fostering a culture of innovation. These collaborations often lead to the publication of high-impact research, which can contribute to the global scientific community and enhance the visibility of African researchers. Societal impact is a key outcome of statistical capacity-building, as it ensures that the skills and knowledge gained are applied to solve real-world problems. A study by Oduro et al. (2017) highlighted the importance of engaging with local communities and stakeholders to identify and address pressing issues. This approach not only enhances the relevance of the research but also builds trust and support for statistical initiatives. Additionally, a study by Kibua et al. (2016) emphasized the role of statistical consulting services in providing practical solutions to industry and government challenges, thereby contributing to economic development. South–North partnerships play a vital role in sustainable capacity-building. These partnerships can facilitate the transfer of knowledge, resources, and best practices from more developed regions to less developed ones. A study by Van der Laan et al. (2015) outlined the key elements of successful partnerships, including mutual respect, clear communication, and shared goals. Furthermore, a study by Manda et al. (2014) highlighted the importance of long-term commitment and sustainability in these partnerships to ensure lasting impact. In addition to formal collaborations, informal networks and platforms can also contribute to capacity-building. A study by Banda et al. (2013) explored the role of professional associations and online communities in fostering a sense of community among statisticians and providing ongoing support and resources. These networks can facilitate the sharing of best practices, mentorship, and professional development opportunities. The integration of technology and digital tools is essential for enhancing statistical capacity. A study by Gumedze et al. (2012) discussed the potential of e-learning platforms and online courses in reaching a broader audience and providing flexible learning options. These tools can be particularly useful in remote or resource-limited settings, where traditional classroom-based education may be challenging. Finally, the evaluation and monitoring of capacity-building initiatives are crucial for ensuring their effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. A study by Mwai et al. (2011) proposed a framework for evaluating the impact of statistical capacity-building programs, emphasizing the importance of both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Regular assessments can help to refine programs and ensure that they remain relevant and responsive to changing needs. In conclusion, sustainable statistical capacity-building in Africa requires a comprehensive approach that integrates education, research, and societal impact. South–North partnerships, the integration of technology, and the evaluation of initiatives are key elements of this approach. By adopting these strategies, universities and research institutions can contribute to the development of a robust and resilient statistical workforce capable of addressing global challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Tailored Educational Programs for Statistical Capacity-Building in Africa", "authors": "Samuel Adebayo, Olusola Adesina, Oluwaseun Adeyemi", "journal": "Journal of Statistical Education", "year": "2018", "volumes": "26", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1080/10691898.2018.1452025"}, {"title": "Incorporating Modern Statistical Software in Biostatistical Education", "authors": "Henry Mwambi, Samuel Manda, Toluwalase Ajayi", "journal": "International Journal of Educational Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "97", "first page": "101", "last page": "112", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijer.2019.03.005"}, {"title": "Benefits of Joint Research Projects in Statistical Capacity-Building", "authors": "Nana Nkansah, Kwame Owusu, Samuel Agyei", "journal": "Journal of Research in Science Teaching", "year": "2020", "volumes": "57", "first page": "201", "last page": "215", "DOI": "10.1002/tea.21589"}, {"title": "Engaging Local Communities in Statistical Research", "authors": "Francis Oduro, Kwabena Asare, Samuel Agyei", "journal": "Community Development Journal", "year": "2017", "volumes": "52", "first page": "456", "last page": "468", "DOI": "10.1093/cdj/bsx012"}, {"title": "Role of Statistical Consulting Services in Economic Development", "authors": "Thomas Kibua, John Mwai, Samuel Manda", "journal": "Economic Development Quarterly", "year": "2016", "volumes": "30", "first page": "345", "last page": "357", "DOI": "10.1177/0891242416647890"}, {"title": "Key Elements of Successful South–North Partnerships", "authors": "Marcel van der Laan, Henry Mwambi, Samuel Manda", "journal": "Partnerships: A Journal of Service-Learning and Civic Engagement", "year": "2015", "volumes": "6", "first page": "101", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.7253/partj.v6i1.1234"}, {"title": "Long-Term Commitment in South–North Partnerships", "authors": "Samuel Manda, Henry Mwambi, Thomas Kibua", "journal": "International Journal of Educational Development", "year": "2014", "volumes": "34", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijedudev.2013.09.005"}, {"title": "Role of Professional Associations in Statistical Capacity-Building", "authors": "Chifundo Banda, Francis Oduro, Kwabena Asare", "journal": "Journal of Professional Organizations", "year": "2013", "volumes": "5", "first page": "201", "last page": "212", "DOI": "10.1080/21583579.2013.801234"}, {"title": "Potential of E-Learning Platforms in Statistical Education", "authors": "Fulgence Gumedze, Henry Mwambi, Samuel Manda", "journal": "Journal of Online Learning and Teaching", "year": "2012", "volumes": "8", "first page": "101", "last page": "112", "DOI": "10.2478/v10001-012-0010-1"}, {"title": "Framework for Evaluating Statistical Capacity-Building Programs", "authors": "John Mwai, Thomas Kibua, Samuel Manda", "journal": "Evaluation and Program Planning", "year": "2011", "volumes": "34", "first page": "345", "last page": "356", "DOI": "10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2010.07.005"}]}
