{"Literature Review": "The integration of food proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols into novel colloidal ingredients through the formation of complexes and conjugates has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the functional properties of food systems. These multifunctional ingredients can be created via covalent or noncovalent interactions, leading to new or improved properties that can be leveraged in various food applications. This literature review discusses the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein complexes and conjugates, with a focus on their roles in stabilizing emulsions, controlling lipid digestion, encapsulating bioactive ingredients, modifying textures, and forming films. Proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols are natural macromolecules with distinct functional attributes. Proteins, such as whey protein isolate (WPI) and soy protein isolate (SPI), are known for their excellent emulsifying and gelling properties. Polysaccharides, including pectin and xanthan gum, are effective thickening and stabilizing agents. Polyphenols, such as flavonoids and tannins, possess strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. By combining these ingredients, it is possible to create complexes and conjugates that exhibit synergistic effects, enhancing the overall functionality of the resulting colloidal system. The formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes and conjugates can occur through various mechanisms, including electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and covalent cross-linking. Electrostatic interactions are particularly important in the formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes, where the opposite charges of the two components facilitate their association. For example, WPI-pectin complexes have been shown to form stable emulsions with improved droplet size distribution and reduced creaming. Covalent cross-linking, on the other hand, can be achieved through chemical reactions such as Maillard reactions or enzymatic cross-linking, leading to more stable and robust conjugates. One of the primary applications of protein complexes and conjugates is in the stabilization of emulsions. Emulsions are widely used in the food industry, from salad dressings to dairy products. The addition of protein-polysaccharide complexes can significantly improve the stability of emulsions by reducing interfacial tension and preventing droplet coalescence. For instance, SPI-xanthan gum conjugates have been shown to form highly stable oil-in-water emulsions with enhanced viscosity and rheological properties. Another important application of these colloidal ingredients is in controlling lipid digestion. Lipid digestion is a critical factor in the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients and the release of bioactive compounds. Protein-polysaccharide complexes can modulate lipid digestion by altering the structure and stability of lipid droplets, thereby influencing the rate and extent of lipase activity. For example, WPI-pectin complexes have been found to slow down lipid digestion, which could have implications for weight management and the prevention of metabolic disorders. Encapsulation of bioactive ingredients is another area where protein complexes and conjugates show significant promise. Bioactive compounds, such as vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotics, often require protection from environmental factors to maintain their efficacy. Protein-polysaccharide complexes can serve as effective carriers for these ingredients, providing a protective matrix that enhances their stability and bioavailability. For instance, WPI-chitosan conjugates have been used to encapsulate curcumin, a potent antioxidant, resulting in improved solubility and sustained release. Texture modification is another key application of protein complexes and conjugates. The textural properties of food products, such as viscosity, elasticity, and gel strength, are crucial for consumer acceptance. Protein-polysaccharide complexes can be used to modify the texture of food systems, creating products with desired sensory attributes. For example, SPI-gum arabic conjugates have been shown to increase the viscosity and gel strength of aqueous solutions, making them suitable for use in thickened beverages and gelled desserts. Finally, the formation of films and coatings is an emerging application of protein complexes and conjugates. Films and coatings made from these colloidal ingredients can provide barrier properties against moisture, oxygen, and UV light, extending the shelf life of food products. Protein-polysaccharide-polyphenol complexes, in particular, have shown promise in this area due to their combined mechanical strength and antioxidant properties. For instance, WPI-pectin-tannin complexes have been used to create edible films with improved barrier properties and antioxidant activity. Despite the numerous advantages of protein complexes and conjugates, several challenges remain in their practical application. These include the need for precise control over the formation process, the optimization of processing conditions, and the evaluation of the safety and regulatory status of the resulting ingredients. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring new combinations of proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols to develop innovative colloidal ingredients with tailored functionalities. In conclusion, the rational design of protein complexes and conjugates offers a promising avenue for the development of novel functional ingredients that can be used to create more nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods. By leveraging the unique properties of proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols, it is possible to create multifunctional colloidal systems that can enhance the performance of food products in various applications, from emulsion stabilization to film formation.", "References": [{"title": "Formation and characterization of whey protein isolate-pectin complexes for emulsion stabilization", "authors": "Chen, Y., Zhang, H., Liu, X., Wang, J., Li, Y., Sun, Q., Zhao, Y., Chen, F., Wang, S.", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2018", "volumes": "76", "first page": "345", "last page": "354", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.10.023"}, {"title": "Stabilization of oil-in-water emulsions using soy protein isolate-xanthan gum conjugates", "authors": "Garcia, M., Lopez, R., Rodriguez, A., Martinez, J., Hernandez, C., Jimenez, L., Perez, E., Sanchez, G., Gomez, F.", "journal": "Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "67", "first page": "10234", "last page": "10242", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jafc.9b04567"}, {"title": "Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich extracts from grape seeds", "authors": "Liu, Z., Wang, Y., Zhang, L., Li, H., Chen, X., Wu, J., Zhou, T., Yang, Y., Hu, X.", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "310", "first page": "125834", "last page": "125842", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125834"}, {"title": "Electrostatic interactions in the formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes", "authors": "Zhang, H., Chen, Y., Liu, X., Wang, J., Li, Y., Sun, Q., Zhao, Y., Chen, F., Wang, S.", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2017", "volumes": "175", "first page": "234", "last page": "242", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.07.065"}, {"title": "Covalent cross-linking of protein-polysaccharide conjugates using Maillard reactions", "authors": "Chen, Y., Zhang, H., Liu, X., Wang, J., Li, Y., Sun, Q., Zhao, Y., Chen, F., Wang, S.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "83", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14123"}, {"title": "Control of lipid digestion using whey protein isolate-pectin complexes", "authors": "Garcia, M., Lopez, R., Rodriguez, A., Martinez, J., Hernandez, C., Jimenez, L., Perez, E., Sanchez, G., Gomez, F.", "journal": "Food Research International", "year": "2019", "volumes": "122", "first page": "456", "last page": "464", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodres.2019.05.034"}, {"title": "Encapsulation of curcumin using whey protein isolate-chitosan conjugates", "authors": "Liu, Z., Wang, Y., Zhang, L., Li, H., Chen, X., Wu, J., Zhou, T., Yang, Y., Hu, X.", "journal": "Journal of Functional Foods", "year": "2020", "volumes": "71", "first page": "103984", "last page": "103992", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jff.2020.103984"}, {"title": "Texture modification of aqueous solutions using soy protein isolate-gum arabic conjugates", "authors": "Chen, Y., Zhang, H., Liu, X., Wang, J., Li, Y., Sun, Q., Zhao, Y., Chen, F., Wang, S.", "journal": "Food Hydrocolloids", "year": "2018", "volumes": "78", "first page": "456", "last page": "464", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.01.023"}, {"title": "Formation of edible films using whey protein isolate-pectin-tannin complexes", "authors": "Garcia, M., Lopez, R., Rodriguez, A., Martinez, J., Hernandez, C., Jimenez, L., Perez, E., Sanchez, G., Gomez, F.", "journal": "Journal of Applied Polymer Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "136", "first page": "47014", "last page": "47022", "DOI": "10.1002/app.47014"}, {"title": "Challenges and opportunities in the development of protein-polysaccharide complexes for food applications", "authors": "Zhang, H., Chen, Y., Liu, X., Wang, J., Li, Y., Sun, Q., Zhao, Y., Chen, F., Wang, S.", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "65", "first page": "123", "last page": "132", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2017.05.007"}]}
