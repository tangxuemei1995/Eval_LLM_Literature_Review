{"Literature Review": "Metabolic engineering has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the nutritional quality of edible plant oils. Traditional breeding methods have limitations, primarily due to their reliance on natural genetic variation and the time-consuming nature of identifying and selecting desirable traits. In contrast, metabolic engineering allows for precise modifications to the biosynthetic pathways of fatty acids and other bioactive compounds, enabling the production of oils with enhanced nutritional profiles. One of the primary goals of metabolic engineering in plant oils is to increase the content of monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic acid, which is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. High oleic oils, such as those from sunflower and soybean, have been developed through both traditional breeding and genetic engineering. Another important area of research is the production of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are essential for human health but are typically derived from marine sources. Plant sterols and stanols are another class of compounds that can be engineered to improve the nutritional value of plant oils. Carotenoids, including β-carotene and lycopene, are pigments with antioxidant properties that are essential for human health. Vitamin E, a group of fat-soluble antioxidants, is another target for metabolic engineering in plant oils. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, have revolutionized the field of metabolic engineering by providing precise and efficient tools for modifying plant genomes. Despite the significant progress made in engineering nutritionally improved edible plant oils, several challenges remain. In conclusion, metabolic engineering offers a promising approach for improving the nutritional quality of edible plant oils.", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic engineering of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants", "authors": "James B.
