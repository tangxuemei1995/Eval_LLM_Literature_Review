{"Literature Review": "Starch, a vital biopolymer composed primarily of amylose and amylopectin, plays a crucial role in both dietary and industrial contexts. However, native starches often lack the specific functionalities required for advanced applications, necessitating structural modifications. Enzymatic approaches have emerged as a promising method for tailoring starch properties due to their precision, environmental friendliness, and ability to produce clean-label products. Enzymatic modification of starch involves the use of glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases to alter the molecular structure of amylose and amylopectin. These enzymes can perform hydrolysis and transfer reactions, leading to the creation of novel starch derivatives with enhanced functionalities. GH70 α-transglycosylases are particularly noteworthy for their ability to transfer glucan chains between different substrates, thereby altering the degree of polymerization and branching patterns of starch molecules. This enzymatic action can lead to the production of starches with improved solubility, viscosity, and thermal stability, making them suitable for a wide range of applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The relationship between the molecular structure of starch and its functionality is complex and multifaceted. For example, the degree of branching in amylopectin influences the gelatinization temperature and the extent of retrogradation, which are critical factors in determining the texture and stability of starch-based products. Similarly, the length and distribution of amylose chains affect the solubility and viscosity of starch solutions, impacting their performance in various applications. Structure-functionality-driven processing strategies involve the strategic use of multiple enzymes to achieve specific modifications in starch. Novel conversion products derived from enzymatically modified starches have shown promise in various industrial applications. In conclusion, enzymatic approaches for structuring starch offer a versatile and sustainable method for improving the functionality of this important biopolymer. By leveraging the unique properties of glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases, it is possible to create starch derivatives with tailored attributes that meet the specific needs of various industrial applications. Further research into the optimization of enzymatic processes and the development of novel starch-active enzymes will continue to expand the potential of starch in the food and pharmaceutical industries.", "References": [{"title": "The molecular structure of starch: A critical review", "authors": "Erik Bertoft", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2014", "volumes": "101", "first page": "294", "last page": "310", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.09.044"}, {"title": "Structural and functional properties of starch: A review", "authors": "Jaspreet Kaur, Narpinder Singh", "journal": "Journal of Food Science and Technology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "53", "first page": "1141", "last page": "1153", "DOI": "10.1007/s13197-016-2162-4"}, {"title": "Amylomaltase: A versatile enzyme for the synthesis of cyclic and linear oligosaccharides", "authors": "Xiaoyun Huang, Xiaoming Liu, Yujie Zhang, Xuebing Xu", "journal": "Carbohydrate Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "461", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carres.2018.02.001"}, {"title": "Branching enzymes and the structure of amylopectin", "authors": "Vladimír Machovič, Jana Jane", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2006", "volumes": "64", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.10.014"}, {"title": "Amylosucrase: A versatile enzyme for the synthesis of α-1,4-glucans", "authors": "Mario A.
