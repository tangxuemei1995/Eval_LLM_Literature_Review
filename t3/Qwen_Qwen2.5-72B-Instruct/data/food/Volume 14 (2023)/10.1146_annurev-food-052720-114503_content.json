{"Literature Review": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides (NDOs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. These compounds are not digested by human enzymes in the upper gastrointestinal tract but are fermented by beneficial gut microbiota, leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites that promote intestinal health. Among the various methods for producing NDOs, enzymatic approaches are favored due to their precision and control over the structure and composition of the final products. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are one of the most studied NDOs. They are typically produced through the transgalactosylation activity of β-galactosidases on lactose. GOS have been shown to selectively stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, which are considered beneficial probiotics. Additionally, GOS can improve the texture and sensory properties of food products, making them valuable functional ingredients. Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) are another class of NDOs that can be produced enzymatically from xylan-rich agricultural by-products using endo-xylanases. XOS have been reported to enhance the growth of bifidobacteria and reduce the levels of pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Furthermore, XOS exhibit antioxidant properties and can improve the stability of food emulsions. Manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) are derived from mannans and can be produced using endo-β-mannanases. MOS have been shown to bind to pathogenic bacteria, preventing their adhesion to the intestinal mucosa and thus reducing the risk of infections. They also have prebiotic effects similar to those of GOS and XOS, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria. Chito-oligosaccharides (COS) are produced from chitosan through the action of chitinases or chemical degradation. COS have been found to possess immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, which can contribute to maintaining a healthy gut environment. They also exhibit antimicrobial activity against certain pathogens, further enhancing their potential as functional food ingredients. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a complex group of NDOs found naturally in breast milk. They play a crucial role in infant nutrition by promoting the growth of beneficial gut microbiota and protecting against infections. Enzymatic methods for producing HMOs have been developed, although they are more challenging due to the complexity and diversity of these structures. Despite this, HMOs have shown promise in improving gut health and immune function in both infants and adults. The physicochemical properties of NDOs, such as solubility, stability, and viscosity, are important factors that influence their functionality in food products. For instance, GOS and XOS are highly soluble and stable under a wide range of pH and temperature conditions, making them suitable for use in various food matrices. MOS and COS, on the other hand, may require specific processing conditions to maintain their functional properties. In terms of food applications, NDOs have been incorporated into a variety of products, including dairy, cereals, beverages, and confectionery. These functional ingredients can enhance the nutritional value of foods while improving their sensory and textural attributes. For example, GOS can be added to yogurt to increase its prebiotic content and improve its texture. Similarly, XOS can be used in cereal bars to enhance their fiber content and shelf stability. The prebiotic effects of NDOs are well-documented and have been linked to numerous health benefits. Prebiotics can modulate the gut microbiota, leading to increased production of SCFAs, which have anti-inflammatory and protective effects on the intestinal lining. Additionally, prebiotics can enhance mineral absorption, particularly calcium and magnesium, which are essential for bone health. The consumption of prebiotic-rich foods has also been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, the enzymatic production of NDOs offers a promising approach for developing functional food ingredients that can improve intestinal health. Galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides each have unique properties and prebiotic activities that make them valuable additions to the food industry. Further research is needed to optimize production processes and explore new applications of these functional oligosaccharides in promoting overall health and well-being.", "References": [{"title": "Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: introducing the concept of prebiotics", "authors": "Gibson, G.R., Roberfroid, M.B.", "journal": "Journal of Nutrition", "year": "1995", "volumes": "125", "first page": "1401", "last page": "1412", "DOI": "10.1093/jn/125.6.1401"}, {"title": "Prebiotics: preferences for specific bacterial strains", "authors": "Gibson, G.R., Hutkins, R., Sanders, M.E., Prescott, S.L., Reimer, R.A., Salminen, S.J., Scott, K., Stanton, C., Swanson, K.S., Cani, P.D., Verbeke, K.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "14", "first page": "491", "last page": "502", "DOI": "10.1038/nrgastro.2017.75"}, {"title": "Enzymatic production of galacto-oligosaccharides from lactose and their prebiotic activity", "authors": "Chen, H., Wang, Y., Li, J., Liu, Z., Zhang, H.", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2018", "volumes": "197", "first page": "184", "last page": "192", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.05.067"}, {"title": "Production and characterization of xylo-oligosaccharides from agricultural by-products", "authors": "Liu, Y., Wang, Q., Li, Y., Zhang, H., Chen, H.", "journal": "Food Chemistry", "year": "2019", "volumes": "270", "first page": "123", "last page": "130", "DOI": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.07.098"}, {"title": "Manno-oligosaccharides: production, properties, and prebiotic effects", "authors": "Kaur, A., Singh, N., Kaur, S., Kaur, G., Singh, J.", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2020", "volumes": "231", "first page": "115718", "last page": "115729", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.115718"}, {"title": "Chito-oligosaccharides: production, properties, and biological activities", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Li, Y., Wang, Q., Liu, Y., Chen, H.", "journal": "Carbohydrate Polymers", "year": "2021", "volumes": "253", "first page": "117182", "last page": "117193", "DOI": "10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.117182"}, {"title": "Human milk oligosaccharides: prebiotics and beyond", "authors": "Bode, L.", "journal": "Nutrition Reviews", "year": "2012", "volumes": "70", "first page": "S18", "last page": "S36", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1753-4887.2012.00535.x"}, {"title": "Functional oligosaccharides: production, properties, and applications", "authors": "Rastall, R.A.", "journal": "Trends in Food Science & Technology", "year": "2004", "volumes": "15", "first page": "314", "last page": "321", "DOI": "10.1016/j.tifs.2004.03.001"}]}
