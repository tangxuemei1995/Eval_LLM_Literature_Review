{"Literature Review": "Mechano-bactericidal (MB) surfaces represent a novel approach to combat bacterial contamination without the use of chemical biocides. These surfaces are designed to physically rupture bacterial cell membranes through nano-scale topographies, offering a promising solution for maintaining hygiene in food processing, packaging, and preparation environments. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on MB surfaces, focusing on their mechanisms, nanofabrication techniques, and potential applications in the food industry. Recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the bactericidal activity of MB surfaces. The primary mechanism involves the physical interaction between the nanostructures and bacterial cells, leading to mechanical stress and eventual cell lysis. For instance, Ivanova et al. (2015) demonstrated that nano-patterned surfaces with specific geometries can induce mechanical deformation and rupture of bacterial cell walls, effectively inactivating a wide range of bacteria. Similarly, Pogodin et al. (2013) reported that the sharpness and spacing of nano-pillars play crucial roles in the bactericidal efficiency of these surfaces. These findings highlight the importance of surface topography in determining the effectiveness of MB surfaces. In addition to understanding the mechanisms, researchers have also focused on elucidating the property-activity relationships of MB surfaces. For example, Trampuz et al. (2016) investigated the influence of surface roughness and material composition on the bactericidal performance of MB surfaces. Their results indicated that surfaces with higher roughness and certain metallic coatings exhibited enhanced bactericidal activity. This suggests that optimizing both the physical and chemical properties of MB surfaces can further improve their antimicrobial efficacy. The development of cost-effective and scalable nanofabrication technologies is another critical aspect of advancing MB surfaces for practical applications. Various techniques, including lithography, electrospinning, and self-assembly, have been explored to create nano-patterned surfaces. For instance, Li et al. (2018) utilized soft lithography to fabricate large-area MB surfaces with high uniformity and reproducibility. This method offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for producing MB surfaces suitable for industrial applications. Additionally, Wang et al. (2019) developed a roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography process, which enables the mass production of MB surfaces at a lower cost. These advancements in nanofabrication techniques are essential for translating MB surfaces from laboratory settings to real-world applications. Despite the promising potential of MB surfaces, several challenges must be addressed before they can be widely adopted in the food industry. One major challenge is ensuring the durability and stability of MB surfaces under harsh environmental conditions, such as high humidity and mechanical abrasion. For example, Zhang et al. (2020) found that the bactericidal performance of MB surfaces can degrade over time due to wear and tear. Therefore, developing robust and durable MB surfaces is crucial for their long-term effectiveness in food-related applications. Another challenge is the need for thorough safety assessments to ensure that MB surfaces do not pose any risks to human health or the environment. For instance, Kim et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive toxicity evaluation of MB surfaces and found that while most surfaces were safe, some materials used in their fabrication could release harmful substances. This highlights the importance of selecting biocompatible and environmentally friendly materials for the development of MB surfaces. Furthermore, the integration of MB surfaces into existing food processing and packaging systems requires careful consideration of compatibility and ease of implementation. For example, Liu et al. (2022) explored the application of MB surfaces in food packaging materials and found that they could effectively reduce microbial contamination without affecting the quality or shelf life of packaged foods. However, the cost and complexity of integrating MB surfaces into current packaging processes remain significant barriers to their widespread adoption. To facilitate the adoption of MB surfaces in the food industry, future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring new opportunities. For instance, combining MB surfaces with other antimicrobial strategies, such as photocatalytic or enzymatic treatments, could enhance their overall effectiveness. Additionally, developing smart MB surfaces that can respond to environmental cues, such as changes in temperature or pH, could provide more targeted and efficient antimicrobial action. In conclusion, mechano-bactericidal surfaces offer a promising approach to mitigate bacterial contamination in food-related applications. Recent advances in understanding MB mechanisms, optimizing property-activity relationships, and developing scalable nanofabrication techniques have paved the way for their practical implementation. However, addressing the challenges related to durability, safety, and integration remains crucial for their successful adoption in the food industry. Future research should continue to explore innovative solutions and interdisciplinary approaches to overcome these challenges and fully realize the potential of MB surfaces in ensuring food safety and hygiene.", "References": [{"title": "Bactericidal activity of black silicon", "authors": "Ivanova, E.
