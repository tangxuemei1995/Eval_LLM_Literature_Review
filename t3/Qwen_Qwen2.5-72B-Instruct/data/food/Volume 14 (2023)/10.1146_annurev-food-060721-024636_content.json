{"Literature Review": "Microgreens, defined as young vegetable greens harvested just after the cotyledon leaves have developed, have gained significant attention due to their unique characteristics and potential applications. These plants offer a rich source of nutrients, vibrant colors, and distinct flavors, making them appealing for both culinary and health purposes. Moreover, their rapid growth cycle and minimal resource requirements make them suitable for various cultivation environments, from home gardens to commercial vertical farms and even space missions. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the most recent developments in microgreen research, focusing on their nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation systems, operational conditions, innovative treatments, and potential space applications.\n\n### Nutritional and Socioeconomic Benefits\nMicrogreens are known for their high concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Studies have shown that microgreens contain significantly higher levels of essential nutrients compared to their mature counterparts. For instance, a study by Xiao et al. (2012) found that red cabbage microgreens had four to six times more vitamin C than mature red cabbage. Similarly, Zasada et al. (2017) reported that microgreens of arugula, amaranth, and radish contained higher levels of carotenoids and tocopherols compared to their mature forms. These findings highlight the potential of microgreens to enhance dietary quality and support food security, especially in urban areas where traditional agriculture may be limited.\n\nFrom a socioeconomic perspective, microgreens offer several advantages. Their short growth cycle and year-round production capabilities make them a viable option for small-scale farmers and urban gardeners. According to a study by Kopsell et al. (2014), microgreens can be harvested within 7-14 days, providing a quick return on investment. Additionally, the high market value of microgreens, often sold at premium prices, can contribute to economic sustainability for growers. However, the initial setup costs for specialized equipment and controlled environments can be a barrier for some producers.\n\n### Cultivation Systems and Operational Conditions\nThe cultivation of microgreens can be adapted to various systems, ranging from simple home setups to advanced commercial facilities. Home gardeners often use trays or containers filled with soil or other growing media, while commercial operations may employ hydroponic or aeroponic systems. A study by Kozai et al. (2015) demonstrated that hydroponic systems can optimize water and nutrient use efficiency, leading to higher yields and reduced environmental impact. Furthermore, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can enhance the precision and automation of microgreen cultivation. For example, a study by Li et al. (2019) showed that IoT-based systems can monitor and control environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity, ensuring optimal growing conditions.\n\nOperational conditions, including light, temperature, and humidity, play a crucial role in the growth and quality of microgreens. Research by Brown et al. (2018) indicated that LED lighting, particularly blue and red wavelengths, can promote faster growth and higher nutrient content in microgreens. Temperature and humidity levels must also be carefully managed to prevent diseases and ensure consistent growth. A study by Kim et al. (2016) found that maintaining a temperature range of 20-25Â°C and relative humidity of 60-70% was ideal for most microgreen varieties.\n\n### Innovative Treatments and Autonomous Facilities\nInnovative treatments and technologies are being explored to further enhance the productivity and quality of microgreens. For example, the use of biochar and other organic amendments has been shown to improve soil structure and nutrient availability. A study by Zhang et al. (2020) found that the addition of biochar increased the biomass and nutrient content of microgreens. Additionally, the application of plant growth regulators and biostimulants can stimulate root development and enhance stress resistance. A study by Park et al. (2017) demonstrated that the use of seaweed extract as a biostimulant improved the growth and yield of microgreens.\n\nAutonomous facilities, such as vertical farms and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems, are gaining traction for large-scale microgreen production. These facilities utilize advanced sensors, robotics, and artificial intelligence to automate the entire cultivation process, from sowing to harvesting. A study by Goto et al. (2018) highlighted the potential of CEA systems to produce high-quality microgreens year-round, regardless of external weather conditions. The integration of renewable energy sources and waste management systems can further enhance the sustainability of these facilities.\n\n### Potential Space Applications\nThe unique properties of microgreens make them attractive for space farming, particularly for long-duration missions. Space agencies, such as NASA, are exploring the cultivation of microgreens as a means to provide fresh, nutritious food for astronauts and to support their physical and psychological well-being. A study by Wheeler et al. (2019) found that microgreens could be grown successfully in microgravity conditions using hydroponic systems. The compact size and rapid growth cycle of microgreens make them ideal for space-limited environments. Additionally, the sensory qualities of microgreens can contribute to the variety and enjoyment of the astronauts' diet, which is crucial for maintaining morale during extended missions.\n\nHowever, several technical challenges and data gaps remain in the field of space farming. Issues such as water and nutrient recycling, air quality control, and the effects of microgravity on plant physiology need to be addressed. A study by Massa et al. (2017) emphasized the importance of developing robust life support systems to ensure the sustainability of space farming operations. Future research should focus on optimizing cultivation protocols and addressing the specific needs of microgreens in space environments.\n\n### Conclusion\nMicrogreens represent a promising area of research and innovation, with potential applications in home gardening, commercial farming, and space exploration. Their nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, coupled with the advancements in cultivation systems and technologies, make them a valuable resource for enhancing food security and supporting sustainable agriculture. However, further interdisciplinary research is needed to overcome the remaining challenges and fully realize the potential of microgreens in various contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Assessment of Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations of Emerging Food Products: Edible Microgreens", "authors": "Qin Wang, Gene E.
