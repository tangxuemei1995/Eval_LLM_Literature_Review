{"Literature Review": "Ferritins are ubiquitous iron storage proteins found in both animals and plants, playing critical roles in iron homeostasis and detoxification. These proteins exist in two primary forms: holo ferritin, which is fully loaded with iron, and apo ferritin, which lacks iron. The dual functionality of ferritins—holo ferritin for iron supplementation and apo ferritin for delivery systems—has been extensively explored across various fields, including food science, nutrition, medicine, and materials science. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the structure of animal and plant ferritins, their iron supplementation capabilities, and their potential as delivery vehicles, while also highlighting recent advancements and future directions.\n\n### Structure of Animal and Plant Ferritins\nFerritins are composed of 24 subunits arranged in a hollow sphere, with a central cavity capable of storing up to 4,500 iron atoms (Theil, 2008). The structure of ferritins from different sources, such as mammals, bacteria, and plants, shows remarkable conservation, although some variations exist. For instance, mammalian ferritins typically consist of heavy (H) and light (L) chains, which play distinct roles in iron storage and release (Arosio et al., 2017). In contrast, plant ferritins are generally homopolymers of a single type of subunit, which can vary in sequence and function among different plant species (Harrison & Arosio, 1996).\n\n### Iron Supplementation Function of Holo Ferritin\nHolo ferritin's ability to deliver iron safely and efficiently makes it a valuable supplement in various contexts. Studies have shown that holo ferritin can effectively increase iron levels in the body without causing oxidative stress or toxicity, which are common issues with traditional iron supplements (Beaumont et al., 2012). For example, a clinical trial demonstrated that oral administration of holo ferritin significantly improved iron status in individuals with iron deficiency anemia, with fewer side effects compared to ferrous sulfate (Iwasaki et al., 2013). Additionally, holo ferritin has been used in food fortification to enhance iron content, particularly in cereals and other staple foods (Garcia et al., 2015).\n\n### Delivery Function of Apo Ferritin\nApo ferritin's unique structure and biocompatibility make it an attractive candidate for drug and nutrient delivery. The hollow core of apo ferritin can be loaded with various molecules, including drugs, enzymes, and nucleic acids, and then released in a controlled manner (Chen et al., 2014). For instance, apo ferritin has been used to encapsulate and deliver anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, to tumor cells, demonstrating enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity (Zhang et al., 2016). Similarly, apo ferritin has been employed to deliver nutrients and bioactive compounds, such as vitamins and antioxidants, to specific tissues or cells (Kim et al., 2017). The ability to functionalize the surface of apo ferritin with targeting ligands further enhances its delivery specificity and efficiency (Wang et al., 2018).\n\n### Recent Advances and Future Directions\nRecent advancements in the field of ferritin research have focused on optimizing the properties of both holo and apo ferritins for specific applications. For iron supplementation, efforts have been made to improve the bioavailability and stability of holo ferritin, such as through encapsulation in nanoparticles or conjugation with other biomolecules (Li et al., 2019). In the context of delivery systems, researchers have explored the use of engineered ferritins with enhanced loading capacity and controlled release mechanisms (Sun et al., 2020). Furthermore, the development of hybrid ferritin-based materials, combining the advantages of ferritins with other nanomaterials, has opened new avenues for multifunctional applications in diagnostics and therapeutics (Liu et al., 2021).\n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain. One major challenge is the scalability of ferritin production, particularly for large-scale applications. While recombinant expression systems have been developed to produce ferritins in bacteria and yeast, optimizing yield and purity remains a significant hurdle (Krebs et al., 2018). Another challenge is the need for more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ferritin's iron storage and release processes, which could inform the design of more effective iron supplements and delivery systems. Additionally, the potential immunogenicity of ferritins, especially when used in therapeutic settings, requires careful consideration and further investigation (Müller et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the dual functions of ferritins—holo ferritin for iron supplementation and apo ferritin for delivery—offer promising opportunities for a wide range of applications. Continued research and innovation in this field are expected to lead to the development of more effective and versatile ferritin-based products, contributing to improvements in human health and well-being.", "References": [{"title": "Structure, function, and evolution of ferritins", "authors": "Pietro Arosio, Paola Invernizzi, Elena Arosio", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "292", "first page": "1595", "last page": "1603", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.R116.757225"}, {"title": "Ferritin: structure, function and cellular regulation", "authors": "Eugene P.
