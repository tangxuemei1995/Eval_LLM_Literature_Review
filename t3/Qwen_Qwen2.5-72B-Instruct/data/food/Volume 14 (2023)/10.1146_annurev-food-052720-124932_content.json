{"Literature Review": "Meat is a significant source of protein in the human diet, providing essential amino acids and other nutrients. However, the processing of meat can lead to various molecular changes that affect its quality and nutritional value. This literature review examines the molecular changes in meat proteins during processing, their impact on nutritional value, and the associated health risks, along with preventive strategies to mitigate these issues. The primary molecular changes in meat proteins during processing include denaturation, aggregation, and cross-linking. Denaturation involves the disruption of the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins, leading to a loss of functionality and solubility. Aggregation occurs when denatured proteins come together to form larger complexes, which can negatively impact texture and water-holding capacity. Cross-linking, often mediated by Maillard reactions or enzymatic processes, can result in the formation of insoluble protein networks, further affecting the texture and cooking yield of meat products. These molecular changes have significant implications for the nutritional value of meat. Denaturation and aggregation can reduce the digestibility of proteins, making it more difficult for the body to break down and absorb essential amino acids. Additionally, cross-linking can lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation. AGEs have been linked to various chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, highlighting the importance of understanding and mitigating these changes. The impact of processing on the bioavailability of meat proteins is another critical aspect. Bioavailability refers to the proportion of ingested nutrients that are absorbed and utilized by the body. High-temperature processing methods, such as grilling and frying, can lead to the formation of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known carcinogens. These compounds can reduce the bioavailability of essential nutrients and increase the risk of cancer. To mitigate the negative effects of processing on meat quality and nutritional value, several strategies have been proposed. One approach is the use of antioxidants, such as vitamin C and E, which can help prevent oxidative changes and preserve the integrity of meat proteins. Another strategy involves the application of low-temperature cooking techniques, which can minimize the formation of HCAs and PAHs while maintaining the nutritional value of the meat. Furthermore, the use of natural preservatives, such as plant extracts and essential oils, has gained attention due to their ability to inhibit microbial growth and oxidative changes without compromising the sensory attributes of meat products. These natural preservatives can also enhance the overall quality and shelf life of meat, making them a promising alternative to synthetic additives. In addition to processing methods, the type of meat and its initial quality can also influence the molecular changes and nutritional outcomes. For example, lean meats, such as chicken and turkey, tend to undergo less extensive denaturation and aggregation compared to fatty meats, such as beef and pork. This difference is attributed to the higher fat content in fatty meats, which can accelerate oxidative processes and lead to more pronounced changes in protein structure. The risks associated with high meat intake, particularly red and processed meats, have been well-documented in the literature. Studies have consistently shown that high consumption of red and processed meats is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These risks are partly attributed to the formation of HCAs and PAHs during high-temperature cooking, as well as the presence of heme iron and nitrites in processed meats. To address these health concerns, dietary guidelines recommend reducing the intake of red and processed meats and increasing the consumption of lean meats and plant-based proteins. Additionally, incorporating a variety of cooking methods, such as steaming and boiling, can help minimize the formation of harmful compounds and preserve the nutritional value of meat. In conclusion, the molecular changes in meat proteins during processing significantly impact the quality and nutritional value of meat products. Understanding these changes and implementing preventive strategies can help mitigate the associated health risks and improve the overall nutritional profile of meat. Future research should focus on developing innovative processing techniques and natural preservatives to enhance the quality and safety of meat products while ensuring their nutritional value.", "References": [{"title": "Dynamics of muscle food protein systems", "authors": "E.
