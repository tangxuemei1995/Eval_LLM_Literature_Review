{"Literature Review": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for noninvasively monitoring cellular and tissue metabolism. This technique leverages the intrinsic autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors, primarily NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), which are key indicators of cellular metabolic activity. Over the past few decades, advancements in nonlinear optical microscopy have significantly enhanced the ability to quantify and analyze these cofactors, providing valuable insights into various biological processes and disease states. The autofluorescence of NADH and FAD has been extensively studied in a wide range of cell types and tissues. NADH, which is involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, exhibits strong fluorescence when excited at specific wavelengths, making it a sensitive marker of cellular energy metabolism. FAD, on the other hand, is primarily associated with the electron transport chain and also emits fluorescence upon excitation. The ratio of NADH to FAD fluorescence intensities, known as the optical redox ratio, has been widely used to assess the metabolic state of cells and tissues. This ratio provides a quantitative measure of the balance between glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways, which can be indicative of various physiological and pathological conditions. One of the key advantages of label-free optical metabolic imaging is its non-invasive nature. Unlike traditional biochemical assays that require sample preparation and labeling, this technique allows for real-time, in situ monitoring of metabolic changes. This is particularly useful in studying dynamic processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to environmental stimuli. For instance, studies have shown that the optical redox ratio can be used to differentiate between normal and cancerous tissues, as cancer cells often exhibit altered metabolic profiles characterized by increased glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. In addition to intensity-based measurements, the fluorescence lifetime of NADH has been explored as a more sensitive and quantitative parameter for metabolic imaging. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) provides information about the microenvironment of the fluorophore, including pH, viscosity, and molecular interactions, which can influence the metabolic state of the cell. FLIM has been used to study the dynamics of NADH in living cells and tissues, revealing subtle changes in metabolic activity that may not be detectable through intensity-based methods alone. Despite its potential, label-free optical metabolic imaging faces several challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize its clinical and research applications. One major challenge is the complexity of the metabolic pathways involved. NADH and FAD are involved in multiple enzymatic reactions, and their fluorescence properties can be influenced by various factors, including protein binding, redox state, and environmental conditions. Therefore, interpreting the fluorescence signals in terms of specific metabolic pathways requires a deep understanding of the underlying biochemistry and physiology. Another challenge is the need for standardized protocols and data analysis methods. The variability in experimental conditions, such as excitation wavelengths, detection settings, and data processing algorithms, can lead to inconsistencies in the results obtained from different studies. To address this issue, efforts are being made to develop standardized protocols and guidelines for NADH and FAD imaging, ensuring reproducibility and comparability across different laboratories. Recent advances in multiphoton microscopy and computational methods have also contributed to the development of more sophisticated and quantitative approaches to metabolic imaging. Multiphoton microscopy, which uses near-infrared light to excite fluorophores, offers deeper tissue penetration and reduced phototoxicity compared to conventional fluorescence microscopy. This makes it particularly suitable for in vivo imaging of tissues and organs. Computational methods, such as machine learning and image processing algorithms, have been applied to extract meaningful information from complex metabolic images, improving the accuracy and reliability of the results. Furthermore, the integration of optical metabolic imaging with other imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET), has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular metabolism. MRS and PET can provide complementary information about the concentrations of metabolic intermediates and the distribution of metabolic activity within tissues, respectively. Combining these techniques with optical metabolic imaging can offer a more holistic view of metabolic processes and their regulation. In conclusion, label-free optical metabolic imaging using NADH and FAD autofluorescence has shown great promise in noninvasively monitoring cellular and tissue metabolism. The optical redox ratio and fluorescence lifetime parameters have been widely used to assess metabolic changes in various biological systems. However, further research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with this technique, including the complexity of metabolic pathways, the need for standardized protocols, and the integration of multiple imaging modalities. As these challenges are addressed, label-free optical metabolic imaging is expected to play an increasingly important role in both basic research and clinical applications.", "References": [{"title": "Non-invasive metabolic imaging of live cells using NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence", "authors": "Korolainen, M.
