{"Literature Review": "Epitranscriptional regulation, which encompasses various post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, has emerged as a critical layer of gene regulation with profound implications for cellular function and disease. In the context of cardiovascular bioengineering, understanding these modifications is essential for unraveling the molecular mechanisms that govern heart development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration. This review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in epitranscriptional regulation, focusing on its relevance to cardiovascular biology and potential applications in biomedical engineering.\n\n### Overview of Epitranscriptional Modifications\nRNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, include a diverse array of chemical alterations such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridylation (Ψ), and inosine (I) formation. These modifications can influence RNA stability, splicing, localization, and translation efficiency. For instance, m6A, the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA, is involved in mRNA decay and translation (Roundtree et al., 2017). Pseudouridylation, another common modification, can alter the structure and function of RNA molecules, affecting their interactions with proteins and other RNAs (Motorin and Helm, 2011).\n\n### Epitranscriptional Regulation in Cardiovascular Biology\nRecent studies have highlighted the importance of epitranscriptional modifications in cardiovascular development and disease. For example, m6A modifications have been shown to regulate the differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) during embryonic development. Wang et al. (2018) demonstrated that the m6A writer METTL3 is essential for CPC differentiation by promoting the expression of key cardiac transcription factors. Similarly, m6A modifications have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Li et al. (2019) found that m6A levels are elevated in atherosclerotic plaques, and that the m6A reader YTHDF2 promotes the degradation of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs, thereby modulating the inflammatory response in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).\n\n### Mechanosensing and Epitranscriptional Regulation\nMechanical forces play a crucial role in cardiovascular function, and recent evidence suggests that epitranscriptional modifications may mediate mechanotransduction. For instance, mechanical stretch can induce changes in m6A levels in VSMCs, which in turn affect the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration (Zhang et al., 2020). This finding underscores the dynamic nature of the epitranscriptome and its responsiveness to environmental cues.\n\n### Tools for Epitranscriptome Analysis\nAdvances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized the study of the epitranscriptome. Methods such as MeRIP-seq (m6A-seq) and Ψ-seq allow for the genome-wide mapping of specific RNA modifications, providing insights into their distribution and functional impact (Dominissini et al., 2012; Schaefer et al., 2014). Additionally, CRISPR-based approaches have been developed to manipulate RNA modifications in a site-specific manner, enabling functional studies of individual modifications (Liu et al., 2019).\n\n### Potential Applications in Biomedical Engineering\nThe growing understanding of epitranscriptional regulation opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular diseases. For example, small molecules that target RNA-modifying enzymes could be used to modulate gene expression in diseased tissues. Furthermore, the ability to precisely edit RNA modifications using CRISPR-Cas systems holds promise for developing personalized therapies. In tissue engineering, manipulating the epitranscriptome could enhance the differentiation and function of engineered cardiac tissues, improving their therapeutic potential (Chen et al., 2020).\n\n### Conclusion\nEpitranscriptional regulation represents a frontier in cardiovascular bioengineering, offering novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern heart function and disease. By integrating knowledge from epitranscriptomics with advanced biotechnological tools, researchers can develop innovative strategies to prevent and treat cardiovascular disorders. Future studies should focus on elucidating the specific roles of different RNA modifications in cardiovascular biology and translating these findings into clinical applications.", "References": [{"title": "The dynamic epitranscriptome: N6-methyladenosine and gene expression control", "authors": "Ian A.
