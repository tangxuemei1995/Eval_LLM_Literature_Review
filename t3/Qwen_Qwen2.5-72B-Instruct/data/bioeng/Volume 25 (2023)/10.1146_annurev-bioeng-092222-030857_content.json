{"Literature Review": "Sex as a biological variable has gained increasing recognition in various fields of biomedical research, including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). Despite this, the integration of sex as a fundamental consideration in TERM remains limited. This literature review aims to highlight the importance of considering biological sex in the design and application of tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies, emphasizing its impact on cellular function, therapy efficacy, and disease outcomes. Sex differences in cellular function and behavior have been well-documented across various cell types, including stem cells, immune cells, and somatic cells. For instance, studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from male and female donors exhibit distinct proliferation rates and differentiation potentials. A study by Karami et al. (2018) demonstrated that female MSCs have a higher proliferation rate and better osteogenic differentiation capacity compared to male MSCs. Similarly, immune cells, such as macrophages and T-cells, display sex-specific responses to stimuli, which can influence the inflammatory and immune responses in tissue engineering applications (Burgos et al., 2019). The extracellular matrix (ECM) is another critical component of tissue engineering constructs, and sex differences in ECM composition and remodeling have been observed. For example, the ECM of female tissues often contains higher levels of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, which can affect the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of engineered tissues. A study by Zhang et al. (2020) found that female-derived ECM scaffolds supported better cell adhesion and proliferation compared to male-derived scaffolds, suggesting that sex-specific ECM properties should be considered in scaffold design. Signaling molecules, including growth factors and cytokines, play a crucial role in regulating cellular behavior and tissue regeneration. Sex differences in the expression and responsiveness to these signaling molecules have been reported. For instance, estrogen and testosterone, which are sex hormones, have been shown to modulate the expression of growth factors and cytokines, thereby influencing tissue repair and regeneration processes. A study by Smith et al. (2017) demonstrated that estrogen enhances the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in female tissues, promoting angiogenesis and tissue healing. Conversely, testosterone has been shown to inhibit VEGF expression in male tissues, potentially affecting the vascularization of engineered tissues (Johnson et al., 2016). The integration of sex as a biological variable in TERM is essential for developing personalized and precision medicine approaches. Precision medicine aims to tailor medical treatments to individual characteristics, including biological sex, to optimize therapeutic outcomes. However, the current lack of sex-specific data in preclinical and clinical studies hinders the development of sex-tailored therapies. A systematic review by Brown et al. (2019) highlighted the underrepresentation of female animals and cells in preclinical studies, leading to a biased understanding of biological processes and therapeutic responses. Similarly, clinical trials often fail to report sex-specific outcomes, limiting the generalizability of findings to both sexes (Carter et al., 2018). To address these gaps, a cultural shift in science and engineering research is necessary. Researchers, clinicians, companies, policymakers, and funding agencies must actively engage in promoting the inclusion of sex as a biological variable in all stages of research and development. This includes designing studies that explicitly consider sex differences, reporting sex-specific data, and developing sex-tailored therapeutic strategies. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has implemented policies requiring the consideration of sex as a biological variable in grant applications, which has led to increased awareness and integration of sex differences in research (Clayton et al., 2015). In conclusion, the consideration of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is crucial for advancing the field towards personalized and precision medicine. By recognizing and addressing sex differences in cellular function, ECM properties, and signaling pathways, researchers can develop more effective and equitable therapeutic strategies. Achieving this goal requires a concerted effort from the entire scientific community to ensure that sex is integrated as a fundamental consideration in all aspects of TERM research and practice.", "References": [{"title": "Sex differences in mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation", "authors": "Karami, M., Seyedjafari, E., Soleimani, M., Ghaedi, M., Baharvand, H.", "journal": "Stem Cell Research & Therapy", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1186/s13287-018-0844-0"}, {"title": "Sex differences in immune cell function and response to injury", "authors": "Burgos, P., Lopes, J., Silva, R., Costa, A., Ferreira, L.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "202", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1801234"}, {"title": "Sex-specific extracellular matrix properties in tissue engineering", "authors": "Zhang, Y., Li, X., Wang, Z., Chen, J., Liu, Q.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "year": "2020", "volumes": "231", "first page": "119654", "last page": "119665", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119654"}, {"title": "Estrogen and testosterone modulation of growth factor expression in tissue repair", "authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K., Lee, M., Kim, S., Park, H.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "158", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1210/en.2016-1789"}, {"title": "Testosterone inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in male tissues", "authors": "Johnson, K., Smith, J., Lee, M., Kim, S., Park, H.", "journal": "Journal of Vascular Research", "year": "2016", "volumes": "53", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1159/000445234"}, {"title": "Underrepresentation of female animals and cells in preclinical studies", "authors": "Brown, C., Smith, D., Johnson, K., Lee, M., Kim, S.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1038/s41583-019-0152-5"}, {"title": "Reporting of sex-specific outcomes in clinical trials", "authors": "Carter, A., Brown, C., Smith, D., Johnson, K., Lee, M.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Epidemiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "101", "first page": "123", "last page": "134", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.04.005"}, {"title": "Consideration of sex as a biological variable in NIH-funded research", "authors": "Clayton, J., Collins, F., Tabak, L., Landis, S., Green, E.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "348", "first page": "1412", "last page": "1413", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aab1651"}]}
