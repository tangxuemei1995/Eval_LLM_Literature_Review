{"Literature Review": "Electroporation, a technique that uses electric fields to create temporary pores in cell membranes, has seen significant advancements over the past decade, expanding its applications from basic research to clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in electroporation technologies, focusing on their biophysical principles, single-cell applications, and in vivo therapeutic uses. The biophysical basis of electroporation involves the application of an electric field to cells, causing a transient increase in membrane permeability. This phenomenon is well-documented and has been extensively studied using both theoretical models and experimental approaches. Neumann et al. (1982) were among the first to describe the mechanism of electroporation, demonstrating that the electric field induces a reorganization of lipid molecules in the cell membrane, leading to the formation of pores. Subsequent studies have refined our understanding of the process, showing that the size and duration of the pores depend on the intensity and duration of the electric field (Tsong, 1991). In the realm of single-cell electroporation, microfluidic devices have emerged as powerful tools for precise control over the electroporation process. These devices allow for the manipulation of individual cells, enabling high-throughput and highly controlled experiments. For instance, Li et al. (2015) developed a microfluidic platform that can perform single-cell electroporation with high efficiency and minimal cell damage. This technology has been particularly useful in gene editing and drug delivery studies, where the ability to target specific cells is crucial. At the nanoscale, the development of nanopore electroporation has opened new avenues for intracellular delivery. Nanopores, which are small channels created in solid-state or biological membranes, can be used to deliver molecules directly into cells with high precision. Zhao et al. (2017) demonstrated the use of nanopore electroporation for the delivery of plasmid DNA into mammalian cells, achieving high transfection rates and low cytotoxicity. This approach has the potential to revolutionize gene therapy by providing a non-viral method for gene delivery. Moving to in vivo applications, electroporation has shown promise in various therapeutic contexts, including electrochemotherapy and gene therapy. Electrochemotherapy combines the use of electric pulses with chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance drug uptake and efficacy. Mir et al. (2006) reported that electrochemotherapy significantly improved the treatment of solid tumors in animal models, leading to enhanced drug penetration and reduced tumor size. This technique has since been translated to clinical trials, with promising results in treating cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors (Sersa et al., 2008). Gene therapy, another area where electroporation has made significant strides, involves the delivery of genetic material to target cells to correct or modify genetic disorders. In vivo electroporation has been used to deliver genes encoding therapeutic proteins or RNA interference (RNAi) molecules. For example, Heller et al. (2005) demonstrated the successful delivery of plasmid DNA encoding a therapeutic protein to muscle tissue in mice, resulting in sustained expression of the protein and therapeutic benefits. This approach has the potential to treat a wide range of genetic diseases, including muscular dystrophy and hemophilia. Pulsed field ablation (PFA) is another emerging application of electroporation in the clinic. PFA uses high-intensity electric fields to irreversibly disrupt cell membranes, leading to cell death. This technique has been explored for the ablation of cancerous tissues and has shown promise in preclinical studies. Rubinsky et al. (2007) reported that PFA effectively ablated liver tumors in animal models, with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PFA in human patients. In addition to these therapeutic applications, electroporation has also been used in food sanitation to inactivate microorganisms and extend the shelf life of food products. Zhang et al. (2014) demonstrated that electroporation can effectively reduce bacterial contamination in fruits and vegetables, making it a viable alternative to chemical preservatives. This application highlights the versatility of electroporation technology and its potential to impact multiple industries. Despite the numerous advancements in electroporation technologies, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is the optimization of electric field parameters to achieve the desired level of cell permeabilization without causing excessive cell damage. Additionally, the scalability of electroporation techniques for large-scale applications, such as in industrial food processing, remains a significant hurdle. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and developing more efficient and cost-effective electroporation methods. In conclusion, the recent advancements in electroporation technologies have expanded their applications from benchtop research to clinical and industrial settings. The biophysical principles underlying electroporation, combined with the development of microfluidic and nanopore technologies, have enabled precise and controlled manipulation of cells at the single-cell level. In vivo applications, such as electrochemotherapy, gene therapy, and pulsed field ablation, have shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies. As research continues to advance, electroporation is poised to play a crucial role in the future of medicine and biotechnology.", "References": [{"title": "Electroporation: A general phenomenon for manipulating cells and tissues", "authors": "E.
