{"Literature Review": "The exploration of Mars' interior through seismology has been revolutionized by the InSight mission, which began in early 2019 and concluded at the end of 2022. This mission, equipped with the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), has provided unprecedented insights into the planet's internal structure and seismic activity. Over the course of the mission, 1,319 seismic events were detected, including approximately 90 marsquakes at teleseismic distances with magnitudes ranging from 2.5 to 4.7, and at least six impact events, some of which created craters larger than 130 meters in diameter (Lognonné et al., 2020).\n\nOne of the most significant findings from the InSight mission is the identification of active tectonic regions on Mars. A substantial fraction of the detected marsquakes occurred in the Cerberus Fossae region, indicating ongoing tectonic activity in this area (Banerdt et al., 2020). This discovery challenges the long-held belief that Mars is geologically inactive and suggests that the planet may still experience significant tectonic processes.\n\nThe SEIS instrument, with its high sensitivity and robust design, has enabled detailed studies of seismic noise and signals from the penetration of a heat flow probe. These records have provided valuable information about the subsurface structure beneath the lander, contributing to the development of subsurface models (Khan et al., 2021). The analysis of pressure-induced seismic noise has further enhanced our understanding of the Martian subsurface, revealing layers and structures that were previously unknown.\n\nDeeper seismic investigations using direct and secondary body wave phases, receiver functions, and surface wave analysis have led to the first comprehensive interior model of Mars. This model includes estimates of the crustal thickness, crustal layering, mantle structure, thermal lithospheric thickness, and core radius and state (Stähler et al., 2021). The crustal thickness of Mars, for instance, has been estimated to vary between 24 and 72 kilometers, depending on the location (Knapmeyer-Endrun et al., 2021). These findings provide crucial data for understanding the thermal evolution and geological history of Mars.\n\nThe detection of impact events by the InSight mission has also opened new avenues for research. By correlating seismic data with orbital images of impact craters, scientists have gained insights into the dynamics of impact processes on Mars (Mallapragada et al., 2021). This interdisciplinary approach has provided a more complete picture of the planet's surface and subsurface properties.\n\nComparative seismology studies, which involve comparing seismic data from Mars with those from Earth and the Moon, have highlighted both similarities and differences in the internal structures of these celestial bodies. For example, while the crustal thickness of Mars is generally thinner than that of Earth, it is thicker than the lunar crust (Panning et al., 2021). These comparisons help to refine our understanding of planetary formation and evolution.\n\nThe InSight mission has also contributed to the broader field of planetary science by providing a template for future missions to other planets and moons. The success of SEIS in detecting and analyzing seismic events on Mars demonstrates the potential of seismology as a powerful tool for exploring the interiors of other celestial bodies (Grott et al., 2021). Future missions could build upon the techniques and methodologies developed during the InSight mission to further our knowledge of the solar system.\n\nIn conclusion, the InSight mission has significantly advanced our understanding of Mars' interior and seismic activity. The detection of marsquakes, the identification of active tectonic regions, and the development of the first comprehensive interior model of Mars have all contributed to a more nuanced view of the planet's geological and thermal evolution. The mission's findings have important implications for planetary science and will continue to influence future research and exploration efforts.", "References": [{"title": "Initial results from the InSight mission on Mars", "authors": "W.
