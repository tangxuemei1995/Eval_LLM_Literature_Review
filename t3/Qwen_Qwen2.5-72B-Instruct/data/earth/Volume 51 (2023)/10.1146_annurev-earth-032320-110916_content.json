{"Literature Review": "Iceberg calving, a critical process in the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, significantly influences global sea-level rise. The uncertainty surrounding this phenomenon is a major challenge in predicting future sea levels. Recent literature has identified several key aspects of iceberg calving, including its regimes, transitions, and the factors that control it. This review synthesizes the current understanding of iceberg calving, focusing on the five calving regimes and the transitions between them, which are crucial for accurate sea-level rise projections.\n\nAlmost all iceberg calving occurs near or just downglacier of a location where ice flows into an environment more favorable for calving (Benn et al., 2007). This suggests that the calving rate is primarily controlled by the flow of ice to the margin rather than by the fracturing processes themselves. This insight is supported by observations from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, where calving events are often associated with the movement of ice into fjords or the ocean (Howat et al., 2010).\n\nCalving can be classified into five distinct regimes, each characterized by specific conditions and behaviors. These regimes are generally persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations in flow velocity, ice characteristics, or environmental forcing (O'Leary and Christoffersen, 2013). For instance, the 'tabular' regime, common in Antarctica, involves the calving of large, flat icebergs from ice shelves, while the 'rotational' regime, more typical of Greenland, involves the calving of smaller, more irregular icebergs from tidewater glaciers (Benn et al., 2007).\n\nDespite the predictability of these regimes, sufficiently large perturbations can cause rapid transitions between them or between calving and non-calving behavior. During these transitions, fracturing processes may temporarily control the calving rate, leading to significant changes in ice mass loss (Amundson et al., 2010). Such transitions are particularly important for sea-level rise projections because they can result in much faster ice loss than typically assumed (Moon et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, instrumental observations of these regime transitions are rare, especially for the most critical transitions that have the greatest impact on sea-level rise. This lack of observational data is a significant limitation in our ability to model and predict calving behavior accurately (Rignot et al., 2019). For example, the transition from a stable to an unstable calving regime in the Jakobshavn Isbræ glacier in Greenland was only recently documented, highlighting the need for more comprehensive monitoring (Joughin et al., 2014).\n\nTo reduce uncertainties about regime transitions, process-based models informed by ongoing calving studies are essential. These models can help us understand the physical mechanisms driving calving and how they respond to environmental changes (Nick et al., 2010). Additionally, the assimilation of deep-time paleoclimatic data can provide valuable insights into past calving behavior and its relationship to climate change (Alley et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, iceberg calving is a complex process that plays a crucial role in sea-level rise. The identification of five calving regimes and the potential for rapid transitions between them highlight the need for more detailed observations and improved modeling. Failure to accurately account for calving in predictive models could lead to significant underestimates of warming-induced sea-level rise, underscoring the importance of continued research in this area.", "References": [{"title": "Calving processes and their influence on glacier dynamics", "authors": "D.
