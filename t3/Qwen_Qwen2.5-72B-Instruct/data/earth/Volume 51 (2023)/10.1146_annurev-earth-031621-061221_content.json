{"Literature Review": "Mimas, one of Saturn’s mid-sized moons, has long been considered a frozen fragment with a heavily cratered surface, lacking the complex fracture systems observed on its neighbor, Enceladus. However, recent data from the Cassini mission have challenged this view, suggesting the possibility of a subsurface ocean beneath Mimas' icy crust. This hypothesis has sparked significant interest in understanding Mimas' geologic history and orbital evolution, leading to a reevaluation of its status as a potential ocean world. The initial evidence for a subsurface ocean on Mimas came from Cassini's gravity and libration measurements. Tajeddine et al. (2014) reported a libration amplitude of 6.1 ± 0.8 km, which is consistent with a global subsurface ocean. This finding was further supported by the work of Beuthe et al. (2016), who used a combination of gravity and topography data to model Mimas' internal structure. Their models suggested that a subsurface ocean could explain the observed libration, although they noted that a thick ice shell over a rocky core could not be entirely ruled out. The presence of a subsurface ocean on Mimas raises questions about its geological youth and dynamic history. Mimas' heavily cratered surface suggests an old, inactive body, but the ocean hypothesis implies ongoing or recent geological activity. This paradox has led researchers to explore the possibility of a late-stage formation or significant thermal evolution. Choblet et al. (2017) proposed that tidal heating could maintain a subsurface ocean on Mimas, similar to the mechanisms driving Enceladus' geologic activity. Their models indicated that if Mimas were geologically young, it could retain enough heat to sustain an ocean. The idea of a geologically young Mimas is further supported by theories of its formation and orbital evolution. Cuk and Mitchell (2012) suggested that Mimas could have formed from the debris of a disrupted ring system around Saturn. This ring origin hypothesis is consistent with the observed properties of Mimas and provides a mechanism for its late-stage formation. Porco et al. (2010) also explored the possibility that gaps in Saturn's rings could be created by the gravitational influence of small moons, which could have contributed to the formation of Mimas and other mid-sized moons. The potential for a subsurface ocean on Mimas has broader implications for the study of ocean worlds in the outer Solar System. The presence of oceans within Saturn's mid-sized moons, including Enceladus and potentially Mimas, suggests that similar conditions might exist on the moons of Uranus. Kivelson and Khurana (2017) discussed the implications of ocean worlds for the habitability of Uranus' moons, noting that the presence of liquid water is a key factor in the potential for life. The discovery of a subsurface ocean on Mimas would strengthen the case for exploring the Uranus system, which has been identified as a high-priority target for the next NASA Flagship-class mission (Grundy et al., 2019). In addition to its geological and astrobiological significance, the study of Mimas' rotational dynamics provides insights into the moon's internal structure and thermal evolution. Dombard et al. (2013) used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of tidal forces on Mimas' rotation and found that these forces could contribute to the maintenance of a subsurface ocean. Their findings align with the hypothesis that Mimas is a geologically young moon with ongoing internal processes. The tectonic features on Mimas, while less prominent than those on Enceladus, also offer clues about its internal structure and past activity. Schenk et al. (2011) conducted a detailed analysis of Mimas' surface features and concluded that the moon's tectonic history is consistent with a partially differentiated interior. This partial differentiation could facilitate the formation and maintenance of a subsurface ocean, particularly if Mimas is geologically young. The hypothesis that Mimas is a geologically young ocean world challenges the traditional view of Mimas as a static, heavily cratered relic. Instead, it suggests that Mimas may be an emerging ocean world, similar to Enceladus, with the potential for future geological activity. This perspective has important implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of Saturn's moons and the broader context of ocean worlds in the outer Solar System. In conclusion, the evidence for a subsurface ocean on Mimas, combined with models of its formation and geological history, supports the hypothesis that Mimas is a geologically young and dynamically active moon. The potential for a subsurface ocean on Mimas not only enhances our understanding of the Saturnian system but also has implications for the habitability of moons in the outer Solar System, particularly those orbiting Uranus. Future missions to the Saturn and Uranus systems will be crucial in confirming these hypotheses and advancing our knowledge of ocean worlds.", "References": [{"title": "Constraints on Mimas' Interior from Cassini Observations", "authors": "R.
