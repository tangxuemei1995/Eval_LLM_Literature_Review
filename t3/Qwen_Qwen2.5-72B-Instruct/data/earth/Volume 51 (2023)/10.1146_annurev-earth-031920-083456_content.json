{"Literature Review": "As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise, the potential for severe climate change impacts has led to increased interest in geoengineering as a means to mitigate these effects. Among the various geoengineering strategies, solar geoengineering (SG) stands out for its ability to rapidly cool the planet by reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight. However, the hydrological consequences of SG remain one of the most uncertain and consequential aspects of its implementation. This literature review synthesizes recent findings on the projected hydrological outcomes of solar geoengineering, drawing on a robust body of literature on hydrological responses to climate change.\n\nThe primary mechanism of SG involves the injection of aerosols into the stratosphere, which scatter and reflect sunlight back into space, thereby reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. This reduction in insolation is expected to have significant impacts on the global hydrological cycle. Studies have consistently shown that SG is likely to weaken the global hydrological cycle, leading to a decrease in evaporation rates and precipitation (Kravitz et al., 2013; Tilmes et al., 2018). This weakening is primarily due to the cooling effect of SG, which reduces the energy available for evaporation and condensation processes.\n\nHowever, the global average response masks significant regional variations. For instance, while some regions may experience reduced precipitation, others might see increases or little change. A study by Jones et al. (2017) found that the hydrological response to SG is highly dependent on the specific implementation method and the geographical location. In particular, the tropics are expected to experience more pronounced changes in precipitation patterns compared to higher latitudes. This is because the tropical hydrological cycle is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the cooling effect of SG is more pronounced in these regions (Tilmes et al., 2018).\n\nThe impact of SG on regional precipitation is further complicated by the interaction with other climate forcings, such as greenhouse gas emissions. A study by MacMartin et al. (2016) demonstrated that the combined effects of SG and continued CO2 emissions can lead to non-linear and sometimes counterintuitive outcomes. For example, while SG can reduce global mean temperatures, it may not fully offset the warming caused by CO2 emissions, leading to complex regional precipitation patterns. This highlights the importance of considering multiple climate forcings when evaluating the hydrological impacts of SG.\n\nAnother critical aspect of the hydrological response to SG is the impact on extreme weather events. Research by Moore et al. (2015) suggests that SG could potentially reduce the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events, which are expected to increase under a high-CO2 scenario. However, the effectiveness of SG in mitigating extreme events is still a matter of debate, and some studies have found that SG could actually exacerbate certain types of extreme weather, such as droughts in some regions (Jones et al., 2017).\n\nThe hydrological impacts of SG also extend to other aspects of the water cycle, including soil moisture and runoff. A study by Kravitz et al. (2013) found that SG could lead to a reduction in soil moisture in some regions, particularly in areas where precipitation decreases. This could have significant implications for agriculture and water resource management. Additionally, changes in runoff patterns could affect river flows and the availability of freshwater resources, potentially leading to conflicts over water rights (Moore et al., 2015).\n\nThe social and economic dimensions of the hydrological impacts of SG are equally important. The distribution of hydrological changes can have differential impacts on different populations, depending on their vulnerability and adaptive capacity. For example, regions that are already water-stressed may be disproportionately affected by reductions in precipitation, while regions with abundant water resources may be less impacted (MacMartin et al., 2016). This underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the social and economic contexts in which SG is implemented.\n\nIn conclusion, the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering are complex and regionally variable. While SG is expected to weaken the global hydrological cycle, the specific impacts on regional precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff are highly dependent on the implementation method and the underlying climate forcings. To reduce decision-relevant uncertainties in this novel field of Earth science inquiry, further research is needed to better understand the interactions between SG and other climate forcings, as well as the social and economic implications of hydrological changes.", "References": [{"title": "The hydrological impact of geoengineering in the GeoMIP ensemble", "authors": "Ben Kravitz, Philip J.
