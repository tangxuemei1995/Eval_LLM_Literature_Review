{"Literature Review": "Elastic thermobarometry is a powerful technique used to infer the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions at which mineral inclusions were entrapped within their host crystals. This method leverages the principles of elasticity and thermodynamics to interpret the differential strains induced by contrasting compressibilities and thermal expansivities during exhumation and cooling. The primary tools for measuring these strains are Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, which provide in situ data on the lattice parameters of both the host and inclusion phases. The fundamental concept behind elastic thermobarometry is that the stress state within a mineral inclusion and its host crystal must have been uniform at the time of entrapment. This uniformity is disrupted during subsequent geological processes, leading to volume mismatches that can be quantified and inverted to determine the original P-T conditions. The accuracy of these calculations depends on the availability of precise equations of state and elastic properties for the minerals involved. Several factors can influence the accuracy of elastic thermobarometry, including the shape of the inclusion, its proximity to surfaces, and the anisotropy of the crystal axes. Crystal-axis anisotropy is another critical factor that must be accounted for in elastic thermobarometry. Anisotropic minerals exhibit different elastic properties along different crystallographic directions, which can result in significant variations in the measured strains. Recent research has expanded the scope of elastic thermobarometry to explore various aspects of crystal growth, reaction overstepping, and the magnitudes of differential stresses. In conclusion, elastic thermobarometry is a robust and versatile tool for inferring the P-T conditions of mineral inclusions. However, its accuracy depends on careful consideration of factors such as inclusion shape, surface proximity, crystal-axis anisotropy, and inelastic deformation. Ongoing research continues to refine the methodology and expand its applicability to a broader range of geological settings and mineral systems.", "References": [{"title": "Elastic thermobarometry: A new tool for determining the pressure-temperature conditions of mineral inclusions", "authors": "W.
