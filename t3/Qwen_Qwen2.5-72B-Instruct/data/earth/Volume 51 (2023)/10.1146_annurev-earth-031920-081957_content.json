{"Literature Review": "The study of Earth's rock-hosted biosphere has significantly advanced over the past two decades, driven by improvements in cell extraction, cell sorting, DNA sequencing, and techniques for detecting cell distributions and activity. This review synthesizes key findings and highlights the critical role of lithology, permeability, and fluid mixing processes in shaping the diversity and distribution of microbial communities in fractured rock systems. The rock-hosted biosphere, often referred to as the endolithic biosphere, encompasses microorganisms living within or on the surface of rocks. These microorganisms, primarily bacteria and archaea, are capable of chemolithoautotrophy, a metabolic process where they derive energy from inorganic compounds. The ability of these microorganisms to thrive in such extreme environments has expanded our understanding of the limits of life on Earth. Lithology plays a crucial role in determining the habitability of subsurface environments. Different rock types provide varying surfaces and pore spaces that can support microbial life. For instance, basaltic rocks, which are common in both continental and oceanic crust, offer abundant surface area and reactive minerals that can serve as energy sources for microorganisms. In contrast, granitic rocks, with their lower porosity and reactivity, may support less diverse microbial communities. Permeability is another critical factor that influences the distribution and activity of microorganisms in the subsurface. Fractured rock systems, characterized by high permeability, allow for the movement of fluids and gases, which can transport nutrients and energy sources to microbial communities. Conversely, low-permeability environments, such as those found in deep sedimentary basins, may limit the availability of these resources, leading to more sparse and less active microbial populations. Fluid mixing processes also play a significant role in the rock-hosted biosphere. The mixing of different fluids, such as groundwater and seawater, can create gradients of chemical potential that drive microbial metabolism. For example, the mixing of oxygenated surface waters with reducing fluids from deeper subsurface environments can create redox gradients that support diverse microbial communities. Despite these advances, many questions remain regarding the functions of most organisms in the rock-hosted biosphere and the rates of their activity and growth. Most studies have focused on identifying the presence and diversity of microorganisms, but fewer have explored their physiological adaptations to mineral-associated growth under energy- and nutrient-limited conditions. Understanding these adaptations is essential for predicting how microbial communities will respond to changes in environmental conditions, such as those caused by climate change or human activities. To address these knowledge gaps, future studies should focus on characterizing the physiology of microorganisms in the rock-hosted biosphere. This includes developing experimental approaches to detect synergistic interactions between microorganisms and between microorganisms and minerals. For example, co-culture experiments can help identify mutualistic relationships that enhance the survival and growth of microorganisms in nutrient-poor environments. Additionally, isotopic labeling techniques can be used to trace the flow of carbon and other elements through microbial communities, providing insights into their metabolic activities. In conclusion, the rock-hosted biosphere represents a vast and largely unexplored frontier in microbiology. While significant progress has been made in understanding the factors that control the distribution and diversity of microbial communities in fractured rock systems, much remains to be discovered about their physiological adaptations and functional roles. Future research should prioritize the development of new experimental and analytical tools to unravel the complex interactions between microorganisms, minerals, and environmental conditions in the subsurface.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial communities in deep-sea hydrothermal vent plumes of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise", "authors": "W.
