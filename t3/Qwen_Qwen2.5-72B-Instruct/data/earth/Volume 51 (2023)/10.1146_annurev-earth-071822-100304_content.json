{"Literature Review": "Understanding the energy partitioning during earthquakes is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of fault dynamic weakening and the processes that govern rupture propagation. Earthquakes are generated by the rupture propagation and slip within fault cores, which are typically a few meters thick and surrounded by damage zones that can extend hundreds of meters. The energy dissipated during this process, known as fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (W_b), plays a pivotal role in earthquake mechanics. This literature review synthesizes findings from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of fracture energy and its scaling with coseismic slip.\n\nSeismological studies have provided valuable insights into the energy budget of earthquakes. For instance, Ide et al. (2007) analyzed the seismic waveforms of large earthquakes and found that the radiated seismic energy is a significant component of the total energy budget. However, the remaining energy is primarily dissipated through fracture and frictional processes within the fault zone. This suggests that the fracture energy is a critical parameter in understanding the overall energy balance during an earthquake.\n\nModeling studies have further refined our understanding of the energy dissipation mechanisms. Rice (2006) developed a theoretical framework that describes the dynamic weakening of faults during rupture propagation. According to this model, the fracture energy is a function of the slip rate and the properties of the fault zone materials. This framework has been validated by numerical simulations, which show that the fracture energy scales with the coseismic slip (Aochi and Fukuyama, 2002). These simulations also highlight the importance of the fault zone structure in determining the energy dissipation patterns.\n\nGeological observations provide empirical evidence for the scaling of fracture energy with coseismic slip. Sibson (1996) conducted detailed field studies of exhumed fault zones and found that the damage zones surrounding the fault cores exhibit characteristics consistent with high-energy dissipation. The thickness and complexity of these damage zones suggest that a significant portion of the energy is dissipated through fracture processes. Similarly, Chester et al. (1993) analyzed the microstructure of fault gouge and found that the grain size distribution and the presence of cataclastic flow indicate intense fracturing and energy dissipation.\n\nExperimental studies have complemented these observations by providing controlled conditions to study the energy dissipation mechanisms. Niemeijer et al. (2011) conducted triaxial deformation experiments on fault gouge samples and measured the fracture energy directly. Their results show that the fracture energy is proportional to the slip distance, which is consistent with the scaling observed in natural faults. These experiments also reveal that the material properties of the fault zone, such as the grain size and mineral composition, play a significant role in determining the fracture energy.\n\nDespite these advances, the energy budget of earthquakes remains a topic of ongoing debate. Some researchers argue that the fracture energy is a material-dependent constant at the microscale, which is important for understanding the fracturing of individual grains (Brace and Byerlee, 1965). However, at the macroscale, where earthquake ruptures occur, the fracture energy is better described by a scaling relationship with coseismic slip. This perspective is supported by the consistency of fracture energy estimates across different types of faults and tectonic settings (Beroza and Ide, 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes highlights the importance of considering both microscale and macroscale processes. While material-dependent constants are relevant for understanding the fracturing of individual grains, they are negligible in the context of macroscale rupture propagation on natural faults. The scaling of fracture energy with coseismic slip provides a robust framework for understanding the energy dissipation mechanisms during earthquakes. Future research should continue to integrate insights from seismology, modeling, geology, and experimentation to further refine our understanding of earthquake mechanics.", "References": [{"title": "Scaling of Seismic Source Parameters with Fault Length and Rupture Velocity", "authors": "Shinji Toda, Ross S.
