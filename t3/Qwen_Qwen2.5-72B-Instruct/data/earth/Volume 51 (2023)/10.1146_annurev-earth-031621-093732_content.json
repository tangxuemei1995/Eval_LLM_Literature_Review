{"Literature Review": "River deltas are dynamic landforms that play a crucial role in global ecosystems and human societies. They are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise (SLR), which poses significant threats to their stability and function. This literature review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on how river deltas respond to SLR, drawing on both historical and projected data, as well as recent advancements in modeling and observational techniques. The Holocene epoch, which began approximately 11,700 years ago, has seen significant variations in sea level, influencing the formation and evolution of river deltas. Studies have shown that the initiation time and subsequent progradation of deltas during the Holocene varied widely, primarily due to differences in sea-level and sediment supply histories. For instance, the Mississippi Delta experienced rapid progradation during periods of high sediment input, while the Nile Delta's growth was more gradual due to lower sediment availability. Modern river deltas, however, face unprecedented challenges. Unlike their Holocene counterparts, contemporary deltas are larger and will encounter faster rates of SLR, making them more susceptible to forced transgression. Forced transgression occurs when the rate of SLR exceeds the delta's ability to accrete vertically or prograde laterally, leading to submergence and land loss. This phenomenon is particularly concerning for densely populated and economically important regions, such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh, where millions of people are at risk. Recent advancements in regional SLR projections have significantly improved our understanding of the processes and sources of uncertainty. These projections now incorporate a broader range of factors, including contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, thermal expansion of oceans, and changes in ocean circulation. The isolation of dominant sources of uncertainty, such as the potential collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, has provided more robust estimates of future SLR scenarios. Morphodynamic models, which simulate the interactions between water flow, sediment transport, and landform evolution, have also seen substantial improvements. These models are essential for predicting how deltas will respond to SLR and other environmental changes. For example, the Delft3D model, which incorporates detailed hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes, has been used to simulate the effects of SLR on the Mekong Delta. Such models help identify critical thresholds beyond which deltaic systems may undergo irreversible changes. Despite these advancements, significant uncertainties remain, particularly regarding vertical land motion (VLM) in and around deltas. VLM, which includes both natural subsidence and anthropogenic factors such as groundwater extraction, can be the dominant source of relative sea-level change (RSLC) in many deltaic environments. Limited observations of VLM complicate efforts to project RSLC accurately, as it is challenging to separate the effects of SLR from those of subsidence. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern SLR are still limited, posing major challenges to model validation. While some studies have documented localized instances of land loss, such as in the Mississippi Delta, comprehensive, long-term datasets are scarce. This lack of empirical evidence hinders our ability to refine and validate predictive models, which is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. Projections suggest that river deltas globally could lose up to 5% (∼35,000 km²) of their surface area by 2100 and up to 50% by 2300 under a high-emission scenario. These losses would have profound implications for coastal communities, ecosystems, and economies. For instance, the loss of fertile agricultural land in the Nile Delta could exacerbate food security issues in Egypt. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and modeling the response of river deltas to SLR, substantial uncertainties remain. Continued research is needed to improve our observational capabilities, refine predictive models, and develop adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of SLR on these vital coastal landforms.", "References": [{"title": "Sediment fluxes to coastal waters and the global rise in sea level", "authors": "J.
