{"Literature Review": "Terrestrial plants have played a pivotal role in shaping Earth's environment over geological timescales, influencing water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. The study of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time has traditionally relied on modern-plant analogs to represent paleo-ecosystems. However, this approach is limited because plant physiology has evolved over time, and many paleo-plants lack clear modern analogs. Recent advancements in the quantitative reconstruction of whole-plant function offer new opportunities to understand the unique roles of extinct plants in past environmental changes. One of the key challenges in studying paleo-plant function is the lack of direct evidence for physiological processes in extinct species. Traditional methods often rely on morphological traits and phylogenetic relationships to infer functional characteristics. However, these methods can be insufficient for capturing the full range of plant responses to environmental conditions. Recent studies have integrated fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem and Earth system models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of paleo-plant performance. Another important aspect of paleo-plant function is the integration of ecological and evolutionary theory. By characterizing extinct plants in terms of their functional traits and strategies, researchers can better understand their roles in past ecosystems. The application of these methods to Earth system models has further expanded our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions in deep time. The integration of paleo-plant function into ecosystem and Earth system models also provides insights into the feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. Moreover, the application of these methods to specific regions and time periods has revealed the unique roles of paleo-plants in local and regional environmental changes. In addition to these regional studies, global-scale analyses have highlighted the importance of plant functional diversity in shaping Earth's climate. The integration of paleo-plant function into Earth system models also has implications for understanding future climate scenarios. In conclusion, the integration of fossil and geologic data with process-based ecosystem and Earth system models provides a powerful framework for understanding the roles of extinct plants in past environmental changes. Future research should continue to refine these methods and apply them to a broader range of time periods and regions to further expand our understanding of Earth's environmental history.", "References": [{"title": "The Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems", "authors": "C.
