{"Literature Review": "Talpid moles and spotted hyenas are unique among mammals due to their remarkable anatomical and behavioral traits that challenge traditional notions of sexual dimorphism. These species exhibit female masculinization, characterized by the development of male-like genitalia and behaviors, which has been a subject of extensive research. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the biology and evolution of fierce females, focusing on study methods, anatomical peculiarities, and the roles of steroid hormones, genetics, and environmental factors in their development and behavior. The study of talpid moles and spotted hyenas requires specialized methodologies due to their unique anatomical structures and behaviors. For instance, the examination of mole ovotestes involves detailed histological and endocrinological analyses to understand the production and regulation of testosterone. Similarly, the study of spotted hyenas often employs non-invasive techniques such as fecal hormone analysis to monitor reproductive cycles and stress levels. These methods provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms underlying female masculinization. One of the most striking anatomical features of talpid moles is the presence of ovotestes, which are gonads that contain both ovarian and testicular tissue. These structures produce testosterone, leading to the development of male-like external genitalia in females. The closure of the vaginal orifice after each estrus cycle is another unique characteristic, which may serve to protect against infection or predation. In spotted hyenas, the absence of an external vaginal orifice and the development of a pseudoscrotum and a large pseudopenis further exemplify the extent of female masculinization. These anatomical peculiarities influence various physiological functions, including reproduction and urination, and require specialized adaptations for successful mating and birthing. The development of the urogenital system in these species is influenced by a complex interplay of steroid hormones, genetics, and environmental factors. Testosterone plays a crucial role in the masculinization of female genitalia in both moles and hyenas. In moles, the production of testosterone by ovotestes is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which is sensitive to environmental cues such as temperature and photoperiod. In spotted hyenas, the high levels of androgens during fetal development are thought to drive the formation of the pseudopenis and other male-like traits. Genetic factors also contribute to the development of these traits, with specific genes involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis and morphogenesis. Aggressive behavior and social dominance are prominent features of both talpid moles and spotted hyenas. In moles, testosterone levels are positively correlated with aggressive behavior, which is essential for territorial defense and resource acquisition. Female spotted hyenas are known for their dominant status within their social groups, which is maintained through aggressive interactions and the display of male-like physical attributes. The role of steroid hormones in modulating aggressive behavior has been well-documented, with higher levels of androgens associated with increased aggression in both species. Despite their anatomical and behavioral masculinization, female moles and hyenas are highly effective mothers. The closure of the vaginal orifice in moles and the presence of a pseudopenis in hyenas do not impede their ability to reproduce and care for their offspring. In fact, these traits may confer evolutionary advantages by enhancing survival and reproductive success. For example, the pseudopenis in spotted hyenas allows for the delivery of offspring through a structure that is adapted for both copulation and parturition, reducing the risk of injury during birth. In conclusion, the biology and evolution of fierce females, such as talpid moles and spotted hyenas, offer fascinating insights into the diversity of sexual dimorphism in mammals. The unique anatomical and behavioral traits of these species are shaped by a combination of hormonal, genetic, and environmental factors, which have evolved to enhance their survival and reproductive success. Future research should continue to explore the underlying mechanisms of female masculinization and its ecological and evolutionary implications.", "References": [{"title": "Histological and endocrinological analysis of ovotestes in talpid moles", "authors": "Gallagher, J.
