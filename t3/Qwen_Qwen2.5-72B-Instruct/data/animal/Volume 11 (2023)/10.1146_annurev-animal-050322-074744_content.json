{"Literature Review": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are unique among mammals due to their exceptional longevity, delayed aging, and resistance to age-related diseases. These characteristics have made them a valuable model for studying healthy aging. NMRs can live over 37 years, which is significantly longer than other rodents of similar size, and they exhibit a delayed aging phenotype characterized by the maintenance of physiological functions and low incidence of age-related diseases (Buffenstein, 2008). NMRs are native to the arid regions of East Africa, where they live in large, subterranean colonies. These colonies are highly organized and exhibit eusocial behavior, similar to that seen in insects such as ants and bees. The social structure of NMR colonies is dominated by a single breeding female (the queen) and one to three breeding males, while the majority of the colony consists of non-breeding workers (Jarvis, 1981). NMRs live in environments with low oxygen levels, which has led to the evolution of remarkable hypoxia tolerance. Studies have shown that NMRs can survive for extended periods in conditions of severe hypoxia (oxygen levels as low as 3%) without experiencing significant tissue damage or cognitive impairment (Park et al., 2017). One of the most striking features of NMRs is their exceptional longevity. Unlike other mammals, NMRs do not show an increase in mortality rate with age, a phenomenon known as negligible senescence (Buffenstein, 2008). Another notable characteristic of NMRs is their resistance to cancer. Despite living for over 37 years, NMRs rarely develop tumors, and when they do, the incidence is extremely low (Buffenstein, 2008). While much has been learned about the unique characteristics of NMRs, several questions remain unanswered. One of the key challenges is to fully elucidate the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying their exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have provided valuable insights, but more comprehensive studies are needed to identify the specific genes and pathways involved (Kim et al., 2011). Additionally, the role of environmental factors, such as diet and social interactions, in modulating the aging process in NMRs remains to be explored (Buffenstein, 2008). In conclusion, NMRs offer a unique opportunity to study the biological mechanisms of healthy aging. Their exceptional longevity, delayed aging, and resistance to age-related diseases make them an invaluable model for understanding the processes that contribute to healthy aging in mammals. Further research in this area has the potential to uncover new strategies for extending human healthspan and preventing age-related diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Negligible senescence in the little rock mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber)", "authors": "Rochelle Buffenstein", "journal": "Journal of Zoology", "year": "2008", "volumes": "275", "first page": "45", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00417.x"}, {"title": "Eusociality in a mammal: cooperative breeding in naked mole-rat colonies", "authors": "J.
