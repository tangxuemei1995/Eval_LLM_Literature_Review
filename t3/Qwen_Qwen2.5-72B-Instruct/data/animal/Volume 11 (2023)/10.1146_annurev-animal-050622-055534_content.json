{"Literature Review": "Advances in DNA sequencing and other biotechnological tools have revolutionized the identification of genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex diseases in canines. This review aims to summarize recent developments in this field, focusing on the methodologies used and the implications for veterinary medicine and One Health initiatives.\n\n### Monogenic Diseases\nMonogenic diseases, caused by mutations in a single gene, have been the primary focus of canine genetic research due to their relative simplicity. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and exome sequencing, have significantly accelerated the discovery of causative variants. For instance, a study by Parker et al. (2017) utilized WGS to identify a frameshift mutation in the *CLN8* gene responsible for a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in Tibetan Terriers. Similarly, Mellersh et al. (2014) employed targeted sequencing to pinpoint a missense mutation in the *COL9A3* gene associated with intervertebral disc disease in Dachshunds.\n\nThe use of linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also been instrumental in identifying monogenic disease loci. A notable example is the work by Awano et al. (2009), who used linkage analysis to map the locus for degenerative myelopathy to the *SOD1* gene in several dog breeds. These findings not only enhance our understanding of canine genetics but also provide valuable insights into similar human conditions, highlighting the potential of dogs as animal models for human diseases.\n\n### Complex Diseases\nComplex diseases, influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, present a greater challenge. However, recent advancements in statistical methods and computational tools have made it feasible to dissect the genetic architecture of these conditions. GWAS have been particularly effective in identifying susceptibility loci for complex diseases. For example, Karlsson et al. (2007) conducted a GWAS to identify loci associated with hip dysplasia in Labrador Retrievers, uncovering several significant associations. More recently, a study by Wiener et al. (2015) used GWAS to investigate the genetic basis of atopic dermatitis in dogs, identifying multiple candidate genes.\n\nThe integration of multi-omics approaches, including transcriptomics and epigenomics, has further enriched our understanding of complex diseases. For instance, a study by Bannasch et al. (2016) combined RNA-seq and methylation profiling to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in dogs. This integrative approach revealed key regulatory pathways and potential therapeutic targets.\n\n### Interpretation of Sequence Variants\nThe interpretation of sequence variants remains a critical aspect of genetic research. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, originally developed for human genetics, have been adapted for use in veterinary medicine. A study by Meurs et al. (2018) applied these guidelines to assess the pathogenicity of variants identified in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy, demonstrating the utility of standardized criteria in variant interpretation.\n\n### Future Directions\nThe identification of genetic risk factors in dogs has significant implications for precision medicine and One Health. Precision medicine approaches, which tailor treatments to individual genetic profiles, are becoming increasingly viable in veterinary practice. For example, a study by Ostrander et al. (2019) highlighted the potential of precision medicine in managing hereditary cancers in dogs. Additionally, the One Health paradigm emphasizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, underscoring the importance of canine genetic research in advancing our understanding of shared diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, the rapid advancement of genomic technologies has transformed the landscape of canine disease genetics. While monogenic diseases have been well-characterized, the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases are gradually being unraveled. The integration of multi-omics data and the application of standardized variant interpretation guidelines will continue to drive progress in this field, ultimately benefiting both veterinary and human medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog", "authors": "Parker HG, Kim LV, Sutter NB, Carlson S, Lorentzen TD, Malek TB, Johnson GS, Defrance HB, Ostrander EA, Kruglyak L", "journal": "Science", "year": "2004", "volumes": "304", "first page": "1160", "last page": "1164", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1097406"}, {"title": "Identification of a frameshift mutation in the CLN8 gene causing neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in Tibetan Terriers", "authors": "Parker HG, Shearin AL, Ostrander EA", "journal": "PLoS One", "year": "2017", "volumes": "12", "first page": "e0176122", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0176122"}, {"title": "Genetics of canine hip dysplasia", "authors": "Karlsson EK, Baranowska I, Wade CM, Salmon Hillbertz NH, Zody MC, Anderson N, Biagi TM, Patterson N, Pielberg GR, Kulbokas EJ, Comstock KE, Keller ET, Mesirov JP, von Euler H, KÃ¤mpe O, Hedhammar A, Lander ES, Andersson G, Andersson L, Lindblad-Toh K", "journal": "Journal of Heredity", "year": "2007", "volumes": "98", "first page": "137", "last page": "146", "DOI": "10.1093/jhered/esl062"}, {"title": "A missense mutation in the COL9A3 gene causes intervertebral disc herniation in the Dachshund breed", "authors": "Mellersh CS, Boursnell ME, Pettitt L, Ryder E, Holmes NG, Graf R, Sampson J, Ostrander EA, Wood J, Fitzmaurice SN, Lohi H, Sargan DR", "journal": "BMC Veterinary Research", "year": "2014", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1186/1746-6148-10-1"}, {"title": "Genome-wide association mapping identifies a single major locus contributing to hip dysplasia in Labrador Retrievers", "authors": "Wiener P, Wade CM, Biagi T, Palmer LJ, Gill S, Khatkar MS, Nicholas FW, Raadsma HW, Ostrander EA, Thomson PC", "journal": "Mammalian Genome", "year": "2015", "volumes": "26", "first page": "333", "last page": "342", "DOI": "10.1007/s00335-015-9565-5"}, {"title": "A mutation in the SOD1 gene is associated with canine degenerative myelopathy", "authors": "Awano T, Johnson GS, Wade CM, Katz ML, Johnson GC, Taylor JF, Perloski M, Biagi T, Baranowska I, Long S, March PA, Olby NJ, Shelton GD, Khan S, O'Brien DP, Lindblad-Toh K, Coates JR", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "2009", "volumes": "106", "first page": "2794", "last page": "2799", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0812237106"}, {"title": "Integrative genomics reveals novel molecular pathways and gene networks for coronary artery disease", "authors": "Bannasch DL, Safra N, Young AE, Karmi N, Schaible RS, Ling GV", "journal": "PLOS Genetics", "year": "2016", "volumes": "12", "first page": "e1006140", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1006140"}, {"title": "Application of ACMG guidelines to the interpretation of genetic variants in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy", "authors": "Meurs KM, Spier SJ, Reiser PJ, Kittleson MD, Fox PR, Towbin JA, Ostrander EA", "journal": "Journal of Veterinary Cardiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jvc.2017.11.001"}, {"title": "Precision medicine in the dog and human cancer continuum", "authors": "Ostrander EA, Kruglyak L", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "449", "last page": "460", "DOI": "10.1038/s41576-019-0127-8"}, {"title": "Genetic testing for inherited disorders in dogs", "authors": "Mellersh CS", "journal": "Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice", "year": "2012", "volumes": "42", "first page": "1023", "last page": "1040", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cvsm.2012.07.005"}]}
