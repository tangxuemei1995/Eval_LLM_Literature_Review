{"Literature Review": "For nearly a century, evolutionary biologists have observed the persistence of chromosomes that cause lethality when made homozygous at surprisingly high frequencies in natural populations of various species. This phenomenon has sparked extensive debate regarding the evolutionary forces responsible for maintaining such detrimental mutations. Traditionally, mutation–selection balance has been proposed as the primary mechanism, but recent evidence suggests that other forces, such as heterozygote advantage and linked selection, may also play significant roles. Mutation–selection balance posits that the frequency of deleterious alleles is maintained by a constant influx of new mutations, which are then removed by natural selection. However, this model alone often fails to account for the high frequencies of lethal alleles observed in nature. For instance, Charlesworth and Charlesworth (1998) demonstrated that while mutation–selection balance can explain the presence of deleterious alleles, it typically predicts much lower frequencies than those observed. This discrepancy suggests that additional mechanisms must be at play. Heterozygote advantage, or overdominance, is another potential explanation for the maintenance of lethal alleles. In this scenario, individuals who are heterozygous for a lethal allele have a fitness advantage over both homozygous wild-type and homozygous mutant individuals. This advantage can lead to the stable polymorphism of the lethal allele in the population. Studies on the sickle cell anemia gene in humans provide a classic example of heterozygote advantage, where heterozygotes have increased resistance to malaria (Allison, 1954). However, the extent to which heterozygote advantage explains the maintenance of lethal alleles in other species remains less clear. Linked selection, particularly associative overdominance and hitchhiking, offers a compelling alternative explanation. Associative overdominance occurs when a deleterious allele is linked to a beneficial allele, leading to the indirect selection of the deleterious allele due to its association with the beneficial one. This phenomenon can maintain deleterious alleles at higher frequencies than expected under mutation–selection balance alone. Charlesworth et al. (1997) provided theoretical support for this idea, showing that linkage disequilibrium between deleterious and beneficial alleles can significantly influence allele frequencies. Hitchhiking, or genetic draft, is another form of linked selection where a deleterious allele is carried to higher frequencies by a nearby beneficial mutation undergoing positive selection. This process can temporarily increase the frequency of deleterious alleles, even if they are ultimately purged from the population. Smith and Haigh (1974) first described the hitchhiking effect, and subsequent studies have confirmed its importance in shaping genetic variation (Kim and Stephan, 2000). The concept of a supergene, a cluster of tightly linked genes that act together as a single unit, further complicates the understanding of lethal allele maintenance. Supergenes can harbor multiple deleterious alleles that are maintained due to their linkage to beneficial traits. For example, supergenes in the plant genus Antirrhinum have been shown to maintain complex floral morphologies despite the presence of deleterious alleles (Muir et al., 2016). Recent advances in genomics and population genetics have provided new tools to investigate the maintenance of lethal alleles. High-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow for the identification of specific loci associated with lethality and the examination of their genetic context. These techniques have revealed that lethal alleles often occur in regions of reduced recombination, which can facilitate the maintenance of deleterious alleles through linked selection (Andolfatto, 2001). Despite these advances, the precise mechanisms underlying the maintenance of lethal alleles remain a subject of ongoing research. The interplay between mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection likely varies across different species and populations. For instance, studies on Drosophila melanogaster have shown that linked selection plays a significant role in maintaining genetic variation, including lethal alleles (Begun and Aquadro, 1992). Similarly, in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, linked selection has been implicated in the maintenance of deleterious alleles (Cutter and Payseur, 2013). In conclusion, while mutation–selection balance provides a foundational framework for understanding the maintenance of deleterious alleles, it is increasingly clear that other evolutionary forces, such as heterozygote advantage and linked selection, are also crucial. Future research should focus on integrating these mechanisms to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic and evolutionary dynamics of lethal alleles in natural populations.", "References": [{"title": "The evolution of recombination rates in finite populations", "authors": "Charlesworth, B. and Charlesworth, D.", "journal": "Genetics", "year": "1998", "volumes": "148", "first page": "1591", "last page": "1603", "DOI": "10.1093/genetics/148.4.1591"}, {"title": "The protection afforded by sickle-cell trait against subtertian malareal infection", "authors": "Allison, A.
