{"Literature Review": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors is a complex and multifaceted process that has been shaped by various genetic and environmental factors over millions of years. Understanding the molecular and functional diversity of these hormones across different vertebrate lineages provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of the endocrine system. This literature review focuses on non-osteichthyan vertebrates, specifically jawless and cartilaginous fishes, to explore the presence or absence of hormone genes, the multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, the differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and the evolutionary timing of gene origins. One of the key hormones studied in this context is leptin, a hormone primarily involved in regulating energy balance and metabolism. Leptin and its receptor have been identified in various vertebrate species, including mammals, birds, and teleost fish. However, the presence of leptin in non-osteichthyan vertebrates has been less well-documented. Recent studies have shown that leptin and its receptor are present in both jawless and cartilaginous fishes, suggesting that the leptin system evolved early in vertebrate evolution. These findings indicate that the leptin system was likely present in the common ancestor of all vertebrates and has been conserved throughout evolution. Another important hormone is oxytocin, which plays a crucial role in social bonding, reproduction, and lactation. Oxytocin and its closely related hormone, vasopressin, are part of the arginine vasotocin (AVT) family. AVT is the ancestral form of these hormones and is found in most non-mammalian vertebrates. Studies have shown that the AVT system is present in jawless and cartilaginous fishes, indicating that the oxytocin/vasopressin system evolved before the divergence of these lineages. The presence of AVT in these ancient lineages suggests that the oxytocin/vasopressin system has been conserved for over 500 million years. Prolactin is another hormone that has been extensively studied in vertebrates. Prolactin is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including lactation, osmoregulation, and immune function. The prolactin gene has been identified in both jawless and cartilaginous fishes, indicating that it evolved early in vertebrate evolution. The presence of prolactin in these ancient lineages suggests that the hormone's diverse functions were established early in vertebrate evolution and have been maintained through subsequent radiations. Ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite and growth hormone release, is another important factor in the endocrine system. Ghrelin and its receptor have been identified in a variety of vertebrates, including mammals, birds, and fish. Recent studies have shown that ghrelin is also present in jawless and cartilaginous fishes, indicating that the ghrelin system evolved early in vertebrate evolution. The presence of ghrelin in these ancient lineages suggests that the hormone's role in appetite regulation and growth hormone release has been conserved throughout evolution. The presence or absence of hormone genes in non-osteichthyan vertebrates provides important insights into the evolutionary history of the endocrine system. For example, the presence of leptin, oxytocin/vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin in jawless and cartilaginous fishes suggests that these hormones evolved before the divergence of these lineages. This finding supports the idea that the endocrine system was already complex and functional in the common ancestor of all vertebrates. The multiplication and maintenance of paralogs is another important aspect of the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors. Gene duplication events have played a significant role in the diversification of the endocrine system, allowing for the development of new functions and the specialization of existing ones. For example, the duplication of the oxytocin/vasopressin gene in mammals has led to the evolution of distinct oxytocin and vasopressin systems, each with unique functions. Similarly, the duplication of the prolactin gene in teleost fish has resulted in the evolution of multiple prolactin isoforms, each with specific roles in osmoregulation and other physiological processes. The differential fates of duplicated paralogs have also contributed to the diversification of the endocrine system. In some cases, duplicated genes may undergo subfunctionalization, where each paralog retains a subset of the ancestral gene's functions. In other cases, duplicated genes may undergo neofunctionalization, where one paralog acquires a new function that was not present in the ancestral gene. For example, the duplication of the ghrelin gene in teleost fish has led to the evolution of two distinct ghrelin isoforms, each with unique functions in appetite regulation and growth hormone release. The evolutionary timing of gene origins is a critical aspect of understanding the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors. The presence of hormone genes in non-osteichthyan vertebrates provides important clues about when these genes first appeared in the vertebrate lineage. For example, the presence of leptin, oxytocin/vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin in jawless and cartilaginous fishes suggests that these genes evolved before the divergence of these lineages, which occurred approximately 500 million years ago. In conclusion, the study of non-osteichthyan vertebrates, particularly jawless and cartilaginous fishes, provides valuable insights into the evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors. The presence or absence of hormone genes, the multiplication and maintenance of paralogs, the differential fates of duplicated paralogs, and the evolutionary timing of gene origins are all important aspects of this evolutionary process. By investigating the genome sequence information of these ancient lineages, we can gain a deeper understanding of the molecular and functional diversity of the endocrine system and its role in vertebrate evolution.", "References": [{"title": "Evolutionary conservation of the leptin system in vertebrates", "authors": "Kurokawa, T., Saito, T., Uchiyama, M., and Sower, S.
