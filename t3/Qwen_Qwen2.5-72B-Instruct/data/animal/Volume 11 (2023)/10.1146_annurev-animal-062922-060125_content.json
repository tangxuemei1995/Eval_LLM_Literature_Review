{"Literature Review": "Zoonotic diseases, which are infections that can be transmitted from animals to humans, pose a significant threat to global public health. These diseases account for approximately 73% of emerging infectious diseases (EID) and are primarily driven by the interaction between humans and various animal species (Jones et al., 2008). Among these, domestic animals play a crucial role as potential reservoirs of zoonotic viral diseases, contributing to approximately 25% of all zoonotic infections (Taylor et al., 2001). This literature review aims to explore the role of domestic animals in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic viral diseases, highlighting key findings and gaps in the current understanding. Domestic animals, including livestock and pets, are integral to human societies worldwide. They provide essential services such as food, labor, and companionship, but they also serve as potential sources of zoonotic pathogens. The close proximity of domestic animals to humans increases the likelihood of pathogen spillover events, where viruses can jump from animal hosts to human populations (Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). For instance, influenza A viruses, which are known to circulate in poultry and swine, have been responsible for several pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Smith et al., 2009). The transmission of zoonotic viruses from domestic animals to humans can occur through various routes, including direct contact, indirect contact via contaminated environments, and vector-borne transmission. Direct contact, such as handling infected animals or their products, is a common mode of transmission. For example, the Nipah virus, which is primarily harbored by fruit bats, has been transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts like pigs, leading to outbreaks in Malaysia and Bangladesh (Chua et al., 2002). Indirect contact can involve exposure to contaminated surfaces or fomites, while vector-borne transmission involves arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks, which can carry and transmit viruses from animals to humans (Patz et al., 2004). Several factors contribute to the emergence and transmission of zoonotic viral diseases from domestic animals. These factors include changes in land use, agricultural practices, and human demographics. For instance, intensive farming practices, which often involve high-density animal populations, can create ideal conditions for the rapid spread of pathogens (Gibbs, 2014). Additionally, the global trade of live animals and animal products facilitates the movement of pathogens across borders, increasing the risk of disease spread (Woolhouse et al., 2005). The role of domestic animals as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses is further complicated by the presence of endemic viral infections. Endemic viruses, such as rabies and leptospirosis, are continuously present in domestic animal populations and can cause sporadic human infections (WHO, 2013). Rabies, for example, is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected dogs and remains a significant public health concern in many developing countries (Hampson et al., 2015). Similarly, leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be transmitted through the urine of infected animals, poses a risk to humans who come into contact with contaminated water or soil (Levett, 2001). The emergence of novel zoonotic viruses from domestic animals is also a growing concern. The rapid mutation and reassortment of viral genomes can lead to the creation of new strains with the potential to infect humans. For example, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was first identified in 2012, is believed to have originated in dromedary camels before spilling over to humans (Reusken et al., 2013). The ability of MERS-CoV to cause severe respiratory illness and its potential for human-to-human transmission highlights the need for ongoing surveillance and control measures. Effective management and control of zoonotic viral diseases require a multidisciplinary approach, often referred to as the One Health concept. This approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health and advocates for collaborative efforts across sectors (Zinsstag et al., 2012). Surveillance systems that monitor both human and animal populations for the presence of zoonotic pathogens are essential for early detection and rapid response to outbreaks. Additionally, public health interventions, such as vaccination programs and improved hygiene practices, can reduce the risk of zoonotic disease transmission (Patz et al., 2004). In conclusion, domestic animals play a significant role in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic viral diseases. Understanding the complex interactions between humans, animals, and the environment is crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and control these diseases. The One Health approach provides a framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by zoonotic viral diseases and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in global health efforts.", "References": [{"title": "Global trends in emerging infectious diseases", "authors": "Kate E.
