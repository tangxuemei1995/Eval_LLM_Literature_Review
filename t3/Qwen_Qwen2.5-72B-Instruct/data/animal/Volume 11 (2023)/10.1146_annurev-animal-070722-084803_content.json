{"Literature Review": "Poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife represent significant threats to global biodiversity, driven by complex socio-economic factors and facilitated by sophisticated criminal networks. The impact of poaching extends beyond individual species, contributing to broader ecological imbalances and biodiversity loss. In response to these challenges, the application of forensic science, particularly forensic genetics, has emerged as a critical tool in the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crimes. Forensic genetics involves the use of DNA analysis to identify individuals and trace the origin of biological samples, providing robust evidence in legal proceedings. One of the primary applications of forensic genetics in wildlife crime is the identification of species and individuals from confiscated products, such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and pangolin scales. For example, a DNA-based method was developed to determine the geographic origin of African elephant ivory, which has been instrumental in tracing illegal ivory trade routes and identifying poaching hotspots. In addition to species identification, forensic genetics can also be used to link suspects to crime scenes or to establish the chain of custody for seized items. This is particularly important in cases where physical evidence is limited or has been tampered with. The development of forensic databases has further enhanced the capabilities of wildlife forensics. These databases store genetic profiles of known species and individuals, allowing for rapid and accurate identification of samples. However, the application of forensic genetics in wildlife crime faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of standardized protocols and methodologies across different jurisdictions. Another challenge is the need for specialized training and resources. Despite these challenges, the use of forensic evidence in wildlife crime has led to several notable successes. The integration of forensic genetics with other forensic disciplines, such as toxicology and ballistics, has also expanded the scope of wildlife investigations. In conclusion, the application of forensic genetics in wildlife crime has significantly enhanced the ability to investigate and prosecute poaching and illegal wildlife trade. While challenges remain, ongoing advancements in technology and international collaboration offer promising avenues for further development. By leveraging forensic evidence, law enforcement agencies can more effectively disrupt criminal networks and protect endangered species, contributing to the conservation of global biodiversity.", "References": [{"title": "Poaching and trafficking of elephants: Can forensic DNA approaches help?", "authors": "Samuel K.
