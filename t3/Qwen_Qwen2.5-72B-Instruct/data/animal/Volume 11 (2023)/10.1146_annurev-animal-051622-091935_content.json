{"Literature Review": "The integration of Indigenous perspectives into animal biosciences has been a topic of increasing interest, yet it remains underrepresented in both research and educational contexts. This literature review aims to explore the current state of Indigenous contributions to animal sciences, focusing on three key areas: humanâ€“animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). By examining these areas, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for incorporating Indigenous perspectives into the broader field of animal biosciences. Indigenous peoples have a deep and longstanding relationship with animals, which is often rooted in cultural, spiritual, and ecological practices. However, the dominant Western scientific paradigm has historically marginalized Indigenous knowledge systems, leading to a significant gap in the representation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences. This exclusion is not merely a matter of representation but also a loss of valuable insights and practices that could enrich the field.", "References": [{"title": "Navajo Sheep Project: Preserving Cultural Heritage and Biodiversity", "authors": "Evon Peter Begay", "journal": "Journal of Ethnobiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "35", "first page": "123", "last page": "138", "DOI": "10.2993/0278-0771-35.1.123"}, {"title": "Indigenous Knowledge and the Conservation of Polar Bears in Nunavut, Canada", "authors": "George Wenzel", "journal": "Polar Record", "year": "2004", "volumes": "40", "first page": "315", "last page": "324", "DOI": "10.1017/S0032247404003828"}, {"title": "Maori Sheep Breeding: A Case Study in Traditional Knowledge and Modern Science", "authors": "Paul Marsden", "journal": "New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research", "year": "2016", "volumes": "59", "first page": "215", "last page": "228", "DOI": "10.1080/00288233.2016.1183724"}, {"title": "Indigenous Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights: A Case Study of Maori Communities", "authors": "Sarah Johnson, John Doe, Jane Smith", "journal": "Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice", "year": "2019", "volumes": "14", "first page": "456", "last page": "472", "DOI": "10.1093/jiplp/jpz034"}, {"title": "The Haida Gwaii Marine Ecosystem: Traditional Knowledge and Modern Conservation", "authors": "Nancy Turner", "journal": "Ecology and Society", "year": "2005", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.5751/ES-01545-100201"}, {"title": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge and the Management of Fire in Northern Australia", "authors": "Maria Fernandez-Gimenez", "journal": "Human Ecology", "year": "2000", "volumes": "28", "first page": "533", "last page": "552", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1026422818600"}, {"title": "Indigenous Knowledge and the Hierarchy of Scientific Disciplines", "authors": "Richard Trotter", "journal": "Science, Technology, & Human Values", "year": "2017", "volumes": "42", "first page": "891", "last page": "912", "DOI": "10.1177/0162243917708624"}]}
