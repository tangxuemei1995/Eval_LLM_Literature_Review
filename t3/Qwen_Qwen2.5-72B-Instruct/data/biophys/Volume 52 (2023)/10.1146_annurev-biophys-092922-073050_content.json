{"Literature Review": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play a crucial role in the innate immune system of both animals and plants. These proteins recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and form multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes in animals and resistosomes in plants. Recent advancements in structural biology have provided significant insights into the assembly and architecture of these complexes, elucidating their mechanisms of activation and function. In animals, NLR proteins such as NLRP3, NLRC4, and NLRP1 form inflammasomes upon activation. The NLRP3 inflammasome, for instance, is activated by a variety of stimuli, including ATP, alum, and bacterial toxins. Upon activation, NLRP3 undergoes conformational changes that lead to its oligomerization and the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1. This complex formation results in the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1, which then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRC4 inflammasome is activated by specific bacterial flagellin or type III secretion system components. Similar to NLRP3, NLRC4 forms a complex with ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to the production of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Structural studies have revealed that the NLRC4 protein contains a central helical domain that undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon ligand binding, facilitating the formation of the inflammasome complex. In plants, NLR proteins such as RPS2 and Rx1 form resistosomes upon recognizing specific pathogen effectors. The RPS2 protein, for example, recognizes the bacterial effector AvrRpt2 and undergoes a conformational change that leads to the formation of a high-molecular-weight complex. This complex, known as the RPS2 resistosome, triggers downstream signaling events that result in the activation of defense responses, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of defense-related genes. The Rx1 protein, on the other hand, recognizes the potato virus X (PVX) coat protein and forms a resistosome that includes the NADase holoenzyme. This holoenzyme is responsible for the degradation of NAD+, leading to cell death and the restriction of viral spread. Despite the differences in the specific mechanisms of activation and function, both NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes share common features. Both complexes are formed through the oligomerization of NLR proteins, which is triggered by the recognition of specific ligands. Additionally, both complexes involve the recruitment of adaptor proteins and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. However, the specific outcomes of these complexes differ between animals and plants. In animals, inflammasomes primarily mediate the processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while in plants, resistosomes often lead to localized cell death and the activation of systemic defense responses. Recent structural studies have provided detailed insights into the architecture of NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes. For example, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of the NLRP3 inflammasome have revealed a ring-like structure composed of multiple NLRP3 subunits, with ASC and pro-caspase-1 forming a filamentous structure on the outer surface. Similarly, cryo-EM studies of the RPS2 resistosome have shown a large, multi-subunit complex with a central pore that may facilitate the passage of signaling molecules. The structural information obtained from these studies has also shed light on the mechanisms of autoinhibition and activation of NLR proteins. In the resting state, NLR proteins are maintained in an autoinhibited conformation, preventing premature activation. Upon ligand binding, these proteins undergo conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition and promote oligomerization. For example, the NLRP3 protein contains an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which are separated by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). In the resting state, the LRR domain interacts with the NBD, maintaining the protein in an autoinhibited state. Ligand binding disrupts this interaction, allowing the PYD to interact with the PYD of ASC, leading to inflammasome formation. Similarly, plant NLR proteins such as RPS2 contain a central coiled-coil domain that is involved in autoinhibition. In the resting state, this domain prevents the interaction of the N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain with downstream signaling components. Upon ligand binding, the coiled-coil domain undergoes a conformational change, allowing the TIR domain to interact with other TIR-containing proteins and initiate signaling. In conclusion, recent advances in structural biology have significantly enhanced our understanding of the assembly and architecture of NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes. These studies have revealed the intricate mechanisms by which NLR proteins recognize ligands, undergo conformational changes, and form multiprotein complexes to mediate host immune responses. While there are commonalities in the overall process of NLR activation and complex formation, the specific outcomes and signaling pathways differ between animals and plants, reflecting the diverse strategies employed by different organisms to combat pathogens.", "References": [{"title": "Inflammasome sensors and the host response to infectious diseases", "authors": "Broz, P., Dixit, V.
