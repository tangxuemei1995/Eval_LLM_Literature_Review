{"Literature Review": "The field of protein structure prediction has seen significant advancements over the past few decades, driven by both incremental improvements and recent breakthroughs in deep learning methodologies. This review critically assesses the methods used for predicting the 3D structures of proteins and protein complexes, highlighting the contributions of community-wide blind prediction experiments such as CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) and CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions). The prediction of single protein chains has been a focal point of research, with early methods relying on template-based modeling (TBM) and ab initio approaches. TBM involves aligning the target sequence to known structures and using these templates to build a model, while ab initio methods predict the structure from first principles without the use of templates. Early studies demonstrated the effectiveness of TBM in cases where homologous structures were available, but the accuracy was limited when no suitable templates could be found. Ab initio methods, on the other hand, faced significant challenges due to the vast conformational space and the computational cost of sampling it. The introduction of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction. Deep learning models, particularly those based on neural networks, have shown remarkable success in predicting protein structures with high accuracy. One of the most notable achievements is the development of AlphaFold by DeepMind, which achieved unprecedented accuracy in the CASP13 and CASP14 competitions. AlphaFold uses a combination of multiple sequence alignments, co-evolutionary information, and deep neural networks to predict the 3D structure of proteins. The success of AlphaFold has not only validated the potential of deep learning in structural biology but also set a new standard for the field. In addition to single protein chains, the prediction of protein complexes has gained increasing attention. Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in various biological processes, and understanding these interactions is essential for functional and therapeutic studies. CAPRI, a community-wide experiment similar to CASP, focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions and complexes. Early CAPRI results showed that the accuracy of complex prediction was generally lower compared to single chain prediction, primarily due to the increased complexity and the lack of suitable templates. However, recent advancements in deep learning have also begun to impact the field of complex prediction. For instance, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promise in predicting the binding interfaces and overall structure of protein complexes. The integration of deep learning into protein structure prediction has not only improved the accuracy of models but also accelerated the pace of discovery. Traditional methods often required extensive manual intervention and computational resources, making them less scalable. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can be trained on large datasets and applied to a wide range of targets with minimal human intervention. This has led to the development of web servers and software tools that make advanced prediction methods accessible to a broader scientific community. Despite the significant progress, several challenges remain in the field of protein structure prediction. One of the primary challenges is the prediction of membrane proteins and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are often underrepresented in structural databases. Membrane proteins, in particular, pose unique challenges due to their hydrophobic nature and the difficulty in obtaining high-resolution structures. IDRs, which lack a fixed tertiary structure, are also challenging to predict using traditional methods, and more specialized approaches are needed to accurately model their behavior. Another challenge is the integration of experimental data into computational models. While deep learning methods have shown great promise in de novo prediction, the integration of experimental data such as NMR, cryo-EM, and X-ray crystallography can further enhance the accuracy and reliability of predicted structures. Hybrid approaches that combine experimental data with computational predictions are becoming increasingly popular and are expected to play a significant role in the future of structural biology. The impact of deep learning on the fields of computational and experimental structural biology is profound. The ability to predict protein structures with high accuracy has opened up new avenues for drug discovery, protein engineering, and understanding biological mechanisms. For example, the accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions can aid in the design of novel drugs and therapeutics. Additionally, the prediction of protein complexes can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases and cellular processes. In conclusion, the field of protein structure prediction has made significant strides, particularly with the advent of deep learning methodologies. The success of community-wide blind prediction experiments such as CASP and CAPRI has played a crucial role in driving these advancements. While challenges remain, the continued development of deep learning methods and the integration of experimental data are likely to lead to further breakthroughs in the field. As these methods become more refined and accessible, they will continue to transform our understanding of protein structure and function, opening up new possibilities for research and application.", "References": [{"title": "A decade of CASP: Progress, bottlenecks and prognosis in protein structure prediction", "authors": "John Moult, Robert F.
