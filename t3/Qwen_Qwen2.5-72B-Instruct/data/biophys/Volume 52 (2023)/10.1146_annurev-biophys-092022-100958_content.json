{"Literature Review": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for visualizing biological structures at near-atomic resolution, particularly in the context of viral studies. This method involves the rapid freezing of samples to preserve their native state, followed by imaging using electron microscopy. The recent advancements in cryo-ET have significantly enhanced the resolution and throughput, leading to a surge of in situ virological discoveries. This literature review aims to summarize the key developments in cryo-ET, the high-resolution insights into virus assembly, and the findings from infected eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The resolution revolution in cryo-ET has been driven by several technological advancements. One of the most significant improvements has been the development of direct electron detectors, which have increased the signal-to-noise ratio and allowed for higher resolution imaging. Additionally, the use of phase plates has further enhanced the contrast of weak-phase objects, making it easier to visualize delicate structures such as viral envelopes. These advancements have enabled researchers to study the intricate details of viral assembly and infection processes with unprecedented clarity. Another critical aspect of cryo-ET is the preparation of samples for imaging. Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling has become an essential tool for preparing thin sections of cells and tissues, allowing for the visualization of intracellular structures in their native environment. The combination of cryo-FIB milling with cryo-ET has enabled the study of viral interactions within the complex cellular milieu, providing insights into the mechanisms of viral entry, replication, and assembly. The application of cryo-ET to the study of enveloped viruses has yielded numerous high-resolution insights. For example, cryo-ET has been used to visualize the assembly of influenza viruses, revealing the dynamic process of viral budding and the formation of the viral envelope. Similarly, the structure of the HIV-1 capsid has been elucidated using cryo-ET, providing detailed information on the organization and stability of the viral core. These studies have not only advanced our understanding of viral architecture but also have implications for the development of antiviral therapies. In addition to enveloped viruses, cryo-ET has been applied to the study of non-enveloped viruses and their interactions with host cells. For instance, the assembly of bacteriophages, such as T4, has been visualized in situ, revealing the intricate mechanisms of viral DNA packaging and capsid maturation. These findings have shed light on the conserved principles of viral assembly across different types of viruses and have provided a foundation for comparative studies. The integration of cryo-ET with other imaging techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy, has further expanded its capabilities. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) allows for the localization of specific proteins or structures within the cell, facilitating the identification of viral components and their interactions with host factors. This approach has been particularly useful in studying the early stages of viral infection, where the precise localization of viral particles is crucial for understanding the infection process. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of cryo-ET in the study of viral infections in eukaryotic cells. For example, cryo-ET has been used to visualize the assembly of herpesviruses within the nucleus of infected cells, providing insights into the nuclear transport of viral components and the formation of viral replication compartments. Similarly, the interaction of viruses with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus has been studied using cryo-ET, revealing the complex interplay between viral and cellular membranes. In prokaryotic systems, cryo-ET has been instrumental in understanding the infection dynamics of bacteriophages. The visualization of phage infection in bacteria has revealed the sequential steps of viral entry, genome delivery, and capsid assembly, providing a comprehensive view of the infection process. These studies have not only advanced our understanding of phage biology but also have implications for the development of phage therapy and biotechnological applications. Despite the significant progress in cryo-ET, challenges remain in terms of sample preparation, data processing, and interpretation. The preparation of high-quality cryo-samples is often labor-intensive and requires specialized equipment and expertise. Moreover, the large datasets generated by cryo-ET necessitate advanced computational tools for image processing and analysis. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued advancement of cryo-ET and its application to a broader range of biological questions. In conclusion, the resolution revolution in cryo-ET has opened new avenues for the study of viral assembly and infection. The combination of cryo-ET with cryo-FIB milling and correlative imaging techniques has provided unprecedented insights into the structural and functional aspects of viruses in their native cellular environments. As the technology continues to evolve, cryo-ET is poised to play a central role in advancing our understanding of viral biology and informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Cryo-electron tomography: A review of the current state of the art", "authors": "J.
