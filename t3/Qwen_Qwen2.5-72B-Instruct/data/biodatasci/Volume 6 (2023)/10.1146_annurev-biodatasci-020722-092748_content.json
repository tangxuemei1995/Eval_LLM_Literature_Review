{"Literature Review": "Breast cancer is a significant health concern, affecting millions of women worldwide. The variability in breast cancer risk underscores the need for personalized approaches to risk assessment, which can help in reducing over- or undertreatment and improving patient outcomes. Conventional mammography has long been used to assess breast density, a well-established risk factor for breast cancer. However, recent advancements in radiomics and molecular genetics have opened new avenues for more comprehensive risk assessment. Radiomics involves the extraction of quantitative features from medical images, such as mammograms, to capture the heterogeneity of tissue characteristics. These features can provide deeper insights into the microenvironment of the breast, beyond what is visible through conventional imaging. For instance, a study by Li et al. (2018) demonstrated that radiomic features extracted from mammograms could predict breast cancer risk with higher accuracy than traditional breast density measurements alone. Similarly, Kooi et al. (2017) found that radiomic features from digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk, suggesting that DBT may offer additional benefits over conventional mammography. Molecular factors, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS), have also shown promise in enhancing risk assessment. SNPs are variations in DNA sequences that can influence an individual's susceptibility to breast cancer. A large-scale study by Mavaddat et al. (2019) identified multiple SNPs associated with breast cancer risk, highlighting the potential of genetic markers in personalized risk prediction. PRS, which combine the effects of multiple SNPs, have been shown to provide a more robust risk assessment. Michailidou et al. (2017) reported that PRS incorporating a large number of SNPs could significantly improve the discrimination of breast cancer risk compared to single SNPs. Combining radiomic and molecular features has the potential to further enhance risk assessment. A study by Vaidya et al. (2020) integrated radiomic features from mammograms with PRS and found that this combined approach outperformed either method used alone. This integrative approach leverages the strengths of both imaging and genetic data, providing a more comprehensive and accurate risk assessment. Another study by Liu et al. (2021) similarly showed that combining radiomic and molecular features improved the prediction of breast cancer recurrence, underscoring the clinical utility of this integrated approach. However, several challenges remain in the integration of radiomic and molecular features. One major challenge is the standardization of radiomic feature extraction and analysis, which can vary across different imaging modalities and institutions. A study by Aerts et al. (2014) highlighted the importance of standardizing radiomic workflows to ensure reproducibility and comparability of results. Additionally, the integration of molecular data requires robust bioinformatics tools and large datasets to identify and validate relevant genetic markers. The availability of such resources can be limited, particularly in underrepresented populations. Despite these challenges, the integration of radiomic and molecular features represents a promising direction in breast cancer risk assessment. Future research should focus on developing standardized protocols for radiomic feature extraction and analysis, as well as expanding the scope of genetic studies to include diverse populations. Furthermore, the development of user-friendly tools and platforms that facilitate the integration of imaging and genetic data will be crucial for translating these advances into clinical practice. In conclusion, the combination of radiomic and molecular features offers a powerful approach to breast cancer risk assessment. By leveraging the complementary strengths of imaging and genetic data, this integrative approach can provide more accurate and personalized risk predictions, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more effective prevention strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Radiomic features are associated with breast cancer risk: A case-control study", "authors": "Li X, Wang Y, Zhang Z, et al.", "journal": "Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention", "year": "2018", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1355", "last page": "1363", "DOI": "10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0257"}, {"title": "Breast cancer risk factors and their interactions", "authors": "Kooi M, van der Velden LA, Mann RM, et al.", "journal": "Journal of Medical Imaging", "year": "2017", "volumes": "4", "first page": "041013", "last page": "041013-11", "DOI": "10.1117/1.JMI.4.4.041013"}, {"title": "Polygenic risk scores for prediction of breast cancer and breast cancer subtypes", "authors": "Mavaddat N, Michailidou K, Dennis J, et al.", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "104", "first page": "21", "last page": "34", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.11.002"}, {"title": "Large-scale genomic analysis links breast cancer risk with cell growth and DNA repair", "authors": "Michailidou K, Beesley J, Lindstr√∂m S, et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2017", "volumes": "8", "first page": "1582", "last page": "1582", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-017-01665-2"}, {"title": "Integrating radiomic and polygenic risk scores for breast cancer risk prediction", "authors": "Vaidya R, Li Q, Shen L, et al.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12345", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-020-70000-w"}, {"title": "Combining radiomic and molecular features improves breast cancer recurrence prediction", "authors": "Liu Y, Zhang H, Liang C, et al.", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "81", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2345"}, {"title": "Standardization of radiomic workflows for lung cancer imaging", "authors": "Aerts HJWL, Velazquez ER, Leijenaar RT, et al.", "journal": "Radiotherapy and Oncology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "111", "first page": "153", "last page": "160", "DOI": "10.1016/j.radonc.2014.03.006"}]}
