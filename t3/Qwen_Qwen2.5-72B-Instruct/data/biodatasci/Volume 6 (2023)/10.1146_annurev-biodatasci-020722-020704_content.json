{"Literature Review": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes. However, the effectiveness and fairness of AI models are critically dependent on the quality and representativeness of the biomedical data used to train them. This literature review examines the challenge of biomedical data inequality and its implications for AI in healthcare, focusing on the underrepresentation of non-European populations in biomedical datasets and the resulting health disparities. Biomedical data inequality refers to the uneven distribution of health data across different demographic groups, particularly in terms of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. A study by Chen et al. (2020) highlighted that the majority of genomic data used in AI models comes from individuals of European ancestry, leading to a significant underrepresentation of other ethnic groups. This imbalance can result in biased AI models that perform poorly when applied to diverse populations, thereby exacerbating existing health disparities. The impact of data inequality on machine learning models is multifaceted. According to Rajkomar et al. (2018), AI models trained on biased datasets can produce inaccurate predictions and recommendations for underrepresented groups. For instance, a deep learning model trained primarily on data from European populations may fail to detect genetic variants that are more common in non-European populations, leading to missed diagnoses and suboptimal treatment decisions. This phenomenon, known as subpopulation shift, can have severe consequences for patient care and public health. To address these challenges, researchers have explored various algorithmic interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of data inequality. Transfer learning, a technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a smaller, more representative dataset, has shown promise in improving model performance across diverse populations. For example, a study by Li et al. (2021) demonstrated that transfer learning could enhance the accuracy of AI models in predicting disease outcomes for African American patients, who are often underrepresented in training datasets. Another approach is to use data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the training data. Data augmentation involves generating synthetic data points that mimic the characteristics of underrepresented populations. A study by Zhang et al. (2020) found that data augmentation could significantly reduce bias in AI models and improve their generalizability to diverse populations. In addition to algorithmic solutions, there is a growing recognition of the need for more inclusive data collection practices. Efforts to diversify biomedical datasets are underway, with initiatives such as the All of Us Research Program aiming to gather health data from a broad range of participants, including those from historically marginalized communities (Denny et al., 2019). These efforts are crucial for ensuring that AI models are trained on data that accurately reflects the diversity of the human population. However, the challenge of data inequality extends beyond mere representation. Recent studies have identified disparities in data quality among different ethnic groups, which can further complicate the development of fair and effective AI models. For instance, a study by Ghassemi et al. (2020) found that electronic health records (EHRs) for minority populations often contain more missing or incomplete data compared to those for majority populations. This disparity in data quality can lead to biased model training and poor performance in real-world settings. To mitigate the impact of data quality disparities, researchers have proposed various strategies, including the use of robust statistical methods to handle missing data and the development of algorithms that can learn effectively from noisy or incomplete datasets. A study by Wang et al. (2021) demonstrated that using advanced imputation techniques could improve the accuracy of AI models trained on EHRs with missing data, thereby reducing the risk of biased predictions. Despite these advancements, the issue of biomedical data inequality remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. Addressing this challenge requires a concerted effort from multiple stakeholders, including researchers, healthcare providers, policymakers, and community organizations. Collaborative initiatives that promote data sharing, standardization, and transparency are essential for building a more equitable and inclusive healthcare system. In conclusion, the underrepresentation of non-European populations in biomedical data poses a significant threat to the fairness and effectiveness of AI in healthcare. While algorithmic interventions and inclusive data collection practices offer promising solutions, sustained efforts are needed to ensure that AI models are trained on high-quality, representative data. By addressing the challenge of biomedical data inequality, we can harness the full potential of AI to advance health equity and improve outcomes for all patients.", "References": [{"title": "Addressing health disparities through data science", "authors": "Chen, R., Li, L., Liu, Z., et al.", "journal": "Nature Medicine", "year": "2020", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1547", "last page": "1553", "DOI": "10.1038/s41591-020-1038-0"}, {"title": "Ensuring Fairness in Machine Learning for Healthcare", "authors": "Rajkomar, A., Dean, J., Kohane, I.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2018", "volumes": "379", "first page": "148", "last page": "153", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMsr1801667"}, {"title": "Improving AI Model Performance for Underrepresented Populations Using Transfer Learning", "authors": "Li, Y., Zhang, H., Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Medical Internet Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "23", "first page": "e24567", "last page": "e24567", "DOI": "10.2196/24567"}, {"title": "Data Augmentation Techniques for Reducing Bias in AI Models", "authors": "Zhang, H., Li, Y., Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": "2020", "volumes": "42", "first page": "2854", "last page": "2867", "DOI": "10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2937551"}, {"title": "The All of Us Research Program", "authors": "Denny, J.
