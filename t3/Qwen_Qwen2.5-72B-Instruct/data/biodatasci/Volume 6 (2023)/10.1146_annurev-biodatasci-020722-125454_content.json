{"Literature Review": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been estimated to affect at least 1 in 44 children, highlighting the urgent need for effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Traditional approaches to diagnosing and managing ASD often involve labor-intensive and subjective clinical assessments, which can lead to significant delays in diagnosis and treatment. However, recent advancements in data science and machine learning offer promising solutions to these challenges by providing objective, scalable, and efficient methods for identifying and managing ASD.", "References": [{"title": "Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years â€” Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2014", "authors": "Baio, J., Wiggins, L., Christensen, D.
