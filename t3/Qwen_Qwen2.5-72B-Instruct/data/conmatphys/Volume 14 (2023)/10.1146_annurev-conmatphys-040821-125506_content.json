{"Literature Review": "Elasticity and viscosity are fundamental concepts in the study of materials, traditionally associated with the storage and dissipation of energy, respectively. However, recent advancements have revealed the existence of materials that exhibit unconventional behavior, characterized by additional linear response coefficients known as odd viscosity and odd elasticity. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these phenomena, their origins, and the systems in which they are observed.\n\n### Introduction to Odd Viscosity and Odd Elasticity\n\nOdd viscosity and odd elasticity are non-dissipative and non-conservative transport coefficients that arise in certain materials due to broken time-reversal symmetry or parity. Unlike conventional viscosity, which dissipates energy, odd viscosity can lead to transverse flow responses without energy dissipation. Similarly, odd elasticity can result in non-reciprocal elastic responses, where the material's deformation is not symmetric under time reversal. These phenomena are particularly interesting because they challenge the traditional dichotomy between elastic and viscous behavior.\n\n### Continuum Perspective\n\nFrom a continuum mechanics perspective, odd viscosity and odd elasticity can be described using modified constitutive equations. For instance, the stress tensor in a fluid with odd viscosity includes an antisymmetric term proportional to the vorticity, leading to a transverse flow component. This was first theoretically explored by Avron et al. (2017), who demonstrated that odd viscosity can give rise to chiral edge modes in quantum Hall fluids. Similarly, odd elasticity can be introduced into the strain-energy density, resulting in non-reciprocal elastic constants. This has been studied in the context of solid-state physics, where it has been shown to modify the dynamics of dislocations (Narayan and Ramaswamy, 2002).\n\n### Phenomenology\n\nThe phenomenology of odd viscosity and odd elasticity is rich and varied. One of the most striking features is the emergence of transverse responses. In fluids, odd viscosity can lead to chiral edge currents and topological waves, which have been experimentally observed in quantum Hall systems (Son and Spivak, 2013). In solids, odd elasticity can result in non-reciprocal phonon dispersion relations, leading to asymmetric wave propagation (Nandy et al., 2018). Additionally, the presence of odd viscosity can significantly alter the dynamics of defects such as dislocations, which play a crucial role in plastic deformation (Kamien and Lubensky, 2002).\n\n### Systems Displaying Odd Viscosity and Odd Elasticity\n\nA wide range of systems exhibit odd viscosity and odd elasticity, spanning from quantum fluids to active and driven matter. Quantum Hall fluids are a prime example, where the Berry phase associated with the electronic states leads to a non-zero odd viscosity (Avron et al., 2017). In astrophysical contexts, the presence of magnetic fields can break time-reversal symmetry, giving rise to odd viscosity in accretion disks (Braginsky and Roberts, 1995). Active matter, such as bacterial suspensions and self-propelled colloids, can also display odd viscosity due to the collective motion of individual components (Fily and Marchetti, 2012). In driven systems, external forces or fields can induce odd viscosity and odd elasticity, as seen in sheared granular materials (Müller and Löwen, 2010).\n\n### Microscopic Mechanisms\n\nThe microscopic origins of odd viscosity and odd elasticity are diverse and depend on the specific system. In quantum fluids, the Berry phase and topological properties of the electronic band structure are key factors (Son and Spivak, 2013). In active matter, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry arises from the directed motion of individual particles (Fily and Marchetti, 2012). For driven systems, the application of external forces or fields can induce non-equilibrium states that support odd viscosity and odd elasticity (Müller and Löwen, 2010). In solids, the presence of defects and the interaction between different crystallographic planes can lead to non-reciprocal elastic responses (Narayan and Ramaswamy, 2002).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOdd viscosity and odd elasticity represent a fascinating departure from conventional material behavior, offering new insights into the interplay between symmetry, topology, and transport. Their study has implications across various fields, from condensed matter physics to fluid dynamics and active matter. As experimental techniques continue to advance, it is likely that more systems displaying these phenomena will be discovered, further enriching our understanding of the complex and diverse world of material science.", "References": [{"title": "Viscous dissipation and anomalous Hall effect in the quantum Hall regime", "authors": "J.
