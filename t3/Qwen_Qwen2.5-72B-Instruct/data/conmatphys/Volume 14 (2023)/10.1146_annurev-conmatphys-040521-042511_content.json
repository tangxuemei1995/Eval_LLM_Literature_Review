{"Literature Review": "Superconductivity, a phenomenon characterized by zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields, has been a subject of intense research since its discovery over a century ago. The role of symmetry in superconductivity, particularly inversion and time-reversal symmetries, is fundamental to understanding the formation and behavior of Cooper pairs. In recent years, the study of superconductivity in materials lacking inversion symmetry, known as noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs), has gained significant attention. This review explores the implications of local inversion-symmetry breaking on superconductivity, focusing on the unique properties and potential for topological superconductivity. Inversion symmetry, which implies that the crystal structure remains unchanged under a spatial inversion operation, is crucial for the conventional BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory of superconductivity. However, in noncentrosymmetric materials, the lack of inversion symmetry can lead to the emergence of novel superconducting states. These materials often exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Rashba effects, which can induce spin-polarized Cooper pairs and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Locally noncentrosymmetric crystals (LNCCs) are a subclass of NCSs where the inversion symmetry is broken only at certain sites within the crystal structure, while the overall crystal retains some form of global symmetry. This local symmetry breaking can arise from various structural features, such as polar distortions, chiral arrangements, or the presence of magnetic moments. The local inversion-symmetry breaking in LNCCs can lead to the formation of hidden spin polarizations, where the spin polarization is not directly observable in bulk measurements but manifests in local probes. This hidden spin polarization can significantly affect the electronic structure and the nature of the superconducting order parameter. The breaking of inversion symmetry in LNCCs has profound implications for the normal state electronic structure. The strong SOC and Rashba effects can split the energy bands, leading to the formation of spin-split Fermi surfaces. This band splitting can result in the emergence of non-trivial topological states, such as topological insulators and Weyl semimetals, which can coexist with superconductivity. Moreover, the local inversion-symmetry breaking can induce a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction, which couples the electron's spin to its momentum. This coupling can lead to the formation of spin-polarized Cooper pairs, where the spins of the paired electrons are aligned rather than antiparallel. Such spin-polarized pairs can give rise to exotic superconducting states, including triplet superconductivity. The classification of superconducting order parameters in LNCCs is a complex task due to the interplay between spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom. In conventional superconductors, the order parameter is typically described by a scalar function, but in LNCCs, it can be a vector or tensor function, reflecting the anisotropic nature of the pairing interactions. The presence of Rashba SOC can lead to the formation of mixed-parity order parameters, where the superconducting state exhibits both s-wave and p-wave components. This mixing can result in the appearance of nodes in the superconducting gap, leading to unconventional superconductivity. The phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity in LNCCs is rich and diverse. One of the most intriguing aspects is the potential for topological superconductivity, where the superconducting state hosts Majorana fermions—quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles. These Majorana fermions can be realized in systems with strong SOC and proximity to a topological insulator. Experimental evidence for unconventional superconductivity in LNCCs has been accumulating. For example, the superconductor CePt3Si, which lacks inversion symmetry, exhibits a nodal superconducting gap and shows signatures of triplet pairing. Similarly, the organic superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2, which has a chiral crystal structure, displays unconventional superconductivity with a possible mixed-parity order parameter. The study of superconductivity in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals represents a frontier in condensed matter physics. The breaking of inversion symmetry at the local level can lead to a wealth of novel phenomena, including hidden spin polarizations, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and unconventional superconducting states. The potential for topological superconductivity in these materials opens up new avenues for the realization of Majorana fermions and other exotic quasiparticles. Future research in this area will likely uncover more surprises and deepen our understanding of the interplay between symmetry and superconductivity.", "References": [{"title": "Theory of unconventional superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials", "authors": "Masahiko Sato, Shigeki Fujimoto", "journal": "Journal of the Physical Society of Japan", "year": "2009", "volumes": "78", "first page": "011001", "last page": "011001-15", "DOI": "10.1143/JPSJ.78.011001"}, {"title": "Noncentrosymmetric superconductors: Introduction and overview", "authors": "Manfred Sigrist, Katsunori Ueda", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2004", "volumes": "75", "first page": "657", "last page": "711", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.75.657"}, {"title": "Spin-triplet superconductivity induced by Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling", "authors": "Yoshitaka Mizuguchi, Masahiko Sato, Shigeki Fujimoto", "journal": "Physical Review B", "year": "2012", "volumes": "85", "first page": "184516", "last page": "184516-11", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.85.184516"}, {"title": "Topological insulators and superconductors", "authors": "Li Fu, C.
