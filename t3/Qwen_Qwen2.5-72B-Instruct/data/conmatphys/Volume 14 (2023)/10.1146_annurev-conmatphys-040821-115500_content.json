{"Literature Review": "Active colloids represent a fascinating class of self-propelled particles that move through viscous fluids by consuming energy from their environment. These systems have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in fields ranging from biophysics to materials science. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the numerical and theoretical modeling approaches used to understand the behavior of active colloids, focusing on the transition from simple models of active Brownian particles to more complex models that incorporate hydrodynamic and chemical fields.\n\n### Active Brownian Particles\n\nActive Brownian particles (ABPs) are a fundamental model for understanding the basic principles of self-propulsion in active colloids. In this model, particles move with a constant speed in a direction that undergoes rotational diffusion. The dynamics of ABPs can be described by the Langevin equation, which accounts for both translational and rotational motion. The inclusion of potential forces and effective pairwise interactions, such as hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions, is crucial for capturing the collective behavior of these particles (Fily et al., 2012; Redner et al., 2013). These interactions can lead to a variety of emergent phenomena, including phase separation and flocking behavior.\n\n### Hydrodynamic and Phoretic Interactions\n\nHydrodynamic interactions play a significant role in the behavior of active colloids. These interactions arise from the flow fields generated by the motion of the particles and can significantly influence their collective dynamics. For instance, the presence of hydrodynamic interactions can lead to the formation of clusters and vortices in suspensions of active particles (Saintillan & Shelley, 2008). Phoretic interactions, on the other hand, are driven by gradients in chemical or thermal fields. These interactions can cause particles to move towards or away from regions of high concentration, leading to complex patterns of motion (Golestanian et al., 2005).\n\n### The Squirmer Model\n\nThe squirmer model is a widely used framework for studying the motion of microswimmers, such as bacteria and sperm cells. In this model, the swimmer is represented as a sphere with a tangential velocity distribution on its surface, which generates a net flow in the surrounding fluid. The squirmer model can be classified into different types based on the nature of the surface velocity distribution, such as pushers and pullers. Pushers, which expel fluid from their rear, exhibit different hydrodynamic interactions compared to pullers, which draw fluid towards their front (Ishikawa & Pedley, 2007). The squirmer model has been instrumental in understanding the collective behavior of microswimmers and the role of hydrodynamic interactions in their motion.\n\n### Explicit Modeling of Fluid Flow\n\nExplicitly modeling the fluid flow generated by active colloids is essential for a detailed understanding of their behavior. This involves solving the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the equations of motion for the particles. Numerical simulations using lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) and finite element methods (FEM) have been particularly useful in this context. These methods allow for the accurate simulation of complex flow fields and the interaction between multiple particles (Lishchuk et al., 2016). The inclusion of chemical fields, such as concentration gradients, further complicates the modeling but provides a more realistic description of the system (Thakur et al., 2019).\n\n### Motion in Complex Environments\n\nActive colloids often operate in complex environments, such as biological tissues or porous media. The presence of obstacles and confinement can significantly affect the motion of these particles. Recent studies have shown that active colloids can exhibit enhanced diffusion and directed motion in confined geometries (Volpe et al., 2014). Additionally, the interaction with surfaces and other particles can lead to the formation of dynamic structures, such as rafts and chains (Palacci et al., 2013). Understanding these behaviors is crucial for designing active colloids for specific applications, such as targeted drug delivery.\n\n### Microrheology in Active Baths\n\nMicrorheology is a powerful technique for characterizing the mechanical properties of complex fluids. In the context of active colloids, microrheology can be used to study the rheological behavior of active baths, which are suspensions of active particles. Active baths exhibit unique rheological properties, such as shear thickening and negative viscosity, which are not observed in passive suspensions (Scheibel et al., 2017). These properties arise from the active stresses generated by the motion of the particles and can have significant implications for the design of active materials.\n\n### Active Colloidal Engines\n\nActive colloidal engines are devices that convert chemical energy into mechanical work at the microscale. These engines can be designed to perform specific tasks, such as cargo transport or mixing. The design of efficient active colloidal engines requires a deep understanding of the underlying physical principles, including the role of hydrodynamic and chemical interactions. Recent advances in the modeling of active colloidal engines have led to the development of novel designs that can operate in complex environments (Kroy et al., 2018). Machine learning techniques have also been employed to optimize the performance of these engines (Wang et al., 2020).\n\n### Adaptive Responses of Active Colloids\n\nActive colloids can exhibit adaptive responses to changes in their environment, such as variations in temperature or chemical concentration. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop models that can predict and control the behavior of active colloids in response to environmental cues. For example, reinforcement learning algorithms have been applied to optimize the motion of active colloids in complex landscapes (Li et al., 2019). These adaptive responses have the potential to enable the development of smart materials that can respond autonomously to external stimuli.\n\n### Effects of Colloid and Fluid Inertia\n\nThe effects of colloid and fluid inertia on the motion of active colloids have been the subject of recent research. Inertial effects become significant at higher speeds and can lead to non-linear behaviors, such as oscillatory motion and chaotic trajectories. The inclusion of inertia in the modeling of active colloids requires the use of more advanced numerical methods, such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) (Underhill et al., 2019). Understanding the role of inertia is crucial for designing active colloids that can operate efficiently at high speeds.\n\nIn conclusion, the modeling of active colloids is a rich and rapidly evolving field that encompasses a wide range of physical phenomena. From the basic principles of active Brownian particles to the complex interactions in active baths, the development of accurate and predictive models is essential for advancing our understanding of these systems. Future research will likely focus on integrating multiple physical processes and developing more sophisticated computational tools to simulate the behavior of active colloids in realistic environments.", "References": [{"title": "Athermal phase separation of self-propelled particles with no alignment", "authors": "Y.
