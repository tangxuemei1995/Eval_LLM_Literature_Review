{"Literature Review": "The study of fermiology has evolved significantly with the advent of topological metals, which exhibit unique properties due to their nontrivial Berry phase. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of topological metals, focusing on how their properties can be diagnosed through magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations of transport and thermodynamic quantities. The geometry of quantum wave functions over the Fermi surface plays a crucial role in these materials, and a holistic analysis of the oscillatory wave form can reveal various aspects of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. Topological metals are characterized by their robustly nontrivial Berry phase, which is a geometric phase acquired by electrons as they move around the Fermi surface. This phase is a direct consequence of the topological nature of the electronic band structure and can lead to a variety of exotic phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the chiral anomaly. The Berry phase can be probed experimentally through various techniques, including angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillation measurements. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations, are periodic modulations in the electrical resistivity and magnetization, respectively, as a function of the inverse magnetic field. These oscillations arise from the quantization of the electron energy levels in a strong magnetic field and provide detailed information about the Fermi surface topology. In topological metals, the presence of a nontrivial Berry phase can modify the quantum oscillation patterns, making them a powerful tool for diagnosing topological properties. The phase offset of the quantum oscillations is particularly sensitive to the Berry phase. For example, in Dirac and Weyl semimetals, the Berry phase can cause a half-cycle shift in the SdH oscillations, which can be observed as a Ï€ phase shift in the oscillatory waveform. This phase shift is a clear signature of the nontrivial topology of the Fermi surface and can be used to distinguish between different types of topological metals. High-harmonic amplitudes in the quantum oscillations can also provide insights into the topological properties of the Fermi surface. In systems with a nontrivial Berry phase, the amplitude of higher harmonics can be enhanced or suppressed, depending on the specific topological features of the Fermi surface. This can be particularly useful in identifying the presence of multiple Fermi surface pockets and their relative orientations. The temperature dependence of the quantum oscillation frequencies is another important characteristic that can be influenced by the Berry phase. In topological metals, the temperature dependence of the oscillation frequencies can deviate from the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich formula, which describes the temperature dependence in conventional metals. This deviation can be attributed to the nontrivial Berry phase and can provide additional evidence for the topological nature of the Fermi surface. The orientation of the magnetic field relative to certain crystallographic axes can also affect the quantum oscillation patterns. In some topological metals, the magnetic field can induce a reorientation of the Fermi surface, leading to changes in the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes. This can be particularly pronounced in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, where the magnetic field can couple to the spin degrees of freedom and modify the Fermi surface topology. The symmetry class of the topological metal is another factor that can influence the quantum oscillation patterns. Different symmetry classes can give rise to distinct topological invariants, which can manifest as different signatures in the quantum oscillations. For example, in time-reversal invariant topological insulators, the presence of protected surface states can lead to additional contributions to the quantum oscillations, which can be distinguished from bulk contributions. The separation of Fermi-surface pockets in quasimomentum space can also play a significant role in the quantum oscillation patterns. In some cases, closely proximate pockets can arise due to weak spin-orbit coupling, leading to the emergence of a pseudospin degree of freedom. This pseudospin can couple to the magnetic field and modify the quantum oscillation patterns, providing additional information about the topological properties of the Fermi surface. In other cases, two Fermi-surface pockets can touch at an isolated point, which can be a topological band-touching point or a saddle point in the energy-momentum dispersion. At these points, the Berry phase can become singular, leading to the phenomenon of magnetic breakdown. Magnetic breakdown occurs when electrons tunnel between different Fermi surface pockets, leading to a mixing of the quantum oscillation frequencies and amplitudes. This can provide valuable insights into the topological structure of the Fermi surface and the nature of the band-touching points. The nonabelian Berry connection of the Fermi surface can also have significant implications for the quantum oscillation patterns. In systems with a nonabelian Berry connection, the quantum oscillations can exhibit complex behavior, such as the appearance of additional harmonics and the modification of the phase offset. This can provide a rich source of information about the topological properties of the Fermi surface and can help to distinguish between different types of topological metals. Future extensions of topofermiology could explore the effects of interaction-induced Fermi-liquid instabilities and two-dimensional electron liquids. In strongly interacting systems, the Fermi surface can undergo significant modifications, leading to the emergence of new topological phases. The interplay between interactions and topology can give rise to novel phenomena, such as the formation of topological superconductors and the realization of fractional quantum Hall states. Additionally, the study of two-dimensional electron liquids in topological metals could provide new insights into the topological properties of low-dimensional systems and the potential for realizing exotic quantum states. In conclusion, the study of topological metals through magnetic-field-induced quantum oscillations offers a powerful tool for diagnosing the topological properties of the Fermi surface. By analyzing the phase offset, high-harmonic amplitudes, temperature-dependent frequencies, and the effects of magnetic field orientation, symmetry class, and Fermi-surface pocket separation, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the topological nature of these materials. Future research in this area could further explore the effects of interactions and low-dimensional systems, opening up new avenues for the discovery of novel topological phenomena.", "References": [{"title": "Berry Phase Effects on Electronic Properties", "authors": "Di Xiao, Ming-Che Chang, Qian Niu", "journal": "Reviews of Modern Physics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "82", "first page": "1959", "last page": "2007", "DOI": "10.1103/RevModPhys.82.1959"}, {"title": "Topological Semimetals and Topological Superconductors", "authors": "A.
