{"Literature Review": "Public pension funds in the United States play a crucial role in ensuring the financial security of state and local government employees. However, the sustainability of these funds has been a subject of increasing concern due to significant unfunded liabilities. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts (2021), as of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of state and local pension plans were $1.076 trillion. This figure, however, is based on actuarial assumptions that may not fully capture the true financial burden. When market-based valuations are applied, the unfunded liability rises to approximately $6.501 trillion, reducing the reported funding ratio from 82.5% to 43.8% (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2021).\n\nThe discrepancy between the reported and market-based valuations stems from the assumptions used in calculating the present value of future pension obligations. State and local pension funds typically use a discount rate based on expected returns on their investment portfolios, which are often higher than risk-free rates. For instance, the average assumed discount rate for state pension plans was around 7.25% in 2021, significantly higher than the 2.5% risk-free rate (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2021). This practice can lead to an underestimation of the true cost of pension liabilities, as it assumes higher returns without accounting for the associated risks.\n\nThe reliance on high expected returns has driven pension funds to increase their exposure to risky assets, particularly alternative investments such as private equity, real estate, and hedge funds. According to a study by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators (NASRA, 2020), the allocation to alternative investments in state pension funds increased from 15% in 2010 to 30% in 2020. While these investments offer the potential for higher returns, they also introduce greater volatility and uncertainty into the pension fund's performance. The high concentration of alternative investments can exacerbate funding shortfalls during economic downturns, as evidenced by the significant losses experienced by many pension funds during the 2008 financial crisis (Gao & Li, 2019).\n\nMoreover, the underfunding of pension liabilities has broader implications for state and local government finances. The need to make up for funding shortfalls can strain government budgets, leading to reduced spending on other essential services or increased taxes. A study by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA, 2018) found that pension costs have been a growing share of state and local government expenditures, rising from 4.5% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2018. This trend is likely to continue as the aging population increases the number of retirees and the associated pension payments.\n\nThe financial health of pension funds is also influenced by changes in retirement policies and demographics. For example, the trend towards later retirement ages and longer life expectancies has increased the duration and cost of pension obligations. A report by the Urban Institute (2019) highlighted that the average retirement age for state and local government employees has risen from 62 in 2000 to 65 in 2019. Additionally, improvements in healthcare and living conditions have extended life expectancy, further increasing the present value of future pension payments (Social Security Administration, 2020).\n\nTo address the challenges of underfunded pension liabilities, some states and localities have implemented reforms aimed at reducing future obligations. These reforms include changes to benefit formulas, increases in employee contributions, and the introduction of hybrid plans that combine defined benefit and defined contribution elements. A study by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence (CSLGE, 2017) found that such reforms have had mixed success, with some states achieving significant improvements in funding ratios while others have seen limited progress. For instance, Rhode Island's pension reform in 2011, which included a shift to a hybrid plan and an increase in the retirement age, led to a substantial improvement in the funding ratio from 48% in 2011 to 75% in 2021 (Rhode Island Retirement Board, 2021).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of pension reforms is often constrained by legal and political considerations. Many state constitutions and collective bargaining agreements provide strong protections for existing pension benefits, making it difficult to reduce accrued liabilities. A study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (2018) noted that legal challenges to pension reforms have been common, with courts often ruling in favor of protecting vested benefits. This legal environment can limit the ability of policymakers to implement comprehensive reforms and may necessitate more gradual and incremental changes.\n\nIn conclusion, the underfunding of state and local pension plans remains a significant challenge for government finances in the United States. The reliance on high expected returns and the accumulation of risky assets have contributed to the underestimation of pension liabilities and increased the vulnerability of pension funds to economic fluctuations. Addressing this issue will require a combination of financial reforms, changes in retirement policies, and a more realistic approach to discount rate assumptions. Policymakers must navigate complex legal and political landscapes to ensure the long-term sustainability of public pension systems.", "References": [{"title": "The Impact of Alternative Investments on Public Pension Fund Performance", "authors": "Gao, J., Li, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "134", "first page": "567", "last page": "589", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2019.06.005"}]}
