{"Literature Review": "The evaluation of public investments and policies often relies on a single discount rate, which can lead to significant misallocations of capital and substantial welfare costs. This traditional approach fails to account for the differential cost of risk, a critical factor in a world where risk markets exhibit large prices of risk. The asset pricing literature provides a robust normative framework that supports the adoption of risk-adjusted discount rates, particularly in the context of public policy evaluation. The concept of risk-adjusted discount rates is not new. In the corporate finance literature, it has been well-established that the cost of capital varies across different types of projects based on their risk profiles. However, this principle has not been widely applied to public investment decisions. The traditional approach of using a single discount rate for all public projects can lead to suboptimal outcomes, as it does not adequately reflect the varying levels of risk associated with different projects. One of the key arguments for risk-adjusted discount rates is that they better align with the principles of cost-benefit analysis (CBA). CBA is a fundamental tool used in public policy to evaluate the economic efficiency of proposed projects. By incorporating risk into the discount rate, policymakers can more accurately assess the true value of a project, especially in scenarios where the benefits or costs are uncertain. This is particularly important in the context of environmental and social projects, where the outcomes are often highly uncertain and can have significant long-term impacts. The asset pricing literature offers a strong theoretical foundation for risk-adjusted discount rates. According to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the expected return on an investment is a function of its beta, which measures the sensitivity of the investment's returns to market movements. In the context of public projects, the equivalent concept is the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. Projects with higher income elasticity are more sensitive to changes in economic conditions and thus carry higher risk. Therefore, these projects should be discounted at a higher rate to reflect their greater uncertainty. Empirical evidence supports the use of risk-adjusted discount rates. Studies have shown that the prices of risk in financial markets are often high, indicating that investors demand a premium for bearing risk. This suggests that ignoring risk in the discount rate can lead to significant valuation errors. For example, a study found that the use of a single discount rate can significantly overestimate the value of risky projects, leading to inefficient allocation of resources. In the context of environmental policy, the importance of risk-adjusted discount rates is even more pronounced. Climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, for instance, often involve significant uncertainties and long-term risks. Using a single discount rate can understate the value of these projects, as it fails to account for the potential catastrophic outcomes associated with climate change. Risk-adjusted discount rates can help ensure that these projects receive the appropriate level of funding and attention. The practical implementation of risk-adjusted discount rates in public policy is also feasible. Evaluators need to estimate the income elasticity of the project's net benefit, which can be done using standard econometric techniques. This additional step is relatively straightforward and can significantly improve the accuracy of CBA. Moreover, the use of risk-adjusted discount rates can enhance transparency and accountability in the decision-making process, as it provides a clear rationale for the valuation of different projects. Despite the theoretical and empirical support for risk-adjusted discount rates, there are some challenges to their widespread adoption. One concern is the potential for increased complexity in the evaluation process. However, this can be mitigated by providing clear guidelines and training for evaluators. Another challenge is the need for consistent data on income elasticity, which may not always be readily available. Nevertheless, the benefits of more accurate and efficient resource allocation outweigh these challenges. In conclusion, the current practice of using a single discount rate for public investments and policies is inadequate and can lead to significant welfare losses. The asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification for the adoption of risk-adjusted discount rates. By incorporating the income elasticity of the project's net benefit, policymakers can better account for risk and make more informed decisions. The methodology is both theoretically sound and practically feasible, making it an essential reform for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public policy.", "References": [{"title": "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment", "authors": "Franco Modigliani, Merton H.
