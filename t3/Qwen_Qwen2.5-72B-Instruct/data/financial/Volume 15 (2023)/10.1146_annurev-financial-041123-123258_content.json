{"Literature Review": "The principles of financial economics play a crucial role in determining the appropriate discount rates for both public and private sector decision-making. However, governments often diverge from these principles, typically adopting their borrowing rate as the cost of capital. This literature review explores the arguments supporting and opposing this practice, the methodologies for risk adjustment, and the limitations of financial economics in long-term policy decisions, particularly in the context of climate change.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of using the government's borrowing rate as the discount rate is its simplicity and transparency. According to Arrow et al. (2013), this approach aligns with the government's ability to borrow at low rates due to its creditworthiness. However, this method overlooks the risk-adjusted nature of private sector investments, which typically use higher discount rates to account for uncertainty and risk. This discrepancy can lead to suboptimal investment decisions, as highlighted by Weitzman (2007), who argues that ignoring risk can result in overinvestment in risky projects and underinvestment in safer ones.\n\nA fair value approach to discount rate selection is often proposed as a more accurate method. This approach involves estimating the market rate of return on a portfolio of assets that reflects the risk profile of the project. According to Krylova and Krylov (2018), a fair value approach can better align government investment decisions with market realities, thereby improving social welfare. However, implementing this approach requires sophisticated financial modeling and data, which can be challenging for some governments.\n\nAnother argument against using the government's borrowing rate is that it does not adequately reflect the opportunity cost of capital. As noted by Arrow et al. (2013), the opportunity cost of capital represents the return that could be earned on alternative investments of similar risk. By using a lower discount rate, governments may inadvertently favor projects with lower returns, potentially leading to inefficient resource allocation. This concern is echoed by Weitzman (2007), who emphasizes the importance of considering opportunity costs in discount rate selection.\n\nFor long-term policy decisions, such as those related to climate change, the limitations of financial economics become more apparent. According to Gollier (2002), the high degree of uncertainty associated with long-term projections makes present value calculations unreliable. This uncertainty is compounded by the intergenerational nature of climate policies, where the benefits and costs are distributed across multiple generations. As Nordhaus (2013) points out, traditional discounting methods can undervalue future benefits, leading to underinvestment in climate mitigation and adaptation measures. Therefore, alternative decision criteria, such as cost-benefit analysis with adjusted discount rates or non-monetary metrics, may be necessary for long-term policy decisions.\n\nDespite these limitations, most government investments involve shorter time horizons, where the principles of financial economics can be effectively applied. According to Krylova and Krylov (2018), adopting standard approaches to risk adjustment can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government investments. This includes using market-based discount rates and incorporating risk premiums to reflect the true cost of capital. By doing so, governments can make more informed and rational investment decisions, ultimately enhancing social welfare.\n\nIn conclusion, while the principles of financial economics provide valuable insights into discount rate selection, they must be applied judiciously. For short-term investments, a fair value approach can improve the alignment of government decisions with market realities. However, for long-term policies, particularly those involving intergenerational concerns, alternative decision criteria are essential to ensure that future generations are not disproportionately burdened. The ongoing debate on discount rate selection underscores the need for a balanced and flexible approach that considers both economic principles and ethical considerations.", "References": [{"title": "Determining the Social Cost of Carbon for Use in U.S. Federal Rulemaking: A Technical Update of the 2010 Report", "authors": "Kenneth J.
