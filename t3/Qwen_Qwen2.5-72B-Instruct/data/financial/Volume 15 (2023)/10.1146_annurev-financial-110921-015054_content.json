{"Literature Review": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative benchmarks has been a significant shift in the global financial landscape. LIBOR, which served as the primary reference rate for trillions of dollars in financial instruments, was phased out due to its vulnerabilities and the lack of underlying market activity. The academic literature provides a comprehensive overview of the rise and fall of LIBOR, the need for robust benchmarks, and the implications of the new risk-free rate (RFR) regimes, particularly the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States. The history of LIBOR dates back to the 1980s when it was introduced to standardize interest rate calculations in the interbank lending market. Initially, LIBOR was based on the average interest rates at which banks could borrow unsecured funds from other banks. However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed the fragility of this system, as the volume of interbank lending plummeted, leading to questions about the reliability of LIBOR. The subsequent manipulation scandals, where banks were found to have colluded to influence LIBOR for profit, further eroded trust in the benchmark. In response to these issues, regulators and market participants began exploring alternatives to LIBOR. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recommended the adoption of RFRs, which are based on actual transactions rather than subjective assessments. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) selected SOFR as the preferred alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is derived from the overnight repurchase agreement (repo) market, which is highly liquid and transparent. The academic literature has extensively discussed the efficiency benefits of benchmarks. According to Gorton and Metrick, benchmarks play a crucial role in reducing transaction costs and enhancing market liquidity. However, the manipulation of LIBOR highlighted the potential for market distortions when benchmarks are not grounded in real transactions. The transition to RFRs like SOFR aims to mitigate these risks by ensuring that benchmarks are based on observable market data. Despite the advantages of RFRs, some scholars argue that a single-benchmark regime may not be optimal. For instance, credit-sensitive term rates, such as Ameribor and BSBY, offer a different risk profile compared to RFRs. Ameribor, based on the average cost of unsecured funding for small and medium-sized banks, and BSBY, a broad-based prime business lending rate, provide insights into credit conditions that RFRs do not capture. These credit-sensitive rates can be particularly useful for certain types of financial instruments, such as corporate loans and floating-rate notes, where credit risk is a significant factor. The debate over the merits of a single-benchmark versus a multi-benchmark regime is ongoing. Proponents of a single-benchmark approach argue that it simplifies the transition process and reduces the risk of fragmentation in the financial markets. However, critics contend that a multi-benchmark regime can better accommodate the diverse needs of market participants and provide a more complete picture of market conditions. For example, the European Union has adopted a multi-benchmark approach, with Euribor and ESTR (Euro Short-Term Rate) coexisting as reference rates. The academic literature also highlights the challenges associated with the transition to RFRs. One of the key concerns is the impact on legacy contracts that reference LIBOR. The ARRC has developed fallback language to address this issue, but the effectiveness of these provisions remains to be seen. Additionally, the transition to RFRs may affect the pricing and valuation of financial instruments, particularly those with longer maturities. The lack of term structures for RFRs, such as SOFR, poses a challenge for the pricing of term loans and derivatives. In conclusion, the transition from LIBOR to RFRs represents a significant shift in the financial industry. While RFRs offer greater transparency and reliability, the debate over the optimal benchmark regime continues. Further academic research is needed to evaluate the long-term implications of the current policy of entrenching a single-benchmark SOFR regime and to explore the potential benefits of a multi-benchmark approach. This research should consider the diverse needs of market participants and the broader economic context in which these benchmarks operate.", "References": [{"title": "The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR): A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Fleming, J., Ostdiek, B.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Markets", "year": "2014", "volumes": "17", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1016/j.finmar.2013.09.001"}, {"title": "Market Liquidity and Credit Risk", "authors": "Brunnermeier, M.
