{"Literature Review": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has gained significant attention in recent years, both from academic researchers and practitioners. The primary debate revolves around whether shareholder interest in CSR is driven by pecuniary motives, such as abnormal rates of return, or nonpecuniary motives, such as a willingness to sacrifice returns to address various firm externalities. This literature review synthesizes existing research by focusing on seven key tests: (a) costs of capital, (b) performance of portfolios, (c) ownership by types of institutions, (d) surveys and experiments, (e) managerial motives, (f) shareholder proposals, and (g) firm inclusion in responsibility indices. The findings predominantly suggest that shareholders are driven by nonpecuniary motives.", "References": [{"title": "A Meta-Study of the Corporate Financial Performance of Sustainable and Responsible Businesses", "authors": "George Serafeim, Robert G.
