{"Literature Review": "Algorithmic fairness has become a critical area of research, particularly in the context of credit scoring, where decisions can have significant financial and social implications. This literature review synthesizes recent findings on human versus machine bias, bias measurement, and the distinction between group and individual fairness, while also exploring various fairness metrics and their application to the US mortgage market.", "References": [{"title": "Big Data's Disparate Impact", "authors": "Solon Barocas, Andrew D.
