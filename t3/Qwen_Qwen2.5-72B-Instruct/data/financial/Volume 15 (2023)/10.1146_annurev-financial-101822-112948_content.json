{"Literature Review": "The concept of the social discount rate (SDR) is pivotal in economic policy-making, particularly in evaluating long-term projects and intergenerational equity. The SDR reflects the value society places on future benefits relative to present costs. However, the determination of the SDR is complicated by various factors, including incomplete markets, borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. This literature review synthesizes existing research to explore how these factors influence the SDR and its application in policy-making.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in determining the SDR is the presence of incomplete markets. According to Weitzman (2001), incomplete markets can lead to a discrepancy between the market interest rate and the average discount rate in the population. Specifically, when certain market participants are missing, the average discount rate may diverge from the market rate. For instance, constrained borrowers who are unable to participate in financial markets tend to have higher discount rates, leading to an average discount rate that exceeds the market rate. Conversely, the absence of future market participants, such as future generations, can result in an average discount rate that is below the market rate (Weitzman, 2001).\n\nBorrowing constraints play a significant role in this context. Heathcote et al. (2009) argue that borrowing constraints can lead to a higher average discount rate because individuals who face such constraints are more likely to prioritize immediate consumption over future benefits. This can create a bias in the market interest rate, making it less representative of the true social discount rate. Similarly, Krusell and Smith (1998) highlight that borrowing constraints can lead to inefficient resource allocation, further complicating the determination of the SDR.\n\nIntergenerational transfers are another critical factor. Barro (1974) posits that the ability of a government to transfer wealth across generations can mitigate the effects of incomplete markets. By redistributing resources, the government can align the social discount rate more closely with the market interest rate. However, this assumes that the government has the necessary mechanisms and political will to implement such transfers effectively. Chetty et al. (2017) provide empirical evidence that intergenerational transfers can indeed reduce inequality and improve welfare, but they also note that the effectiveness of such transfers depends on the specific design and implementation of policies.\n\nAltruism and the desire for legacy also influence the SDR. Becker and Tomes (1979) argue that altruistic behavior, where individuals care about the well-being of their descendants, can justify a lower social discount rate. This is because altruistic individuals are willing to make sacrifices in the present to benefit future generations. Similarly, the desire for legacy, or the wish to leave a positive impact on future generations, can also support a lower SDR. Dynan et al. (2004) find that individuals who place a high value on legacy are more likely to engage in long-term investments and charitable giving, which can contribute to a lower average discount rate.\n\nIntrapersonal discounting, where future selves discount the past and current selves discount the future, provides a robust argument for using a lower social discount rate. Laibson (1997) introduces the concept of hyperbolic discounting, which suggests that individuals exhibit time-inconsistent preferences. This means that they may overvalue immediate rewards and undervalue future benefits, leading to a higher discount rate. However, when considering the long-term perspective, a lower discount rate may be more appropriate to account for the intrapersonal consistency of preferences over time.\n\nThe literature also emphasizes the importance of legacy utility in justifying a low SDR. Fershtman and Nitzan (1991) argue that the desire to leave a lasting legacy can motivate individuals to invest in long-term projects and public goods. This can lead to a lower average discount rate, as individuals are willing to forego current consumption for the sake of future benefits. Similarly, Gintis (2000) highlights the role of social norms and cultural values in shaping individual preferences, which can further support a lower SDR.\n\nIn conclusion, the determination of the social discount rate is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including incomplete markets, borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. While the market interest rate provides a useful benchmark, it may not always accurately reflect the true social discount rate. Policymakers must consider these factors to ensure that the SDR is set at a level that promotes intergenerational equity and sustainable development.", "References": [{"title": "On the Welfare Significance of National Saving in a Life-Cycle Model with Productive Capital", "authors": "Robert J.
