{"Literature Review": "The selection of appropriate discount rates for evaluating public projects and policies is a critical issue in economic decision-making, particularly in the context of long-term investments such as those addressing climate change. The social discount rate (SDR) plays a pivotal role in determining the present value of future benefits and costs, thereby influencing the allocation of resources and the assessment of social welfare. This literature review synthesizes key findings from recent studies to highlight the theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical considerations involved in the selection of SDRs by governments. One of the primary theoretical considerations is the need to use risk-adjusted discount rates. According to Weitzman (2007), the choice of discount rate should reflect the risk associated with the project or policy. Risk-adjusted rates account for the uncertainty and variability in future outcomes, ensuring that the valuation is more accurate and reflective of the true cost-benefit analysis. This approach is particularly important in long-term projects where risks are more pronounced. For instance, Gollier (2008) argues that the discount rate should decrease over time to account for the increasing uncertainty of distant future events, a concept known as hyperbolic discounting. Practically, the selection of SDRs often involves balancing intergenerational equity and efficiency. Arrow et al. (2013) emphasize that the SDR should reflect the opportunity cost of capital, which is the return that could be earned on alternative investments. However, they also note that this approach can lead to discount rates that are too high, potentially undervaluing future benefits and leading to underinvestment in long-term projects. This is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where the benefits of mitigation efforts may not be realized for several decades. Nordhaus (2017) suggests that a lower discount rate is justified for climate change policies due to the long-term nature of the impacts and the ethical imperative to consider the well-being of future generations. Legal and regulatory frameworks also play a significant role in the selection of SDRs. In many countries, government agencies are required to follow specific guidelines or regulations when choosing discount rates. For example, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides detailed guidance on the use of discount rates in regulatory impact analyses (OMB, 2003). These guidelines often recommend a range of discount rates to account for different types of projects and the associated risks. However, as Hepburn (2006) points out, these guidelines can sometimes be overly prescriptive, leading to the use of discount rates that do not accurately reflect the underlying economic conditions. Philosophical considerations further complicate the selection of SDRs. The choice of discount rate reflects societal values and ethical principles, particularly regarding intergenerational equity. Dasgupta (2004) argues that a zero or near-zero discount rate is ethically justifiable for long-term projects, as it places equal value on the well-being of current and future generations. This perspective aligns with the principle of sustainability, which emphasizes the need to preserve resources and opportunities for future generations. However, this approach can also lead to impractical or inefficient resource allocation, as noted by Stern (2006). The disconnect between common government practices and the principles of financial economics is another significant issue. Many governments continue to use discount rates that are either too high or too low, failing to reflect the true opportunity cost of capital or the risks associated with long-term projects. This disconnect can result in suboptimal decision-making and misallocation of resources. For instance, Newell and Pizer (2003) find that the use of artificially low discount rates can lead to overinvestment in projects with uncertain returns, while the use of high discount rates can result in underinvestment in socially beneficial projects. The articles in this theme provide a comprehensive overview of these issues and offer insights into best practices for selecting SDRs. One common thread is the importance of transparency and consistency in the selection process. Governments should clearly articulate the rationale behind their choice of discount rates and ensure that these rates are aligned with broader economic and ethical principles. Additionally, the use of multiple discount rates to reflect different scenarios and sensitivities can enhance the robustness of the analysis. In conclusion, the selection of SDRs is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical factors. By adopting a principles-based approach and ensuring transparency and consistency, governments can make more informed and equitable decisions regarding the allocation of resources for long-term projects and policies.", "References": [{"title": "On the Welfare Significance of the Market Rate of Interest", "authors": "Martin L.
