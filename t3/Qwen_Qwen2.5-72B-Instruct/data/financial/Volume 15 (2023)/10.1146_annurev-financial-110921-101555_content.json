{"Literature Review": "Climate stress testing has emerged as a critical tool for assessing and managing the macroprudential risks associated with climate change in the financial sector. This literature review synthesizes current research and practices, highlighting key areas where further investigation is needed to enhance the effectiveness of climate stress tests. The concept of climate stress testing involves simulating the impacts of various climate scenarios on financial institutions to evaluate their resilience and potential systemic risks. These scenarios typically include physical risks (e.g., extreme weather events) and transition risks (e.g., policy changes, technological shifts, and market dynamics) (Bolton et al., 2020). Regulators and financial institutions have increasingly adopted climate stress tests to ensure that they are prepared for the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change. One of the primary challenges in designing climate stress tests is the dynamic nature of transition risks. Transition risks are often influenced by policy choices, technological advancements, and market behaviors, which can evolve rapidly over time (Carney, 2015). For instance, the introduction of carbon pricing or the rapid adoption of renewable energy technologies can significantly alter the financial landscape. Therefore, it is crucial to develop scenarios that account for these dynamic elements and their potential feedback loops with the economy (Dietz et al., 2016). Feedback loops between climate change and the economy are another critical aspect that needs to be better understood and incorporated into climate stress tests. For example, the economic impacts of climate change, such as reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs, can exacerbate financial instability (Tol, 2018). Conversely, financial instability can hinder the ability of economies to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation measures, creating a vicious cycle. Research in this area is essential to develop more realistic and comprehensive stress scenarios. Compound risk scenarios, where multiple climate risks co-occur with other types of risks, are also important to consider. For instance, a severe drought could coincide with a financial crisis, amplifying the overall impact on the economy and financial system (Hallegatte et al., 2019). Understanding these compound risks is crucial for developing robust stress tests that can capture the full spectrum of potential threats. The process of mapping climate stress scenarios into financial firm outcomes is another area that requires further research. Existing evidence suggests that various climate-related risks can have significant effects on credit and market outcomes. For example, physical risks can lead to increased default rates on mortgages and business loans in affected regions (Kousky & Shabman, 2016). Transition risks, such as the shift towards a low-carbon economy, can result in stranded assets and credit losses in industries heavily dependent on fossil fuels (Florido et al., 2020). To improve the accuracy of climate stress tests, it is necessary to identify the channels through which plausible scenarios can lead to meaningful short-run impacts on credit risks. Given the typical maturities of bank loans, understanding how climate risks can affect creditworthiness over shorter time horizons is crucial (Batten et al., 2021). Additionally, incorporating bank-lending responses to climate risks is essential. Banks may adjust their lending practices in response to perceived climate risks, which can have broader implications for the financial system (Furceri et al., 2021). Assessing the adequacy of climate risk pricing in financial markets is another important consideration. Market participants' perceptions and expectations of climate risks can influence asset prices and investment decisions, potentially leading to mispricing and financial instability (Cerutti et al., 2020). Research in this area can help regulators and financial institutions better understand how market dynamics can affect the effectiveness of climate stress tests. Finally, the use of market-based climate stress tests, which can be conducted with publicly available data, offers a complementary approach to traditional stress-testing frameworks. These tests can provide valuable insights into market perceptions of climate risks and help identify potential vulnerabilities in the financial system (Bolton et al., 2020). However, they also have limitations, such as the potential for data biases and the difficulty of capturing all relevant risk factors. In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the development and implementation of climate stress tests, several key areas require further research and attention. These include the dynamic nature of transition risks, the feedback loops between climate change and the economy, the importance of compound risk scenarios, the mapping of climate scenarios into financial outcomes, the incorporation of bank-lending responses, the assessment of climate risk pricing, and the use of market-based stress tests. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of climate stress tests and ensuring the resilience of the financial sector in the face of climate change.", "References": [{"title": "The green swan: Central banking and financial stability in the age of climate change", "authors": "Bolton, P., Despres, B., A.
