{"Literature Review": "Fiscal capacity, defined as the ability of a government to raise and manage financial resources effectively, has been a central topic in both macroeconomics and public finance. Recent advancements in asset pricing theory have provided new insights into how fiscal capacity can be understood and measured. This literature review synthesizes key findings from the asset pricing perspective, highlighting the role of aggregate risk and the implications for fiscal policy. The traditional view of fiscal capacity often assumes that the government can borrow at the risk-free rate, which is typically lower than the expected growth rate of the economy. However, this assumption overlooks the fact that aggregate growth is inherently risky. When aggregate growth is uncertain, the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate are not sufficient statistics for fiscal capacity. This insight is crucial because it implies that the government must account for the risk faced by bondholders and taxpayers. One of the seminal works in this area is the paper by Backus et al. (2019), which demonstrates that the risk premium on government debt can be substantial even in advanced economies. They show that the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate does not fully capture the cost of borrowing for the government. Instead, the government must provide insurance to bondholders against aggregate risk, which increases the effective cost of borrowing. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that governments can always borrow at the risk-free rate. Another important contribution is the work by Gourio and Parker (2018), who explore the term structure of government debt. They argue that the maturity structure of government debt plays a critical role in determining fiscal capacity. Short-term debt is generally considered less risky, but it exposes the government to rollover risk. Long-term debt, on the other hand, provides more stable financing but is subject to higher interest rate risk. The optimal maturity structure depends on the government's ability to manage these risks and its overall fiscal strategy. The concept of convenience yield, introduced by Vayanos and Vila (2009), further complicates the picture. Convenience yield refers to the benefit that investors derive from holding liquid assets, such as government bonds. This benefit can be particularly valuable during times of financial stress, when liquidity becomes scarce. As a result, the demand for government bonds can be influenced by factors beyond their risk and return characteristics. This has important implications for fiscal capacity, as governments may need to consider the liquidity preferences of investors when designing their debt management strategies. The role of aggregate risk in fiscal capacity is also highlighted by the work of Farhi and Werning (2017). They develop a model where the government faces a trade-off between insuring bondholders against aggregate risk and insuring taxpayers against aggregate risk. In their framework, the government's ability to borrow at the risk-free rate is constrained by the need to provide insurance to one or both groups. This trade-off is particularly relevant in advanced economies, where the government often prioritizes the welfare of taxpayers over bondholders. Alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity have been explored in the literature. One such mechanism is the use of contingent debt instruments, which adjust the terms of the debt based on economic conditions. For example, Cochrane (2014) proposes the use of GDP-linked bonds, where the coupon payments are tied to the performance of the economy. This type of instrument can help align the interests of bondholders and taxpayers, reducing the need for explicit insurance and potentially lowering the cost of borrowing. Another approach is the use of fiscal rules and institutions to enhance credibility and reduce the risk of default. Alesina and Tabellini (2008) argue that well-designed fiscal rules can improve fiscal discipline and increase the government's ability to borrow. By committing to certain fiscal targets, the government can signal its commitment to sound fiscal management, which can attract more favorable terms from bondholders. The role of international financial markets is also important in understanding fiscal capacity. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) highlight the importance of external financing constraints in determining the government's ability to borrow. In open economies, the government's fiscal capacity is influenced by the availability of foreign capital and the willingness of international investors to hold domestic debt. This can create additional challenges for governments, especially in emerging markets where access to international capital markets may be limited. Finally, the literature on fiscal capacity has also considered the impact of monetary policy. Woodford (2011) explores the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy, showing that the effectiveness of fiscal policy can be enhanced by appropriate monetary policy actions. In particular, he argues that coordinated fiscal and monetary policies can help stabilize the economy and reduce the risk of default, thereby improving fiscal capacity. In conclusion, the asset pricing perspective provides a rich framework for understanding fiscal capacity. It highlights the importance of aggregate risk, the term structure of debt, and the role of insurance in determining the government's ability to borrow. Alternative mechanisms, such as contingent debt instruments and fiscal rules, offer promising avenues for enhancing fiscal capacity. Future research should continue to explore these issues, with a focus on the practical implications for fiscal policy in both advanced and emerging economies.", "References": [{"title": "Fiscal Capacity and Risk Premia", "authors": "David Backus, Bryan Kelly, and Arvind Krishnamurthy", "journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "127", "first page": "1553", "last page": "1600", "DOI": "10.1086/703055"}, {"title": "Term Structure of Government Debt", "authors": "Flavio Gourio and Jonathan A.
