{"Literature Review": "The concept of racist dehumanization is a critical lens through which political scientists can examine the historical and contemporary dynamics of white racial prejudice in the United States. Racist dehumanization involves a series of processes that construct and maintain racial hierarchies by coding certain groups as fully human and others as less than fully human. This review focuses on the dehumanization of Indigenous and Black people, highlighting how these processes have been integral to the practice of race-making and the exploitation and domination of racialized groups. Racist dehumanization has deep roots in American history, dating back to the colonial period. According to Fredrickson (2002), the dehumanization of Indigenous peoples was a foundational aspect of European colonization, justifying land theft, violence, and forced assimilation. Similarly, the dehumanization of Black people was central to the institution of slavery, where they were treated as property rather than human beings (Harris, 1993). These historical processes have left lasting imprints on contemporary racial attitudes and social structures. In the context of Indigenous peoples, dehumanization has been perpetuated through policies and practices that deny their humanity and sovereignty. For instance, the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which forcibly relocated Native Americans from their ancestral lands, was justified by the dehumanizing rhetoric that portrayed them as uncivilized and incapable of managing their own affairs (Perdue, 2003). This dehumanization continues in modern times, as evidenced by the disproportionate rates of poverty, health disparities, and environmental degradation faced by Indigenous communities (Smith, 2015). For Black people, dehumanization has been maintained through systemic racism and institutionalized discrimination. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow laws has created enduring racial inequalities in areas such as education, employment, and criminal justice (Alexander, 2010). Contemporary manifestations of dehumanization include the criminalization of Black bodies, as seen in the disproportionate use of force by law enforcement against Black individuals (Goff et al., 2014). This dehumanization is also reflected in media portrayals that often depict Black people in negative and stereotypical ways, reinforcing harmful racial stereotypes (Entman & Rojecki, 2000). The psychological impact of dehumanization on racialized groups is profound. Studies have shown that exposure to dehumanizing rhetoric and imagery can lead to internalized racism, low self-esteem, and mental health issues among marginalized communities (Branscombe et al., 2003). Moreover, dehumanization can erode the moral and ethical boundaries that normally prevent violence and exploitation, making it easier for dominant groups to justify harmful actions against racialized others (Haslam & Loughnan, 2014). Understanding the role of dehumanization in shaping white racial prejudice is crucial for addressing contemporary racial issues. Research by Esses et al. (2001) demonstrates that dehumanization is a key predictor of prejudiced attitudes and behaviors, suggesting that interventions aimed at humanizing marginalized groups can reduce prejudice. Additionally, recognizing the historical and ongoing processes of dehumanization can inform policy and social change efforts, such as reparations for past injustices and reforms to address systemic racism (Tatum, 2003). In conclusion, the politics of racist dehumanization in the United States is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has shaped the construction of racial identities and the maintenance of racial hierarchies. By acknowledging the historical and contemporary dimensions of dehumanization, researchers and policymakers can develop more effective strategies to combat white racial prejudice and promote social justice. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms of dehumanization and their impacts on both individual and collective levels, as well as identify effective interventions to counteract these processes.", "References": [{"title": "The Dehumanizing Effects of System Justification and Victim Blaming: Implications for Racial and Ethnic Prejudice", "authors": "Nyla R.
