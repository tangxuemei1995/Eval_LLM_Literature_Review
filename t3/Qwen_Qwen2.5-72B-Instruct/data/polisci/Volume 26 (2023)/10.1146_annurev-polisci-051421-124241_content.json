{"Literature Review": "Global climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges of our time, prompting a reevaluation of international energy politics. The push for a clean energy transition, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has opened up new questions and reinvigorated old lines of inquiry in the study of energy politics. This literature review synthesizes existing research to explore the complexities and dynamics of international energy politics in the context of climate change, focusing on the clean energy transition, distributive politics, and the continued relevance of fossil fuels. The clean energy transition is often framed as a necessary shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. However, the transition is not straightforward and is fraught with political, economic, and social challenges. Political scientists and other analysts generally agree on the basic categories of 'winners' and 'losers' from this transition. Countries and industries with significant investments in renewable energy technologies are likely to benefit, while those heavily reliant on fossil fuels may face economic and political disruptions. One of the key areas of consensus is the role of distributive politics in shaping the clean energy transition. The transition will inevitably lead to winners and losers, and the distribution of these outcomes can have significant political implications. For instance, countries with large reserves of oil, coal, and natural gas may resist the transition due to the potential loss of revenue and jobs. Conversely, countries with abundant renewable resources or advanced technological capabilities may advocate for a rapid transition to capitalize on their comparative advantages. However, political science tends to depart significantly from other disciplines in its analysis of the clean energy transition. While economists and physical scientists often focus on technical and economic feasibility, political scientists emphasize the political and social dimensions of the transition. For example, the success of the transition depends not only on technological advancements but also on the ability of governments to implement effective policies and manage public opinion. The political landscape is further complicated by the presence of powerful interest groups, such as fossil fuel companies, which may use their influence to delay or obstruct the transition. The politics of the clean energy transition are also influenced by international relations and global governance structures. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, represents a significant step towards international cooperation on climate change. However, the agreement's effectiveness is limited by its voluntary nature and the lack of enforcement mechanisms. Moreover, the transition is not uniform across different regions and countries, with some nations making more progress than others. For instance, European countries have been at the forefront of the transition, while developing countries may face greater challenges due to limited financial and technological resources. Despite the push for a clean energy transition, the politics of fossil fuels remain a significant factor in international energy politics. Oil, in particular, continues to play a crucial role in the global economy and geopolitical dynamics. The volatility of oil prices and the strategic importance of oil-producing regions, such as the Middle East, mean that the politics of oil are far from over. Furthermore, the transition to clean energy is not happening uniformly, and many countries continue to rely on fossil fuels for a significant portion of their energy needs. The transition to clean energy also raises important questions about energy security and reliability. Renewable energy sources, while environmentally friendly, can be intermittent and dependent on weather conditions. This intermittency poses challenges for grid stability and reliability, which must be addressed through the development of energy storage technologies and grid management systems. Additionally, the transition may create new forms of energy dependence, such as reliance on rare earth minerals used in renewable energy technologies. In conclusion, the clean energy transition is a complex and multifaceted process that involves a range of political, economic, and social factors. While there is broad agreement on the need for a transition, the distribution of benefits and costs, the role of international governance, and the continued relevance of fossil fuels are areas of ongoing debate and research. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the clean energy transition in an age of climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Navigating the Anthropocene: Improving Earth System Governance", "authors": "Frank Biermann, Bernd Siebenh√ºner, Louis Lebel, William C.
