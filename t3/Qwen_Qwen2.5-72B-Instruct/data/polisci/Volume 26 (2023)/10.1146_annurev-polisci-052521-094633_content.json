{"Literature Review": "The field of global health governance has evolved through distinct eras, each marked by unique political dynamics and shifting priorities. This literature review identifies seven key periods, from the era of imperialism to the current context of the 'Great Lockdown' due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each era reflects the changing roles of states, international organizations, and non-state actors in shaping global health policies and practices. The first era, characterized by imperialism and colonialism, saw the establishment of early international health institutions. During this period, European powers used health interventions as a tool for maintaining control over their colonies. The International Sanitary Conferences, held from 1851 to 1938, were among the earliest attempts to coordinate international responses to infectious diseases. These conferences laid the groundwork for the creation of the League of Nations Health Organization in 1920, which later evolved into the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948. The post-World War II period marked the second era, characterized by the rise of the WHO and the United Nations. The WHO played a crucial role in setting international health standards and coordinating global health initiatives. However, the organization's effectiveness was often constrained by the Cold War geopolitical tensions and the limited resources available for global health. Despite these challenges, the WHO led successful campaigns against smallpox and polio, demonstrating the potential for international cooperation in public health. The third era, spanning the 1970s and 1980s, saw the emergence of the primary health care movement. The Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 emphasized the need for comprehensive health systems and community participation in health care delivery. This period also witnessed the rise of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups, which began to play a more significant role in global health advocacy and service delivery. The fourth era, from the 1990s to the early 2000s, was marked by the globalization of health issues and the increasing involvement of private sector actors. The HIV/AIDS epidemic brought unprecedented attention to global health, leading to the creation of new funding mechanisms such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) in 2002. This period also saw the rise of public-private partnerships (PPPs), which aimed to leverage the resources and expertise of the private sector to address global health challenges. The fifth era, often referred to as the 'Golden Age' of global health, lasted from the mid-2000s to the early 2010s. This period was characterized by a surge in global health financing and political attention, driven by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the increased engagement of high-income countries in global health initiatives. The MDGs, adopted in 2000, set specific targets for reducing poverty, improving maternal and child health, and combating major infectious diseases. The success of the MDGs in mobilizing resources and political will for global health was evident in the significant reductions in child mortality and the expansion of antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS. However, the 'Golden Age' also highlighted the limitations of a disease-specific approach to global health. Critics argued that the focus on vertical programs, such as those targeting HIV/AIDS and malaria, neglected the broader health system strengthening needed to achieve sustainable improvements in health outcomes. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2016 further exposed the weaknesses in global health governance, particularly the inadequate preparedness and response capabilities of affected countries and the international community. The sixth era, from the mid-2010s to the present, has been marked by a renewed focus on universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs, adopted in 2015, expanded the global health agenda to include a wide range of health-related targets, including the reduction of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the promotion of mental health. The emphasis on UHC reflects a recognition that access to essential health services is a fundamental human right and a key driver of economic development. The seventh and current era, the 'Great Lockdown,' has been dominated by the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has exposed the deep inequalities in global health systems and the limitations of existing governance structures. The WHO has faced criticism for its handling of the pandemic, particularly its delayed declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and its perceived lack of leadership. The pandemic has also reinforced the centrality of states in global health governance, as national governments have taken the lead in implementing public health measures and distributing vaccines. In conclusion, the politics of global health governance have evolved through distinct eras, each shaped by the changing roles of states, international organizations, and non-state actors. While significant progress has been made in addressing global health challenges, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for continued reform and innovation in global health governance to ensure equitable and effective responses to future health crises.", "References": [{"title": "The Origins of International Health: The Colonial Context", "authors": "Miguel Cueto", "journal": "Social Science & Medicine", "year": "2004", "volumes": "59", "first page": "2237", "last page": "2251", "DOI": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.03.029"}, {"title": "The Globalization of Public Health: The First 100 Years of International Health Diplomacy", "authors": "Ilona Kickbusch", "journal": "Bulletin of the World Health Organization", "year": "2002", "volumes": "80", "first page": "956", "last page": "960", "DOI": "10.1590/S0042-96862002001200014"}, {"title": "From International to Global Public Health", "authors": "David P.
