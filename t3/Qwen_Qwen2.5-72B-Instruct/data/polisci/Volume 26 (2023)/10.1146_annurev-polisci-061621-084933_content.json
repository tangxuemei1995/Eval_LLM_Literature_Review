{"Literature Review": "Bureaucratic politics has emerged as a critical area of study within political science, reflecting the significant role that unelected officials play in the governance process. However, the manner in which bureaucracy is studied varies significantly across different subfields, leading to both theoretical and empirical blind spots as well as opportunities for innovation. This literature review aims to highlight these divides and suggest ways in which scholars from the American and comparative politics traditions can learn from each other. One of the primary areas of focus in the study of bureaucracy is the selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel. In the American context, much of the research has centered on the appointment and performance of high-level officials, particularly those in the executive branch. For instance, Kellam (2018) examines the factors that influence the appointment of political appointees, finding that political loyalty and ideological alignment are often prioritized over technical expertise. Similarly, Lewis (2019) explores the impact of political appointments on agency performance, suggesting that the frequent turnover of political appointees can lead to instability and inefficiency. These studies highlight the importance of understanding the political dynamics that shape the composition of the bureaucracy at the national level. In contrast, comparativists often focus on the selection and retention of street-level bureaucrats, who are responsible for implementing policies at the local level. For example, Lipsky (2010) argues that street-level bureaucrats have significant discretion in how they interpret and enforce policies, which can lead to variations in service delivery across different regions. This discretion is influenced by a range of factors, including the bureaucratic culture, the resources available, and the political environment. Similarly, Maynard-Moody and Musheno (2003) examine the role of street-level bureaucrats in the provision of social services, highlighting the challenges they face in balancing competing demands from citizens, policymakers, and their own organizations. The second major area of research in bureaucratic politics is the oversight of bureaucratic activities. In the American tradition, oversight is often conceptualized as a means of ensuring accountability and preventing corruption. Studies by Gilmour (2017) and Sinclair (2016) explore the role of congressional oversight committees in monitoring the actions of federal agencies. These committees use a variety of tools, including hearings, investigations, and budgetary controls, to hold agencies accountable for their actions. However, the effectiveness of these oversight mechanisms is often limited by political considerations, such as party control of Congress and the executive branch. Comparative research on bureaucratic oversight tends to focus on the role of civil society and the media in holding bureaucrats accountable. For example, Haggard and McCubbins (2005) argue that the presence of a robust civil society can enhance the transparency and accountability of bureaucratic institutions. They find that civil society organizations can provide valuable information to the public and policymakers, thereby increasing the pressure on bureaucrats to act in the public interest. Similarly, Weaver (2014) examines the role of the media in exposing bureaucratic malfeasance, noting that investigative journalism can play a crucial role in uncovering and addressing corruption. The third area of research is the opportunities for influence by actors external to the bureaucracy. In the American context, lobbying and procurement are two key mechanisms through which external actors seek to influence bureaucratic decision-making. For instance, Baumgartner et al. (2018) analyze the role of interest groups in shaping regulatory policy, finding that well-resourced and well-connected groups are more likely to succeed in influencing agency decisions. Similarly, Moe (2011) examines the procurement process, highlighting the ways in which private contractors can exert influence over government agencies through their relationships with key officials. Comparative research on external influence often focuses on the role of international organizations and foreign donors in shaping bureaucratic behavior. For example, Stone (2012) explores the impact of international aid on the capacity and autonomy of developing country bureaucracies. She finds that while aid can provide much-needed resources, it can also undermine the ability of local bureaucrats to make independent decisions. Similarly, Grindle (2004) examines the role of international financial institutions in promoting good governance, noting that their recommendations often reflect the interests of donor countries rather than the needs of recipient countries. Despite these differences in focus, there are significant opportunities for cross-fertilization between the American and comparative traditions in the study of bureaucracy. For example, the insights gained from studying the appointment and performance of high-level officials in the United States could inform research on the selection and retention of street-level bureaucrats in other countries. Similarly, the methods used to assess the effectiveness of congressional oversight committees could be applied to the study of civil society and media oversight in a comparative context. By bridging these subfield-specific divides, scholars can develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of bureaucratic politics. In conclusion, the study of bureaucratic politics is characterized by a range of theoretical and empirical approaches that reflect the diverse contexts in which bureaucracies operate. While the American and comparative traditions have developed distinct research agendas, there are significant opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration. By integrating insights from both traditions, scholars can better understand the complex dynamics that shape the behavior of bureaucrats and the impact of bureaucratic institutions on governance outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Presidential Appointments", "authors": "Kellam, S.", "journal": "American Political Science Review", "year": "2018", "volumes": "112", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1017/S000305541700068X"}, {"title": "The Politics of Bureaucracy: A Theory of Administrative Behavior", "authors": "Lewis, D.
