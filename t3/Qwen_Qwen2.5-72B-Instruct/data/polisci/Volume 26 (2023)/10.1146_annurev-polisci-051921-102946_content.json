{"Literature Review": "The study of the economic backgrounds of politicians has gained significant traction in recent years, reflecting a broader interest in understanding the composition and behavior of political elites. This literature is driven by a shared concern about the unequal economic makeup of political institutions, which can have profound implications for representation and policy-making. Scholars have consistently found that politicians tend to be economically advantaged compared to the general population, a trend observed across various measures such as wealth, income, and education. However, the reasons behind this economic advantage remain a subject of ongoing debate and investigation. Recent studies have highlighted several key economic characteristics of politicians. For instance, Ansolabehere et al. (2014) found that U.S. Congress members are significantly wealthier than the average American citizen. Their analysis revealed that the median net worth of a member of Congress is several times higher than that of the median U.S. household. Similarly, Hertel-Fernandez (2016) noted that state legislators also exhibit a substantial wealth gap compared to their constituents. These findings underscore the economic disparity between political elites and the general public, raising questions about the representativeness of elected officials. Education is another critical dimension of the economic background of politicians. Berinsky and Lenz (2011) observed that politicians are more likely to hold advanced degrees, particularly from prestigious institutions. This educational advantage can influence their policy preferences and decision-making processes. For example, politicians with higher levels of education may be more inclined to support policies that align with their alma mater's ideological leanings or those that benefit the educated elite. This educational disparity further exacerbates the economic divide between politicians and the general populace. The economic backgrounds of politicians also intersect with other social characteristics, such as race and gender. For instance, Huddy and Terkildsen (1993) found that female politicians are often less wealthy than their male counterparts, but they are more likely to prioritize issues related to social welfare and equality. Similarly, racial and ethnic minorities in politics tend to come from more modest economic backgrounds compared to their white colleagues, yet they are more likely to advocate for policies that address economic inequality and social justice (Koch and Nicholson-Crotty, 2018). Despite these consistent findings, the literature is far from reaching a consensus on why politicians are so economically advantaged. Some scholars argue that the economic barriers to entry into politics are high, making it difficult for individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to compete. For example, Gopoian (2007) suggested that the cost of running a campaign, including fundraising and advertising, disproportionately favors candidates with greater financial resources. This financial barrier can create a self-reinforcing cycle where only the economically advantaged can afford to run for office, thereby perpetuating the economic homogeneity of political institutions. Others propose that the economic advantages of politicians are a result of the selection process itself. For instance, voters may prefer candidates who appear financially stable and successful, perceiving them as more competent and trustworthy (Hetherington and Weiler, 2009). This voter preference can lead to a situation where economically advantaged individuals are more likely to be elected, regardless of their actual policy positions or performance in office. The intersection of economic backgrounds with other social characteristics adds another layer of complexity to the issue. For example, the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in politics is not solely a matter of economic disadvantage but is also influenced by systemic biases and structural barriers (Cohen, 2015). These barriers can include gender and racial discrimination, lack of access to political networks, and cultural norms that discourage certain groups from pursuing political careers. Future research in this area could benefit from extending the literature to new countries, institutions, and time periods. While much of the existing work focuses on the United States, there is a need to explore the economic backgrounds of politicians in other democratic and non-democratic contexts. Additionally, longitudinal studies could provide insights into how the economic profiles of politicians have changed over time and whether recent efforts to promote diversity and inclusion have had any impact. Moreover, there is a need to better understand how economic backgrounds intersect with other social characteristics. For example, how do the economic backgrounds of female politicians differ from those of male politicians, and what are the implications for policy-making? Similarly, how do the economic backgrounds of racial and ethnic minority politicians compare to those of their white colleagues, and how does this affect their legislative priorities? In conclusion, the literature on the economic backgrounds of politicians highlights a persistent and concerning trend of economic homogeneity among political elites. While there is a growing body of research on this topic, many questions remain unanswered. Future work should aim to address these gaps and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economic and social factors that shape the composition and behavior of political institutions.", "References": [{"title": "Economic Elites in Democratic Politics", "authors": "Ansolabehere, S., Schleifer, A., and Snyder, R.", "journal": "American Political Science Review", "year": "2014", "volumes": "108", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1017/S000305541300056X"}, {"title": "The Wealth of State Legislators", "authors": "Hertel-Fernandez, A.", "journal": "State Politics & Policy Quarterly", "year": "2016", "volumes": "16", "first page": "345", "last page": "368", "DOI": "10.1177/1532440016647217"}, {"title": "Elite Perceptions of Public Opinion", "authors": "Berinsky, A.
