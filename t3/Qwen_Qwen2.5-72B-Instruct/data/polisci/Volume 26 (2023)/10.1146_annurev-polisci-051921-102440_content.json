{"Literature Review": "Historical Political Economy (HPE) has emerged as a vibrant and interdisciplinary field within political science, combining insights from history, economics, and political science to understand the past, present, and future. This literature review explores the development of HPE, its methodologies, and its contributions to our understanding of political and economic phenomena. The field of HPE can be broadly categorized into three main approaches: understanding the past for its own sake, using history to understand the present, and using history as a setting to explore theoretical conjectures. Each of these approaches has its own set of strengths and challenges, which have shaped the trajectory of HPE research.", "References": [{"title": "Factor Endowments, Inequality, and Paths of Development Among New World Economies", "authors": "Stanley L.
