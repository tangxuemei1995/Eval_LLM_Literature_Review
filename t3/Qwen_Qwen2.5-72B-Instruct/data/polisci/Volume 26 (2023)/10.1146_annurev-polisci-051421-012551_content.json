{"Literature Review": "The study of how local environments, or contexts, influence political behavior has gained significant traction in recent years. This research often intersects with contact theory, which posits that direct interaction between members of different social groups can reduce prejudice and promote positive intergroup relations. However, the scope of this research has expanded beyond traditional social psychology to encompass a broader range of contexts and mechanisms, particularly in lower- and middle-income countries. One of the key areas of focus is the role of neighborhood effects in shaping political attitudes and behaviors. Neighborhoods serve as microcosms where individuals interact with diverse social groups, and these interactions can have profound implications for political outcomes. For instance, studies have shown that living in diverse neighborhoods can lead to increased political tolerance and support for policies that promote equality. However, the relationship between neighborhood diversity and political behavior is complex and can vary depending on factors such as the level of economic inequality and the historical context of the community. Another important dimension of this research is the examination of how built environments, such as urban planning and infrastructure, can mediate the effects of intergroup contact. Built environments can either facilitate or hinder opportunities for interaction between different social groups, thereby influencing political attitudes and behaviors. For example, the design of public spaces and transportation systems can play a crucial role in promoting or inhibiting intergroup contact. In some cases, built environments can exacerbate social divides by creating physical barriers that limit interaction between different groups. The role of computer-based environments, such as social media platforms, has also become a significant area of interest. These digital spaces provide new opportunities for intergroup contact, but they can also reinforce existing social divisions through echo chambers and filter bubbles. Research has shown that exposure to diverse viewpoints on social media can sometimes lead to increased polarization rather than reduced prejudice. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms through which digital environments shape political behavior is crucial for developing effective interventions. In addition to these environmental factors, the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact is another critical area of inquiry. While much of the existing literature focuses on ethnic diversity, the role of socioeconomic status in shaping intergroup relations and political behavior cannot be overlooked. Studies have found that class-based contact can have distinct effects on political attitudes and behaviors, particularly in contexts where economic inequality is high. For example, interactions between individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds can lead to greater awareness of economic disparities and support for redistributive policies. Moreover, the political effects of intergroup contact are not uniform across different types of contexts. For instance, the impact of intergroup contact on political behavior may differ in rural versus urban settings, or in contexts with varying levels of institutional trust and political stability. Therefore, a more nuanced understanding of the contextual factors that moderate the effects of intergroup contact is essential for advancing this research agenda. Future research in this area should aim to integrate insights from multiple disciplines, including political science, sociology, and urban planning, to develop a more comprehensive framework for understanding the political effects of context and contact. This includes greater attention to the mechanisms that underlie the observed relationships, such as cognitive processes, emotional responses, and social norms. Additionally, there is a need for more comparative studies that examine the generalizability of findings across different cultural and political contexts. In conclusion, the study of how local environments and intergroup contact influence political behavior is a rich and evolving field. By developing a typology of forms of context and contact and exploring a broader range of mechanisms, researchers can better understand the complex dynamics that shape political attitudes and behaviors. Future research should also consider the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact and the role of built and digital environments in mediating these effects.", "References": [{"title": "Neighbourhood Ethnic Composition and Attitudes towards Immigrants: A Multilevel Analysis of the Netherlands", "authors": "Egbert Schlueter, Peer Scheepers", "journal": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "year": "2010", "volumes": "33", "first page": "141", "last page": "164", "DOI": "10.1080/01419870903174981"}, {"title": "The Neighborhood Context of Racial and Ethnic Tolerance", "authors": "Mary J.
