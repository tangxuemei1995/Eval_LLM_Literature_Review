{"Literature Review": "The South has long been a focal point in American political development, often characterized by its distinctiveness from other regions of the United States. Recent scholarship has shifted away from the traditional narrative of the South's eventual convergence with the post-New Deal North, emphasizing instead the enduring impact of white supremacy and the region's significant role in shaping national politics and institutions. This literature review synthesizes recent works and the interpretive issues they raise, highlighting two broad pathways of southern influence and the debates surrounding their sources.\n\nOne of the key shifts in the literature is the recognition of the South's persistent commitment to white supremacy. For instance, Crespino (2007) argues that the South's resistance to civil rights reforms and its maintenance of Jim Crow laws were not merely remnants of a bygone era but active and evolving strategies to maintain racial hierarchy. Similarly, Key (1949) noted the deep-seated racial attitudes that underpinned southern politics, a theme that has been revisited and expanded upon in contemporary studies. These works challenge the earlier assumption that the South would naturally align with the progressive trends of the North over time.\n\nAnother significant pathway of southern influence is through its impact on national political institutions and policies. Zelizer (2010) highlights how southern Democrats played a crucial role in shaping New Deal legislation, often ensuring that programs did not disrupt the region's racial order. This influence extended beyond the New Deal era, as southern politicians continued to wield significant power in Congress, particularly through their control of key committees. Recent studies, such as those by Frymer (2008), further explore how southern interests shaped the development of federal policies, including those related to labor and social welfare.\n\nThe concept of authoritarianism has also gained traction in the literature on southern politics. Piven and Cloward (1977) argue that the South's political system exhibited authoritarian characteristics, characterized by the suppression of dissent and the maintenance of elite control. This perspective has been echoed in more recent works, such as those by Klarman (2004), who examines the legal and political mechanisms used to enforce segregation and suppress black political participation. The authoritarian nature of southern politics has been linked to broader national trends, suggesting that the South's influence extends beyond its borders.\n\nDebates over the sources of southern influence have also emerged in the literature. Some scholars, such as Kousser (1974), emphasize the structural factors that have perpetuated southern distinctiveness, including the legacy of slavery and the economic dependence on agriculture. Others, like Perman (1985), focus on the ideological and cultural dimensions, arguing that the South's commitment to white supremacy is deeply rooted in its history and identity. These differing perspectives highlight the complexity of understanding the South's role in American political development.\n\nRecent works on southern regimes have further complicated the picture. For example, Smith (2006) explores the ways in which southern states maintained a system of racial segregation and political exclusion, even as national norms evolved. This has led to debates over the extent to which southern regimes can be considered outliers or whether they reflect broader trends in American politics. Some scholars, such as Crespino (2007), argue that the South's influence is more pervasive than previously recognized, while others, like Zelizer (2010), suggest that the region's impact is more nuanced and context-dependent.\n\nIn conclusion, recent literature on the South in American political development has challenged many of the foundational premises of earlier scholarship. By emphasizing the enduring commitment to white supremacy and the significant influence of the South on national politics, these works provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the region's role. However, the debates over the sources and extent of southern influence highlight the need for continued research and critical engagement with the existing literature. Overcoming the limits of recent works will ultimately require a more integrated and interdisciplinary approach to studying the South's impact on American political development.", "References": [{"title": "Promised Land, Crucible of Struggle: The South since the Civil War", "authors": "James C.
