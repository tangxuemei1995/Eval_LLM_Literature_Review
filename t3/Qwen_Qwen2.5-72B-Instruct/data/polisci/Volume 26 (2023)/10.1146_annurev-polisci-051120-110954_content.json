{"Literature Review": "The intersection of gender and international relations (IR) has been a vibrant and evolving field over the past three decades. Feminist scholars have made significant contributions, expanding the scope of IR to include issues of gender and sexuality. This literature review explores four key areas within the broader field: gender and political economy, gender and security, queer approaches, and feminist foreign policy. Each area is discussed through the lens of recent scholarship, highlighting both enduring themes and emerging trends.\n\n### Gender and Political Economy\nGender and political economy is a critical area of study that examines how economic structures and policies impact different genders. Recent scholarship in this area has focused on the gendered dimensions of globalization, labor markets, and economic development. For instance, Elson (2000) argues that neoliberal economic policies have disproportionately affected women, exacerbating existing inequalities. This is further supported by the work of Kabeer (2005), who highlights the importance of considering gender in the context of economic empowerment and poverty reduction. The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought new attention to the gendered impacts of economic crises, as women have been disproportionately affected by job losses and increased care responsibilities (UN Women, 2020).\n\n### Gender and Security\nThe study of gender and security has evolved from a focus on women as victims to a more nuanced understanding of gender roles and identities in conflict and peacebuilding. Enloe (2000) pioneered this field by examining the ways in which militarization affects women and men differently. More recently, Tickner (2018) has explored the role of gender in peacekeeping operations, emphasizing the need for gender-sensitive approaches. The concept of 'gendered security' has gained traction, recognizing that security concerns are not gender-neutral and that women's experiences of violence and insecurity are often overlooked (Caprioli, 2000). The inclusion of women in peace processes has also been shown to lead to more sustainable peace outcomes (Rehn and Sirleaf, 2002).\n\n### Queer Approaches\nQueer approaches to IR challenge heteronormative assumptions and explore the intersections of gender, sexuality, and power. Puar (2007) introduces the concept of 'queer necropolitics,' which examines how certain lives are deemed expendable based on their sexual and gender identities. This approach has been influential in understanding the ways in which LGBTQ+ individuals are marginalized in global politics. Halberstam (2011) further develops queer theory by critiquing normative frameworks and advocating for a more inclusive understanding of gender and sexuality. Queer IR scholarship has also addressed the role of LGBTQ+ rights in foreign policy, highlighting the tensions between universal human rights and cultural relativism (Pettman, 2014).\n\n### Feminist Foreign Policy\nFeminist foreign policy is an emerging area that seeks to integrate gender equality into the core principles of statecraft. Sweden's 'feminist foreign policy' (FFP) has been a notable example, emphasizing gender equality, human rights, and peace (Lombard, 2016). This approach has inspired other countries to adopt similar policies, although the implementation and impact of FFP remain subjects of debate. Critics argue that FFP can be co-opted by states to advance their own interests, while supporters contend that it represents a significant step towards more equitable global governance (True, 2012). The effectiveness of FFP in addressing gender-based violence and promoting women's leadership in international organizations is an ongoing area of research (Hudson and Leidl, 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the study of gender and IR continues to evolve, reflecting both the enduring challenges and the promising developments in the field. By examining gender and political economy, gender and security, queer approaches, and feminist foreign policy, this literature review underscores the importance of integrating gender perspectives into all aspects of global politics. Future research should continue to push the boundaries of traditional IR theories and methods, ensuring that the voices and experiences of marginalized groups are heard and valued.", "References": [{"title": "Gender mainstreaming in practice: Lessons from the European Union", "authors": "Elson, D.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "2000", "volumes": "6", "first page": "37", "last page": "58", "DOI": "10.1080/135457000337734"}, {"title": "Gender equality and women’s empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1", "authors": "Kabeer, N.", "journal": "Gender & Development", "year": "2005", "volumes": "13", "first page": "13", "last page": "24", "DOI": "10.1080/13552070512331332980"}, {"title": "The manly ways of war", "authors": "Enloe, C.", "journal": "Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "25", "DOI": "10.1525/california/9780520220713.003.0001"}, {"title": "Gendered peace: Women, war, and the reconstruction of Iraq", "authors": "Tickner, J.
