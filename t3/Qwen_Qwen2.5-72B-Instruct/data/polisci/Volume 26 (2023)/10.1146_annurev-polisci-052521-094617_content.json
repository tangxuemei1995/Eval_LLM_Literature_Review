{"Literature Review": "Political inequality in rich democracies has become a significant concern, particularly as it pertains to participation and representation. This review synthesizes existing literature to explore the dynamics of political inequality, focusing on how rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions affect participation and representation. Participation is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance, yet it is often skewed towards individuals with greater resources. Research consistently shows that people with fewer individual resources, such as lower income and education levels, participate much less in political activities compared to those with more resources. This disparity is exacerbated by rising income inequality, which can further marginalize already disadvantaged groups. The role of collective organizations, particularly trade unions, in mitigating these inequalities cannot be overstated. Trade unions have historically played a crucial role in mobilizing workers and advocating for their interests. However, the weakening of trade unions in many rich democracies has led to a decline in their ability to counteract the negative effects of rising income inequality on political participation. In terms of representation, the literature reveals a similar pattern of bias. Substantive representation refers to the extent to which the policies and decisions made by elected officials align with the preferences of different social groups. Studies have shown that the opinions of decision-makers are more congruent with those of the better-off segments of society. Descriptive representation, which involves the presence of diverse social groups in political institutions, is also influenced by political inequality. While descriptive representation can enhance substantive representation by bringing diverse perspectives into the decision-making process, it is often insufficient on its own. The social distance between rulers and ruled is another critical factor in understanding political inequality. As the social and economic distance between political elites and the general population increases, the ability of representatives to accurately understand and represent the interests of their constituents diminishes. Moreover, the media and political communication play a significant role in shaping public opinion and political engagement. Media coverage tends to focus more on the issues and perspectives of the affluent, which can reinforce existing biases and limit the visibility of marginalized voices. In conclusion, political inequality in rich democracies is a multifaceted issue that affects both participation and representation. Rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions exacerbate disparities in political engagement, while the social distance between rulers and ruled and media biases further skew the political landscape in favor of higher-status groups. Addressing these inequalities requires a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening collective organizations, promoting inclusive political institutions, and ensuring balanced media representation. Only through such efforts can rich democracies hope to achieve a more equitable and representative political system.", "References": [{"title": "Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics", "authors": "Sidney Verba, Kay Lehman Schlozman, Henry E.
