{"Literature Review": "The study of power sharing in authoritarian regimes has gained significant traction in recent years, as scholars seek to understand the mechanisms and strategies that enable rulers to maintain stability while accommodating potential challengers. Power sharing in authoritarian contexts is more complex than mere distribution of resources; it involves the establishment of credible enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance from both the ruler and the challenger. This literature review synthesizes key concepts, mechanisms, and strategies that have been identified in the existing body of research on authoritarian power sharing.\n\nOne of the foundational concepts in this area is the idea that power sharing is not just about dividing spoils but also about reallocating power to make it costly for the ruler to renege on agreements (Hicken & Kuhonta, 2013). This reallocation can take various forms, including institutional concessions such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers (Geddes, 2003). These institutional arrangements are crucial because they help to mitigate the commitment problem, which is a central challenge in authoritarian power sharing. The commitment problem arises when the ruler has an incentive to renege on the agreement once the challenger has been pacified, leading to a breakdown of the power-sharing arrangement (Fearon, 1995).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of these institutional mechanisms is often constrained by the weakness of institutions in many authoritarian regimes. Weak institutions create a Catch-22 situation where the very mechanisms needed to enforce power-sharing agreements are often the ones that are least reliable (Levitsky & Way, 2010). In such contexts, self-enforcing power sharing becomes a viable alternative. Self-enforcing power sharing relies on the coercive capabilities of the challenger to defend their share of the spoils. For example, military or paramilitary groups can use their force to ensure that the ruler adheres to the agreement (Wright, 2014). However, this coercive capability also poses a risk to the ruler, as it can be leveraged to overthrow them entirely (Svolik, 2012).\n\nThis double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator will only share power under specific conditions. First, the challenger must have the ability to credibly punish the ruler if they renege on the agreement. Second, the challenger must be willing to forgo taking actions that could harm the ruler, even if they have the means to do so. Finally, the ruler must be willing to accept a reduction in their power and rents (Wright, 2014). These conditions highlight the delicate balance that must be struck in authoritarian power-sharing arrangements.\n\nEmpirical studies have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of power sharing in authoritarian regimes. For instance, Hicken and Kuhonta (2013) examine the role of local elites in power-sharing arrangements in Southeast Asia, demonstrating how these elites can act as third-party enforcers to ensure compliance. Similarly, Svolik (2012) analyzes the role of the military in power-sharing agreements, showing how military leaders can use their coercive power to influence political outcomes. Wright (2014) provides a comparative analysis of power-sharing arrangements in Africa, highlighting the importance of credible commitment mechanisms in maintaining stability.\n\nTheoretical models have also contributed to our understanding of authoritarian power sharing. Fearon (1995) develops a game-theoretic model that explains why commitment problems arise and how they can be overcome through credible enforcement mechanisms. Geddes (2003) extends this framework by incorporating the role of institutions in facilitating or hindering power sharing. Levitsky and Way (2010) offer a comprehensive analysis of the institutional weaknesses that undermine the effectiveness of power-sharing arrangements in authoritarian regimes.\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on authoritarian power sharing underscores the complexity of these arrangements and the importance of credible enforcement mechanisms. While institutional concessions and coercive capabilities can facilitate power sharing, the success of these arrangements depends on a delicate balance of incentives and constraints. Future research should continue to explore the conditions under which power sharing is most likely to succeed and the long-term implications of these arrangements for regime stability and political development.", "References": [{"title": "The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups", "authors": "Mancur Olson", "journal": "Harvard University Press", "year": "1965", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Why Parties and Elections Matter: A Study of Dominant Party Systems and Electoral Authoritarianism", "authors": "Andrea Benitez, Steven Fish, Matthew S.
