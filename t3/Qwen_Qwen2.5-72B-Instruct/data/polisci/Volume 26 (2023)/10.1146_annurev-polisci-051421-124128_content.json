{"Literature Review": "Over the past two decades, the study of nonviolent resistance has gained significant traction within the fields of political science, sociology, and peace studies. Nonviolent resistance, characterized by the use of unarmed collective actions such as protests, strikes, and boycotts, has been a focal point for understanding how social movements can achieve their goals without resorting to violence. However, the presence of violent flanks—unarmed collective violence, fringe violence, or organized armed action—within otherwise nonviolent movements has sparked considerable debate. This literature review synthesizes existing research to explore the effects of violent flanks on the outcomes of nonviolent resistance movements. One of the seminal works in this area is the book 'Why Civil Resistance Works' by Chenoweth and Stephan (2011), which provides a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of nonviolent resistance compared to violent resistance. Their study, based on data from 323 major nonviolent and violent resistance campaigns from 1900 to 2006, found that nonviolent campaigns were twice as likely to achieve full success as violent campaigns. They argue that nonviolent movements are more effective because they can attract broader participation, maintain moral legitimacy, and are less likely to provoke harsh repression from authorities. However, the presence of violent flanks complicates this narrative. Davenport and Moore (2008) examined the impact of violent flanks on the success of nonviolent movements and found that the introduction of violence often leads to increased repression and decreased public support for the movement. They argue that violent actions can undermine the moral high ground that nonviolent movements occupy, making it easier for authorities to justify harsher responses. Shapiro and Solis (2014) further explored the dynamics of violent flanks within nonviolent movements. Their study of the Arab Spring movements revealed that while some violent incidents did occur, they were often isolated and did not significantly alter the overall trajectory of the movements. They suggest that the key factor in the success of nonviolent movements is the ability to maintain broad-based participation and unity, even in the face of violent provocations. The role of media framing in shaping public perception of violent flanks has also been a subject of interest. Earl et al. (2004) investigated how media coverage of violent and nonviolent protests influenced public opinion. They found that media outlets tend to give disproportionate attention to violent incidents, which can skew public perception and reduce support for the movement. This finding underscores the importance of strategic communication and media management for nonviolent movements. Another critical aspect is the internal dynamics of movements and the potential for violent flanks to emerge. Schock (2005) analyzed the organizational structures of nonviolent movements and found that movements with strong, centralized leadership and clear nonviolent principles are better equipped to prevent the emergence of violent flanks. He argues that clear communication of nonviolent strategies and the establishment of norms against violence are crucial for maintaining movement coherence. The impact of violent flanks on the international community's response to nonviolent movements has also been studied. Beissinger (2002) examined the role of external actors in the success of nonviolent movements, particularly during the color revolutions in Eastern Europe. He found that international support, including diplomatic pressure and financial assistance, was more likely to be forthcoming for nonviolent movements than for those with violent components. This suggests that the presence of violent flanks can limit the international solidarity and resources available to a movement. The relationship between violent flanks and the duration of nonviolent movements is another area of inquiry. Schock (2006) found that movements with violent flanks tend to have shorter lifespans and are less likely to achieve their goals. He attributes this to the increased risk of repression and the difficulty of maintaining broad-based support over time when violent actions are present. The role of state repression in the context of violent flanks has also been explored. Davenport (2007) analyzed the state's response to different types of resistance and found that states are more likely to use severe repression against movements with violent flanks. This can lead to a cycle of violence and counter-violence that undermines the movement's effectiveness and legitimacy. Finally, the ethical implications of violent flanks within nonviolent movements have been a subject of philosophical debate. Sharp (1973) argued that the use of violence, even in limited forms, can undermine the moral and strategic advantages of nonviolent resistance. He emphasized the importance of maintaining strict nonviolent discipline to preserve the movement's integrity and effectiveness. In conclusion, the literature on nonviolent resistance and violent flanks suggests that while nonviolent movements are generally more effective, the presence of violent flanks can significantly undermine their success. The balance of empirical evidence indicates that organized armed violence reduces the chances of success, while the effects of unarmed collective violence are more ambiguous. Future research should focus on developing greater analytical precision in comparing the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity to provide a more nuanced understanding of these complex dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", "authors": "Erica Chenoweth, Maria J.
