{"Literature Review": "The structure and governance of global supply chains play a pivotal role in shaping social and environmental outcomes at various levels, from the global to the local. The existing literature on supply chain governance has predominantly focused on the actions and impacts of transnational corporations (TNCs), providing a wealth of theoretical and empirical insights into firm- and nation-level outcomes. However, there is a notable gap in understanding the localized social and environmental consequences of networked production, which are influenced by a complex interplay of local, national, and global actors and institutions. This literature review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on supply chain governance and highlight the need for a more multi-level and multi-actor approach to address this gap.\n\n### Dominant Literature on Supply Chain Governance\n\nThe dominant literature on supply chain governance has primarily adopted an actor-centric approach, focusing on the strategies and practices of TNCs. These studies have explored how TNCs exert control over their supply chains through various mechanisms, such as direct ownership, contractual agreements, and relational norms (Gereffi, 2005). For instance, Gereffi (2005) categorizes supply chains into three types—market, modular, and hierarchical—each characterized by different levels of control and coordination. Market-based supply chains rely on arm's-length transactions, modular supply chains involve standardized components and clear interfaces, and hierarchical supply chains are characterized by vertical integration or tight control over suppliers.\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that the governance structure of supply chains significantly influences firm performance and competitive advantage. For example, Christopher (2016) argues that effective supply chain management can lead to cost reductions, improved quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction. Similarly, Lee and Billington (1992) emphasize the importance of information sharing and collaboration among supply chain partners to achieve operational efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nHowever, the focus on firm-level outcomes has often overshadowed the broader social and environmental implications of supply chain governance. While some studies have examined the environmental impact of supply chains, such as carbon emissions and resource depletion (Seuring and Müller, 2008), the localized social and environmental outcomes remain underexplored. Seuring and Müller (2008) highlight the need for integrating environmental considerations into supply chain management, but their analysis is primarily at the firm level.\n\n### Local Social and Environmental Outcomes\n\nThe localized social and environmental outcomes of supply chain governance are shaped by a multitude of factors, including local labor conditions, environmental regulations, and community engagement. Research by Carmichael and McEachern (2007) underscores the importance of local labor conditions in determining the social impact of supply chains. They find that poor working conditions, low wages, and lack of worker rights are prevalent in many global supply chains, particularly in developing countries. These conditions can lead to social unrest and negative health outcomes for workers.\n\nEnvironmental outcomes at the local level are equally significant. Studies by Sroufe and Klassen (2009) and Zhu and Geng (2013) have shown that local environmental regulations and community pressure can influence the environmental performance of firms within a supply chain. Sroufe and Klassen (2009) argue that firms are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly practices when faced with stringent local regulations and active community engagement. Zhu and Geng (2013) further suggest that the adoption of green supply chain management practices can lead to reduced pollution and resource consumption, benefiting both the environment and the local community.\n\n### Multi-Level and Multi-Actor Approach\n\nTo fully understand the localized social and environmental outcomes of supply chain governance, a more multi-level and multi-actor approach is necessary. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of local, national, and global actors and institutions and seeks to identify the interactions and feedback loops that shape these outcomes. Ostrom (2010) provides a framework for analyzing polycentric systems, where multiple centers of decision-making coexist and interact. This framework can be applied to supply chain governance to explore how different levels of governance—local, national, and global—interact to produce social and environmental outcomes.\n\nA multi-level approach also allows for the identification of potential trade-offs, double wins, and spillovers between social and environmental outcomes. For example, a study by Darnall et al. (2010) found that firms that adopt environmentally friendly practices often experience improved labor conditions as well, suggesting a double win scenario. Conversely, the pursuit of cost efficiency in supply chains can sometimes lead to negative social and environmental outcomes, such as poor working conditions and environmental degradation (Carmichael and McEachern, 2007).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the existing literature on supply chain governance has provided valuable insights into firm- and nation-level outcomes, there is a need to extend this research to the local level. A multi-level and multi-actor approach can help us better understand the localized social and environmental consequences of networked production and identify potential trade-offs and synergies. Future research should focus on developing frameworks and methodologies that can capture the complexity of these interactions and provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners.", "References": [{"title": "Global Production Systems and Third World Development", "authors": "Gary Gereffi", "journal": "Journal of Development Studies", "year": "2005", "volumes": "41", "first page": "158", "last page": "187", "DOI": "10.1080/00220380500086850"}, {"title": "Logistics and Supply Chain Management: Creating Value-Adding Networks", "authors": "Martin Christopher", "journal": "Financial Times Prentice Hall", "year": "2016", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Strategic Analysis of Integrated Supply Chain Management Practices: A Case Study", "authors": "Hau L.
