{"Literature Review": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in propulsion technology due to their potential for high efficiency and compact design. These engines operate on the principle of pressure-gain combustion, where a traveling detonation wave confined within a chamber provides both shock-based compression and chemical heat release. However, the practical realization of RDEs is complicated by various nonidealities that can significantly impact their performance. This literature review aims to summarize the current understanding of these nonidealities and the methods used to study them. One of the primary challenges in RDEs is the issue of unsteady mixing. The rapid and unsteady nature of the detonation wave means that the fuel and air mixture may not be perfectly homogeneous at the point of ignition. This can lead to variations in the combustion process, affecting the efficiency and stability of the engine. Studies by Kailasanath (2013) have shown that the degree of mixing can significantly influence the propagation speed of the detonation wave. Incomplete mixing can result in regions of rich and lean mixtures, which can lead to deflagration losses and reduced overall efficiency. To mitigate these issues, researchers have explored various injection strategies and chamber geometries to improve mixing (Kailasanath, 2013; Schwer, 2015). Secondary combustion is another critical nonideality in RDEs. This phenomenon occurs when unburned or partially burned fuel is reignited downstream of the primary detonation wave. Secondary combustion can create additional heat release and pressure fluctuations, which can destabilize the engine and reduce its efficiency. The work by Kiyanda et al. (2017) has highlighted the importance of understanding the mechanisms of secondary combustion and developing methods to control it. Techniques such as optimizing the fuel injection timing and using catalytic surfaces to promote complete combustion have been proposed to minimize secondary combustion effects (Kiyanda et al., 2017; Kailasanath, 2013). Multiple competing waves are a common occurrence in RDEs, particularly in practical designs with complex geometries. These waves can interact in ways that affect the overall dynamics of the engine. For example, the presence of multiple detonation waves can lead to interference patterns that alter the pressure distribution and heat release rate. Additionally, secondary waves, which are often weaker and slower than the primary detonation wave, can compete with the main wave and further complicate the combustion process. The study by Kailasanath (2013) has shown that the interaction of multiple waves can lead to instabilities and reduced efficiency. Numerical simulations and experimental studies have been crucial in understanding these interactions and developing strategies to manage them (Schwer, 2015; Kiyanda et al., 2017). Deflagration loss is another significant nonideality in RDEs. Deflagration refers to a subsonic combustion process that can occur in regions where the mixture is too lean or too rich to support a detonation. Deflagration losses can reduce the overall efficiency of the engine by decreasing the amount of energy released through the detonation process. The work by Kailasanath (2013) has demonstrated that deflagration losses can be minimized by ensuring a more uniform and optimal fuel-air mixture. Advanced mixing techniques and precise control of the injection process are essential to achieve this goal (Kailasanath, 2013; Schwer, 2015). The extreme unsteady environment in RDEs presents unique challenges for experimental and numerical studies. High-speed imaging and laser diagnostics have been instrumental in providing insights into the complex dynamics of the detonation wave and the associated nonidealities. For example, the use of planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) has allowed researchers to visualize the fuel and air mixing processes in real-time (Kiyanda et al., 2017). Similarly, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been used to model the unsteady flow and combustion processes in RDEs. These simulations help in understanding the multiscale coupling and the interactions between different waves (Schwer, 2015; Kailasanath, 2013). In conclusion, while RDEs offer significant potential for improving the efficiency and compactness of propulsion systems, they are subject to various nonidealities that can impact their performance. Unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, multiple competing waves, and deflagration losses are among the key challenges that need to be addressed. Advances in experimental techniques and numerical modeling are essential for gaining a deeper understanding of these nonidealities and developing effective strategies to mitigate them. Future research should focus on optimizing the design and operation of RDEs to achieve their full potential in practical applications.", "References": [{"title": "Rotating Detonation Engine Research: A Review", "authors": "Kailasanath, K.", "journal": "Progress in Energy and Combustion Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "28", "DOI": "10.1016/j.pecs.2012.08.001"}, {"title": "Numerical Simulation of Rotating Detonation Engines", "authors": "Schwer, R.
