{"Literature Review": "Free surface flows, particularly those involving the breakup and coalescence of drops or bubbles, are characterized by the presence of hydrodynamic singularities. These singularities pose significant challenges for numerical simulation due to the wide range of length scales involved, often spanning several orders of magnitude. This review focuses on the advancements in sharp interface methods, which have emerged as powerful tools for accurately capturing the dynamics of these complex flows. Sharp interface methods are designed to track the interface between different fluids explicitly, ensuring that the physical properties and boundary conditions at the interface are accurately represented. This is crucial for simulating phenomena such as drop breakup and coalescence, where the interface plays a critical role in the flow dynamics. One of the key challenges in these simulations is resolving the thinning of fluid threads or films, which can reach sub-nanometer scales. For instance, in drop breakup, the radius of the fluid thread can thin down to approximately 10 nm, while in coalescence, the thickness of the fluid film separating two drops must fall below 10 nm before the drops merge. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various sharp interface methods, including finite element methods (FEM), boundary integral methods (BIM), and level set methods. Among these, FEM has been particularly successful in achieving high-resolution simulations of free surface flows with singularities. FEM allows for adaptive mesh refinement, which is essential for capturing the multiscale nature of these flows. Another significant advancement in sharp interface methods is the development of hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different techniques. For instance, the combination of FEM with boundary integral methods has been used to simulate the coalescence of drops with high accuracy. In addition to methodological advancements, there has been substantial progress in understanding the underlying physics of free surface flows with singularities. Experimental studies have also played a crucial role in validating the predictions of numerical simulations. The application of sharp interface methods extends beyond fundamental research to practical applications in industries such as inkjet printing and microfluidics. Despite the significant progress made in the development and application of sharp interface methods, several challenges remain. In conclusion, sharp interface methods have revolutionized the simulation and analysis of free surface flows with hydrodynamic singularities. The continued development and refinement of these methods will be essential for advancing our understanding of free surface flows and for their application in a wide range of industrial and scientific contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Coalescence of liquid drops", "authors": "J.
