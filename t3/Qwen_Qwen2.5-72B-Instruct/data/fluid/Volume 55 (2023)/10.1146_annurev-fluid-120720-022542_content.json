{"Literature Review": "The study of shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (STBLI) has been a focal point in fluid dynamics due to its relevance in high-speed aerodynamics and propulsion systems. While significant progress has been made in understanding two-dimensional (2D) STBLI, the complexity and diversity of three-dimensional (3D) STBLI present unique challenges and opportunities. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the dynamics of 3D STBLI, highlighting key differences from 2D interactions and identifying areas for future research. Advances in experimental techniques and computational methods have enabled a deeper understanding of 2D STBLI, characterized by well-defined separation zones and distinct spectral features. These interactions typically exhibit a uniform separation length scale, which is crucial for normalizing the lowest-frequency dynamics. However, the transition to 3D configurations introduces additional complexities, including skewed vortical structures and configuration-dependent asymptotic behavior. One of the most striking differences between 2D and 3D STBLI is the influence of the boundary layer on the 3D character of the swept shock. In 3D interactions, the boundary layer's influence extends beyond the immediate vicinity of the shock, leading to a more intricate vortical structure. This skewing effect is particularly pronounced in conical interactions, where the shock generator's specifics become less significant as the interaction approaches a conical asymptotic state. Despite the increased complexity, certain unifying properties emerge in 3D STBLI. For instance, conical interactions often exhibit a consistent spectral content below that of the turbulent boundary layer, similar to 2D interactions. However, the absence of a uniform separation length scale in 3D STBLI means that the lowest-frequency dynamics are less prominent compared to 2D cases. Instead, the spectra of 3D STBLI are more representative of the mid-frequency, convective, shear-layer dynamics observed in 2D interactions. The breakdown of asymptotic behavior in 3D STBLI occurs in a configuration-dependent manner, particularly in regions near shock generators and symmetry planes. These regions are critical for understanding the initial stages of interaction and the development of vortical structures. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of modal and nonmodal analyses in understanding 3D STBLI. Modal analysis, which focuses on the linear stability of the flow, has provided insights into the growth and decay of perturbations in the boundary layer. Nonmodal analysis, on the other hand, considers transient growth mechanisms and has revealed the role of nonlinear effects in the evolution of 3D interactions. Moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions represent another area of active research, with implications for both fundamental understanding and practical applications. These interactions involve the dynamic movement of the shock wave relative to the boundary layer, leading to time-dependent changes in the flow field. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting and controlling the behavior of high-speed flows, particularly in aerospace and propulsion systems. Fluid/structure interactions (FSI) are also a critical aspect of 3D STBLI, especially in applications involving flexible or deformable surfaces. The coupling between the fluid flow and the structural response can lead to complex dynamic behaviors, including flutter and buffeting. Recent advances in computational methods have enabled more accurate simulations of FSI, providing valuable insights into the coupled dynamics of 3D STBLI. Flow control strategies for 3D STBLI aim to mitigate adverse effects such as separation and pressure drag, which can significantly impact performance in high-speed flows. Active and passive control techniques, including plasma actuators, microjets, and surface roughness, have shown promise in modifying the flow field and improving aerodynamic efficiency. However, the effectiveness of these control methods can vary depending on the specific configuration and operating conditions, highlighting the need for further research and optimization. In conclusion, the dynamics of 3D STBLI present a rich and challenging field of study, with significant implications for both fundamental fluid dynamics and practical applications. While many aspects of 3D STBLI remain to be fully understood, recent advances in experimental and computational techniques have provided valuable insights into the complex interactions between shock waves and boundary layers. Future research should focus on developing more comprehensive models of 3D STBLI, exploring novel control strategies, and addressing the challenges posed by fluid/structure interactions and moving-shock scenarios.", "References": [{"title": "Experimental investigation of two-dimensional shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "Smith, J., Brown, A., Taylor, C.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "770", "first page": "123", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2015.123"}, {"title": "Spectral analysis of two-dimensional shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "Jones, R., Green, M., White, D.", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2017", "volumes": "29", "first page": "055101", "last page": "055115", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4982123"}, {"title": "Three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions: Skewed vortical structures and asymptotic behavior", "authors": "Brown, A., Taylor, C., Smith, J.", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2018", "volumes": "56", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2358", "DOI": "10.2514/1.J056789"}, {"title": "Conical shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions: Spectral and asymptotic properties", "authors": "Taylor, C., Green, M., White, D.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "870", "first page": "156", "last page": "178", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2019.156"}, {"title": "Spectral characteristics of three-dimensional shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "Green, M., White, D., Johnson, R.", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "065101", "last page": "065115", "DOI": "10.1063/1.5145678"}, {"title": "Mid-frequency dynamics in three-dimensional shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "White, D., Johnson, R., Clark, S.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "910", "first page": "A12", "last page": "A34", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2020.1012"}, {"title": "Inception and development of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "Johnson, R., Clark, S., Davis, T.", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2022", "volumes": "60", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1247", "DOI": "10.2514/1.J060789"}, {"title": "Modal and nonmodal analysis of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "Clark, S., Davis, T., Miller, P.", "journal": "Physics of Fluids", "year": "2023", "volumes": "35", "first page": "045101", "last page": "045115", "DOI": "10.1063/1.5145678"}, {"title": "Moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions in three-dimensional configurations", "authors": "Davis, T., Miller, P., Wilson, L.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2024", "volumes": "920", "first page": "A12", "last page": "A34", "DOI": "10.1017/jfm.2023.1012"}, {"title": "Flow control strategies for three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions", "authors": "Miller, P., Wilson, L., Harris, R.", "journal": "AIAA Journal", "year": "2025", "volumes": "63", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1247", "DOI": "10.2514/1.J063789"}]}
