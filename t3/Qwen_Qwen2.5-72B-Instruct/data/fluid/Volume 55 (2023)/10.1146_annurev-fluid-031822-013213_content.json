{"Literature Review": "The evaporation of sessile droplets is a phenomenon of significant interest across various scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and biology. This process is crucial for understanding and optimizing a wide range of applications, from inkjet printing and microfluidics to biological systems and environmental science. The complexity of droplet evaporation arises from the interplay of multiple physical mechanisms, including heat and mass transfer, surface tension, and fluid dynamics. This literature review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the evaporation of sessile droplets, focusing on the insights derived from mathematical models and potential future directions in the field.\n\nOne of the primary factors influencing the evaporation rate of sessile droplets is the diffusion-limited process. According to the classical model proposed by Deegan et al. (1997), the evaporation rate is primarily controlled by the diffusion of vapor from the droplet's surface into the surrounding air. This model assumes that the droplet is in a quasi-steady state, where the concentration gradient of the vapor is the dominant factor. However, this model has been extended to account for non-uniform evaporation rates and the effects of substrate properties (Bhattacharya et al., 2005). These extensions have shown that the evaporation rate can vary significantly depending on the wettability of the substrate and the presence of impurities or surfactants.\n\nAnother important aspect of droplet evaporation is the mode of evaporation. Sessile droplets can evaporate in two primary modes: the constant contact radius (CCR) mode and the constant contact angle (CCA) mode. In the CCR mode, the contact radius remains constant while the contact angle decreases over time, leading to a gradual thinning of the droplet. Conversely, in the CCA mode, the contact angle remains constant while the contact radius decreases, resulting in a more uniform reduction in droplet size. The transition between these modes has been studied extensively, and it has been found that the mode of evaporation can significantly affect the final deposition patterns (Xu et al., 2005).\n\nThe lifetime of a sessile droplet is another critical parameter that has been the subject of numerous studies. Mathematical models have been developed to predict the droplet lifetime based on various factors, including the initial droplet volume, the ambient conditions, and the properties of the liquid and substrate. For example, Lin et al. (2006) derived a theoretical framework that accounts for the effects of temperature and humidity on the droplet lifetime. Their model predicts that the droplet lifetime decreases exponentially with increasing temperature and humidity, highlighting the importance of environmental conditions in controlling the evaporation process.\n\nDeposition patterns formed during the evaporation of sessile droplets have also been a focus of research. The coffee-ring effect, where solutes accumulate at the edge of the droplet, is a well-known phenomenon that has been explained using a combination of hydrodynamic and diffusive transport mechanisms (Deegan et al., 1997). However, recent studies have shown that the deposition patterns can be influenced by factors such as the droplet's shape, the presence of surfactants, and the substrate's topography (Chen et al., 2013). These findings have implications for applications such as inkjet printing, where the control of deposition patterns is crucial for achieving high-quality prints.\n\nThe study of multiple droplets has revealed additional complexities in the evaporation process. When multiple droplets are in close proximity, the evaporation of one droplet can influence the behavior of neighboring droplets through the formation of vapor gradients and the alteration of local humidity (Shahidzadeh-Bonn et al., 2006). This interaction can lead to phenomena such as the merging of droplets and the formation of complex patterns. Understanding these interactions is essential for applications involving the simultaneous evaporation of multiple droplets, such as in microarray fabrication and drug delivery systems.\n\nIn recent years, advances in experimental techniques and computational methods have enabled more detailed investigations of droplet evaporation. High-speed imaging and numerical simulations have provided new insights into the dynamics of the evaporation process, including the role of Marangoni flows and the effects of thermal gradients (Karpitschka et al., 2015). These studies have highlighted the importance of considering both macroscopic and microscopic phenomena in modeling droplet evaporation.\n\nDespite the progress made in understanding the evaporation of sessile droplets, several challenges remain. One of the key challenges is the development of more accurate and comprehensive models that can account for the complex interplay of physical mechanisms. Additionally, there is a need for further experimental studies to validate these models and to explore the behavior of droplets under a wider range of conditions. Future research should also focus on the application of droplet evaporation in emerging fields such as nanotechnology and biotechnology, where the control of droplet behavior is critical for the success of various processes.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaporation of sessile droplets is a rich and dynamic field of research that continues to evolve. Mathematical models have provided valuable insights into the underlying physical mechanisms, but there is still much to be discovered. By addressing the remaining challenges and exploring new directions, researchers can continue to advance our understanding of this fundamental process and its applications.", "References": [{"title": "Capillary flow as the cause of ring stains from dried liquid drops", "authors": "R.
