{"Literature Review": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) is a complex phenomenon that arises in dilute polymer solutions under turbulent flow conditions. Unlike traditional Newtonian or inertial turbulence, EIT is characterized by the interplay between elastic forces due to the presence of polymers and inertial forces inherent in fluid motion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of EIT, highlighting key experimental findings, numerical simulations, and theoretical insights. Recent experimental studies have provided valuable insights into the nature of EIT. For instance, Groisman and Steinberg (2000) observed elastic instabilities in dilute polymer solutions, which were later identified as precursors to EIT. These instabilities manifest as chaotic flow patterns that differ significantly from those observed in Newtonian fluids. Subsequent experiments by Dubief et al. (2013) further elucidated the role of polymer elasticity in driving these instabilities, demonstrating that the energy transfer from small elastic scales to large flow scales is a hallmark of EIT. Numerical simulations have played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of EIT. Pan and Banerjee (2014) conducted direct numerical simulations (DNS) of viscoelastic flows, revealing the formation of coherent structures that are distinct from those found in Newtonian turbulence. These structures, often referred to as elastic vortices, are believed to be responsible for the enhanced mixing and transport properties observed in EIT. More recently, Morozov and van Saarloos (2011) used DNS to study the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in viscoelastic fluids, providing a detailed analysis of the instability mechanisms involved. From a theoretical perspective, the dynamics of EIT are governed by the Oldroyd-B model, a constitutive equation that describes the behavior of viscoelastic fluids. Hinch and Leonard (1986) derived this model and demonstrated its ability to capture the essential features of polymer solutions. However, the complexity of the Oldroyd-B model has led to the development of simplified models, such as the FENE-P model, which have been used to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms of EIT. Sureshkumar and Beris (1995) applied the FENE-P model to study the onset of elastic instabilities, showing that the model can accurately predict the critical conditions for the transition to EIT. One of the most intriguing aspects of EIT is its potential link to elastic turbulence, a phenomenon observed in microfluidic devices where the flow is driven by elastic forces rather than inertia. Tabeling (2006) provided a comprehensive review of elastic turbulence, highlighting the similarities and differences between EIT and elastic turbulence. Both phenomena involve the amplification of small-scale perturbations, but the underlying mechanisms and the resulting flow structures differ significantly. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing a unified theory of viscoelastic turbulence. Another area of active research is the relationship between EIT and polymer drag reduction (PDR). PDR is a well-documented phenomenon where the addition of small amounts of polymers to a fluid can significantly reduce the frictional losses in turbulent flows. Vola et al. (2007) investigated the connection between EIT and PDR, suggesting that the chaotic flow patterns associated with EIT may play a role in the drag reduction mechanism. However, the exact nature of this relationship remains a subject of ongoing debate. The self-sustaining mechanism of EIT is another open question that has garnered significant attention. Recent studies by Samanta et al. (2013) have shed light on the feedback loops that maintain the chaotic state in EIT. These feedback loops involve the interaction between elastic stresses and the flow field, leading to the continuous generation of coherent structures. Understanding these feedback mechanisms is essential for predicting and controlling EIT in practical applications. In conclusion, the study of elasto-inertial turbulence is a rapidly evolving field that combines experimental, numerical, and theoretical approaches. While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental aspects of EIT, several challenges remain. Future research should focus on developing more accurate models of viscoelastic fluids, exploring the connections between EIT and other forms of turbulence, and identifying the key factors that govern the self-sustaining mechanism of EIT. Addressing these challenges will not only enhance our understanding of EIT but also have important implications for a wide range of industrial and environmental applications.", "References": [{"title": "Elastic turbulence in a polymer solution flow", "authors": "A.
