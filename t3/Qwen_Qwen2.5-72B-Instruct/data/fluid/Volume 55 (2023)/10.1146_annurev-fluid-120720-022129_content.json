{"Literature Review": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) have evolved significantly since their inception in the early 1960s, becoming a cornerstone in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for solving complex flow problems. The historical development of IBMs can be traced back to the pioneering work of Peskin (1972), who introduced the method to simulate blood flow in the heart. This initial application demonstrated the method's ability to handle moving boundaries and complex geometries without the need for body-fitted grids, a significant advantage over traditional grid-based methods. However, the computational limitations of the time restricted the full exploitation of IBMs' potential until the advent of more powerful computing resources in the late 20th century. The versatility of IBMs lies in their ability to couple fluid dynamics with other physical phenomena, making them particularly useful for multiphysics problems. For instance, Mittal and Iaccarino (2005) highlighted the method's effectiveness in simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, where the deformation of solid structures influences the surrounding fluid flow. This capability has been leveraged in various applications, including the simulation of flapping wings (Liu et al., 2009) and the study of cardiovascular systems (Peskin, 2002). Despite their advantages, IBMs are not without limitations. One of the primary challenges is the accurate representation of boundary conditions, especially in high-Reynolds number flows. The thin wall shear layers near solid boundaries require high spatial resolution, which can be computationally expensive. To address this issue, researchers have developed wall models that approximate the behavior of the boundary layer without the need for fine meshing. For example, Uhlmann (2005) proposed a wall model based on the logarithmic law of the wall, which has been successfully applied to turbulent flow simulations. However, the accuracy of these wall models depends on the specific flow conditions and may introduce errors if not properly calibrated. Another approach to mitigate the resolution issue is the use of local grid refinement techniques. These methods allow for higher resolution in regions of interest while maintaining coarser grids elsewhere, thus reducing the overall computational cost. Taira and Colonius (2007) demonstrated the effectiveness of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in conjunction with IBMs for simulating vortex-induced vibrations. While AMR can significantly improve the efficiency of IBMs, it also introduces complexity in the implementation and requires careful management of the grid hierarchy. The development of IBMs has also been driven by the need to handle complex geometries and moving boundaries. Fadlun et al. (2000) introduced a ghost-cell method that extends the applicability of IBMs to irregular domains by enforcing boundary conditions through virtual cells. This approach has been widely adopted in both academic and industrial settings due to its simplicity and robustness. However, the ghost-cell method can suffer from accuracy issues in highly curved or rapidly moving boundaries, necessitating further refinements. In recent years, the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques with IBMs has opened new avenues for improving the accuracy and efficiency of simulations. For example, Wang et al. (2020) used deep learning to predict the forces acting on immersed boundaries, thereby reducing the computational burden of traditional force calculations. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of data-driven models with the flexibility of IBMs, offering a promising direction for future research. The future outlook for IBMs is optimistic, with ongoing efforts to enhance their capabilities and expand their applications. One area of active research is the development of high-order IBMs that can achieve higher accuracy with fewer grid points. For instance, Bhalla et al. (2013) presented a high-order accurate immersed interface method that uses a combination of finite difference and finite volume schemes to improve the resolution of boundary layers. Additionally, the integration of IBMs with other advanced numerical techniques, such as lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM), is being explored to address the limitations of traditional CFD approaches. In conclusion, immersed boundary methods have come a long way since their inception, evolving into a powerful tool for simulating complex flow problems. While challenges remain, particularly in the context of high-Reynolds number flows and the accurate representation of boundary conditions, ongoing research and technological advancements continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with IBMs. As computational resources become more powerful and ML techniques mature, the future of IBMs looks bright, with the potential to revolutionize the field of computational fluid dynamics and multiphysics simulations.", "References": [{"title": "Flow patterns around heart valves: A numerical method", "authors": "C.S.
