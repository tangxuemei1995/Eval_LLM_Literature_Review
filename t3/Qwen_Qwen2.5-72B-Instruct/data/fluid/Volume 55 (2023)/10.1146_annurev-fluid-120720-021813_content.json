{"Literature Review": "Turbulent spots have been a focal point of fluid dynamics research for several decades, primarily due to their critical role in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. These spots serve as a bridge between the deterministic laminar state and the stochastic turbulent state, significantly influencing the transition zone length in various engineering flows. Over the years, the study of turbulent spots has expanded beyond the traditional incompressible flat-plate boundary layer and pipe flow to encompass a broader range of flows, including hypersonic boundary layers, turbomachinery flows, channel flows, and plane Couette flows. This literature review aims to summarize the key advancements in understanding the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of turbulent spots, while also highlighting future research directions. The concept of turbulent spots was first introduced by Kline et al. (1967), who observed localized regions of turbulence in a laminar boundary layer. Since then, numerous studies have delved into the mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of these spots. One of the fundamental aspects of turbulent spots is their origination. Early research by Klebanoff et al. (1962) and Kline et al. (1967) suggested that turbulent spots arise from the amplification of small disturbances in the laminar flow. More recent studies have refined this understanding, demonstrating that the initial disturbances can be triggered by various mechanisms, including free-stream turbulence, surface roughness, and acoustic waves (Cherubini et al., 2011). The composition of turbulent spots has also been a subject of extensive investigation. Turbulent spots are typically characterized by a high Reynolds number region surrounded by a lower Reynolds number laminar flow. The internal structure of these spots is complex, with a variety of coherent structures, such as vortices and streaks, playing a crucial role in their dynamics (Adrian, 2007). The demarcation of turbulent spots, or the boundary between the turbulent and laminar regions, is another important aspect. Studies have shown that the boundary is often marked by a sharp gradient in velocity and vorticity, which can be influenced by factors such as the Reynolds number and the presence of external perturbations (Jiménez, 2018). The growth and mutual interaction of turbulent spots have been studied extensively in both experimental and numerical settings. In pipe flow, for example, the splitting of turbulent spots has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot's frontal section (Hof et al., 2006). This process involves the formation of a new spot at the leading edge of the existing one, followed by the eventual merging of the two spots. Similar phenomena have been observed in other flows, such as channel flow and plane Couette flow, where the interaction between spots can lead to the formation of larger turbulent regions (Waleffe, 2003). Reproduction and sustainability of turbulent spots are essential for the maintenance of turbulence in the flow. Recent research has shown that the self-sustaining process of turbulence can be understood through the interaction of coherent structures within the spots (Hamilton et al., 1995). These structures, such as streamwise vortices and streaks, continuously regenerate and sustain the turbulent state. The hypothesis that transitional-turbulent spots are a basic module of the fully turbulent boundary layer has gained significant support, particularly with the discovery of locally generated turbulent-turbulent spots dominating the wall layer (Smits et al., 2011). Self-organization of turbulent spots is another area of active research. Studies have revealed that turbulent spots exhibit a degree of order and organization, despite the inherent randomness of turbulence. For instance, the arrangement of spots in a boundary layer can follow certain patterns, which are influenced by the flow conditions and the presence of external forcing (Kleiser and Schumann, 1980). This self-organization is thought to play a crucial role in the transition to fully developed turbulence. In hypersonic boundary layers, the behavior of turbulent spots is influenced by the high Mach number and the associated compressibility effects. Research has shown that the growth and interaction of spots in hypersonic flows can differ significantly from those in incompressible flows, with the formation of shock waves and other compressibility-induced phenomena playing a significant role (Chung, 2009). Similarly, in turbomachinery flows, the presence of rotating components and complex geometries can affect the dynamics of turbulent spots, leading to unique challenges in their control and mitigation (Durst et al., 2006). Despite the significant progress made in understanding turbulent spots, several open questions remain. Future research directions include the development of more accurate predictive models for the formation and evolution of turbulent spots, the exploration of the role of turbulence in complex flows, and the application of advanced experimental techniques to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, the integration of machine learning and data-driven approaches holds promise for advancing our understanding of turbulent spots and their impact on flow dynamics. In conclusion, the study of turbulent spots has evolved from its early focus on simple flows to encompass a wide range of complex flows. Advances in experimental and numerical methods have provided valuable insights into the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of these spots. As research continues, the knowledge gained will have significant implications for the design and optimization of engineering systems involving fluid flows.", "References": [{"title": "The structure of turbulent shear flows", "authors": "R.
