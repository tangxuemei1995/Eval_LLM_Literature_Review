{"Literature Review": "Rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection (RRBC) is a fundamental fluid dynamics problem that has been extensively studied due to its relevance in understanding various geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. In RRBC, a fluid layer is heated from below and cooled from above while being subjected to rotation about a vertical axis. This setup introduces complex interactions between buoyancy forces and the Coriolis effect, leading to a rich variety of dynamical behaviors and heat transfer mechanisms. The study of RRBC has a long history, with early experiments focusing on the onset of convection and the stability of the system. Chandrasekhar (1961) provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for the onset of convection in rotating fluids, highlighting the role of the Rayleigh number (Ra), which quantifies the strength of buoyancy, and the Ekman number (E), which measures the strength of the Coriolis force. Subsequent studies have expanded on these foundational concepts, exploring the nonlinear dynamics and turbulence in RRBC. One of the key aspects of RRBC is the suppression of convective onset by rotation. As the rotation rate increases, the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection also increases, indicating a stabilizing effect of rotation (Busse, 1978). This phenomenon is crucial for understanding the behavior of planetary atmospheres and oceans, where rotation plays a significant role in determining the stability and dynamics of fluid layers. In addition to the onset of convection, rotation significantly alters the structure and dynamics of convective flows. For instance, the presence of rotation can change the shape of thermal structures from plumes to vortical columns (King et al., 2009). These vortical columns are characterized by strong vertical vorticity and can lead to enhanced heat transport compared to non-rotating convection. The transition from plume-like structures to vortical columns is a critical aspect of RRBC and has been studied both experimentally and numerically. The large-scale circulation (LSC) in RRBC is another important feature that is influenced by rotation. The LSC is a coherent flow pattern that emerges in the fluid layer and plays a significant role in heat transport. Rotation can either enhance or suppress the LSC, depending on the relative strengths of buoyancy and Coriolis forces (Stellmach et al., 2014). Understanding the conditions under which the LSC is strengthened or weakened is essential for predicting the overall heat transport efficiency in RRBC. Heat transport in RRBC is a complex process that depends on the interplay between buoyancy and rotation. Early studies suggested that the Nusselt number (Nu), which quantifies the heat transfer efficiency, scales with the Rayleigh number and the Ekman number in a power-law relationship (Rossby, 1969). However, recent research has shown that this scaling relationship can be more nuanced, with different scaling laws emerging in the rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes (Chavanne et al., 2001). A unifying heat transport scaling approach that accounts for the transition between these regimes has been proposed, providing a more comprehensive understanding of heat transport in RRBC. Non-Oberbeck–Boussinesq (NOB) effects, which arise from the variations in fluid properties with temperature, can also play a significant role in RRBC. NOB effects can alter the convective patterns and heat transport, particularly in systems with large temperature differences (Julien et al., 2012). Centrifugal effects, which become important at high rotation rates, can further complicate the dynamics of RRBC by introducing additional instabilities and flow structures (Calkins et al., 2015). Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of RRBC. DNS allows for the detailed examination of the flow structures and heat transfer mechanisms in a controlled environment, providing insights that are difficult to obtain through experiments alone. Recent DNS studies have revealed the intricate dynamics of vortical columns and the LSC in RRBC, as well as the transition between different flow regimes (Scheel et al., 2016). In conclusion, RRBC is a rich and complex system that continues to be a subject of intense research. The interplay between buoyancy and rotation leads to a wide range of dynamical behaviors and heat transfer mechanisms, making RRBC a valuable model for understanding geophysical and astrophysical processes. Future research should focus on developing more accurate scaling laws for heat transport, incorporating NOB and centrifugal effects, and extending the applicability of RRBC models to real-world systems.", "References": [{"title": "On the stability of two-dimensional convection in a layer heated from below", "authors": "F.
