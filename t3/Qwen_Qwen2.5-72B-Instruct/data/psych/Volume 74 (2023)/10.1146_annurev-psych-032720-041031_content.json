{"Literature Review": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying human object vision has been a central theme in cognitive neuroscience and psychology for decades. Traditional theories of object vision, such as those proposed by Marr (1982) and Biederman (1987), emphasized the role of object recognition as a fundamental process. These theories posited that objects are recognized through a hierarchical processing of visual features, culminating in a holistic representation that allows for identification and categorization. However, recent advancements in behavioral paradigms, neuroscientific methods, and computational modeling have revealed a more complex and multidimensional representational space that underlies object vision. Recent studies have shown that object vision is not solely about recognition but involves a broader range of behavioral goals. For instance, DiCarlo et al. (2012) demonstrated that the primate visual system is capable of representing objects at multiple levels of abstraction, from low-level features to high-level semantic categories. This hierarchical representation is supported by the ventral stream of the visual cortex, which includes areas such as V1, V2, V4, and the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. These areas are involved in the progressive extraction of increasingly complex features, ultimately leading to object recognition. However, the complexity of object vision extends beyond the ventral stream. The dorsal stream, which is involved in spatial processing and action planning, also plays a crucial role in object vision. Goodale and Milner (1992) proposed the 'two-stream' hypothesis, suggesting that the ventral stream is responsible for object recognition, while the dorsal stream is responsible for guiding actions. This hypothesis has been supported by numerous studies, including those using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the functional specialization of these streams (Culham and Kanwisher, 2001). Moreover, the integration of information across different sensory modalities is essential for a comprehensive understanding of object vision. Cross-modal integration allows for the binding of visual, auditory, and tactile information, enhancing the richness and accuracy of object representations. For example, Driver and Noesselt (2008) reviewed evidence showing that cross-modal interactions can modulate activity in the visual cortex, influencing object perception and recognition. Computational models, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have become powerful tools for understanding the representational spaces underlying object vision. DCNNs are designed to mimic the hierarchical processing of the visual cortex, with layers of neurons that progressively extract more complex features from input images. Studies have shown that DCNNs can achieve human-like performance in object recognition tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Moreover, the activation patterns of DCNNs have been found to correlate with neural activity in the visual cortex, providing insights into the nature of object representations (Yamins et al., 2014). However, the success of DCNNs in object recognition does not necessarily imply that they capture the full complexity of human object vision. Recent research has highlighted the limitations of DCNNs in handling certain aspects of object vision, such as context-dependent recognition and the integration of top-down influences (Rajalingham et al., 2018). These limitations suggest that a more nuanced understanding of object vision requires considering the full repertoire of behavioral goals that underlie human behavior. Behavioral goals, such as navigation, manipulation, and social interaction, play a critical role in shaping object representations. For example, Gallese and Lakoff (2005) proposed the 'embodied cognition' framework, which emphasizes the role of sensorimotor experiences in shaping cognitive processes, including object vision. This framework suggests that object representations are not static but are dynamically constructed based on the context and the specific goals of the observer. In conclusion, the traditional view of object vision as primarily focused on object recognition is being replaced by a more comprehensive understanding that considers the multidimensional representational space underlying object vision. This space is shaped by the integration of information across multiple sensory modalities, the involvement of both ventral and dorsal streams, and the influence of a wide range of behavioral goals. Future research should continue to explore these dimensions to gain a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of human object vision.", "References": [{"title": "Recognition-by-components: A theory of human image understanding", "authors": "Irving Biederman", "journal": "Psychological Review", "year": "1987", "volumes": "94", "first page": "115", "last page": "147", "DOI": "10.1037/0033-295X.94.2.115"}, {"title": "A category-specific response to animals in the right human anterior medial temporal lobe", "authors": "James J.
