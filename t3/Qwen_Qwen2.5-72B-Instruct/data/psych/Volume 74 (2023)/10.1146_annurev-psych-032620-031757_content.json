{"Literature Review": "Psychosocial and integrative oncology represent interdisciplinary fields that focus on the psychological, social, and holistic aspects of cancer care. These fields aim to address the multifaceted challenges faced by patients and their caregivers throughout the disease trajectory, from diagnosis through treatment and survivorship or end-of-life care. Common psychological reactions to cancer include distress, anxiety, depression, and fear of cancer recurrence (FRC), which can significantly impact quality of life (QoL) and treatment adherence. Distress is a prevalent issue among cancer patients, encompassing a range of emotional, social, spiritual, and physical problems. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend routine screening for distress to identify patients who may benefit from additional support. Studies have shown that distress levels can vary across different stages of the disease, with higher levels often observed during the initial diagnosis and active treatment phases. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely used to manage distress, with meta-analyses demonstrating its efficacy in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression are also common comorbidities in cancer patients, affecting up to 35% of individuals. These conditions can exacerbate physical symptoms and reduce QoL. Acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies have gained attention for their potential to improve mental health outcomes. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) have been shown to reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients. These interventions emphasize present-moment awareness and non-judgmental acceptance, which can help patients cope with the uncertainty and stress associated with cancer. Fear of cancer recurrence (FRC) is another significant concern, particularly among survivors. FRC can lead to heightened anxiety, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors, which can interfere with daily functioning and QoL. Cognitive-behavioral strategies, such as cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, have been effective in reducing FRC. Additionally, meaning-based approaches, which focus on finding purpose and meaning in the face of adversity, have shown promise in addressing FRC and promoting resilience. Caregiver burden is another critical aspect of psychosocial oncology. Caregivers often experience high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression due to the demands of providing care and the emotional toll of witnessing a loved one's suffering. Supportive interventions for caregivers, such as psychoeducational programs and peer support groups, have been shown to improve their mental health and coping skills. Physical symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances are also common in cancer patients and can be exacerbated by psychological distress. Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms, affecting up to 90% of patients during treatment. Mind-body therapies, such as yoga and tai chi, have been found to reduce fatigue and improve physical function. Pain management is another crucial area, with integrative approaches combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to provide comprehensive care. Sleep disturbances, including insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns, are also prevalent among cancer patients and can contribute to increased fatigue and reduced QoL. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be effective in improving sleep quality and reducing symptoms of insomnia in cancer patients. In recent years, psychedelic therapy has emerged as a novel approach for addressing psychological distress in advanced cancer patients. Studies have shown that psilocybin-assisted therapy can lead to significant reductions in anxiety and depression, with effects lasting up to six months. However, more research is needed to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of psychedelic therapy in this population. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting various psychosocial and integrative interventions, several methodological issues and shortcomings remain. Many studies suffer from small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and short follow-up periods, which limit the generalizability of findings. Future research should prioritize pragmatic trial designs, digital health interventions, and implementation science to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of these interventions in real-world settings. Digital health interventions, such as mobile apps and online platforms, offer promising opportunities to deliver psychosocial support and self-management tools to a broader audience. These interventions can be tailored to individual needs and preferences, making them a valuable addition to traditional in-person therapies. Implementation science, which focuses on the systematic uptake of evidence-based practices into routine clinical care, is also essential for ensuring that effective interventions reach those who need them most. In conclusion, psychosocial and integrative oncology play a vital role in addressing the complex needs of cancer patients and their caregivers. By integrating evidence-based interventions into comprehensive care plans, healthcare providers can improve QoL, reduce distress, and promote overall well-being. Future research should continue to explore innovative approaches and address methodological limitations to advance the field and benefit patients and caregivers alike.", "References": [{"title": "Screening, assessment, and care of anxiety and depressive symptoms in adults with cancer: An American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline adaptation", "authors": "Carlson, L.
