{"Literature Review": "Self-continuity, the subjective sense of connection between one's past, present, and future selves, has been a focal point in psychological research due to its profound implications for various aspects of human functioning. This review synthesizes the current understanding of self-continuity, its forms, and its impacts on attitudes, behaviors, and health. Self-continuity can be categorized into three primary forms: past–present self-continuity, present–future self-continuity, and global self-continuity. Past–present self-continuity refers to the perceived connection between one's past and present selves, which is crucial for maintaining a coherent identity over time. Present–future self-continuity involves the connection between one's present and future selves, which is essential for goal-directed behavior and future planning. Global self-continuity encompasses the integration of all temporal selves, providing a holistic sense of personal continuity. The motivational character of self-continuity is well-documented. Individuals with high levels of self-continuity are more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors, maintain stable relationships, and exhibit greater life satisfaction. This is because a strong sense of self-continuity fosters a stable and predictable self-concept, which in turn supports consistent and adaptive behaviors. Self-continuity also plays a critical role in regulatory processes. For instance, individuals who perceive a strong connection between their past and present selves are better able to regulate their emotions and cope with stress. Similarly, present–future self-continuity enhances self-control and reduces impulsive behaviors, as individuals are more likely to consider the long-term consequences of their actions. The consequences of self-continuity extend to attitudes and judgments. Research has shown that individuals with higher self-continuity are more likely to hold consistent attitudes and make decisions that align with their values and goals. This consistency is particularly evident in moral and ethical decision-making, where a strong sense of self-continuity promotes adherence to personal principles. However, the benefits of self-continuity are not universal. In some cases, self-discontinuity, or a sense of disconnection among temporal selves, can have positive outcomes. For example, self-discontinuity can facilitate personal growth and change, especially in the context of significant life transitions. It allows individuals to break free from past constraints and embrace new opportunities, leading to enhanced creativity and adaptability. Neuroscientific research has begun to uncover the brain regions involved in self-continuity. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have identified the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as key areas activated during tasks that require self-referential processing and temporal self-projection. These findings suggest that self-continuity is not only a psychological construct but also has a neural basis. Developmental perspectives on self-continuity highlight the importance of early experiences in shaping one's sense of self over time. Children who receive consistent and supportive parenting are more likely to develop a strong sense of self-continuity, which persists into adulthood. Conversely, adverse childhood experiences, such as trauma or neglect, can disrupt the development of self-continuity, leading to difficulties in forming stable relationships and achieving personal goals. Collective self-continuity, the sense of connection between one's personal identity and the identity of a group, has also received attention in recent research. Collective self-continuity is particularly relevant in the context of social movements and community resilience. Individuals who feel a strong connection to a group are more likely to engage in collective action and support group goals, even at personal cost. This form of self-continuity can enhance social cohesion and promote positive social change. Cultural differences in self-continuity further complicate the picture. Individualistic cultures, which emphasize personal autonomy and independence, tend to foster a stronger sense of individual self-continuity. In contrast, collectivistic cultures, which prioritize group harmony and interdependence, may place greater emphasis on collective self-continuity. These cultural variations highlight the need for culturally sensitive approaches in studying self-continuity. In conclusion, self-continuity is a multifaceted construct with significant implications for individual and collective well-being. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms underlying self-continuity, its interactions with other psychological constructs, and its applications in various domains, including education, therapy, and organizational management. By deepening our understanding of self-continuity, we can better support individuals in maintaining a coherent and fulfilling sense of self across the lifespan.", "References": [{"title": "Possible selves", "authors": "Hazel Rose Markus, Paula Nurius", "journal": "American Psychologist", "year": "1986", "volumes": "41", "first page": "954", "last page": "969", "DOI": "10.1037/0003-066X.41.9.954"}, {"title": "Beyond self-interest: A taxonomy of motives for volunteering", "authors": "Michael H.
