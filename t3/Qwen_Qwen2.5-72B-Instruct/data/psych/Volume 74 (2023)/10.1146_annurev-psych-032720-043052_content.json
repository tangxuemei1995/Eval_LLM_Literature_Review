{"Literature Review": "Despite significant efforts to promote gender equality in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, women remain underrepresented and often face challenges related to equity and inclusion. This literature review synthesizes key findings from psychological research to understand the factors contributing to women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM and to identify strategies for mitigating these issues. One of the primary explanations for the underrepresentation of women in STEM has been the focus on person-level factors, such as abilities, interests, and self-efficacy. However, numerous studies have shown that these factors alone cannot fully account for the persistent gender gaps in STEM. For instance, a meta-analysis by Hyde (2014) found that there are no substantial differences in mathematical abilities between men and women, suggesting that ability differences do not explain the underrepresentation of women in STEM. Similarly, a study by Diekman and Eagly (2000) demonstrated that while women may have different career interests, these interests are influenced by societal and cultural factors rather than inherent differences in aptitude or preference. A more compelling explanation for the gender gap in STEM lies in the role of gender stereotypes. Stereotypes can influence women's perceptions of their fit and belonging in STEM environments. For example, Cheryan et al. (2017) found that stereotypical cues in the physical environment, such as posters of male computer scientists, can deter women from pursuing computer science. These cues signal that the field is not inclusive of women, thereby reducing their sense of belonging and interest in the field. Similarly, Stout et al. (2011) showed that exposure to female role models in STEM can increase women's interest and confidence in pursuing STEM careers, highlighting the importance of representation and role modeling. Gender stereotypes also affect women's self-concept fit, which refers to the alignment between one's self-image and the perceived characteristics of a particular field. A study by Nosek et al. (2009) revealed that implicit biases and stereotypes can lead women to doubt their fit in STEM, even when they have the necessary skills and qualifications. This self-doubt can manifest in reduced self-efficacy and increased anxiety, further deterring women from pursuing STEM careers. Moreover, the lack of visible female role models in STEM can reinforce the stereotype that these fields are not suitable for women, creating a vicious cycle of underrepresentation. In addition to self-concept fit, goal fit and social fit are crucial for women's inclusion in STEM. Goal fit refers to the alignment between one's personal goals and the goals associated with a particular field. Research by Diekman et al. (2010) found that women are more likely to pursue careers that align with communal goals, such as helping others, rather than agentic goals, such as achieving personal success. This preference for communal goals can be influenced by societal expectations and stereotypes, leading women to perceive STEM fields as less aligned with their personal values and goals. Social fit, on the other hand, involves the extent to which individuals feel accepted and supported in a particular environment. A study by Ong et al. (2011) highlighted that women in STEM often experience isolation and a lack of support, which can undermine their sense of belonging and commitment to the field. The impact of gender stereotypes on women's fit and inclusion in STEM is not limited to individual perceptions but also extends to organizational and educational cultures. A report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018) emphasized the need for systemic changes to address the structural barriers that hinder women's participation in STEM. These changes include implementing policies to promote diversity and inclusion, providing mentorship and networking opportunities, and creating supportive learning and work environments. For example, interventions that challenge gender stereotypes and promote a growth mindset can help reduce the negative impact of stereotypes on women's performance and persistence in STEM (Dweck, 2006). Moreover, educational institutions play a critical role in shaping students' perceptions and experiences in STEM. A study by Dasgupta and Asgari (2014) found that exposure to diverse role models and inclusive teaching practices can enhance women's motivation and engagement in STEM. These practices can help counteract the negative effects of stereotypes and create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. In conclusion, the underrepresentation of women in STEM is a complex issue that cannot be attributed solely to person-level factors. Gender stereotypes play a significant role in shaping women's perceptions of their fit and belonging in STEM, influencing their career choices and experiences. Addressing these stereotypes requires a multifaceted approach that includes changing organizational and educational cultures, promoting representation and role modeling, and implementing policies to support diversity and inclusion. By dismantling these systemic barriers, we can create a more equitable and inclusive STEM environment that benefits everyone.", "References": [{"title": "The gender similarities hypothesis", "authors": "Janet Shibley Hyde", "journal": "American Psychologist", "year": "2014", "volumes": "55", "first page": "581", "last page": "592", "DOI": "10.1037/0003-066X.55.6.581"}, {"title": "Sex differences in intrinsic interest: An evolutionary perspective", "authors": "Alice H.
