{"Literature Review": "Color perception and cognition are fundamental aspects of human sensory and cognitive processing, playing a crucial role in various domains such as basic vision, scene perception, object recognition, aesthetics, and communication. The development of these processes from infancy through childhood has been a subject of extensive interdisciplinary research, involving fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics. This literature review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the development of color perception and cognition, highlighting key findings and theoretical implications. The development of color vision begins in infancy, with newborns showing sensitivity to certain colors. According to Bornstein and Kessen (1975), infants as young as two months old can discriminate between different hues, suggesting that the basic mechanisms of color vision are functional early in life. However, the ability to distinguish fine color differences continues to develop throughout the first year of life. Johnson and Aslin (1995) found that by six months, infants can reliably discriminate between closely related colors, indicating a maturation of the visual system's color-processing capabilities. Color constancy, the ability to perceive the color of objects as relatively constant under varying lighting conditions, is another critical aspect of color perception. Research by Kimura and Shevell (2003) demonstrated that children as young as three years old exhibit color constancy, although their performance improves with age. This suggests that while the basic mechanisms of color constancy are present early in development, they continue to refine and become more efficient over time. The development of color naming, a higher-level cognitive process, is closely tied to language acquisition. Franklin and Davies (2004) found that children typically learn to name primary colors (e.g., red, blue, yellow) before secondary colors (e.g., orange, purple). This pattern of acquisition is consistent across cultures, suggesting a universal sequence in the development of color vocabulary. However, the specific age at which children acquire color terms can vary depending on cultural and linguistic factors. For instance, Davidoff et al. (1999) observed that children in cultures with fewer color terms may take longer to learn and use these terms accurately. Color preferences, another aspect of color cognition, also show developmental trends. Hurlbert and Ling (2007) found that children tend to prefer bright, saturated colors, particularly red and blue, which aligns with adult preferences. However, the intensity and specificity of these preferences can change with age. Children's color preferences are influenced by both biological and environmental factors, including cultural norms and personal experiences. Neurodiversity in the development of color perception and cognition is an important consideration. Some individuals, such as those with color vision deficiencies (CVD), may experience color differently. Simunovic (2010) reviewed the prevalence and types of CVD, noting that while most cases are genetic, environmental factors can also play a role. Understanding the impact of CVD on color perception and cognition is crucial for developing appropriate educational and clinical interventions. The development of color perception and cognition has significant implications for educational practices. Children's ability to perceive and name colors is often used as a marker of cognitive development and readiness for learning. Mollon (2006) discussed the importance of color in early education, emphasizing that activities involving color can enhance children's cognitive and perceptual skills. Educational programs that incorporate color-based activities can support the development of color perception and cognition, particularly in children with CVD or other visual impairments. From a theoretical perspective, the development of color perception and cognition provides insights into the principles of perceptual and cognitive development. Spelke (2000) proposed that the development of color perception involves both innate mechanisms and experiential learning. Innate mechanisms provide the initial framework for color perception, while experience refines and expands this framework. This interplay between nature and nurture is evident in the development of color constancy, color naming, and color preferences. In conclusion, the development of color perception and cognition is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the maturation of visual systems, the acquisition of language, and the influence of environmental and cultural factors. Understanding this development is essential for advancing our knowledge of human cognition and for informing educational and clinical practices. Future research should continue to explore the neural mechanisms underlying color perception and cognition, as well as the impact of individual differences and neurodiversity on these processes.", "References": [{"title": "The Visual Abilities of Infants", "authors": "M.
