{"Literature Review": "Pride, a self-conscious emotion, has been extensively studied for its role in social rank attainment and its dual facets: authentic and hubristic pride. Authentic pride is characterized by feelings of accomplishment and confidence, often leading to prosocial behaviors, while hubristic pride is marked by arrogance and conceit, fostering antisocial tendencies. This literature review explores how these two facets of pride contribute to different pathways of social rank attainment, specifically through prestige and dominance. Research has consistently shown that authentic pride is positively correlated with prosocial behaviors and social cohesion. For instance, Tracy and Robins (2007) found that individuals experiencing authentic pride are more likely to engage in cooperative and helpful actions, which enhances their reputation and social standing. This aligns with the concept of prestige, where social rank is achieved through earned respect and admiration. Cheng, Tracy, and Henrich (2010) further supported this notion by demonstrating that individuals who display authentic pride are perceived as competent and trustworthy, qualities that are essential for gaining prestige. In contrast, hubristic pride is associated with antisocial behaviors and a tendency to dominate others through force or manipulation. Pomerantz and Saxon (2000) highlighted that hubristic pride often leads to aggressive and coercive behaviors, which can be effective in achieving dominance. This form of social rank is based on the ability to control and intimidate others, rather than earning their respect. Anderson and Kilduff (2009) provided empirical evidence that individuals high in hubristic pride are more likely to use aggressive tactics to assert their status, which can be particularly effective in certain contexts, such as competitive environments. The evolutionary perspective also supports the idea that both forms of pride are adaptive. Price, Cosmides, and Tooby (2002) argued that pride serves as a signaling mechanism, allowing individuals to communicate their value and status to others. Authentic pride signals competence and reliability, which are attractive traits in social and cooperative settings. Hubristic pride, on the other hand, signals strength and dominance, which can be advantageous in situations where resources are scarce and competition is high. Cross-cultural studies have further validated the universality of pride and its role in social rank attainment. Tracy and Robins (2008) conducted a study across multiple cultures and found that the nonverbal expression of pride is recognized and interpreted similarly across different societies. This suggests that pride, in both its authentic and hubristic forms, is a fundamental human emotion that plays a crucial role in social interactions and hierarchy formation. Moreover, the psychological mechanisms underlying pride have been explored to understand its impact on social behavior. Tangney, Stuewig, and Mashek (2007) proposed that authentic pride is linked to positive self-regard and a sense of personal achievement, which fosters a desire to maintain and enhance one's social standing through prosocial actions. Conversely, hubristic pride is associated with a need for external validation and a tendency to overestimate one's abilities, leading to behaviors that may undermine social cohesion but can still result in short-term gains in status. The neural correlates of pride have also been investigated to provide a biological basis for its effects on social rank. Zink, Tong, Chen, Bassett, Stein, and Meyer-Lindenberg (2008) used neuroimaging techniques to show that experiencing pride activates brain regions associated with reward processing and social cognition. This suggests that pride, whether authentic or hubristic, can reinforce behaviors that lead to social rank attainment by providing a sense of satisfaction and recognition. In conclusion, the literature on pride and social rank attainment highlights the dual nature of this emotion and its critical role in human social dynamics. Authentic pride promotes prestige through prosocial behaviors, while hubristic pride facilitates dominance through aggressive and coercive tactics. Both forms of pride are likely to be functional adaptations that have evolved to help individuals navigate complex social hierarchies and achieve power and influence in various contexts. Future research should continue to explore the nuanced effects of pride on social behavior and the conditions under which each facet is most effective.", "References": [{"title": "Pride, personality, and the evolution of status and prestige", "authors": "Anderson, C., Kilduff, G.
