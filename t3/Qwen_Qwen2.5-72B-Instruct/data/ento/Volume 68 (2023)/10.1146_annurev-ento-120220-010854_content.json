{"Literature Review": "The economic and environmental threats posed by non-native forest insects have become increasingly significant due to the globalization of trade and travel. These invasive species can cause substantial damage to forest ecosystems, leading to biodiversity loss, ecological imbalance, and economic losses. Effective biosecurity measures are crucial for mitigating the risks associated with these invasions. This literature review examines the processes, patterns, predictions, and pitfalls of forest insect biosecurity, highlighting the challenges and potential solutions in preventing the arrival, establishment, spread, and impact of non-native forest insects. Biosecurity measures are typically categorized into three stages: pre-border, border, and post-border. Pre-border measures aim to prevent the introduction of non-native species by regulating pathways and implementing phytosanitary standards. For instance, the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) provides guidelines for international trade to minimize the risk of pest introductions. However, the effectiveness of these measures is often limited by the complexity and volume of global trade. Inspecting all imports is practically impossible, and even when inspections are conducted, they may not detect all potential pests. Border measures focus on intercepting and identifying non-native species at points of entry. These measures include quarantine inspections, X-ray screening, and the use of detector dogs. Despite these efforts, the sheer volume of goods and the diversity of potential pathways make it challenging to achieve complete interception. Post-border measures are designed to manage and control established non-native species. These measures include surveillance, eradication, and containment strategies. Surveillance programs are essential for early detection and rapid response, which can significantly reduce the costs and impacts of invasions. Eradication efforts, while often challenging and resource-intensive, can be successful if implemented promptly and effectively. However, eradication is not always possible, and containment strategies may be necessary to limit the spread of established pests. Despite the implementation of various biosecurity measures, the rate of non-native forest insect invasions continues to increase. This trend is attributed to several factors, including the expansion of global trade, climate change, and the lack of comprehensive and coordinated efforts across countries. Climate change, in particular, can alter the distribution and abundance of both native and non-native species, potentially facilitating the establishment and spread of invasive pests. One of the key challenges in biosecurity is the presence of known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns. Known-unknowns refer to species that are recognized as potential invaders but are not yet regulated, while unknown-unknowns are species that are not yet identified or understood. Both categories pose significant risks, as they can bypass existing regulatory frameworks and enter new environments undetected. To address these challenges, there is a need for continuous monitoring and research to identify and assess potential invasive species. Non-compliance with phytosanitary regulations is another critical issue that undermines the effectiveness of biosecurity measures. Non-compliance can occur due to a lack of awareness, intentional violations, or inadequate enforcement. Collaboration among countries, governments, stakeholders, and individuals is essential for developing and implementing effective biosecurity strategies. The success of biosecurity measures is often under-recognized because it is difficult to detect and quantify the prevention of invasions. Conversely, failures are more evident in the continued establishment of additional non-native species. This discrepancy can lead to a perception that biosecurity efforts are ineffective, which may discourage further investment and support. Therefore, it is crucial to develop metrics and methods for evaluating the success of biosecurity measures, including the prevention of invasions and the reduction of their impacts. In conclusion, the management of non-native forest insects requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates pre-border, border, and post-border measures. While significant progress has been made in understanding the processes and patterns of invasions, there are still many challenges to overcome. Addressing these challenges will require a coordinated and collaborative effort at global and national levels, along with continuous research and innovation in biosecurity practices.", "References": [{"title": "International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs)", "authors": "Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)", "journal": "FAO", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Exotic bark and wood-boring Coleoptera (Curculionidae and Buprestidae) in the United States: Distributions, intercept frequencies, and an estimate of undiscovered species", "authors": "R.A.
