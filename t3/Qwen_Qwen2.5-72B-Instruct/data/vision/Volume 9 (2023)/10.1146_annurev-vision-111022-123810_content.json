{"Literature Review": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults and is traditionally considered a vascular disease. However, recent evidence suggests that DR should be reclassified as a neurovascular disorder due to the presence of significant neuronal and visual dysfunctions that precede the onset of vascular abnormalities (Cheung et al., 2010). This literature review aims to explore the early neuronal and visual dysfunctions observed in both human patients and rodent models of diabetes, highlighting the potential for early intervention to mitigate these deficits.\n\nIn human patients, early signs of visual dysfunction are evident through compromised electroretinograms (ERGs), which indicate disruptions in the normal function of the retina, particularly in the inner retina (Fujinami et al., 2013). ERGs measure the electrical responses of the retina to light stimuli and can detect changes in the function of photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells. Studies have shown that diabetic patients exhibit reduced amplitudes and prolonged latencies in ERG responses, suggesting a decline in the efficiency of retinal signal processing (Browning et al., 2014).\n\nAnother critical aspect of early visual dysfunction in diabetes is the reduction in contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity refers to the ability to distinguish objects from their background and is crucial for tasks such as reading and driving. Diabetic patients often report difficulties in these activities, which correlate with reduced contrast sensitivity (Klein et al., 2007). This reduction is thought to be related to changes in the retinal neurons responsible for processing visual information, particularly in the inner retina where the majority of visual processing occurs.\n\nRodent models of diabetes provide valuable insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying early visual dysfunction. These models exhibit several neuronal deficits that parallel those observed in human patients. For instance, diabetic rodents show reduced evoked GABA release, which is essential for inhibitory neurotransmission in the retina (Li et al., 2015). GABA plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of retinal neurons, and its reduction can lead to hyperexcitability and disrupted neural signaling. Additionally, diabetic rodents exhibit increased excitatory glutamate signaling, which can contribute to neuronal damage and dysfunction (Barber et al., 2005). Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the retina, and excessive glutamate release can lead to excitotoxicity, a process that damages or kills neurons.\n\nDopamine signaling is another key factor in retinal function, and its reduction in diabetic rodents has been linked to visual dysfunction. Dopamine is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm of the retina and modulating the activity of photoreceptors and other retinal neurons. Studies have shown that diabetic rodents have reduced levels of dopamine and its metabolites, which can impair the normal functioning of the retina (Chen et al., 2016). This reduction in dopamine signaling may contribute to the early visual deficits observed in diabetes.\n\nThe early neuronal and visual dysfunctions observed in both human patients and rodent models of diabetes highlight the importance of considering DR as a neurovascular disease. Understanding the specific neuronal deficits, such as reduced GABA release, increased glutamate signaling, and reduced dopamine signaling, can provide targets for early interventions to ameliorate these deficits. For example, pharmacological agents that enhance GABAergic transmission or reduce glutamate excitotoxicity could be developed to protect retinal neurons and preserve visual function (Schröder et al., 2018). Similarly, strategies to enhance dopamine signaling, such as the use of dopaminergic agonists, may help to maintain the normal function of the retina in diabetic patients.\n\nIn conclusion, the early neuronal and visual dysfunctions observed in diabetes underscore the need for a broader perspective on DR as a neurovascular disease. By focusing on the neuronal mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions, researchers can develop novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or delay the onset of DR and improve the quality of life for diabetic patients.", "References": [{"title": "Diabetic retinopathy and systemic vascular complications in type 2 diabetes: The Hong Kong Diabetes Registry", "authors": "N.
