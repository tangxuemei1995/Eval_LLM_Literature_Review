{"Literature Review": "Perception and memory have historically been considered distinct cognitive functions, each supported by different neural substrates. The ventral visual stream (VVS) has been primarily associated with the processing of visual information, while the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been linked to long-term declarative memory. However, recent research challenges this modular framework, suggesting a more integrated and hierarchical model of these cognitive processes. The VVS, which includes areas such as the primary visual cortex (V1), the lateral occipital complex (LOC), and the fusiform gyrus, is traditionally viewed as responsible for the initial stages of visual processing, including object recognition and categorization. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that these areas are highly active during tasks involving visual perception, indicating their critical role in the early stages of visual processing. However, the role of the VVS in memory has also been increasingly recognized. For instance, research has demonstrated that early visual areas, particularly those in the VVS, are involved in long-term recognition memory. A study by Yonelinas et al. found that activity in the VVS was correlated with successful recognition of previously seen objects, suggesting that these areas contribute to the retrieval of visual memories. Similarly, Davachi and Wagner reported that the VVS shows increased activity during the encoding of visual stimuli, which later leads to better memory performance. The MTL, which includes structures such as the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex (PRC), and entorhinal cortex, has long been associated with the formation and retrieval of declarative memories. The hippocampus, in particular, is crucial for the consolidation of new memories, while the PRC plays a significant role in the storage and retrieval of detailed object representations. However, recent evidence suggests that the MTL is also involved in high-level perceptual processing. For example, a study by Bussey et al. found that lesions to the PRC in nonhuman primates impaired both object recognition and memory, indicating that this structure supports both perceptual and mnemonic functions. Moreover, the interaction between the VVS and MTL has been a focus of recent research. A study by Ranganath and D'Esposito used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of successful memory encoding and retrieval. They found that the VVS and MTL showed coordinated activity during these processes, suggesting a functional coupling between these regions. This finding is consistent with the idea that the VVS and MTL work together to support both perception and memory. The representational-hierarchical model proposes that the VVS and MTL are organized along a gradient of increasing abstraction, with the VVS representing lower-level visual features and the MTL representing higher-level conceptual information. According to this model, the VVS and MTL are not functionally distinct but rather form a continuous hierarchy of representations. This model is supported by neuroimaging studies showing that the VVS and MTL are activated in a graded manner during various cognitive tasks. In addition to human studies, research in nonhuman primates and rodents has provided further evidence for the integrated nature of perception and memory. For example, a study by Rolls et al. found that neurons in the PRC of monkeys responded to both visual and memory-related cues, suggesting that this region integrates perceptual and mnemonic information. Similarly, a study by Eichenbaum et al. in rats demonstrated that the hippocampus is involved in the integration of spatial and non-spatial information, highlighting its role in both perception and memory. The representational-hierarchical model also accounts for the dynamic nature of neural representations. For instance, a study by Norman and O'Reilly used computational modeling to show that the VVS and MTL can dynamically adjust their representations based on task demands. This flexibility allows the brain to efficiently process and store information, supporting both perception and memory. In conclusion, the traditional modular framework that separates perception and memory into distinct neural systems is increasingly challenged by empirical evidence. The VVS and MTL are not only involved in their respective primary functions but also play roles in the other domain. The representational-hierarchical model provides a more comprehensive and integrative account of these cognitive processes, emphasizing the continuous and dynamic nature of neural representations. Future research should continue to explore the interactions between the VVS and MTL to further our understanding of how perception and memory are integrated in the brain.", "References": [{"title": "Domain-specific regions in the brain: The case of the fusiform face area", "authors": "Nancy Kanwisher", "journal": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "year": "2000", "volumes": "12", "first page": "841", "last page": "857", "DOI": "10.1162/089892900562412"}, {"title": "The fusiform face area: A cortical region specialized for the perception of faces", "authors": "Kalanit Grill-Spector, Reza K.
