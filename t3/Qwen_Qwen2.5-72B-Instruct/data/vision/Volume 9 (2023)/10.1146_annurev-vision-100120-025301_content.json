{"Literature Review": "Visual representations in the brain have been a focal point of neuroscientific inquiry for decades. The advent of advanced computational techniques, particularly those from machine learning, has revolutionized our ability to decode and understand the information encoded in neural activity patterns. This literature review synthesizes key findings from recent studies that have employed decoding methods to elucidate the nature of visual representations, their spatiotemporal structure, and their functional relevance. Recent advances in multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) have enabled researchers to decode visual stimuli from brain activity with unprecedented accuracy. For instance, Kamitani and Tong (2005) demonstrated that MVPA could be used to identify the orientation of visual gratings from fMRI data, providing early evidence for the feasibility of decoding visual content. Building on this foundation, Kay et al. (2008) extended the application of MVPA to reconstruct natural images from brain activity, further validating the potential of decoding techniques to capture complex visual representations. The spatiotemporal structure of visual representations has been another area of intense investigation. Studies have shown that visual information is processed hierarchically in the brain, with early visual areas (e.g., V1, V2) encoding low-level features and higher-order areas (e.g., IT) representing more abstract concepts (DiCarlo et al., 2012). Decoding approaches have been instrumental in mapping these hierarchical processes. For example, Cichy et al. (2014) used MVPA to track the temporal dynamics of object recognition, revealing a cascade of processing stages from early sensory input to higher-level categorization. Beyond the physical world, decoding has also shed light on internally generated visual states, such as mental imagery and prediction. Kosslyn et al. (2001) were among the first to demonstrate that mental imagery activates similar brain regions as actual perception, suggesting a shared representational framework. More recently, Stokes et al. (2013) used decoding to show that the brain can maintain and manipulate visual representations in working memory, highlighting the dynamic nature of these internal states. The robustness and sensitivity of visual representations to different mental states have also been explored. For instance, Serences and Boynton (2007) found that attention modulates the representation of visual stimuli in early visual cortex, indicating that top-down processes can influence the encoding of sensory information. Similarly, Peelen and Kastner (2014) showed that the context in which a stimulus is presented can alter its neural representation, emphasizing the importance of contextual factors in shaping visual processing. Decoding techniques have also been applied to understand the functional relevance of visual representations for human behavior. For example, Carlson et al. (2013) used decoding to predict perceptual decisions based on neural activity, demonstrating the direct link between brain activity and behavioral outcomes. This line of research has implications for understanding how visual representations contribute to decision-making and other cognitive processes. Moreover, decoding has the potential to reveal how visual representations change over the lifespan and in various mental disorders. For instance, Golarai et al. (2007) used fMRI to study the development of face processing in children, showing that the neural mechanisms underlying face recognition mature over time. In the context of mental disorders, Saxe et al. (2006) used decoding to investigate the neural basis of theory of mind in individuals with autism, providing insights into the altered processing of social cues in this population. In conclusion, decoding approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of visual representations in the brain. These techniques have not only revealed the spatiotemporal structure and complexity of visual representations but have also highlighted their functional relevance and the role of internal states. Future research should continue to leverage decoding methods to explore the dynamic nature of visual representations, their developmental trajectories, and their involvement in various mental disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Decoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain", "authors": "Yukiyasu Kamitani, Frank Tong", "journal": "Nature Neuroscience", "year": "2005", "volumes": "8", "first page": "679", "last page": "685", "DOI": "10.1038/nn1444"}, {"title": "Identifying natural images from human brain activity", "authors": "Thomas Naselaris, Ryan J.
