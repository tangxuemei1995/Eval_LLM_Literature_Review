{"Literature Review": "Emerging pathogenic viral infections pose significant challenges to global health security, particularly due to their potential to cause severe systemic and ophthalmic complications. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have underscored the need for a comprehensive approach to managing these threats. This literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the ophthalmic and systemic manifestations, epidemiology, and therapeutic strategies for emerging viral pathogens, focusing on those identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has been extensively studied for its systemic and ophthalmic manifestations. While respiratory symptoms are the most common, several studies have reported ocular symptoms such as conjunctivitis, chemosis, and epiphora. These ocular manifestations can occur in both mild and severe cases of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of ophthalmic evaluation in patients with suspected or confirmed infection. Additionally, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears and conjunctival secretions suggests a potential route of transmission, emphasizing the need for appropriate protective measures during ophthalmic examinations. Ebola virus disease (EVD) is another high-priority pathogen with significant ophthalmic sequelae. Post-Ebola syndrome (PES) is a well-documented condition characterized by various long-term health issues, including uveitis, cataracts, and retinal detachment. Uveitis, in particular, is a common complication, affecting up to 40% of survivors. The persistence of Ebola virus in ocular tissues, even after clearance from the bloodstream, poses a unique challenge for treatment and management. Antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, and surgical interventions may be required to manage these complications effectively. Zika virus (ZIKV) is another emerging pathogen with significant ophthalmic implications, particularly in neonates. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) can lead to severe ocular abnormalities, including microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and ocular findings such as macular and perimacular pigment mottling, optic nerve hypoplasia, and chorioretinal atrophy. These ocular manifestations can result in significant visual impairment and require early detection and intervention to improve outcomes. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is another coronavirus that has caused sporadic outbreaks, primarily in the Middle East. While MERS-CoV primarily affects the respiratory system, there is limited evidence of ocular involvement. However, given the similarity to SARS-CoV-2, it is prudent to monitor for potential ocular manifestations and take appropriate precautions during ophthalmic evaluations. Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus that can cause severe encephalitis and respiratory illness. Ocular manifestations of NiV infection are less well-documented compared to other emerging pathogens, but case reports suggest the possibility of conjunctivitis and uveitis. The potential for viral persistence in ocular tissues and the risk of secondary transmission highlight the need for further research and surveillance. Lassa fever, caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is endemic in West Africa and can lead to severe systemic illness, including hemorrhagic fever. Ocular manifestations of Lassa fever are rare but can include conjunctivitis and retinal hemorrhages. The high case fatality rate and potential for nosocomial transmission underscore the importance of early diagnosis and isolation of suspected cases. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that primarily affects livestock but can also infect humans. RVF can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including ocular complications such as retinitis and blindness. The potential for large-scale outbreaks in endemic regions necessitates robust surveillance and control measures to prevent human infections. In conclusion, emerging pathogenic viral infections pose significant challenges to global health security, with a spectrum of ophthalmic manifestations that can contribute to long-term morbidity. Comprehensive approaches to preparedness, management, and research are essential to mitigate the impact of these pathogens. Ophthalmologists play a crucial role in the early detection and management of ocular complications, contributing to the broader public health response to disease outbreaks.", "References": [{"title": "Ocular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Rahman, M.
