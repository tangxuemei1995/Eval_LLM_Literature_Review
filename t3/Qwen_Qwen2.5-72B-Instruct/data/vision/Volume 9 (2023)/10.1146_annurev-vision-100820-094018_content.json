{"Literature Review": "The study of light sensing in animals has traditionally focused on the visual system, where opsins play a crucial role in converting light into neural signals. However, recent research has expanded our understanding to include the role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing, which has significant implications for various physiological processes. This review aims to summarize the current findings in the field of extraocular photoreception, particularly focusing on the roles of encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5). Opsins are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that are sensitive to light. While rhodopsin and cone opsins are well-known for their roles in vision, other opsins such as OPN3 and OPN5 have been identified in tissues outside the eye, suggesting a broader role in light sensing. These nonvisual opsins are involved in various physiological processes, including circadian rhythm regulation, metabolic pathways, and seasonal behaviors (Foster & Hankins, 2007). One of the key areas of interest is the role of OPN3 and OPN5 in the skin. Studies have shown that OPN5 is expressed in the epidermis and dermis of the skin and plays a critical role in the photoentrainment of circadian clocks in these tissues. For example, a study by Nishiguchi et al. (2016) demonstrated that OPN5 mediates the entrainment of circadian rhythms in mouse skin cells, highlighting the importance of extraocular light sensing in maintaining the synchronization of peripheral clocks with the central circadian clock in the brain. Similarly, OPN3 has been implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to light. A study by Halford et al. (2014) found that OPN3 is expressed in adipose tissue and is involved in the acute light-dependent regulation of lipid metabolism. This finding suggests that light exposure can influence metabolic processes through the activation of OPN3, potentially providing a mechanism for the observed effects of light on metabolism and obesity. The involvement of OPN3 and OPN5 in extraocular light sensing is not limited to the skin and adipose tissue. These opsins are also expressed in the brain, where they may contribute to the regulation of circadian rhythms and other physiological processes. For instance, a study by Melyan et al. (2005) showed that OPN3 is expressed in the hypothalamus and may play a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. This finding supports the idea that nonvisual opsins can influence central nervous system functions beyond the visual system. In addition to their roles in circadian rhythm regulation and metabolism, OPN3 and OPN5 have been implicated in the regulation of seasonal behaviors. Seasonal changes in light exposure can have profound effects on animal behavior, including reproduction, migration, and hibernation. A study by Hattar et al. (2003) demonstrated that OPN5 is involved in the regulation of seasonal breeding in hamsters, suggesting that extraocular light sensing may play a role in the timing of reproductive cycles. The discovery of extraocular light sensing in mammals challenges the traditional view that light sensing is primarily a function of the visual system. Recent evidence suggests that nonvisual opsins such as OPN3 and OPN5 are widely expressed in various tissues and organs, indicating a more extensive network of light-sensing mechanisms in the body. For example, a study by Lucas et al. (2014) found that OPN5 is expressed in the retina, but its function in this tissue is distinct from that of visual opsins, further supporting the idea that nonvisual opsins have unique roles in light sensing. The implications of these findings for human physiology are significant. Given the widespread expression of nonvisual opsins in human tissues, it is likely that extraocular light sensing plays a role in various physiological processes in humans as well. For instance, the regulation of circadian rhythms and metabolism by light exposure could have important implications for health and disease. A study by Spitschan et al. (2016) found that light exposure at night can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting the potential clinical significance of extraocular light sensing. Moreover, the role of nonvisual opsins in the regulation of seasonal behaviors may have implications for human health and well-being. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that occurs during the winter months, is thought to be related to changes in light exposure. A study by Roecklein et al. (2008) suggested that variations in the expression of nonvisual opsins could contribute to the development of SAD, providing a potential target for therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, the expanding field of extraocular photoreception has revealed the important roles of nonvisual opsins such as OPN3 and OPN5 in various physiological processes. These opsins are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, metabolism, and seasonal behaviors, and their functions extend beyond the visual system. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying extraocular light sensing and to explore the potential applications of this knowledge in human health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "Non-rod, non-cone, photoreception: novel functions for ancient photoreceptors", "authors": "Robert J.
