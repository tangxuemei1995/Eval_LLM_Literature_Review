{"Literature Review": "The human visual system is a marvel of biological engineering, capable of extracting meaningful information from complex and dynamic environments. Two prominent theories have emerged to explain how the visual system processes and represents this information: the efficient coding hypothesis and the predictive coding hypothesis. These theories, while distinct, share a common goal of optimizing the use of limited neural resources to represent the most relevant aspects of the visual world. This review aims to explore the relationship between these two paradigms and argue that they are complementary rather than competing. The efficient coding hypothesis posits that the visual system has evolved to efficiently represent the statistical structure of natural scenes. According to this theory, the brain allocates its limited resources to encode the most probable and invariant features of the environment, thereby reducing redundancy and maximizing the information content per unit of neural activity. This principle is supported by numerous studies showing that the receptive fields of neurons in early visual areas, such as the primary visual cortex (V1), are tuned to the statistical regularities of natural images. However, the efficient coding hypothesis alone does not fully account for the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the visual environment. While it is crucial to represent the most probable features, the visual system must also be able to adapt to novel and changing conditions. This is where the predictive coding hypothesis comes into play. Predictive coding suggests that the brain actively generates predictions about future sensory inputs based on past experiences and current context. By comparing these predictions with actual sensory inputs, the brain can efficiently update its internal model of the world and focus on the most relevant and unexpected information. The relationship between efficient coding and predictive coding is an area of active investigation. Some researchers argue that these two principles are not mutually exclusive but rather operate at different levels of the visual hierarchy. For instance, efficient coding may dominate in early visual areas, where the focus is on extracting basic features and reducing redundancy. In contrast, predictive coding may become more prominent in higher-level areas, where the emphasis shifts to integrating information across multiple modalities and generating more abstract representations. One way to reconcile these two paradigms is through the concept of the information bottleneck. The information bottleneck framework provides a normative approach to understanding how the brain balances the trade-off between the amount of information encoded and the complexity of the representation. According to this framework, the brain aims to retain only the most relevant information for a given task while discarding irrelevant details. This can be achieved by compressing the input data into a compact representation that captures the essential features necessary for accurate prediction. Several studies have demonstrated that the information bottleneck principle can be applied to both efficient coding and predictive coding. For example, in the context of efficient coding, the information bottleneck has been used to derive optimal receptive fields that match the statistics of natural scenes. Similarly, in the context of predictive coding, the information bottleneck has been used to develop models that can generate accurate predictions of future sensory inputs while minimizing the computational cost. Moreover, recent advances in deep learning have provided new insights into the integration of efficient coding and predictive coding. Deep neural networks, which are inspired by the hierarchical structure of the brain, have been shown to exhibit both efficient and predictive coding properties. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed to efficiently extract features from images, similar to the way early visual areas process information. At the same time, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are capable of generating predictions based on past inputs, much like the predictive coding mechanisms in the brain. In conclusion, the efficient coding and predictive coding hypotheses are not opposing theories but rather complementary principles that work together to optimize the processing of visual information. The efficient coding hypothesis ensures that the brain efficiently represents the most probable and invariant features of the environment, while the predictive coding hypothesis allows the brain to adapt to novel and changing conditions by generating accurate predictions. The integration of these principles can be understood through the lens of the information bottleneck, which provides a normative framework for balancing the trade-off between information content and computational complexity. Future research should continue to explore how these principles interact at different levels of the visual hierarchy and how they can be applied to develop more sophisticated models of visual processing.", "References": [{"title": "Possible Principles Underlying the Transformation of Sensory Messages", "authors": "H.
