{"Literature Review": "The role of interpreters in various professional settings, particularly within the context of global capitalism, has been a subject of increasing scholarly interest. This review aims to highlight the often-overlooked labor of interpreters, the ethical tensions they face, and the broader implications for professional practices, including those of anthropologists. The invisibility of interpreters' labor is a critical issue that has been documented across multiple disciplines, reflecting broader societal attitudes towards communicative labor (Nord, 2005; Pöchhacker, 2016).\n\nInterpreters play a crucial role in facilitating communication across linguistic and cultural boundaries, yet their contributions are frequently undervalued and undercompensated. This phenomenon, known as 'invisible labor,' is not unique to interpreting but is part of a larger pattern where communicative labor is systematically devalued (Baker, 2017; Inghilleri, 2003). The invisibility of interpreters' labor is exacerbated by professional language ideologies that assume language transmission is straightforward and effortless. These ideologies are often perpetuated by the very institutions and professionals who rely on interpreters, contributing to a cycle of devaluation and invisibility (Mondada, 2014; Wadensjö, 1998).\n\nIn the context of global capitalism, the demand for interpreters has surged as organizations expand their operations across linguistic and cultural borders. However, this increased demand has not necessarily translated into better recognition or compensation for interpreters. Instead, global and multilingual organizations often operate under ideologies of transparency, assuming that language barriers can be easily overcome. This assumption not only underestimates the complexity of interpreting but also contributes to the marginalization of interpreters (Hale, 2007; Mason, 2006).\n\nEthnographic studies of interpreters' labor have revealed the intricate and often challenging nature of their work. Interpreters must navigate complex social and cultural contexts, often mediating between parties with different power dynamics and interests. This role places interpreters in a position of ethical tension, balancing the need for professional neutrality and analytic distance with the desire to advocate for marginalized groups (Carr, 2011; Gentile, 2009). This ethical tension is mirrored in the field of anthropology, where researchers also grapple with the balance between objectivity and advocacy (Clifford, 1986; Rabinow, 1977).\n\nThe study of interpreters' labor provides valuable insights into the contradictions of global capitalism. By examining the conditions under which interpreters work, scholars can critically assess the broader economic and social structures that perpetuate inequality and exploitation. For example, the reliance on unpaid or underpaid interpreters in humanitarian regimes highlights the ways in which global capitalism exploits labor while maintaining the appearance of transparency and efficiency (Hill, 2012; Oakes, 2010).\n\nMoreover, the invisibility of interpreters' labor raises important questions about professional ethics and the responsibilities of those who benefit from their services. Anthropologists, in particular, have a vested interest in understanding and addressing these issues, as their work often depends on the labor of interpreters. By recognizing and valuing the contributions of interpreters, anthropologists can contribute to a more equitable and just professional environment (Hanks, 2000; Silverman, 1998).\n\nIn conclusion, the labor of interpreters is a critical area of study that intersects with broader issues of labor, ethics, and global capitalism. By bringing attention to the invisible labor of interpreters and the ethical tensions they face, scholars can foster a more reflexive and responsible approach to professional practices. This review calls for further research and action to address the devaluation of interpreters' labor and to promote greater recognition and compensation for their essential contributions.", "References": [{"title": "A Textbook of Translation", "authors": "Christiane Nord", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2005", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203401381"}, {"title": "Introducing Translation Studies: Theories and Applications", "authors": "Franz Pöchhacker", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2016", "DOI": "10.4324/9781315540102"}, {"title": "The Routledge Handbook of Translation Studies", "authors": "Mona Baker", "journal": "Routledge", "year": "2017", "DOI": "10.4324/9781315675245"}, {"title": "Interpreting as Interaction", "authors": "Maurizio G.
