{"Literature Review": "The study of religious conversion as a political phenomenon has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly within the field of anthropology. This literature review aims to synthesize the key contributions and theoretical developments in this area, focusing on the concept of 'making a difference' as both a methodological framework and a substantive outcome of religious conversion. The review will map the major strands of inquiry, contextualize their emergence, and suggest directions for future research.\n\n### Emergence and Consolidation\n\nThe anthropological engagement with religious conversion as a political phenomenon is relatively recent. Early studies often focused on conversion as a personal or individual experience, emphasizing psychological and social factors (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). However, over the past few decades, scholars have increasingly recognized the political dimensions of religious conversion, highlighting its role in shaping and being shaped by broader social and political contexts (Comaroff & Comaroff, 1997).\n\nOne of the seminal works in this area is John and Jean Comaroff's (1997) exploration of conversion among the Tswana in South Africa. They argue that conversion is not merely a change in religious belief but a transformative process that reconfigures social and political relations. This perspective has been influential in shifting the focus from individual psychology to collective dynamics and political implications.\n\n### Major Strands of Inquiry\n\n#### 1. Conversion and Identity Formation\n\nA significant strand of research examines how religious conversion contributes to the formation and transformation of individual and collective identities. This includes studies of how converts negotiate their new religious identities within existing social and political structures (Ewing, 1990). For example, Katherine Ewing (1990) explores the experiences of Muslim converts in Pakistan, showing how conversion is a process of identity negotiation that involves both personal and communal dimensions.\n\n#### 2. Conversion and Social Change\n\nAnother important strand focuses on the role of religious conversion in driving social and political change. Scholars have documented how conversion movements can challenge existing power structures and promote social justice (Hefner, 1997). Robert Hefner (1997) provides a compelling case study of Islamic revivalism in Indonesia, demonstrating how religious conversion has been a catalyst for democratic reforms and social activism.\n\n#### 3. Conversion and Political Crises\n\nRecent research has also explored the relationship between religious conversion and political crises. Studies have shown that periods of political instability and conflict can lead to increased rates of conversion, as individuals and communities seek new forms of meaning and solidarity (Mazurana, 2003). Dyan Mazurana (2003) examines the role of religious conversion in post-conflict societies, highlighting its potential to both exacerbate and mitigate tensions.\n\n### Theoretical Developments\n\nThe consolidation of religious conversion as a political phenomenon has been accompanied by several theoretical developments. One key development is the recognition of the agency of converts. Rather than viewing conversion as a passive process, scholars now emphasize the active role of individuals in shaping their religious and political trajectories (Lambek, 2002). Michael Lambek (2002) argues that conversion is a form of ethical practice, through which individuals actively engage with and transform their social and political environments.\n\nAnother important theoretical contribution is the concept of 'political theology.' This framework, developed by scholars such as Talal Asad (2003), examines the ways in which religious beliefs and practices intersect with political ideologies and institutions. Asad (2003) argues that religious conversion is not only a matter of personal faith but also a political act that can challenge or reinforce state power.\n\n### Future Directions\n\nWhile the field has made significant progress, several areas remain underexplored. One promising direction is the study of political conversions, where individuals or groups shift their political allegiances in conjunction with religious changes. This could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of political mobilization and social movement formation (Scott, 2004).\n\nAnother area for future research is the examination of the links between religious conversion and political crises. More empirical studies are needed to understand how conversion processes unfold in different types of political contexts, such as authoritarian regimes, democracies, and post-conflict societies (Mazurana, 2003).\n\nIn conclusion, the anthropological study of religious conversion as a political phenomenon has made substantial contributions to our understanding of social and political change. By framing conversion in political terms, scholars have not only made a difference in the academic discourse but have also shed light on how religious change makes a difference in the lives of individuals and communities. Future research should continue to explore these themes, with a particular focus on the interplay between religious and political transformations.", "References": [{"title": "An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology", "authors": "Pierre Bourdieu, Lo√Øc J.D.
