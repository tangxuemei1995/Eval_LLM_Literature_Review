{"Literature Review": "The discourse on decolonizing museums has gained significant traction over the past few decades, reflecting a broader shift in how cultural institutions engage with Indigenous communities and their heritage. This literature review explores the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, with a particular focus on Native North American contexts, while also drawing comparisons to international developments. The review begins by examining the theoretical and practical critiques that emerged in the 1990s, particularly in response to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990. It then delves into the evolving concerns surrounding Native American representation and public displays, the involvement of Indigenous communities in collections care, and the collaborative efforts that are reshaping museum practices. Finally, it highlights the rise of tribal museums and their pivotal role in advancing the decolonization and indigenization of museums, alongside the emerging paradigm shifts in the anthropology of museums and anthropology within museums. The 1990s marked a critical turning point in the discourse on museum decolonization, driven by a growing awareness of the ethical and political implications of museum practices. The passage of NAGPRA in 1990 was a landmark event, mandating the return of Native American cultural items, including human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony, to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated tribes. This legislation not only addressed historical injustices but also catalyzed a broader reevaluation of museum policies and practices. Scholars such as Deloria and Clough were among the first to critically examine the role of ethnographic museums in perpetuating colonial narratives and the need for more inclusive and respectful engagement with Indigenous communities. Following the implementation of NAGPRA, the focus shifted to the practical challenges and opportunities presented by the repatriation process. Museums began to grapple with the ethical and logistical aspects of returning cultural items, which often required extensive consultation and collaboration with Indigenous communities. This period saw the emergence of new models of partnership and co-curation, where Indigenous voices and perspectives were increasingly integrated into museum exhibitions and collections management. The representation of Native American cultures in museums has been another focal point of decolonization efforts. Traditional museum displays often presented Indigenous peoples through a Eurocentric lens, reinforcing stereotypes and marginalizing Indigenous voices. In response, scholars and curators have advocated for more authentic and nuanced representations that reflect the diversity and complexity of Native American experiences. This has led to the development of new interpretive frameworks and methodologies, such as the use of Indigenous knowledge systems and storytelling techniques. Collaborative approaches have also extended to the care and management of museum collections. Indigenous communities have become active participants in the preservation and interpretation of their cultural heritage, challenging the notion of museums as neutral custodians of artifacts. This shift has been particularly evident in the context of repatriation, where museums and Indigenous communities work together to ensure that returned items are cared for in culturally appropriate ways. The rise of tribal museums has further contributed to the decolonization and indigenization of museum practices. These institutions are often established and operated by Indigenous communities themselves, providing a platform for self-representation and cultural revitalization. Tribal museums not only preserve and showcase Indigenous heritage but also serve as educational centers and community hubs. The impact of these decolonization efforts extends beyond individual museums and communities, influencing broader paradigms in the anthropology of museums and anthropology within museums. Scholars have begun to question the traditional boundaries between academia and community, advocating for a more participatory and reciprocal relationship. This shift is reflected in the growing body of literature on community-based research and the role of Indigenous methodologies in museum studies. In conclusion, the decolonization of museums is a multifaceted and ongoing process that involves critical reflection, collaboration, and innovation. The trajectory of decolonization efforts, particularly in the context of Native North American heritage, highlights the transformative potential of these initiatives. As museums continue to evolve, the integration of Indigenous perspectives and practices will be crucial in creating more just and inclusive cultural institutions. The rise of tribal museums and the adoption of community-based approaches represent significant steps toward a paradigm shift in museum practices, one that prioritizes the voices and experiences of Indigenous communities.", "References": [{"title": "The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act: Background and Legislative History", "authors": "C.
