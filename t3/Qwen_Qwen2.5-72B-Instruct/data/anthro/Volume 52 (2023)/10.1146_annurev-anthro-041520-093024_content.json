{"Literature Review": "Global health interventions have been a focal point of both scholarly and practical interest, yet the nuanced ways in which these interventions are conceptualized and executed often remain under-examined. This literature review explores three key areas of anthropological inquiry into global health interventions: those serving imperial and military objectives, those driven by 'magic bullet' approaches from laboratory science, and those based on deterministic modeling techniques. Additionally, it highlights the concept of 'intervention otherwise,' which emphasizes alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise that challenge dominant power structures.", "References": [{"title": "Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor", "authors": "Paul Farmer", "journal": "University of California Press", "year": "2005"}, {"title": "When People Come First: Critical Studies in Global Health", "authors": "Jo√£o Biehl, Adriana Petryna", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2013"}, {"title": "Biomedicalization: Technoscience, Health, and Illness in the U.S.", "authors": "Margaret Lock, Vinh-Kim Nguyen", "journal": "Duke University Press", "year": "2010"}, {"title": "Global Health, Biomedicine, and the Postcolonial State", "authors": "M.
