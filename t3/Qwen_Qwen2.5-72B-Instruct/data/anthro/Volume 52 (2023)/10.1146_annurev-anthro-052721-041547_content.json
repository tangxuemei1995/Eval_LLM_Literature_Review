{"Literature Review": "The study of algorithms has become increasingly important in social science, yet researchers often struggle to define the object of their inquiry. This literature review synthesizes various perspectives to propose that algorithms should be studied within the context of algorithmic ecologies, which encompass multiple dimensions including imaginaries, infrastructures, interfaces, identities, and investments and interests. By examining these modalities, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how algorithms operate and influence social processes.\n\n### Imaginaries\nSocial imaginaries refer to the collective understandings and shared beliefs that shape how people perceive and interact with the world. In the context of algorithms, imaginaries play a crucial role in how these technologies are conceptualized and integrated into society. For instance, Couldry and Hepp (2017) argue that digital media and algorithms are often imbued with utopian visions of efficiency, transparency, and democratization. These imaginaries can influence public discourse and policy-making, shaping the ways in which algorithms are developed and deployed. Similarly, Bucher (2018) explores how social media platforms, driven by algorithmic recommendations, create and reinforce certain cultural narratives and values. Understanding these imaginaries is essential for grasping the broader social implications of algorithms.\n\n### Infrastructures\nAlgorithms do not exist in isolation; they are embedded within complex technological and organizational infrastructures. The infrastructure perspective emphasizes the material and institutional contexts that enable and constrain algorithmic processes. Star and Ruhleder (1996) highlight the importance of studying the 'work' that infrastructures perform, which includes the maintenance, standardization, and coordination required to keep systems operational. In the context of algorithms, this means examining the data centers, networks, and software architectures that support algorithmic operations. Kitchin (2014) further argues that smart city initiatives, which rely heavily on algorithms, are deeply intertwined with urban infrastructures, influencing everything from traffic management to public safety. By focusing on infrastructures, researchers can uncover the hidden mechanisms that underpin algorithmic systems.\n\n### Interfaces\nInterfaces are the points of interaction between users and algorithms. They mediate how people experience and engage with algorithmic processes. Dourish (2001) emphasizes the importance of studying interfaces as sites of social and technical negotiation. For example, the design of user interfaces on social media platforms can significantly impact user behavior and data collection practices. Gandy (1993) discusses how interfaces can be designed to manipulate user choices, creating what he terms 'panoptic sort'â€”a form of surveillance and control. By analyzing interfaces, researchers can gain insights into the ways in which algorithms shape and are shaped by human interactions.\n\n### Identities\nAlgorithms play a significant role in the construction and performance of identities. They can both reflect and reinforce existing social categories and hierarchies. Couldry and Powell (2014) explore how algorithms contribute to the formation of digital selves, influencing how individuals present themselves online and how they are perceived by others. Algorithms can also perpetuate biases and inequalities, as shown by Noble (2018), who examines how search algorithms can reinforce racial stereotypes and marginalize certain groups. By studying the relationship between algorithms and identities, researchers can uncover the ways in which these technologies contribute to social stratification and power dynamics.\n\n### Investments and Interests\nFinally, the study of algorithms must consider the economic and political interests that drive their development and deployment. Algorithms are often created and maintained by powerful actors, such as tech companies and governments, who have specific goals and incentives. Zuboff (2019) introduces the concept of 'surveillance capitalism,' where algorithms are used to extract and monetize personal data. This perspective highlights the economic motivations behind algorithmic systems and the potential for exploitation. Similarly, Couldry (2012) discusses the role of algorithms in the media industry, where they are used to optimize content distribution and advertising. By examining the investments and interests at play, researchers can better understand the broader socio-economic context in which algorithms operate.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of algorithms should be approached through the lens of algorithmic ecologies, which encompass imaginaries, infrastructures, interfaces, identities, and investments and interests. This holistic approach allows researchers to capture the multifaceted nature of algorithms and their impact on society. By integrating insights from various literatures, this review provides a framework for future research in this area.", "References": [{"title": "The Mediated Construction of Reality", "authors": "Nick Couldry, Andreas Hepp", "journal": "Polity Press", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/10551.001.0001"}, {"title": "If...
