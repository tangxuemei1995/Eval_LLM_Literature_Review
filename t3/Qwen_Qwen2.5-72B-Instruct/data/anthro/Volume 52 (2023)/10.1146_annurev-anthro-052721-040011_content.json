{"Literature Review": "Critical University Studies (CUS) represents an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that critically examines the structures, functions, and impacts of higher education institutions. This body of scholarship is particularly concerned with the ways in which universities are entangled with broader national and global institutions and political movements. By adopting an expansive definition of CUS, this review draws from a diverse array of scholarly perspectives that trace the historical and contemporary roles of universities in perpetuating systemic inequalities and injustices. One of the foundational aspects of CUS is its focus on the historical roots of the American university. Scholars such as Craig Steven Wilder (2013) have meticulously documented how early American universities were deeply intertwined with the slave trade, racial science, and the displacement of Native American communities. Wilder's work highlights the complicity of these institutions in the perpetuation of racial hierarchies and the extraction of wealth from marginalized populations. This historical context is crucial for understanding the enduring legacies of these practices within contemporary higher education. Building on this historical foundation, CUS also engages with the ongoing role of universities in reinforcing state interests and perpetuating carceral and settler logics. Scholars like Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2007) and Angela Y. Davis (2011) have emphasized the connections between higher education and the prison-industrial complex. They argue that universities often serve as ideological and material supports for carceral systems, contributing to the criminalization and marginalization of certain communities, particularly those of color. This perspective underscores the need for a critical examination of the university's role in perpetuating systemic violence and inequality. Another key dimension of CUS is its engagement with decolonial and abolitionist frameworks. Decolonial scholars such as Walter Mignolo (2011) and Tuck and Yang (2012) have critiqued the ways in which Western universities have historically and continue to perpetuate colonial logics. These scholars advocate for the decolonization of knowledge production and the dismantling of epistemic structures that privilege Western perspectives. Similarly, abolitionist scholars like Mariame Kaba (2020) and Beth E. Richie (2012) call for the abolition of carceral systems and the transformation of universities into spaces that actively support social justice and liberation. The intersection of CUS with anthropology provides a rich ground for exploring the challenges and possibilities of antiracist and anti-imperial scholarship. Anthropologists such as Audra Simpson (2014) and Talal Asad (2007) have critically examined the discipline's historical ties to colonialism and its ongoing role in reinforcing racial and cultural hierarchies. Simpson's work, for example, highlights the ways in which anthropological research has been complicit in the dispossession and erasure of Indigenous peoples. Asad, on the other hand, critiques the Eurocentric biases that have shaped anthropological theory and practice, calling for a more reflexive and inclusive approach to the discipline. The emerging field of abolitionist anthropology further enriches the conversation within CUS. Scholars like Zoé Samudzi (2021) and Eve Tuck (2013) have advocated for an abolitionist approach to anthropology that seeks to dismantle carceral systems and promote social justice. Samudzi's work, for instance, explores the intersections of race, gender, and power within the discipline, while Tuck emphasizes the importance of decolonizing methodologies and centering the voices of marginalized communities. In conclusion, CUS offers a powerful framework for critically examining the structures and impacts of higher education institutions. By drawing on a wide range of scholarly perspectives, including those focused on historical complicity, ongoing carceral and settler logics, and decolonial and abolitionist frameworks, CUS provides a robust foundation for advocating for transformative change within the academy. The intersection of CUS with anthropology highlights the need for a critical and reflexive approach to the discipline, one that actively works to dismantle systemic inequalities and promote social justice.", "References": [{"title": "Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled History of America's Universities", "authors": "Craig Steven Wilder", "journal": "Bloomsbury Publishing USA", "year": "2013"}, {"title": "Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California", "authors": "Ruth Wilson Gilmore", "journal": "University of California Press", "year": "2007"}, {"title": "Are Prisons Obsolete?", "authors": "Angela Y.
