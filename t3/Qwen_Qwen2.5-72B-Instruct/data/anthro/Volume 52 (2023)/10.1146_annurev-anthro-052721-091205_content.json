{"Literature Review": "The intersection of social movements, power, and mediated visibility has been a rich area of inquiry for anthropologists and ethnographers of media. This literature review synthesizes key findings from studies that examine the production, circulation, and consumption of visual media within the context of social movements and hegemonic power structures. By exploring these themes, we gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which social movements challenge and negotiate power, and how media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and political action. The anthropological study of media has evolved significantly since the turn of the twenty-first century, with a growing emphasis on the ways in which media technologies and practices intersect with social and political dynamics. One of the central themes in this body of literature is the role of visual media in amplifying the voices of marginalized groups and facilitating collective action. For instance, Couldry (2012) argues that media technologies provide a platform for social movements to challenge dominant narratives and assert their presence in the public sphere. This is particularly evident in the use of social media platforms, which have become essential tools for organizing protests, disseminating information, and mobilizing support (Bennett & Segerberg, 2013). However, the relationship between social movements and media is not one-sided. Media institutions, including both traditional and digital platforms, are often embedded within broader power structures that can either support or suppress the messages of social movements. For example, Couldry and Hepp (2017) highlight the ways in which corporate media outlets may selectively cover or ignore social movements, thereby influencing public opinion and political outcomes. This selective coverage can be seen as a form of symbolic violence, where the absence of representation in mainstream media can marginalize and delegitimize social movements (Bourdieu, 1991). Moreover, the production and circulation of visual media by social movements themselves have become increasingly sophisticated. Activists and organizers are leveraging a range of media forms, from videos and photographs to memes and live streams, to create compelling narratives and engage diverse audiences. Castells (2015) emphasizes the importance of networked communication in contemporary social movements, where horizontal and decentralized structures enable rapid dissemination of information and coordination of actions. This networked approach has been particularly effective in movements such as Black Lives Matter, where the use of hashtags and viral content has helped to sustain momentum and draw attention to systemic issues (Freelon et al., 2016). The role of states and corporations in shaping the media environment is another critical dimension of this research. States often employ media as a tool for surveillance and control, monitoring and sometimes censoring the activities of social movements. For example, Zuboff (2019) discusses the concept of surveillance capitalism, where data collected through digital platforms is used to manipulate public behavior and reinforce existing power structures. Similarly, corporations play a significant role in the media landscape, often aligning with state interests to maintain the status quo and protect their economic interests (McChesney, 2013). Despite these challenges, social movements continue to find innovative ways to navigate and subvert media systems. Ethnographic studies have shown that activists often develop their own media infrastructures, such as independent news outlets and community radio stations, to ensure that their voices are heard (Couldry, 2012). These alternative media forms serve as counterpublics, providing spaces for marginalized groups to articulate their concerns and build solidarity (Warner, 2002). The consumption of media by the public is also a crucial aspect of this dynamic. Audiences play an active role in interpreting and responding to media content, and their engagement can either amplify or undermine the messages of social movements. Couldry and Hepp (2017) argue that the concept of media repertoires, which refers to the diverse array of media sources and practices that individuals draw upon, is essential for understanding how people make sense of and act upon the information they receive. This concept highlights the agency of media consumers and the potential for grassroots mobilization. In conclusion, the anthropological study of media, social movements, and power offers a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between media technologies, political structures, and collective action. By examining the production, circulation, and consumption of visual media, researchers can uncover the strategies and tactics employed by social movements to challenge hegemonic power and envision alternative political futures. As media environments continue to evolve, it is crucial for scholars to remain attuned to these dynamics and to explore new avenues for research that can inform and support the ongoing struggles for social justice.", "References": [{"title": "The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics", "authors": "W.
