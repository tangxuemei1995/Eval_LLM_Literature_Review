{"Literature Review": "Human habitation and adaptation to extreme environments have been a focal point in anthropological research for over a century. These environments, characterized by extreme heat, cold, and high altitude, present significant challenges to human physiology and survival. Early studies focused on the physiological mechanisms that enable humans to adapt to these conditions, but recent research has expanded our understanding of the complex interplay between environmental stressors, metabolic responses, thermoregulation, and social factors such as structural inequality and climate change. One of the most extensively studied aspects of human adaptation to extreme environments is thermoregulation. In hot climates, the human body must efficiently dissipate heat to maintain core temperature within a safe range. Early research by Hales and Burrell (1974) demonstrated that acclimatization to heat involves a series of physiological adaptations, including increased sweating and improved cardiovascular efficiency. More recent studies have further elucidated the role of genetic factors in heat tolerance. For instance, Rana et al. (2016) identified specific genetic variants associated with enhanced heat tolerance in populations living in arid regions. In contrast, cold environments pose different challenges, primarily related to the conservation of body heat. Research by Savourey and Launay (2009) highlighted the importance of non-shivering thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue in maintaining core temperature in cold conditions. Additionally, cultural practices such as clothing and shelter play a crucial role in cold adaptation. For example, studies by Park and Kim (2015) have shown that traditional clothing designs in Arctic communities are highly effective in insulating the body against cold temperatures. High-altitude environments, characterized by low oxygen levels, present unique physiological challenges. Early work by West (1985) described the hypoxic response, which includes increased ventilation and red blood cell production. Recent research has delved into the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation. Beall et al. (2010) identified specific genetic polymorphisms in Tibetan populations that confer a survival advantage at high altitudes. These genetic adaptations allow for more efficient oxygen utilization and reduced risk of altitude sickness. While physiological adaptations are crucial for survival in extreme environments, recent research has emphasized the importance of social and structural factors. Structural inequality, such as poverty and lack of access to resources, can exacerbate the negative impacts of extreme environments on health and well-being. For example, a study by Ebi and McGregor (2008) found that marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by heatwaves due to limited access to air conditioning and other cooling measures. Similarly, climate change is intensifying the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, further compounding the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2014) highlighted the disproportionate impact of climate change on low-income and marginalized communities. The intersection of extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change has led to a growing interest in the concept of resilience. Resilience refers to the ability of individuals and communities to withstand and recover from environmental stressors. Research by Adger et al. (2005) has shown that social capital, community organization, and access to resources are key determinants of resilience. For instance, a study by Ford et al. (2016) in the Arctic region found that strong community networks and traditional knowledge play a vital role in enhancing resilience to climate change. Future research in this field will need to adopt a holistic approach that integrates physiological, social, and environmental perspectives. Understanding how extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change are embodied and mitigated will be crucial for developing strategies to improve human health and well-being in a rapidly changing world. This will require interdisciplinary collaboration and a focus on both individual and community-level interventions. By addressing the multifaceted nature of these challenges, researchers can contribute to the development of more effective policies and practices that promote resilience and adaptation in extreme environments.", "References": [{"title": "Heat acclimatization in man: a review", "authors": "Hales, J.
