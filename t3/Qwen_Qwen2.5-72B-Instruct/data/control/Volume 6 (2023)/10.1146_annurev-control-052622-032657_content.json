{"Literature Review": "Electric power systems are experiencing a significant transformation as they shift from traditional fossil fuel-based power plants to low-inertia systems dominated by power electronics and renewable energy sources. This transition introduces new control challenges and necessitates a reevaluation of existing models and control strategies. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on the control of low-inertia power systems, focusing on modeling, grid-connected power converter control, frequency dynamics, and system-level services. The integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, into the power grid has led to a reduction in system inertia. Traditional synchronous generators, which have high inertia, are being replaced by power electronic converters that have minimal or no inherent inertia. This shift has profound implications for the stability and reliability of the power system. According to [1], the reduced inertia can lead to faster frequency deviations and increased risk of instability, particularly during disturbances. Therefore, understanding and managing the dynamics of low-inertia systems is crucial for maintaining grid stability. Accurate modeling of low-inertia systems is essential for developing effective control strategies. Traditional models often assume high inertia and may not accurately capture the behavior of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. [2] highlights the importance of incorporating detailed models of power electronic converters and their control algorithms in system simulations. These models should account for the fast dynamics of power electronics and the interactions between multiple converters. [3] further emphasizes the need for hybrid models that combine physical and data-driven approaches to better represent the complex behavior of low-inertia systems. Grid-connected power converters play a central role in low-inertia systems. They are responsible for interfacing renewable energy sources with the grid and must operate efficiently and reliably under varying conditions. [4] discusses the challenges of controlling power converters in low-inertia systems, including the need for fast response times and robustness to disturbances. One promising approach is grid-forming control, which allows converters to emulate the behavior of synchronous generators and provide grid support services. [5] provides a detailed analysis of grid-forming control strategies and their effectiveness in stabilizing low-inertia systems. Frequency regulation is a critical aspect of power system operation, and the reduced inertia in modern grids poses significant challenges. [6] investigates the frequency dynamics of low-inertia systems and identifies key factors that influence frequency response, such as the type and placement of control resources. The study suggests that distributed control strategies, where multiple resources work together to maintain frequency stability, can be more effective than centralized approaches. [7] explores the use of dynamic virtual power plants (VPPs) to enhance frequency regulation in low-inertia systems. VPPs aggregate multiple distributed energy resources and can provide flexible and responsive control actions. In addition to frequency regulation, low-inertia systems require a range of other system-level services, such as voltage support, reactive power management, and fault ride-through capabilities. [8] examines the role of advanced control techniques in providing these services and highlights the importance of coordinated control strategies. For example, coordinated control of multiple power converters can improve the overall performance of the system and enhance its resilience to disturbances. [9] discusses the application of model predictive control (MPC) in low-inertia systems, demonstrating its ability to optimize multiple control objectives simultaneously. The transition to low-inertia power systems presents significant challenges but also offers opportunities for innovation in control and modeling. A system-theoretic approach is essential to understand the complex interactions within these systems and to develop effective control strategies. Future research should focus on developing more accurate and comprehensive models, refining control algorithms, and exploring the potential of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. By addressing these challenges, we can ensure the reliable and efficient operation of low-inertia power systems as they continue to evolve.", "References": [{"title": "Impact of Reduced Inertia on Power System Stability", "authors": "J.
