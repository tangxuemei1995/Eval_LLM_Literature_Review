{"Literature Review": "Embodied communication, the process through which robots and humans interact through physical means, has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Early research primarily focused on the development of safe and effective hardware, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and robot arms, which enabled physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) (Huang et al., 2010). These devices were designed to ensure that humans could safely come into contact with robotic systems and communicate their intentions effectively. However, as hardware capabilities have advanced, the focus has shifted towards developing algorithms that can support more fluent and expressive interactions (Chernova & Veloso, 2009).\n\nOne of the early algorithmic approaches in pHRI was admittance control, which is based on physical analogies. Admittance control involves the robot responding to forces applied by the human, allowing for intuitive and natural interaction (Hogan, 1985). This approach has been widely used in applications such as robotic rehabilitation, where patients can guide the movement of a robotic arm to perform exercises (Burgar et al., 2000). While admittance control provides a basic level of interaction, it is limited in its ability to handle complex tasks and interpret higher-level human intentions.\n\nAs computing power has increased, more sophisticated algorithms have been developed to enhance pHRI. One such approach is impedance control, which allows the robot to adjust its stiffness and damping properties in response to the environment and the user's actions (Colgate & Hogan, 1988). Impedance control has been particularly useful in applications where the robot needs to adapt to varying conditions, such as in surgical robotics (Salisbury & Craig, 1982). However, while impedance control improves the robot's adaptability, it still falls short in enabling versatile human-robot collaboration.\n\nTo address these limitations, researchers have turned to higher-level reasoning and multimodal communication. Multimodal communication involves the integration of multiple sensory inputs, such as visual, auditory, and haptic feedback, to create a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction (Krupke et al., 2017). For example, a robot might use visual cues to understand a human's gestures and haptic feedback to sense the force applied during a physical interaction. This approach has been shown to improve the robot's ability to interpret human intentions and respond appropriately (Fong et al., 2003).\n\nMachine learning techniques have also played a crucial role in advancing pHRI. Reinforcement learning, in particular, has been used to enable robots to learn from continuous interaction with humans (Kormushev et al., 2010). By receiving feedback from the human, the robot can adapt its behavior to better align with the user's preferences and goals. This approach has been successfully applied in assistive robotics, where robots can learn to assist users in performing daily activities (Correll et al., 2011).\n\nDespite these advancements, current algorithmic approaches still face challenges in achieving versatile human-robot collaboration. Most existing systems are task-specific and lack the ability to generalize to new situations (Chen et al., 2016). To overcome this limitation, researchers are exploring the concept of emergent embodied dialogue, which involves bidirectional, multimodal communication that can be learned through continuous interaction (Breazeal, 2003). Emergent embodied dialogue aims to create robots that can engage in natural and adaptive conversations with humans, using both verbal and non-verbal cues to understand and respond to the user's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of embodied communication in pHRI has made significant progress, moving from basic physical analogies to more sophisticated algorithms that integrate multimodal communication and machine learning. However, the next frontier in pHRI is the development of emergent embodied dialogue, which promises to enable more versatile and adaptive human-robot collaboration. Future research should focus on creating algorithms that can learn from continuous interaction and adapt to a wide range of tasks and environments.", "References": [{"title": "A Survey of Robot Learning from Demonstration", "authors": "Sonia Chernova, Manuela M.
