{"Literature Review": "Austrian economics, a distinct and influential school of economic thought, has evolved significantly over the years, contributing to various fields within economics and beyond. This literature review aims to synthesize recent contributions from the Austrian school, categorizing them into several research 'buckets' to highlight their ongoing relevance and impact on scientific discourse. These buckets include robust political economy, macroeconomics, monetary economics, entrepreneurship and the market process, development economics, behavioral economics, governance, social economy, collective action challenges related to natural disaster recovery and infectious disease, and war and defense.", "References": [{"title": "Calculation and Coordination: Essays on Socialism and Transitional Political Economy", "authors": "Peter J.
