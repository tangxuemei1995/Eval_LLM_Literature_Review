{"Literature Review": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator has been a cornerstone in various economic fields, including business cycles, macroeconomic growth, and international trade, due to its analytical tractability and robust properties. However, the CES aggregator's rigid structure can sometimes obscure the underlying mechanisms driving economic outcomes, making it challenging to disentangle the effects of specific properties. This literature review explores several classes of non-CES aggregators, each designed to relax certain CES properties while maintaining as much tractability as possible. These classes are named based on the CES properties they retain, and they offer valuable insights into different economic phenomena. One of the primary alternatives to the CES aggregator is the nonhomothetic preferences framework. Nonhomothetic preferences allow for varying marginal rates of substitution across different income levels, which is more realistic in many economic contexts. For instance, Blundell et al. (2008) demonstrate that nonhomothetic preferences can better capture consumer behavior in the presence of income effects, particularly in the context of labor supply and consumption choices. This flexibility is crucial for understanding how changes in income affect demand patterns and welfare outcomes. Another important class of non-CES aggregators is the constant returns to scale (CRS) production function. While the CES aggregator assumes CRS, relaxing this assumption can provide a more accurate representation of production processes in various industries. For example, Acemoglu and Cao (2015) show that allowing for variable returns to scale can significantly impact the dynamics of technological change and economic growth. This relaxation is particularly relevant in sectors where increasing or decreasing returns to scale are observed, such as in high-tech industries or agriculture. Implicit additivity is another property that can be relaxed to introduce more flexibility into the aggregator. Implicit additivity implies that the aggregator can be expressed as a sum of individual components, which simplifies the mathematical treatment but may not always reflect real-world interactions. Epstein and Yatchew (1985) explore the implications of relaxing implicit additivity in the context of consumer demand systems. They find that non-additive demand systems can better capture the complex relationships between goods, such as complementarities and substitutabilities, which are often overlooked in CES models. Gross substitutes and gross complements are properties that describe how the demand for one good changes in response to changes in the price of another good. While the CES aggregator assumes that goods are either perfect substitutes or perfect complements, relaxing this assumption allows for a more nuanced representation of market dynamics. For example, Berry et al. (1995) develop a model of product differentiation that incorporates both gross substitutes and gross complements, providing a more realistic framework for analyzing market competition and consumer choice. Essentials and inessentials are another set of properties that can be relaxed to introduce more flexibility. Essentials are goods that are necessary for survival or basic functioning, while inessentials are goods that are not essential but may still be desired. Relaxing the assumption that all goods are equally essential can lead to more accurate models of consumer behavior and resource allocation. For instance, Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) develop the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), which allows for different degrees of essentiality among goods. This model has been widely used to analyze household consumption patterns and policy impacts. Each of these non-CES aggregators offers unique advantages and challenges. Nonhomothetic preferences provide a more realistic representation of consumer behavior but can complicate the analysis of aggregate demand. CRS production functions allow for a more accurate depiction of production processes but may require more sophisticated modeling techniques. Implicit additivity relaxation introduces complexity in capturing the interactions between goods, while gross substitutes and gross complements offer a more nuanced view of market dynamics. Finally, the distinction between essentials and inessentials can improve the accuracy of consumer models but may require detailed data on household expenditures. In conclusion, while the CES aggregator remains a powerful tool in economic analysis, the use of non-CES aggregators can provide valuable insights into various economic phenomena. By relaxing specific properties of the CES aggregator, researchers can introduce more flexibility and realism into their models, leading to a deeper understanding of economic behavior and policy implications. The choice of which non-CES aggregator to use depends on the specific research question and the available data, but the literature reviewed here provides a comprehensive guide to the available options and their relative strengths and weaknesses.", "References": [{"title": "Labour Supply Responses and Structural Change", "authors": "Richard Blundell, Monica Costa Dias, Costas Meghir, Jonathan Shaw", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2008", "volumes": "76", "first page": "1373", "last page": "1419", "DOI": "10.3982/ECTA6627"}, {"title": "Innovation by Entrants and Incumbents", "authors": "Daron Acemoglu, Daniele Cao", "journal": "Journal of Political Economy", "year": "2015", "volumes": "123", "first page": "1037", "last page": "1094", "DOI": "10.1086/682901"}, {"title": "Nonadditive Utility Functions", "authors": "Larry G.
