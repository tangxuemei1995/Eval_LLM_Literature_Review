{"Literature Review": "The economic relationship between the United States and China has been a focal point of global trade dynamics over the past two decades. This literature review synthesizes theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of US–China trade relations, focusing on the China shock, the recent trade war, and their broader implications. The term 'China shock' refers to the significant economic impact of China's rapid integration into the global economy, particularly after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. This event marked a turning point in international trade, leading to a surge in Chinese exports and a corresponding shift in global production patterns. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) were among the first to quantify the China shock, demonstrating that regions in the US more exposed to Chinese imports experienced significant declines in manufacturing employment and wages. Their study highlighted the uneven distribution of gains and losses from trade, with certain industries and regions bearing the brunt of the negative effects. Subsequent research has further explored the mechanisms through which the China shock affected the US economy. Acemoglu et al. (2016) extended the analysis by incorporating input-output linkages and dynamic spatial economics. They found that the decline in manufacturing employment was not solely due to direct competition from Chinese imports but also due to the ripple effects through supply chains and local labor markets. This comprehensive approach underscores the complexity of the China shock and its far-reaching consequences. Despite the significant impact of the China shock, it is important to note that China's trade expansion was not the sole driver of the decline in US manufacturing employment. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2016) conducted a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to the decline in manufacturing jobs and concluded that technological change and automation played a more substantial role than trade with China. This finding challenges the narrative that the China shock was the primary culprit for job losses in the US manufacturing sector. The recent US–China trade war, initiated in 2018, represents a significant shift in trade policy. The imposition of tariffs on a wide range of goods from both countries aimed to address perceived imbalances and protect domestic industries. However, the economic effects of these policies have been widely debated. Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) evaluated the welfare impacts of the trade war using a general equilibrium model and found that the tariffs led to substantial welfare losses for both the US and China. The study highlighted that the costs of the trade war were borne primarily by consumers and firms, rather than the intended beneficiaries. Another critical aspect of the trade war is its impact on employment. Pierce and Schott (2020) analyzed the employment effects of the tariffs and found that while some sectors experienced job gains, the overall effect on employment was minimal. This suggests that the trade war did not significantly alter the trajectory of US employment, contrary to the expectations of policymakers. The effectiveness of the trade war in reversing the distributional effects of the China shock is also questionable. Ebenstein et al. (2020) examined the long-term impacts of the trade war and concluded that it did little to mitigate the adverse effects of the China shock on US workers. Instead, the trade war exacerbated existing inequalities and created new challenges for businesses and consumers. In addition to the economic impacts, the trade war has had broader implications for global trade governance. Baldwin and Evenett (2020) discussed the potential long-term consequences of increased trade protectionism, including the fragmentation of global value chains and the erosion of multilateral institutions. They argued that the trade war could lead to a more fragmented and less efficient global trading system, with negative repercussions for economic growth and development. The literature also highlights the importance of policy responses to mitigate the negative effects of trade shocks. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2019) proposed a range of policy interventions, including retraining programs, infrastructure investments, and social safety nets, to support workers and communities affected by the China shock. These policies aim to ensure that the benefits of trade are more equitably distributed and that the transition to a more integrated global economy is smoother. In conclusion, the economic effects of US–China trade relations over the past two decades reveal a complex interplay of gains and losses. The China shock created significant disruptions in the US economy, but it was not the primary cause of the decline in manufacturing employment. The recent trade war generated welfare losses and had limited employment effects, failing to reverse the distributional impacts of the China shock. Moving forward, policymakers must consider a balanced approach that leverages the benefits of trade while addressing the needs of those adversely affected.", "References": [{"title": "The China Shock: Learning from Labor Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade", "authors": "David H.
