{"Literature Review": "Over the past two decades, the landscape of international finance has been significantly reshaped by the rapid growth of non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), particularly through the expansion of open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This shift has profound implications for emerging markets (EMs), which have increasingly relied on these sources of external financing. According to a study by Bruno and Shin (2015), NBFI now accounts for nearly half of the external financing flows to EMs, surpassing traditional cross-border lending by global banks. This transformation has both positive and negative dimensions, influencing the stability and resilience of EM financial systems. The positive aspects of this trend include enhanced risk sharing and greater access to diverse forms of financing. Investment funds, by pooling resources from a wide range of investors, can allocate capital more efficiently across borders, thereby reducing the concentration of risks in any single market (Acharya et al., 2017). This diversification can help EMs attract stable and long-term investments, fostering economic development and financial integration. For instance, research by Obstfeld and Taylor (2019) highlights how investment funds have facilitated the flow of capital into EMs, contributing to infrastructure projects and other critical sectors. However, the growing reliance on investment funds also introduces new vulnerabilities, especially during periods of global financial market stress. A key concern is the liquidity and redemption risks associated with these funds. During market downturns, investors may rush to redeem their shares, leading to significant outflows from EMs. This phenomenon, often referred to as 'sudden stops,' can exacerbate financial instability and economic downturns in EMs (Rey, 2013). Studies by Adrian and Shin (2010) and Drehmann et al. (2011) have shown that the procyclicality of investment fund flows can amplify the impact of global risk shocks, making EMs more susceptible to financial crises. Benchmark-driven investments, particularly passive funds, are particularly sensitive to global risk shocks. These funds, which aim to replicate the performance of specific indices, tend to follow mechanical rules for asset allocation, making them more prone to herd behavior. Research by Chernenko and Sunderam (2018) demonstrates that passive funds are more likely to experience large outflows during periods of market stress, as they lack the flexibility to adjust their portfolios based on changing market conditions. In contrast, active funds, which are managed by professional portfolio managers, can make more nuanced decisions and are generally less volatile (Brunnermeier and Pedersen, 2009). The sensitivity of passive funds to global risk shocks is further compounded by the role of the US dollar in international finance. Tightening US dollar funding conditions, often a result of monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, can trigger significant capital flight from EMs. A study by Forbes and Warnock (2012) found that changes in US interest rates have a substantial impact on the flows of investment funds to EMs, with higher rates leading to reduced inflows and increased outflows. This relationship underscores the importance of global financial conditions in shaping the behavior of investment funds and their impact on EMs. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to EMs during times of global stress poses significant financial stability concerns. When large volumes of capital suddenly leave EMs, it can lead to currency depreciation, rising interest rates, and reduced credit availability, all of which can have severe economic consequences. To mitigate these risks, policymakers have increasingly turned to macroprudential measures. These policies aim to reduce the procyclicality of financial flows and enhance the resilience of EM financial systems. For example, the use of capital controls, liquidity requirements, and other regulatory tools can help stabilize capital flows and prevent excessive leverage (Claessens et al., 2012). In conclusion, the rise of non-bank financial intermediation, particularly through investment funds, has transformed the landscape of international finance, providing EMs with new opportunities for growth and development. However, this shift also introduces new vulnerabilities, particularly during periods of global financial stress. The procyclicality of investment fund flows, driven by benchmark-driven investments and influenced by global risk shocks, poses significant challenges for financial stability. Policymakers must carefully consider the role of macroprudential policies to ensure that the benefits of NBFI are realized while minimizing the potential risks.", "References": [{"title": "Cross-Border Banking Flows and Capital Account Policies", "authors": "Bruno, V., Shin, H.S.", "journal": "Journal of International Economics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "96", "first page": "S1", "last page": "S14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jinteco.2015.03.001"}, {"title": "A Theory of Systemic Risk and Design of Prudential Tools", "authors": "Acharya, V.V., Pedersen, L.H., Philippon, T., Richardson, M.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "126", "first page": "25", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2017.05.001"}, {"title": "Capital Flows and the Current Account", "authors": "Obstfeld, M., Taylor, A.M.", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2019", "volumes": "109", "first page": "1", "last page": "34", "DOI": "10.1257/aer.20170855"}, {"title": "Liquidity and Leverage", "authors": "Adrian, T., Shin, H.S.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Intermediation", "year": "2010", "volumes": "19", "first page": "418", "last page": "452", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfi.2010.01.002"}, {"title": "An Early Warning Indicator of Systemic Stress", "authors": "Drehmann, M., Borio, C., Tsatsaronis, K.", "journal": "BIS Quarterly Review", "year": "2011", "volumes": "March", "first page": "53", "last page": "63", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1793025"}, {"title": "The Sudden Stop Hypothesis", "authors": "Rey, H.", "journal": "NBER Working Paper", "year": "2013", "volumes": "19222", "first page": "1", "last page": "45", "DOI": "10.3386/w19222"}, {"title": "The Flight to Quality and the Flight to Liquidity", "authors": "Chernenko, S., Sunderam, A.", "journal": "Review of Financial Studies", "year": "2018", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1285", "last page": "1328", "DOI": "10.1093/rfs/hhx118"}, {"title": "Market Liquidity as a Sentiment Indicator", "authors": "Brunnermeier, M.K., Pedersen, L.H.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Markets", "year": "2009", "volumes": "12", "first page": "297", "last page": "331", "DOI": "10.1016/j.finmar.2009.01.001"}, {"title": "Capital Flows, Push Factors, and Macroeconomic Policies", "authors": "Forbes, K.J., Warnock, F.E.", "journal": "IMF Economic Review", "year": "2012", "volumes": "60", "first page": "54", "last page": "94", "DOI": "10.1057/imfer.2012.1"}, {"title": "Capital Flows and Real Exchange Rates", "authors": "Claessens, S., Kose, M.A., Terrones, M.E.", "journal": "Journal of International Economics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "87", "first page": "260", "last page": "272", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jinteco.2012.01.001"}]}
