{"Literature Review": "The dynamic causal effect of interventions on outcomes is a central concern in both macro- and microeconomics. Traditional time series methods, particularly vector autoregressions (VARs), have been the mainstay in macroeconomic research for estimating these effects. However, the rise of applied microeconometrics has introduced new methodologies, such as difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs, which focus on potential outcomes and treatment effects. Local projections (LPs) offer a promising bridge between these two approaches, translating the familiar language of VARs and impulse responses into the framework of potential outcomes and treatment effects. Local projections were first introduced by Jorda (2005) as a method to estimate impulse response functions without the need for a full VAR model. Unlike VARs, which require specifying a multivariate system of equations, LPs estimate the response of a variable to a shock at different horizons using a series of simple regressions. This approach is particularly useful when the underlying economic relationships are complex or when the sample size is small, as it avoids the overfitting issues that can arise with VARs. In the context of applied microeconometrics, local projections can be seen as a way to estimate dynamic treatment effects. For instance, Angrist and Kuersteiner (2012) demonstrate how LPs can be used to estimate the dynamic effects of policy interventions, such as changes in minimum wage laws or educational reforms. By treating the intervention as a treatment and the outcome as the response, LPs can provide a flexible and robust method for estimating the causal impact of the intervention over time. One of the key advantages of local projections is their ability to handle panel data, which is common in applied microeconometric studies. Panel data methods, such as fixed effects and random effects models, are widely used to control for unobserved heterogeneity. However, these methods often assume that the effects of the treatment are constant over time, which may not be realistic. Local projections, on the other hand, allow for the estimation of time-varying treatment effects, providing a more nuanced understanding of the causal mechanisms at play (Stock and Watson, 2001). Moreover, local projections can be easily extended to incorporate additional covariates and control variables, making them a versatile tool for applied researchers. For example, Stock and Watson (2002) show how LPs can be used to estimate the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks while controlling for other macroeconomic variables. This flexibility is particularly valuable in settings where multiple factors influence the outcome of interest. Despite their advantages, local projections are not without limitations. One potential issue is the choice of lag length, which can affect the accuracy of the estimated impulse response functions. Jorda (2005) suggests using information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), to select the optimal lag length. However, these criteria may not always provide a clear answer, and sensitivity analyses are often necessary to ensure robustness. Another challenge is the potential for omitted variable bias, which can occur if important confounding factors are not included in the model. To address this, researchers can use instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect of the treatment. For instance, Kuersteiner and Pruefer (2013) use IVs in conjunction with LPs to estimate the dynamic effects of fiscal policy shocks. This approach helps to mitigate concerns about endogeneity and provides more reliable estimates of the causal effects. In addition to their methodological contributions, local projections have also been applied to a wide range of empirical questions in economics. For example, Stock and Watson (2001) use LPs to study the dynamic effects of oil price shocks on macroeconomic variables, while Angrist and Pischke (2009) apply LPs to estimate the long-term impacts of early childhood education programs. These applications highlight the versatility and practical utility of local projections in addressing real-world economic problems. However, the integration of local projections into the broader econometric toolkit is still an ongoing process. While LPs have gained traction in macroeconomics, they are less commonly used in applied microeconometrics. This gap presents an opportunity for further research and methodological development. For instance, future work could explore the use of machine learning techniques to improve the estimation of local projections, particularly in high-dimensional settings (Athey and Imbens, 2017). In conclusion, local projections offer a powerful and flexible method for estimating dynamic causal effects in both macro- and microeconomics. By bridging the gap between traditional time series methods and modern econometric techniques, LPs can help researchers better understand the complex dynamics of economic interventions. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of local projections into the standard toolkit of applied economists will likely lead to new insights and more robust empirical findings.", "References": [{"title": "Estimation and Inference of Impulse Responses by Local Projections", "authors": "Oscar Jorda", "journal": "American Economic Review", "year": "2005", "volumes": "95", "first page": "161", "last page": "182", "DOI": "10.1257/0002828053828518"}, {"title": "The Effect of Time Aggregation on Dynamic Multipliers in Time Series Models", "authors": "Joshua D.
