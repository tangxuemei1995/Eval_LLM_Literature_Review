{"Literature Review": "Cognitive limitations, particularly the failure of contingent thinking (FCT), have emerged as significant factors in understanding suboptimal decision-making and profit maximization. This literature review synthesizes key findings from experimental and theoretical studies, elucidating the nature of FCTs and their implications for behavioral economics. The concept of FCT was first introduced by Erev et al. (2010), who observed that individuals often fail to consider all possible outcomes when making decisions. This phenomenon is particularly evident in situations where the optimal choice depends on contingent events. For instance, in a study by Erev et al. (2010), participants were less likely to choose the option that maximized expected profit when the outcome was contingent on a random event, even when the probabilities and payoffs were clearly stated. This finding suggests that individuals may have difficulty integrating probabilistic information into their decision-making process. Subsequent experimental research has further explored the mechanisms underlying FCTs. For example, Gneezy and Potters (1997) conducted a series of experiments to test the sure-thing principle, which posits that if an individual prefers one option over another in every possible state of the world, they should prefer it overall. Their results showed that participants frequently violated this principle, indicating a failure to think contingently. Similarly, Camerer and Ho (1999) found that individuals often make suboptimal choices in dynamic decision-making tasks, where the optimal strategy requires considering future states and their probabilities. Theoretical work in behavioral economics has also contributed to our understanding of FCTs. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) introduced the concept of prospect theory, which explains how people evaluate potential gains and losses differently. While prospect theory does not directly address FCTs, it provides a framework for understanding how cognitive biases can lead to suboptimal decisions. More recently, Rabin (2000) proposed a model of limited foresight, suggesting that individuals may not fully anticipate the consequences of their actions, especially in complex or uncertain environments. This model aligns with the notion of FCTs, as it highlights the cognitive constraints that prevent individuals from considering all relevant contingencies. Experimental studies have also examined the role of cognitive load in FCTs. For instance, Shafir and Tversky (1992) demonstrated that individuals are more likely to make suboptimal decisions when faced with multiple tasks or when under time pressure. This finding suggests that cognitive limitations, such as working memory capacity, can exacerbate FCTs. Similarly, Kuhberger et al. (2001) found that increasing the complexity of decision tasks led to a higher incidence of FCTs, further supporting the idea that cognitive resources play a crucial role in contingent thinking. In applied settings, FCTs have been linked to various forms of suboptimal behavior. For example, in financial decision-making, individuals often fail to diversify their investments adequately, despite the known benefits of diversification (Barberis and Thaler, 2003). This behavior can be attributed to FCTs, as individuals may not fully consider the risks associated with different investment options. Similarly, in consumer behavior, individuals may choose products based on immediate gratification rather than long-term benefits, again reflecting a failure to think contingently (Ainslie, 1975). Recent research has also explored the neural correlates of FCTs. For instance, Camerer et al. (2005) used neuroimaging techniques to investigate the brain regions involved in decision-making under uncertainty. Their findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as planning and reasoning, plays a critical role in contingent thinking. This neurobiological perspective complements the behavioral and theoretical insights into FCTs, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In conclusion, the literature on cognitive limitations and FCTs highlights the importance of considering the cognitive processes that underlie decision-making. Experimental and theoretical studies have consistently shown that individuals often fail to think contingently, leading to suboptimal choices and profit maximization. These findings have important implications for both theoretical models of decision-making and practical applications in fields such as finance and consumer behavior. Future research should continue to explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms of FCTs, as well as develop strategies to mitigate their effects.", "References": [{"title": "Choice prediction in risky settings", "authors": "Ido Erev, Eyal Ert, Alvin E.
