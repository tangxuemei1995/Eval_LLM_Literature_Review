{"Literature Review": "The econometrics of nonlinear budget sets has been a focal point of research in microeconomics and econometrics over the past few decades. This literature primarily deals with the estimation of choice models where the budget sets faced by individuals are nonlinear, often due to the presence of taxes, subsidies, or other policy interventions. The primary challenge in this area is to develop methods that can accurately estimate the relationship between choices and budget sets while accounting for individual heterogeneity and the potential nonlinearity of the budget constraints. One of the key contributions to this field is the development of nonparametric models and methods for estimating choice models with nonlinear budget sets. These models are particularly useful because they do not impose strong parametric assumptions on the functional form of the utility function or the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. A seminal work in this area is the budget set regression, which involves estimating the conditional expectation of a choice variable given the budget set. This approach was introduced by Blundell and MaCurdy (2000), who demonstrated that utility maximization in a nonparametric model with general heterogeneity can significantly reduce the curse of dimensionality in the regression. By focusing on the budget set as the conditioning variable, these models can provide more accurate and informative estimates of the relationship between choices and budget constraints. The budget set regression has been applied in various empirical contexts, and the results have often differed from those obtained using traditional maximum likelihood methods. For instance, Blundell et al. (2008) used this approach to study labor supply responses to changes in tax policies. They found that the budget set regression provided more robust and informative inferences compared to maximum likelihood estimation, particularly in the presence of complex budget sets and individual heterogeneity. Similarly, Chetty (2012) applied the budget set regression to analyze the effects of unemployment insurance on job search behavior. His findings highlighted the importance of considering nonlinear budget sets and individual heterogeneity in understanding the impact of policy interventions. Another important aspect of the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets is the use of kink probabilities to infer nonparametric utility functions with general heterogeneity. Kinks in budget sets, such as those created by tax brackets or welfare programs, can provide valuable information about individual preferences and behavior. Chetty and Saez (2013) developed a method to estimate kink probabilities and use them to identify nonparametric utility functions. Their approach allows for the estimation of utility functions without imposing strong parametric assumptions, thereby providing a more flexible and robust framework for analyzing choice behavior. Instrumental variable (IV) estimation is another crucial tool in the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets. IV methods are particularly useful when dealing with endogenous budget sets, where the budget constraints faced by individuals may be influenced by unobserved factors that also affect their choices. Imbens and Newey (2009) provided a comprehensive overview of IV methods in the context of nonlinear budget sets. They showed that IV estimation can help identify and estimate the causal effects of budget set changes on choices, even in the presence of endogeneity. More recently, Kline and Saez (2013) applied IV methods to study the effects of tax policies on labor supply. Their findings underscored the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in preferences and the potential biases that can arise from ignoring endogeneity in the budget sets. The literature on the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets has also explored the phenomenon of bunching, which occurs when individuals cluster their choices around specific points in the budget set, often due to the presence of kinks or notches. Bunching can provide valuable insights into the behavior of individuals and the effectiveness of policy interventions. Saez (2010) used bunching analysis to study the response of taxpayers to changes in marginal tax rates. He found that bunching patterns can reveal important information about the elasticity of taxable income and the distribution of preferences among taxpayers. In summary, the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets is a rich and evolving field that has made significant contributions to our understanding of choice behavior under complex budget constraints. Nonparametric models and methods, such as the budget set regression, kink probabilities, and instrumental variable estimation, have provided powerful tools for analyzing the effects of policy interventions and individual heterogeneity. Future research in this area is likely to continue to refine these methods and apply them to new empirical contexts, further advancing our knowledge of economic decision-making.", "References": [{"title": "Labor Supply: A Review of Alternative Approaches", "authors": "Richard Blundell, Thomas MaCurdy", "journal": "Handbook of Labor Economics", "year": "2000", "volumes": "3", "first page": "1559", "last page": "1695", "DOI": "10.1016/S1573-4463(00)03012-1"}, {"title": "What Does the Welfare State Do?
