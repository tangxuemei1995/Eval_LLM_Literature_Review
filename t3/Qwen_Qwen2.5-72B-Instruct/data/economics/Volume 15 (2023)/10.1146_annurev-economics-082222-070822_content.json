{"Literature Review": "Antitrust reform has become a focal point of economic and legal discourse, driven by growing concerns over market concentration and the dominance of large technology firms. The European Union (EU) has taken a proactive stance, enacting comprehensive legislation to address these issues, which has influenced similar proposals in the United States. This literature review examines the economic perspectives on antitrust reform, focusing on the implications for market competition, consumer welfare, and regulatory effectiveness. Market power has indeed increased in the United States and other advanced economies, as evidenced by studies such as Autor et al. (2020), who found that markups and profit margins have risen significantly since the 1980s. However, this increase in market power has not been uniformly associated with higher prices or lower productivity. For instance, De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) noted that while markups have increased, they have not necessarily led to higher consumer prices due to various factors, including technological advancements and global competition. Despite the mixed empirical evidence, there is a consensus that antitrust reforms are necessary to address the concentration and exercise of economic power. In the EU, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) represent significant steps towards regulating dominant digital platforms. These acts aim to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure fair competition in the digital market (European Commission, 2021). The DMA, in particular, introduces specific obligations for gatekeepers, such as prohibiting self-preferencing and ensuring interoperability, which are designed to level the playing field for smaller competitors. In the United States, several legislative proposals have emerged, drawing inspiration from the EU's approach. The American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) and the Platform Competition and Opportunity Act (PCOA) are notable examples. AICOA seeks to prohibit large online platforms from engaging in discriminatory practices, while PCOA aims to restrict mergers and acquisitions that could reduce competition (Khan, 2021). These proposals reflect a shift towards more interventionist antitrust policies, emphasizing the need to protect consumers and promote innovation. However, some economists argue that these reforms may depart from traditional antitrust principles and pose risks to consumer welfare. For example, Boudreau and Wright (2021) caution that overly broad prohibitions could stifle innovation and reduce the incentives for firms to invest in new technologies. They suggest that antitrust enforcement should focus on case-by-case analysis rather than blanket prohibitions, to avoid unintended consequences. Moreover, the effectiveness of antitrust reforms depends on the ability of regulatory bodies to enforce them effectively. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have faced criticism for being too lenient in their enforcement actions. Studies by Crane (2019) highlight the need for more robust enforcement mechanisms to ensure that antitrust laws are applied consistently and fairly. This includes enhancing the resources and expertise of regulatory agencies to keep pace with the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Another critical aspect of antitrust reform is the balance between promoting competition and maintaining consumer choice. Some scholars, such as Ezrachi and Stucke (2016), argue that the current antitrust framework is too focused on short-term price effects and fails to account for broader consumer welfare considerations, such as data privacy and quality of service. They propose a more holistic approach to antitrust that considers the long-term impacts of market structures on consumers. In the context of mergers and acquisitions, the literature suggests that stricter scrutiny is warranted to prevent the consolidation of market power. Research by Blonigen and Goldberg (2019) indicates that mergers often lead to reduced competition and higher prices, particularly in concentrated markets. Therefore, antitrust authorities should adopt a more cautious approach to merger reviews, taking into account the potential for market dominance and anti-competitive behavior. Finally, the role of international cooperation in antitrust enforcement cannot be overlooked. As global markets become increasingly interconnected, coordinated efforts among regulatory bodies are essential to address cross-border anticompetitive practices. The International Competition Network (ICN) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) play crucial roles in fostering collaboration and harmonizing antitrust standards (OECD, 2020). In conclusion, while antitrust reform is necessary to address the challenges posed by market concentration and the dominance of large technology firms, it must be carefully designed to balance the promotion of competition with the protection of consumer welfare. Policymakers should draw on the lessons learned from the EU's experience and consider the potential risks and benefits of proposed reforms. Robust enforcement mechanisms and a holistic approach to antitrust are essential to ensure that the reforms achieve their intended goals.", "References": [{"title": "The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms", "authors": "David H.
