{"Literature Review": "Gender differences in negotiation have been extensively studied due to their significant impact on labor market outcomes, particularly the gender pay gap. Research has shown that women tend to negotiate less frequently and less assertively than men, which can lead to lower salaries and fewer career advancements (Babcock & Laschever, 2003; Bowles et al., 2007). However, recent interventions aim to reduce these disparities by altering both individual behaviors and institutional structures. This literature review examines the effectiveness of various interventions designed to mitigate gender differences in negotiation and their potential to close the gender pay gap.\n\nOne of the earliest approaches to addressing gender differences in negotiation was to encourage women to 'lean in' and adopt more assertive negotiation strategies. Programs and workshops aimed at teaching women negotiation skills have been popular, with the hope that increased confidence and competence in negotiation would lead to better outcomes (Catalyst, 2015). While some studies have found that negotiation training can improve women's negotiation performance (Bowles et al., 2007), others suggest that these gains may not translate into real-world settings where social and organizational norms play a significant role (Eagly & Carli, 2007).\n\nMoreover, the 'lean in' approach has been criticized for placing the burden of change on individual women rather than addressing systemic issues (Williams & Ceci, 2015). This critique has led to a shift in focus towards institutional interventions that aim to create more equitable negotiation environments. One such intervention is the prohibition of salary history inquiries during the hiring process. Research indicates that asking for salary history can perpetuate existing pay disparities, as women and minorities are more likely to have lower starting salaries (Hoffman & Podolny, 2016). By banning these inquiries, organizations can ensure that new offers are based on the value of the position rather than past earnings (Levine et al., 2018).\n\nAnother institutional change that has gained traction is the promotion of wage transparency. Studies have shown that when employees have access to information about their colleagues' salaries, they are better equipped to negotiate fair compensation (Bertrand & Hallock, 2001). Transparency can also help identify and address pay disparities within organizations (Kearney & Levine, 2019). However, implementing wage transparency can be challenging, as it requires a cultural shift and may face resistance from management (Bauer & Brief, 2001).\n\nIn addition to these policy changes, some organizations have adopted structured negotiation processes that provide clear guidelines and criteria for salary and benefit discussions. These processes can reduce the discretion of managers and minimize the influence of unconscious biases (Correll et al., 2007). For example, a study by Correll et al. (2007) found that structured negotiation procedures led to more equitable outcomes for women and minorities.\n\nDespite the potential benefits of these interventions, it is important to consider their unintended consequences. For instance, banning salary history inquiries may lead to increased uncertainty for employers, who may struggle to determine appropriate starting salaries without this information (Levine et al., 2018). Similarly, wage transparency can sometimes lead to conflict and dissatisfaction among employees if not implemented carefully (Bauer & Brief, 2001).\n\nFurthermore, while institutional changes can create more equitable negotiation environments, they do not eliminate the need for individual skill development. Women still benefit from negotiation training, especially when combined with supportive organizational practices (Catalyst, 2015). A comprehensive approach that addresses both individual and institutional factors is likely to be the most effective in reducing gender differences in negotiation and closing the pay gap.\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on gender differences in negotiation highlights the importance of both individual and institutional interventions. While early efforts focused on encouraging women to negotiate more assertively, recent research suggests that altering the conditions of negotiation through policy changes can be more effective in achieving pay equity. Future research should continue to explore the interactions between individual and institutional factors and identify best practices for implementing these interventions in diverse organizational contexts.", "References": [{"title": "Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide", "authors": "Linda Babcock, Sara Laschever", "journal": "Princeton University Press", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Constraints and Triggers: When Power Promotes or Prevents Goal-Directed Behavior", "authors": "Heidi Grant Halvorson, E.
