{"Literature Review": "Dietary supplements (DSs) play a significant role in the nutritional intake of individuals, often providing essential vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive compounds. Despite their widespread use, the methods for assessing DS intake remain underexplored, leading to gaps in our understanding of their impact on health and disease. This literature review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on the relative validity and reproducibility of DS assessment methods, focusing on the United States context. The primary methods used to assess DS intake include product inventories, self-administered questionnaires, and 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR). Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of method can significantly influence the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. For instance, product inventories involve listing all DS products used over a specified period, which can provide detailed information on the types and quantities of supplements consumed. However, this method can be time-consuming and may not capture sporadic or occasional use. Self-administered questionnaires are a common tool for assessing DS use due to their ease of administration and lower cost. These questionnaires typically ask participants to report their DS use over a specific timeframe, such as the past month or year. While questionnaires can provide a broad overview of DS use, they may suffer from recall bias, where participants may forget or misreport their supplement intake. Despite this limitation, several studies have found that self-administered questionnaires agree well with 24HR and inventory methods when comparing the prevalence of commonly used DSs. 24-hour dietary recalls involve participants reporting all foods and supplements consumed in the past 24 hours. This method can provide a detailed snapshot of daily intake but may not capture long-term patterns of DS use. Additionally, 24HR can be subject to day-to-day variability and may not accurately reflect habitual intake. The validity of DS assessment methods is crucial for ensuring that the data collected accurately reflects true DS use. Validity is typically assessed by comparing the results of the method in question to a reference standard. However, no gold standard reference method exists for validating DS use, which complicates the evaluation process. In the absence of a gold standard, researchers have used various reference instruments, such as multiple 24HRs or product inventories, to assess the validity of DS assessment methods. A study by Murphy et al. compared the validity of self-administered questionnaires, 24HR, and product inventories in a sample of U.S. adults. The study found that self-administered questionnaires agreed well with 24HR and inventory methods when estimating the prevalence of commonly used DSs. However, the inventory method was more accurate in capturing nutrient amounts, suggesting that it may be the preferred method for detailed nutrient assessment. Reproducibility, or the consistency of measurements over time, is another important aspect of DS assessment. A study by Bailey et al. evaluated the reproducibility of self-administered questionnaires over a period of 3 months to 2.4 years. The study found that the reproducibility of prevalence estimates for common DSs was acceptable, indicating that these questionnaires can provide reliable data over extended periods. However, the reproducibility of less common DSs was lower, highlighting the need for further research to improve the accuracy of these assessments. Despite the progress made in DS assessment, the limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment remains a significant gap. Measurement error can lead to biased estimates of DS use and confound the relationship between DS intake and health outcomes. A study by Wallace et al. highlighted the importance of accounting for measurement error in DS assessment, particularly in epidemiological studies. The study found that failing to account for measurement error can result in underestimating the true effect of DSs on health outcomes. To address these gaps, future research should focus on developing and validating new DS assessment methods that can provide more accurate and reliable data. One potential approach is the use of biomarkers, which can provide objective measures of nutrient status and supplement intake. A study by Bailey et al. explored the use of biomarkers in assessing DS intake and found that certain biomarkers, such as serum vitamin D levels, can provide valuable insights into DS use. However, the use of biomarkers is not without challenges, including cost and feasibility, and further research is needed to establish their utility in large-scale studies. In conclusion, while self-administered questionnaires, 24HR, and product inventories are commonly used to assess DS intake, each method has its strengths and limitations. The inventory method appears to be the most accurate for detailed nutrient assessment, while self-administered questionnaires provide a reliable estimate of the prevalence of common DSs. However, the limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment underscores the need for further investigation. Developing and validating new methods, such as the use of biomarkers, could help advance our understanding of DS use and its impact on health and disease.", "References": [{"title": "The Accuracy of Self-Reported Dietary Supplement Use in the United States: A Systematic Review", "authors": "Murphy, S.
