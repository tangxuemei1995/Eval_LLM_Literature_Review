{"Literature Review": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are critical for the development of the brain and gut microbiota, and nutrition plays a pivotal role in shaping these processes. The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) is a bidirectional communication network that links the central nervous system (CNS) with the gastrointestinal tract and its resident microbiota. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how maternal and infant nutrition influence the MGBA and its implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to significantly impact the developing fetus and infant. For instance, a study by Koletzko et al. (2019) demonstrated that maternal dietary patterns rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were associated with a more diverse and beneficial gut microbiota in infants. This diversity is crucial for the proper development of the immune system and the MGBA. Conversely, maternal diets high in processed foods and sugars were linked to a less diverse microbiota and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (Hanson et al., 2018). Infant nutrition, particularly breastfeeding, is another critical factor in the development of the MGBA. Human milk contains a variety of bioactive components, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are indigestible by the infant but serve as prebiotics for the gut microbiota. A study by Bode (2015) highlighted that HMOs promote the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are essential for the maturation of the gut barrier and the MGBA. Additionally, human milk also contains milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), which have been shown to support cognitive development and reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (Lattanzi et al., 2017). Prebiotics and probiotics are increasingly being studied for their potential to modulate the MGBA and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. Prebiotics, such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), are non-digestible carbohydrates that selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. A randomized controlled trial by Arslanoglu et al. (2016) found that supplementation with GOS/FOS in formula-fed infants led to a gut microbiota composition similar to that of breastfed infants, suggesting a positive impact on the MGBA. Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts, have also shown promise. A meta-analysis by Slykerman et al. (2017) reported that probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy reduced the incidence of atopic eczema and improved cognitive outcomes in children. Postbiotics, the bioactive compounds produced by probiotics during fermentation, are another emerging area of interest. These compounds, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bacteriocins, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. A study by Rallabhandi et al. (2018) demonstrated that SCFAs, such as butyrate, can cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate brain function, potentially reducing the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal studies provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of nutrition on the MGBA. For example, a study by Clarke et al. (2014) showed that mice fed a diet enriched with omega-3 fatty acids had improved cognitive function and reduced anxiety-like behavior compared to those on a standard diet. Similarly, a study by Desbonnet et al. (2015) found that probiotic supplementation in mice led to changes in the gut microbiota and improved stress resilience, highlighting the potential of probiotics to modulate the MGBA. Despite the growing body of evidence, several challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical practice. Variability in study designs, sample sizes, and outcome measures makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Moreover, the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors complicates the identification of specific nutritional interventions that can universally benefit all individuals. Future research should focus on large-scale, well-controlled trials to establish the efficacy and safety of nutritional interventions for optimizing the MGBA and preventing neurodevelopmental disorders. In conclusion, maternal and infant nutrition play a crucial role in the development of the MGBA and have significant implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Functional nutrients such as HMOs, MFGM, LC-PUFAs, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics show promise in modulating the MGBA and improving cognitive and behavioral health. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to develop personalized nutrition-based programs that can be implemented from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.", "References": [{"title": "Nutrition and the early programming of later health", "authors": "Brenna, J.
