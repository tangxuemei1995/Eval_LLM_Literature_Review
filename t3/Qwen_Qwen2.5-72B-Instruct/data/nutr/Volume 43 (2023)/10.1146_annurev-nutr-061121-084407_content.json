{"Literature Review": "Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a crucial micronutrient that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, cellular antioxidant defense, and the metabolism of other essential nutrients such as iron, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin deficiency, while most prevalent in low-income countries, can also occur in high-income settings, often going undetected due to the lack of routine biomarker measurements. This review aims to explore the causes, detection methods, and clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency, highlighting the broader implications for public health and policy. Severe riboflavin deficiency, characterized by clinical manifestations such as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis, is primarily observed in populations with limited dietary diversity and poor nutritional status. These symptoms are indicative of a significant depletion of riboflavin stores and can lead to more severe complications, including anemia with erythroid hypoplasia. Anemia resulting from riboflavin deficiency is particularly concerning, as it can impair cognitive function, physical performance, and overall quality of life. Subclinical riboflavin deficiency, which is more common and often overlooked, can have subtle but significant health impacts. Studies have shown that subclinical deficiency is associated with increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant capacity, which can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. The detection of riboflavin deficiency is challenging due to the lack of a single, reliable biomarker. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) is one of the most widely used indicators of riboflavin status, as it reflects the functional activity of riboflavin-dependent enzymes. However, EGRac has limitations, including variability in response to supplementation and the need for specialized laboratory equipment. Therefore, a combination of biochemical markers and dietary assessment is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of riboflavin status. Dietary intake is a primary determinant of riboflavin status, and inadequate consumption of riboflavin-rich foods such as dairy products, eggs, and leafy green vegetables can lead to deficiency. In low-income countries, where access to these foods is limited, riboflavin deficiency is more prevalent. Additionally, certain population groups, such as pregnant women and the elderly, have higher riboflavin requirements and are at greater risk of deficiency. The consequences of riboflavin deficiency extend beyond individual health outcomes and have significant public health implications. Anemia, a common manifestation of riboflavin deficiency, is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. Addressing riboflavin deficiency through targeted interventions, such as fortification programs and dietary diversification, can help reduce the prevalence of anemia and improve overall health outcomes. Moreover, the relationship between riboflavin status and hypertension highlights the importance of considering micronutrient deficiencies in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. In conclusion, riboflavin deficiency is a multifaceted issue with far-reaching consequences for individual and public health. While severe deficiency is more common in low-income settings, subclinical deficiency is a global concern that requires attention. Future research should focus on developing more accurate and accessible methods for detecting riboflavin deficiency and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Public health policies should prioritize improving dietary diversity and ensuring adequate riboflavin intake across all population groups to mitigate the health impacts of deficiency.", "References": [{"title": "Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and health", "authors": "Higdon, Jane, Victoria J.
