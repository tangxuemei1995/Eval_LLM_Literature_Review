{"Literature Review": "Nutrition security is an evolving concept that extends beyond the traditional notion of food security, encompassing the availability, access, and utilization of nutritious foods necessary for optimal health outcomes. While food security primarily focuses on the availability and accessibility of sufficient food, nutrition security emphasizes the quality and adequacy of dietary intake and the resulting nutritional status of individuals and populations. This literature review synthesizes existing research on nutrition security, drawing parallels with the well-established literature on food security and diet quality, to propose a comprehensive framework for assessing and monitoring nutrition security in the United States. The concept of food security has been extensively studied and operationalized, particularly through the work of the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). According to the USDA-ERS, food security is defined as the condition in which all household members have reliable access to enough food for an active, healthy life (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2019). However, food security alone does not guarantee that the available food is nutritionally adequate or that individuals consume a balanced diet. This gap highlights the need for a broader concept that encompasses both the quantity and quality of food, leading to the emergence of nutrition security. Nutrition security can be conceptualized as a state where individuals and communities have consistent access to a diverse, safe, and culturally acceptable diet that meets their nutritional needs and promotes optimal health (Gillespie et al., 2013). This definition underscores the importance of not only the availability of food but also its nutritional value and the ability of individuals to utilize it effectively. The distinction between food security and nutrition security is crucial because a household may be food secure but still suffer from malnutrition due to poor dietary quality (Hoddinott & Yohannes, 2002). To better understand nutrition security, it is essential to examine the constructs and subconstructs that form its foundation. Two primary constructs are identified: healthy diets and nutritional status. A healthy diet is characterized by the consumption of a variety of nutrient-dense foods that meet dietary recommendations and support overall health (Drewnowski & Darmon, 2005). Nutritional status, on the other hand, refers to the physiological state of an individual as determined by their dietary intake and nutrient absorption (Black et al., 2008). Several subconstructs contribute to the formation of these primary constructs. For healthy diets, key subconstructs include dietary diversity, which measures the variety of food groups consumed; dietary adequacy, which assesses the intake of essential nutrients; and dietary balance, which evaluates the proportion of macronutrients and micronutrients in the diet (Kennedy et al., 2013). These subconstructs are critical for ensuring that individuals receive a wide range of nutrients necessary for optimal health. Nutritional status is influenced by several factors, including dietary intake, physical activity, and health conditions. Subconstructs under nutritional status include anthropometric measurements, such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, which provide insights into body composition and obesity risk (WHO, 2000). Biochemical indicators, such as blood levels of vitamins and minerals, offer direct measures of nutrient status and can help identify deficiencies or excesses (Mason et al., 2005). Clinical assessments, such as the presence of chronic diseases and their management, also play a role in evaluating nutritional status. The relationship between food security and nutrition security is complex and bidirectional. Food security is a prerequisite for nutrition security, as insufficient food availability and access can lead to inadequate dietary intake and poor nutritional status (Smith & Haddad, 2000). Conversely, even in food-secure environments, poor dietary choices and limited knowledge about nutrition can result in suboptimal health outcomes (Ruel & Alderman, 2013). Therefore, efforts to improve nutrition security must address both the availability and quality of food, as well as the factors that influence dietary behaviors. Assessing and monitoring nutrition security requires a multifaceted approach that integrates various data sources and methodologies. Household surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), provide valuable data on dietary intake and nutritional status at the population level (CDC, 2018). Biomarker analysis, including blood and urine tests, offers objective measures of nutrient status and can help identify specific deficiencies or excesses (Frongillo et al., 2006). Community-based assessments, such as focus groups and interviews, can provide context-specific insights into the barriers and facilitators of healthy eating (Jones-Smith et al., 2012). In addition to data collection, the development of standardized metrics and tools is essential for the assessment and monitoring of nutrition security. The Dietary Quality Index (DQI) and the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) are widely used tools that evaluate the alignment of individual diets with dietary guidelines (Guo et al., 2016). These indices can help track changes in dietary patterns over time and identify areas for intervention. Similarly, the Global Nutrition Report provides a comprehensive overview of global nutrition trends and highlights the need for targeted policies and programs to improve nutrition security (Global Nutrition Report, 2018). The proposed framework for understanding nutrition security and its relationship to food security is intended to guide future research and policy initiatives. By focusing on the constructs of healthy diets and nutritional status, this framework provides a clear structure for assessing and monitoring nutrition security. It also highlights the importance of addressing the underlying determinants of dietary behaviors, such as socioeconomic status, education, and cultural norms, to promote sustainable improvements in nutrition security. In conclusion, nutrition security is a critical component of public health that extends beyond the traditional concept of food security. By integrating the constructs of healthy diets and nutritional status, this literature review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing nutrition security in the United States. Future research should focus on developing and validating standardized metrics and tools for assessing nutrition security, as well as identifying effective interventions to improve dietary quality and nutritional status across diverse populations.", "References": [{"title": "Household food security in the United States in 2018", "authors": "Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Matthew P.
