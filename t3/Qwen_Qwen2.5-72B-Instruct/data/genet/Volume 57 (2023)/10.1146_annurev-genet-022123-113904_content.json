{"Literature Review": "The interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years. AMR, characterized by the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antimicrobial drugs, has been recognized as a major public health threat (World Health Organization, 2014). The emergence and spread of AMR are influenced by various factors, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, as well as the release of antibiotics and other contaminants into the environment (Aminov, 2010).\n\nThe environment plays a crucial role in the development and dissemination of AMR. Natural environments, such as soil and water bodies, serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and can facilitate their horizontal transfer among different microbial communities (Martínez, 2009). Anthropogenic activities, such as industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural practices, have significantly altered these natural environments, leading to increased contamination with antibiotics and other pollutants (Kümmerer, 2009). These contaminants can exert selective pressure on microbial populations, promoting the selection and spread of resistant strains (Baquero et al., 2011).\n\nClimate change, another major global environmental challenge, further complicates the AMR crisis. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can affect the distribution and abundance of microorganisms, including those carrying ARGs (Baker-Austin et al., 2017). For example, warmer temperatures can enhance the growth and survival of pathogenic bacteria, potentially increasing the risk of infections and the spread of AMR (Liu et al., 2018). Additionally, climate-induced changes in water availability and quality can lead to the concentration of pollutants in aquatic systems, exacerbating the environmental load of antibiotics and other contaminants (Gillings, 2013).\n\nThe interaction between AMR and global environmental change is not limited to natural environments; it also extends to human-associated ecosystems, such as hospitals and urban areas. In healthcare settings, the overuse of antibiotics and poor infection control practices contribute to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (World Health Organization, 2014). Urbanization and population density can further amplify these issues by facilitating the transmission of resistant pathogens through close human interactions and shared infrastructure (Collignon et al., 2018).\n\nAgricultural practices, particularly the use of antibiotics in livestock production, also play a significant role in the AMR crisis. Antibiotics are often used prophylactically and for growth promotion in animals, leading to high levels of antibiotic residues in manure and runoff, which can contaminate soil and water resources (Aminov, 2010). This contamination can promote the selection of resistant bacteria in the environment, which can then be transmitted to humans through the food chain or direct contact (Silbergeld et al., 2008).\n\nTo address the interconnected challenges of AMR and global environmental change, a holistic and interdisciplinary approach is necessary. This includes reducing the unnecessary use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, improving waste management practices to minimize environmental contamination, and implementing policies to mitigate climate change (Baquero et al., 2011). Additionally, enhancing surveillance and monitoring systems to track the prevalence and spread of AMR in both natural and human-associated environments is crucial for developing effective intervention strategies (Collignon et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the interplay between AMR and global environmental change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between human activities, the environment, and microbial communities. By addressing the root causes of AMR and mitigating the impacts of environmental change, we can work towards a more sustainable and resilient future.", "References": [{"title": "The role of humans in the evolution of antibiotic resistance", "authors": "R.
