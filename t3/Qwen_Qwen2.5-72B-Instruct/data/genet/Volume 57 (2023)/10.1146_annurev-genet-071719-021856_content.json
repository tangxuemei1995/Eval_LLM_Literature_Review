{"Literature Review": "RNA repair mechanisms have been a subject of intense investigation over the past several decades, revealing a complex array of enzymatic activities and biological pathways. The discovery of enzymes capable of phosphorylating, dephosphorylating, and ligating RNA 5′ and 3′ ends dates back more than half a century. These enzymes play crucial roles in repairing purposeful site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone, a process that is essential for maintaining the integrity and functionality of RNA molecules. One of the most well-characterized examples of RNA repair is tRNA splicing, a process that involves the removal of introns and the ligation of the resulting exons to restore the functional tRNA molecule. In eukaryotes, tRNA splicing is mediated by a set of enzymes including the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) and the tRNA ligase (TRAL). TSEN recognizes and cleaves the tRNA at specific sites, while TRAL catalyzes the ligation of the 5′ and 3′ exons. This process is highly conserved across different species, underscoring its importance in cellular function. Another important aspect of RNA repair is the role of polynucleotide kinase–phosphatase (PNKP) enzymes, which are involved in the repair of RNA ends. PNKP enzymes can both phosphorylate and dephosphorylate RNA ends, ensuring that the RNA is in the correct form for subsequent processing steps. For instance, in the context of tRNA restriction-repair, PNKP enzymes help to prepare the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cleaved tRNA for ligation by TRAL. The mechanisms of RNA repair are not limited to tRNA splicing and restriction-repair. Recent studies have identified additional RNA repair pathways in various organisms, including bacteria and archaea. For example, the bacterial enzyme RtcB, a member of the RNA triphosphatase-cyclase family, plays a role in the repair of RNA breaks by converting the 5′ triphosphate end of the RNA to a 5′ cyclic phosphate, which can then be ligated to the 3′ hydroxyl end. This process, known as RNA cyclization, is an alternative mechanism for RNA repair that has been observed in multiple taxa. In addition to these enzymatic activities, the biological pathways in which RNA repair occurs are still being elucidated. One key question is the identification of the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage. For instance, stress conditions such as oxidative stress can induce RNA breaks, which must be repaired to maintain cellular homeostasis. The agents responsible for these breaks can include endonucleases, which are often regulated by cellular signaling pathways. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control RNA cleavage and repair is crucial for comprehending the physiological significance of these processes. Furthermore, the outcomes of RNA repair can vary depending on the specific pathway involved. In some cases, RNA repair results in the restoration of the original RNA molecule, as seen in tRNA splicing. However, in other cases, RNA repair can lead to modifications of the RNA, such as the loss or gain of nucleotides at the ends, or even the rearrangement of RNA segments, a process known as RNA recombination. These modifications can have significant implications for gene expression and cellular function. The discovery and characterization of new candidate RNA repair activities continue to outpace our understanding of the biological pathways in which they act. For example, recent studies have identified novel RNA repair enzymes in non-model organisms, providing insights into the diversity and evolution of RNA repair mechanisms. These findings highlight the need for further research to uncover the full spectrum of RNA repair pathways and their roles in cellular biology. In conclusion, the study of RNA repair mechanisms has revealed a complex interplay of enzymatic activities and biological pathways that are essential for maintaining the integrity and functionality of RNA molecules. While much progress has been made in understanding specific pathways such as tRNA splicing and restriction-repair, many questions remain regarding the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage, as well as the outcomes of RNA repair. Continued research in this area will undoubtedly provide new insights into the fundamental processes that govern RNA metabolism and cellular function.", "References": [{"title": "tRNA Splicing: A New Frontier in RNA Biology", "authors": "James Abelson, Carol E.
