{"Literature Review": "Transcription and replication are fundamental processes in the maintenance and propagation of genetic information. Both processes involve large macromolecular complexes that interact with the DNA template, leading to potential conflicts known as transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs). These conflicts can result in DNA damage and compromise the fidelity and completeness of genome replication, contributing to genomic instability. This review synthesizes recent findings on the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they are prevented, mitigated, or resolved, with a particular focus on multicellular eukaryotes. Recent studies have identified specific genomic regions where TRCs are more likely to occur. For instance, TRCs are frequently observed at highly transcribed genes, particularly those with high levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity. These regions are often associated with increased levels of DNA damage and replication stress, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TRCs. One key mechanism for preventing TRCs involves the regulation of replication origin firing. In eukaryotes, the timing and location of origin firing are tightly controlled to ensure efficient and coordinated replication. Studies have shown that origins located in highly transcribed regions are often delayed or inhibited, reducing the likelihood of TRCs. This regulation is thought to be mediated by factors that influence the assembly and activation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), such as the origin recognition complex (ORC) and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase. Despite these regulatory mechanisms, TRCs can still occur, and cells have evolved various strategies to mitigate their effects. One such strategy involves the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of conflict. For example, the ATR kinase, a key regulator of the DNA damage response, is activated in response to TRCs and helps to stabilize the replisome and promote replication fork progression. Additionally, the R-loop resolution machinery, including the RNase H family of enzymes, plays a crucial role in resolving R-loops, which are stable RNA-DNA hybrids that can form during transcription and impede replication. In addition to preventing and mitigating TRCs, cells must also resolve conflicts that do occur. The resolution of TRCs often involves the recruitment of specialized DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is particularly important for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that can arise from unresolved TRCs, while NHEJ is involved in the repair of single-strand breaks (SSBs) and other types of DNA damage. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway in resolving TRCs, particularly in the context of replication fork stalling and collapse. The impact of TRCs on genomic stability is further exacerbated by the context of cell type–specific gene expression and higher-order chromatin organization. In multicellular eukaryotes, the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression is critical for proper development and function. TRCs can disrupt this regulation, leading to aberrant gene expression and cellular dysfunction. Moreover, the three-dimensional organization of the genome, including the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops, can influence the frequency and resolution of TRCs. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided valuable insights into the genomic landscape of TRCs. For example, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses have revealed that TRCs are enriched at specific genomic features, such as promoters, enhancers, and repetitive elements. These findings underscore the importance of considering the genomic context when studying TRCs and their impact on genomic stability. In conclusion, TRCs represent a significant source of genomic instability in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The prevention, mitigation, and resolution of TRCs involve a complex interplay of regulatory mechanisms and DNA repair pathways. Understanding these processes is crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of genomic instability and developing strategies to prevent or treat diseases associated with DNA damage and replication stress.", "References": [{"title": "Regulation of DNA replication origin firing in metazoans", "authors": "Fraga, D., Gómez, M., Méndez, J.", "journal": "Current Opinion in Cell Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "53", "first page": "106", "last page": "113", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ceb.2018.04.005"}, {"title": "The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives", "authors": "Branzei, D., Foiani, M.", "journal": "Molecular Cell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "39", "first page": "179", "last page": "189", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2010.07.011"}, {"title": "R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability", "authors": "Garcia-Muse, T., Boulton, S.
