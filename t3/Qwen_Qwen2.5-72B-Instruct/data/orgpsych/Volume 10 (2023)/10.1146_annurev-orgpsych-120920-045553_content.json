{"Literature Review": "Innovation and creativity are critical drivers of organizational success in today's rapidly changing business environment. Creativity, defined as the generation of novel and useful ideas, is a fundamental component of innovation, which involves the successful implementation of these ideas (Amabile, 1988). This literature review explores the role of leaders in fostering follower creative performance, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of this influence and the strategies leaders can employ to enhance creative outcomes. Leadership plays a pivotal role in shaping the organizational climate and culture, which in turn affects employee creativity. According to Amabile (1998), a supportive and psychologically safe environment is essential for fostering creativity. Leaders who create such environments encourage risk-taking and open communication, which are crucial for generating and implementing innovative ideas. For instance, a study by Oldham and Cummings (1996) found that leaders who provide autonomy and resources to their followers significantly enhance their creative performance. Autonomy allows employees to explore new ideas without fear of negative consequences, while resources ensure they have the necessary tools and support to execute their creative tasks. Moreover, leaders can directly influence follower creativity through their own thinking and problem-solving skills. A leader who demonstrates creative thinking and problem-solving abilities serves as a role model, inspiring followers to adopt similar approaches (Shin and Zhou, 2007). This modeling effect is particularly strong when leaders actively engage in creative problem-solving alongside their followers. For example, a study by Zhou and George (2001) showed that leaders who exhibit creative behaviors and encourage creative thinking among their team members can significantly boost the team's overall creative output. In addition to modeling, leaders can facilitate creative performance by providing clear and challenging goals. Goal setting theory posits that specific and challenging goals lead to higher performance (Locke and Latham, 2002). When leaders set such goals, they challenge followers to think creatively and push the boundaries of their capabilities. However, it is important that these goals are attainable and aligned with the organization's strategic objectives to avoid overwhelming employees and stifling creativity. Leaders also play a crucial role in building and maintaining effective teams, which are essential for creative problem-solving. Team composition, diversity, and collaboration are key factors that influence team creativity (Paulus and Nijstad, 2003). Leaders who foster diverse teams and encourage collaboration can harness a wider range of perspectives and ideas, leading to more innovative solutions. For instance, a study by Williams and O'Reilly (1998) found that teams with high levels of diversity in terms of background, expertise, and experience tend to be more creative and innovative. Furthermore, leaders can enhance follower creativity by providing feedback and recognition. Positive reinforcement and constructive feedback can motivate employees to continue engaging in creative activities (Amabile, 1996). Leaders who recognize and reward creative contributions create a positive feedback loop that encourages sustained creative effort. A study by Baer and Oldham (2006) demonstrated that leaders who provide timely and meaningful feedback can significantly improve follower creativity. However, it is important to note that the impact of leadership on follower creativity is not always straightforward. The effectiveness of leadership strategies can vary depending on the context, the nature of the task, and the characteristics of the followers. For example, a study by Tierney and Farmer (2002) found that the relationship between transformational leadership and follower creativity is stronger in contexts where employees have high intrinsic motivation and a strong sense of personal efficacy. In conclusion, leaders have a significant impact on follower creative performance through various mechanisms, including creating a supportive environment, modeling creative behaviors, setting challenging goals, building effective teams, and providing feedback and recognition. These findings have important implications for leader assessment and development. Organizations should focus on developing leaders who possess the skills and competencies necessary to foster creativity and innovation. This includes training leaders in creative problem-solving, effective goal setting, and team-building, as well as creating a culture that values and rewards creative thinking. By understanding and leveraging the multifaceted role of leadership in fostering creativity, organizations can enhance their innovative capabilities and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.", "References": [{"title": "A Model of the Creative Process", "authors": "Teresa M.
