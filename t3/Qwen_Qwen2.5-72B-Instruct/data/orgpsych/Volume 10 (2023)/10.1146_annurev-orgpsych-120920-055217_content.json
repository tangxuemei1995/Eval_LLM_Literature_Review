{"Literature Review": "Psychological safety, a concept that has gained significant traction since the 1990s, refers to the shared belief held by members of a team that the environment is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. This literature review synthesizes contemporary research on psychological safety, highlighting four dominant themes: getting things done, learning behaviors, improving the work experience, and leadership. These themes underscore the multifaceted impact of psychological safety on organizational performance and employee well-being.", "References": [{"title": "Psychological safety and learning behavior in work teams", "authors": "Amy C.
