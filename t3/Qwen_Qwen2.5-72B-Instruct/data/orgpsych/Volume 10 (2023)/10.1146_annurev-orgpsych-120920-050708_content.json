{"Literature Review": "The concept of 'noise' in judgment and decision-making has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in fields such as psychology, economics, and management. Noise, defined as unwanted variance in judgments, is often considered a critical yet underexplored source of error. However, the issue of noise in judgment is not new; it has been a focal point in personnel selection research for nearly a century. This literature review explores how a century of selection research has contributed to understanding and reducing noise in workplace judgments, highlighting key lessons and methodologies that can be applied more broadly. Personnel selection, a cornerstone of organizational psychology, has long recognized the importance of consistency and reliability in hiring decisions. Early studies in the 1920s and 1930s emphasized the need for structured and standardized procedures to minimize subjective biases and errors. For instance, the development of structured interviews, where questions are pre-determined and uniformly administered, has been shown to reduce noise and improve the predictive validity of selection processes. One of the fundamental strategies for reducing noise is the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler components. By breaking down the selection process into discrete steps, each with clear criteria and standards, organizations can ensure that judgments are based on consistent and objective measures. This approach not only reduces the variability in individual judgments but also enhances the overall reliability of the selection process. Another critical aspect of reducing noise is the standardization of evaluation criteria. Agreeing on and adhering to well-defined standards is essential for ensuring that judgments are consistent across different evaluators and over time. Research has shown that the use of rating scales and clear performance metrics can significantly reduce noise in performance evaluations. For example, a study by Murphy and Cleveland found that the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) led to more reliable and valid performance assessments compared to unstructured methods. Aggregating independent judgments is another effective method for reducing noise. By combining multiple independent evaluations, the idiosyncratic biases and errors of individual judges can be averaged out, leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes. This principle is well-established in the field of forecasting, where ensemble methods have been shown to outperform individual predictions. In the context of personnel selection, aggregating the judgments of multiple interviewers or evaluators can lead to more robust and reliable hiring decisions. The role of algorithms in reducing noise has also been a subject of extensive research. Algorithms, particularly those based on statistical models, can provide a systematic and objective basis for making judgments. For example, regression models and other statistical techniques have been used to predict job performance based on a combination of relevant variables. These models can help to standardize the selection process and reduce the influence of subjective biases. However, it is important to note that not all algorithmic approaches are equally effective in reducing noise. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have raised concerns about the potential for these technologies to introduce new sources of noise. For instance, AI and ML models can be highly sensitive to the quality and representativeness of the training data, and they may amplify existing biases if not carefully designed and validated. Therefore, while algorithms can be powerful tools for reducing noise, their implementation must be guided by rigorous validation and ethical considerations. In conclusion, a century of research in personnel selection has provided valuable insights into the nature and reduction of noise in judgment. Structured processes, standardized criteria, and the aggregation of independent judgments are proven strategies for enhancing the reliability and validity of workplace decisions. While algorithms offer promising avenues for further improvement, their application must be approached with caution to avoid introducing new sources of error. By integrating these lessons into broader decision-making contexts, organizations can make more informed and consistent judgments, ultimately leading to better outcomes and improved performance.", "References": [{"title": "Validity and Utility of Alternative Predictors of Job Performance", "authors": "John E.
