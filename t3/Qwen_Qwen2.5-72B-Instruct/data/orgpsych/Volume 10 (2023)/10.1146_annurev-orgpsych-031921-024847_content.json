{"Literature Review": "Decent work and meaningful work are two critical constructs in the contemporary discourse on employment and labor. While they emerge from distinct theoretical perspectives, both have significant implications for individuals, organizations, and society. This literature review aims to explore the conceptual and empirical foundations of decent work and meaningful work, drawing connections between them through the lens of the Psychology of Working Theory (PWT). Decent work, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO), encompasses fair income, security in the workplace, and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize, and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men (ILO, 2008). The concept of decent work has been widely studied in the fields of labor economics, sociology, and human resource management. For instance, Standing (2011) emphasizes the importance of decent work in reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. Similarly, Kalleberg (2009) highlights the role of decent work in enhancing job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Meaningful work, on the other hand, is a more aspirational concept that goes beyond the basic conditions of decent work. It refers to the extent to which individuals find their work significant, fulfilling, and aligned with their values and goals (Rosso et al., 2010). Research on meaningful work has primarily been conducted within the fields of positive psychology and organizational behavior. For example, Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) explore how individuals can find meaning in their work through job crafting, which involves altering the tasks, relationships, and perceptions associated with one's job. Similarly, Pratt and Ashforth (2003) discuss the role of identity in making work meaningful, suggesting that when individuals' identities are closely tied to their work, they are more likely to experience a sense of purpose and fulfillment. The Psychology of Working Theory (PWT) provides a framework for understanding the interplay between decent work and meaningful work. According to PWT, the quality of work is influenced by the extent to which it satisfies individuals' basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Blustein, 2006). These needs are universal and essential for psychological well-being. When these needs are met, individuals are more likely to experience both decent work and meaningful work. For instance, Ryan and Deci (2000) argue that need satisfaction is a key determinant of intrinsic motivation, which is closely linked to the experience of meaningful work. Societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices play crucial roles in promoting access to decent work and meaningful work. At the societal level, policies and regulations that ensure fair labor standards and social protections are essential for creating a foundation of decent work (ILO, 2008). For example, countries with strong labor unions and comprehensive social welfare systems tend to have higher levels of decent work (Standing, 2011). At the organizational level, supportive leadership, fair performance evaluations, and opportunities for professional development contribute to both decent and meaningful work (Kalleberg, 2009). Individual practices, such as proactive behavior and self-reflection, also play a role in enhancing the quality of work (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). Despite the growing body of research on decent work and meaningful work, several gaps remain. Future research should broaden the available scholarship and methods used to study these constructs. For instance, there is a need for more longitudinal studies to understand the long-term effects of decent work and meaningful work on individual well-being and organizational outcomes (Pratt & Ashforth, 2003). Additionally, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from psychology, sociology, and economics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex intersection of macro-level and psychological factors (Blustein, 2006). In conclusion, decent work and meaningful work are interconnected constructs that are essential for the well-being of individuals and the prosperity of organizations and society. By focusing on need satisfaction and considering the roles of societal context, organizational conditions, and individual practices, researchers and practitioners can develop interventions to improve the quality of work and enhance the lives of workers. Future research should continue to explore the multifaceted nature of decent work and meaningful work, using a variety of methods and interdisciplinary perspectives to deepen our understanding of these important concepts.", "References": [{"title": "Decent Work: The Quality of Jobs and the Quality of People's Working Lives", "authors": "International Labour Organization", "journal": "International Labour Organization", "year": "2008", "DOI": "https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/ilo-bookstore/order-online/books/WCMS_108457/lang--en/index.htm"}, {"title": "The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class", "authors": "Guy Standing", "journal": "Bloomsbury Academic", "year": "2011", "DOI": "10.5040/9781472549806"}, {"title": "Precariousness, Insecurity, and Inequality in the Neoliberal Era", "authors": "Arne L.
