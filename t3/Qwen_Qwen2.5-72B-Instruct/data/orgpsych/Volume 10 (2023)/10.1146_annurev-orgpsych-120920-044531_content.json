{"Literature Review": "Self-awareness, defined as the ability to recognize one's own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, plays a crucial role in personal and interpersonal growth. It influences how individuals perceive themselves and their interactions with the environment, ultimately shaping their behavior and identity. This literature review synthesizes recent research on the development of self-awareness, focusing on its definition, accuracy, measurement, and effects, including both positive and negative aspects. Additionally, it explores educational interventions aimed at enhancing self-awareness through mindfulness, reflection, feedback, and coaching.", "References": [{"title": "A Meta-Analytic Review of Mindfulness Meditation on Self-Awareness", "authors": "Chiesa, A., Serretti, A.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Psychology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "66", "first page": "491", "last page": "502", "DOI": "10.1002/jclp.20699"}, {"title": "The Role of Self-Awareness in Personal and Professional Development", "authors": "Grant, A.
