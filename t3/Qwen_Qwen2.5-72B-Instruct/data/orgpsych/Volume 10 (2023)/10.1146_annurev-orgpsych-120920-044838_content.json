{"Literature Review": "Crisis leadership is a critical area of study, particularly given the increasing frequency and complexity of crises in the modern world. Effective leadership during crises can mitigate damage, restore order, and foster resilience. However, despite its importance, crisis leadership remains a relatively underdeveloped field. This literature review aims to synthesize existing knowledge and identify gaps in our understanding of crisis leadership. Crises are defined as sudden, unexpected events that disrupt normal operations and pose significant threats to organizations, communities, or societies. They can be categorized into various types, including natural disasters, technological failures, and human-induced crises. Each type of crisis presents unique challenges and requires tailored leadership responses. The dynamics of crises are characterized by uncertainty, ambiguity, and high stakes. Leaders must navigate these conditions to make effective decisions under pressure. Several leadership theories provide valuable insights into crisis leadership. Transformational leadership, transactional leadership, servant leadership, and authentic leadership are discussed in the literature review. Specific competencies required for effective crisis leadership include strategic thinking, emotional intelligence, crisis communication, decision-making, and resilience. Despite the progress made in understanding crisis leadership, several areas remain underexplored, such as the distinction between crisis leadership and crisis management, cross-national and intercultural implications of crisis leadership, and the role of ethics in crisis leadership.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Crisis Management: Public Leadership Under Pressure", "authors": "Arjen Boin, Paul 't Hart, Eric Stern, Bengt Sundelius", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2005", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511614526"}, {"title": "Framing Crisis: The Role of Media in Shaping Public Perception", "authors": "Joan C.
