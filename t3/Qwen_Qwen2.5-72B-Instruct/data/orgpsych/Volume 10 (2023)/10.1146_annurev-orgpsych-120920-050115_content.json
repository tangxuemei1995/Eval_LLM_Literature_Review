{"Literature Review": "The rapid advancement of technology and the increasing prevalence of remote work have significantly transformed the landscape of leadership. Virtual leadership, defined as the process of guiding and influencing team members who are geographically dispersed and primarily interact through digital communication tools, has become a critical area of study. This literature review synthesizes existing research on virtual leadership, focusing on the application of functional leadership theory to understand the unique challenges and opportunities presented by virtual work environments. Functional leadership theory posits that effective leadership involves fulfilling certain functions that satisfy the needs of followers. In the context of virtual leadership, these functions can be categorized into traditional and new functions. Traditional functions include task coordination, relationship building, motivation, and communication. However, the virtual setting introduces a new function: facilitating the use of technology. This review will explore how these functions manifest in virtual leadership and discuss the implications for both research and practice.", "References": [{"title": "Virtual team leadership: The effects of leadership style on team performance and viability", "authors": "Bell, B.
