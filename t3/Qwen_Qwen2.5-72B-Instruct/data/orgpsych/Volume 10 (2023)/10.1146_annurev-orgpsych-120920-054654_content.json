{"Literature Review": "Over the past decade, the study of employee voice and silence has gained significant traction within the organizational behavior and human resource management fields. This review aims to synthesize the existing literature, highlighting key findings, methodological advancements, and identifying gaps that warrant further exploration. Employee voice refers to the discretionary communication of ideas, suggestions, or concerns by employees to their superiors or colleagues, while employee silence encompasses the withholding of such information. Both phenomena have profound implications for individual well-being, team dynamics, and organizational performance.", "References": [{"title": "Employee voice and silence", "authors": "E. W.
