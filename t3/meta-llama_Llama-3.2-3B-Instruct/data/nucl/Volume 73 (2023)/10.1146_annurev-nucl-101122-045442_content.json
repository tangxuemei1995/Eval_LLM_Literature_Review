{"Literature Review": "Lepton Flavor Violation and Lepton Flavor Universality Violation in b and c Decays: A Comprehensive Review\n\nThe Standard Model of particle physics describes the behavior of fundamental particles and forces, but it is not without its limitations. One of the most significant open questions in particle physics is the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Recent experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have provided new insights into the nature of matter and the fundamental interactions. Two key areas of research have emerged: lepton flavor universality (LFU) and lepton flavor violation (LFV) in b and c decays.\n\nLepton Flavor Universality (LFU) is a fundamental concept in particle physics that states that the interactions between leptons are the same for all flavors. This concept has been extensively tested in various experiments, including the LHCb experiment at the LHC. The LHCb experiment has reported several anomalies that suggest non-standard LFU effects (1, 2). For example, the LHCb experiment has observed a discrepancy in the branching ratio of the B_s → μμ decay, which could be indicative of LFV (3).\n\nLepton Flavor Violation (LFV) is a phenomenon in which a lepton of one flavor is converted into a lepton of another flavor. This process is highly suppressed in the Standard Model and is therefore a potential signature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHCb experiment has also reported evidence for LFV in the B_s → μμ decay (4).\n\nTheoretical models that attempt to explain the observed LFU and LFV effects include the seesaw mechanism (5) and the Pati-Salam model (6). The seesaw mechanism proposes that the neutrino masses arise from the exchange of heavy particles, while the Pati-Salam model proposes that the neutrino masses arise from the exchange of particles that are not part of the Standard Model. Both models predict the existence of new particles that could be responsible for the observed LFU and LFV effects.\n\nExperimental searches for LFV and LFU effects are ongoing at the LHC and at future colliders. The LHCb experiment has reported several results on LFV and LFU effects, including the observation of a discrepancy in the branching ratio of the B_s → μμ decay (3). The CMS experiment has also reported results on LFV effects, including the observation of a possible signal for the decay B_s → μμ (7).\n\nIn conclusion, the observed LFU and LFV effects in b and c decays provide strong evidence for the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Theoretical models that attempt to explain these effects include the seesaw mechanism and the Pati-Salam model. Experimental searches for LFV and LFU effects are ongoing and will continue to provide new insights into the nature of matter and the fundamental interactions.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Aaij, R., et al.
