{"Literature Review": "The s process is a crucial neutron-capture process that produces the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. This process is essential for understanding the chemical composition of stars, planets, and the interstellar medium. In this review, we will discuss the main properties of the s process, its astrophysical sites, and the current observational evidence for its occurrence. We will also explore the nuclear physics input required to investigate the s process and its extensions beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes.\n\nThe s process is a type of neutron-capture process that occurs in the presence of a neutron-rich environment. This process is characterized by the capture of free neutrons by atomic nuclei, leading to the formation of heavier elements. The s process is thought to occur in the hearts of massive stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, where the neutron density is high enough to sustain the process.\n\nMassive stars are the most likely astrophysical sites for the s process. These stars have high neutron densities due to their rapid rotation and convective zones, which lead to the formation of neutron-rich environments. The s process in massive stars is thought to occur in the core, where the neutron density is highest. The products of the s process in massive stars are then dispersed into the interstellar medium through stellar winds and supernovae explosions.\n\nAGB stars are also thought to be sites for the s process. These stars have lower neutron densities than massive stars, but the s process can still occur in the presence of a neutron-rich environment. The s process in AGB stars is thought to occur in the asymptotic giant branch phase, where the star is undergoing a thermal pulse. The products of the s process in AGB stars are then dispersed into the interstellar medium through stellar winds.\n\nThe s process is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of nuclear physics. The process involves the capture of free neutrons by atomic nuclei, leading to the formation of heavier elements. The s process is characterized by the presence of a neutron-rich environment, which is necessary for the process to occur. The s process is also sensitive to the neutron-to-proton ratio, which affects the yield of the process.\n\nCurrent observational evidence for the s process includes stellar spectroscopic observations and laboratory analysis of meteorites. Stellar spectroscopic observations have revealed the presence of s-process elements in the spectra of stars. Laboratory analysis of meteorites has also provided evidence for the s process, as meteorites contain s-process elements that are not produced by other astrophysical processes.\n\nThe s process has been extensively studied in the laboratory, and several experiments have been conducted to investigate the process. These experiments have provided valuable insights into the nuclear physics input required to investigate the s process. The results of these experiments have been used to develop models of the s process that can be applied to astrophysical environments.\n\nIn addition to the s process, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes. These processes are thought to occur in the presence of a neutron-rich environment, but the neutron density is lower than in the s process. The products of these processes are thought to be s-process elements that are not produced by the s process.\n\nThe s process is an essential component of the chemical evolution of the Universe. The process produces the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron, which are essential for the formation of planets and the interstellar medium. The s process is also sensitive to the neutron-to-proton ratio, which affects the yield of the process. Understanding the s process is essential for understanding the chemical composition of the Universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the s process is a complex neutron-capture process that produces the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. The process occurs in the presence of a neutron-rich environment and is characterized by the capture of free neutrons by atomic nuclei. The s process is an essential component of the chemical evolution of the Universe and requires a deep understanding of nuclear physics.", "References": [{"title": "Synthesis of the elements", "authors": "G.
