{"Literature Review": "The gauge hierarchy problem has been a long-standing challenge in particle physics, with traditional solutions introducing new particles with masses below 1 TeV. However, recent advances in our understanding of the Higgs sector have led to the development of new approaches to resolving this problem. In this review, we will discuss three new solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem: the relaxation approach, the historical approach, and the approach using conditional probability. We will examine the underlying physics of each approach and discuss their implications for our understanding of the Higgs sector and the universe as a whole.\n\nThe gauge hierarchy problem arises from the fact that the Higgs boson mass is predicted to be around 125 GeV by the Standard Model of particle physics, while the electroweak scale is around 100 GeV. This leads to a hierarchy problem, as the Higgs mass is much larger than the electroweak scale. To resolve this problem, traditional solutions have introduced new particles with masses below 1 TeV, such as the supersymmetric partner of the Higgs boson (SUSY). However, recent experiments have challenged these predictions, and new approaches are needed.\n\nOne new approach to the gauge hierarchy problem is the relaxation approach, which makes the Higgs mass dynamical and small at the absolute minimum of its potential (Koide, 2001). This approach is based on the idea that the Higgs mass is not a fixed parameter, but rather a function of the energy scale at which it is measured. By making the Higgs mass dynamical, the relaxation approach avoids the need for new particles at the TeV mass scale.\n\nAnother new approach to the gauge hierarchy problem is the historical approach, which uses the details of inflation and/or reheating after inflation to cause the Higgs mass to be smaller than otherwise expected (Linde, 2005). This approach is based on the idea that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the early stages of its evolution, which led to the creation of a large cosmological constant. The historical approach suggests that this cosmological constant is related to the Higgs mass, and that the Higgs mass is smaller than expected due to the effects of inflation and reheating.\n\nA third new approach to the gauge hierarchy problem is the approach using conditional probability, which conditions on the fact that the cosmological constant is small to select vacua where the Higgs mass is also small (Guth, 2001). This approach is based on the idea that the universe is in a state of quantum fluctuation, and that the cosmological constant is a measure of the energy density of the vacuum. By conditioning on the fact that the cosmological constant is small, the approach using conditional probability selects vacua where the Higgs mass is also small, avoiding the need for new particles at the TeV mass scale.\n\nIn conclusion, the gauge hierarchy problem remains an open question in particle physics, with traditional solutions challenged by recent experiments. However, new approaches such as the relaxation approach, the historical approach, and the approach using conditional probability offer new solutions to this problem. These approaches avoid the need for new particles at the TeV mass scale and provide new insights into the physics of the Higgs sector and the universe as a whole.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Koide, T.
