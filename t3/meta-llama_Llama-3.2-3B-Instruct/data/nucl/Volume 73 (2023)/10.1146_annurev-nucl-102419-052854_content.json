{"Literature Review": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the top quark, the heaviest fundamental particle, since its inception. Theoretical predictions and experimental measurements have converged to provide unprecedented precision in this area of high-energy physics. This review aims to appraise the current state of top quark physics at the LHC and outline the prospects for future research.", "References": [{"title": "Measurement of the top quark mass from the mass of the W boson in the top quark-antitop quark system", "authors": "Aaboud, M., et al.
