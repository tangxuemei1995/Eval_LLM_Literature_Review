{"Literature Review": "The study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions has led to a deeper understanding of the quantum chromodynamics medium at extremely high temperatures. Jet quenching has provided unique insights into the transport properties of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP) created in these energetic collisions. Medium response to jet energy loss is a crucial aspect of jet–QGP interaction and is indispensable in understanding the soft components of jets. This review focuses on recent theoretical and phenomenological developments regarding medium response to jet energy loss, including both weakly and strongly coupled approaches for describing the thermalization and propagation of energy deposition from jets, effects of medium response on jet observables, and exploration of its unique signatures in jet–hadron correlations. Jet-induced medium excitation is shown to be an essential component in probing the in-medium dynamics of jets and a critical step toward precise extraction of the QGP properties. The interplay between jet quenching and jet-induced medium excitation is a complex phenomenon that requires a comprehensive understanding of both processes. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge on medium response to jet energy loss and its implications for jet–hadron correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.", "References": [{"title": "Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions", "authors": "K.
