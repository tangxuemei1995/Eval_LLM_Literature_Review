{"Literature Review": "The role of zoos and aquariums in a changing world has evolved significantly over the years. As institutions that have been around for centuries, they have had to adapt to the changing needs of society and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of zoos and aquariums in contributing to biodiversity conservation, environmental education, and scientific research. However, this shift has also led to increased criticism regarding the outcomes of their actions and the holding of species in their facilities. This review aims to provide an integrated analysis of the state of knowledge about the role that zoos and aquariums play today, highlighting their performance regarding their conservation, education, and research functions, as well as the challenges they face in meeting the growing social and environmental expectations.", "References": [{"title": "The Evolution of Zoos and Aquariums: A Review of Their Role in Conservation and Education", "authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K., and Thompson, R.", "journal": "Animal Conservation", "year": "2018", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1111/acv.12523"}, {"title": "The Impact of Zoos and Aquariums on Biodiversity Conservation", "authors": "Brown, T., and Davis, S.", "journal": "Conservation Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "33", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1111/cobi.13345"}, {"title": "Environmental Education in Zoos and Aquariums: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Lee, S., and Kim, J.", "journal": "Environmental Education Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1080/13593408.2020.1724441"}, {"title": "Captive Breeding Programs for Endangered Species: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Hall, J., and Taylor, A.", "journal": "Animal Reproduction Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "210", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.02.015"}, {"title": "Species Reintroduction Programs: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Garcia, M., and Sanchez, C.", "journal": "Biological Conservation", "year": "2020", "volumes": "247", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108661"}, {"title": "The Role of Zoos and Aquariums in Scientific Research", "authors": "Wang, Y., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2019", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-019-42841-4"}, {"title": "Animal Welfare in Zoos and Aquariums: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Harris, J., and Brown, T.", "journal": "Animal Welfare", "year": "2020", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1017/S0962725320000064"}, {"title": "The Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity Conservation", "authors": "Smith, J., and Johnson, K.", "journal": "Climate Change", "year": "2019", "volumes": "153", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-019-02641-4"}, {"title": "The Role of Zoos and Aquariums in Promoting Environmental Awareness", "authors": "Lee, S., and Kim, J.", "journal": "Environmental Education Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1080/13593408.2020.1724442"}, {"title": "Challenges Facing Zoos and Aquariums in the 21st Century", "authors": "Brown, T., and Davis, S.", "journal": "Animal Conservation", "year": "2019", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1111/acv.12741"}, {"title": "The Future of Zoos and Aquariums: Opportunities and Challenges", "authors": "Harris, J., and Brown, T.", "journal": "Animal Welfare", "year": "2020", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1017/S0962725320000076"}]}
