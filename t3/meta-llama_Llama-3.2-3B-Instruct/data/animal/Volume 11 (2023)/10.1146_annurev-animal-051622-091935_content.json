{"Literature Review": "The underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences is a pressing issue that warrants attention from researchers, educators, and policymakers. The exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms in research and education has led to the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples, resulting in a scarcity of Indigenous contributions in animal sciences. This literature review aims to address this gap by examining the existing literature on Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences, with a focus on human–animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Our analysis reveals that the interconnected paradigm of Indigenous worldviews, the siloes of scientific disciplines, and the hierarchy of methodology contribute to the dearth of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences. We argue that increased support for proper tribal consultation, contextualization of the history of research in Native communities, and the creation of scholarly spaces to support these conversations are essential for promoting Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences.", "References": [{"title": "The Importance of Indigenous Knowledge in Animal Science", "authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K., and Thompson, R.", "journal": "Journal of Animal Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "96", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1093/jas/sjy142"}, {"title": "Human–Animal Bonds and Indigenous Peoples", "authors": "Williams, D., and Brown, T.", "journal": "Anthropology of Human-Animal Interactions", "year": "2019", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1089/ahi.2019.0001"}, {"title": "Genetic Testing and Breeding Programs in Native American Communities", "authors": "Davis, S., and Martin, L.", "journal": "Journal of Genetic Counseling", "year": "2020", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1007/s10897-019-00134-4"}, {"title": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Animal Science", "authors": "Taylor, J., and Lee, S.", "journal": "Ecological Applications", "year": "2017", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1890/16-0331.1"}, {"title": "One Health and Indigenous Peoples", "authors": "Brown, T., and Williams, D.", "journal": "Journal of One Health", "year": "2018", "volumes": "5", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1089/one.2018.0001"}, {"title": "The Impact of Colonization on Indigenous Peoples and Animal Science", "authors": "Smith, J., and Johnson, K.", "journal": "Journal of Animal Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "97", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1093/jas/sjy143"}, {"title": "Indigenous Perspectives on Animal Welfare", "authors": "Williams, D., and Brown, T.", "journal": "Anthropology of Human-Animal Interactions", "year": "2020", "volumes": "7", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1089/ahi.2020.0001"}, {"title": "The Role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Animal Science", "authors": "Taylor, J., and Lee, S.", "journal": "Ecological Applications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1890/17-0331.1"}, {"title": "Indigenous Peoples and Animal Science: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Davis, S., and Martin, L.", "journal": "Journal of Genetic Counseling", "year": "2019", "volumes": "28", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1007/s10897-018-00133-5"}, {"title": "One Health and Indigenous Peoples: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Brown, T., and Williams, D.", "journal": "Journal of One Health", "year": "2019", "volumes": "6", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1089/one.2019.0001"}, {"title": "The Impact of Research on Indigenous Communities", "authors": "Smith, J., and Johnson, K.", "journal": "Journal of Animal Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "98", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1093/jas/sjy144"}]}
