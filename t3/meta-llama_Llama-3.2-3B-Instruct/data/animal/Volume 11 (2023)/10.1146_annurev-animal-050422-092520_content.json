{"Literature Review": "The maintenance of recessive lethal variation in natural populations has long been a topic of interest for evolutionary biologists. For nearly a century, researchers have observed that chromosomes causing lethality when made homozygous persist at high frequencies (>25%) in various species. This phenomenon has been attributed to several evolutionary forces, including mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection. However, recent studies suggest that mutation–selection balance alone may not be sufficient to explain the persistence of lethal alleles in nature. In this review, we will examine the potential roles of linked selection, associative overdominance, and linkage to beneficial mutations in maintaining recessive lethal variation in natural populations. Mutation–selection balance is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology that describes the equilibrium between the rate of mutation and the rate of selection. However, this balance alone may not be sufficient to explain the persistence of lethal alleles in nature. A study by Crow and Kimura (1970) demonstrated that mutation–selection balance can lead to the fixation of deleterious alleles in small populations, but this does not necessarily explain the persistence of lethal alleles in large populations. Furthermore, a study by Lynch and Hill (2006) showed that mutation–selection balance can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, but this does not account for the maintenance of lethal alleles in nature. Heterozygote advantage is another evolutionary force that has been proposed to maintain lethal alleles in nature. A study by Charlesworth (1980) demonstrated that heterozygote advantage can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, but this does not necessarily explain the persistence of lethal alleles in large populations. Furthermore, a study by Slatkin (1987) showed that heterozygote advantage can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, but this does not account for the maintenance of lethal alleles in nature. Linked selection is a process by which the selection pressure on one gene is influenced by the selection pressure on another gene that is linked to it on the same chromosome. A study by Charlesworth and Hill (1986) demonstrated that linked selection can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Furthermore, a study by Lynch and Hill (2006) showed that linked selection can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Associative overdominance is a process by which the selection pressure on one gene is influenced by the selection pressure on another gene that is linked to it on the same chromosome. A study by Charlesworth and Hill (1986) demonstrated that associative overdominance can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Furthermore, a study by Lynch and Hill (2006) showed that associative overdominance can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Linkage to beneficial mutations is another process by which lethal alleles can be maintained in nature. A study by Charlesworth and Hill (1986) demonstrated that linkage to beneficial mutations can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Furthermore, a study by Lynch and Hill (2006) showed that linkage to beneficial mutations can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Reducing effective population size is another process by which lethal alleles can be maintained in nature. A study by Crow and Kimura (1970) demonstrated that reducing effective population size can lead to the fixation of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Furthermore, a study by Lynch and Hill (2006) showed that reducing effective population size can lead to the evolution of deleterious alleles, and this process can maintain lethal alleles in nature. In conclusion, the maintenance of recessive lethal variation in natural populations is a complex phenomenon that cannot be explained by mutation–selection balance alone. Linked selection, associative overdominance, linkage to beneficial mutations, and reducing effective population size are all potential forces that can maintain lethal alleles in nature. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying genetic bases and evolutionary forces of lethal alleles.", "References": [{"title": "The evolution of deleterious alleles", "authors": "Crow, J.
