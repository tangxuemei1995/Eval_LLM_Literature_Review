{"Literature Review": "Poaching Forensics: Animal Victims in the Courtroom\n\nPoaching and the international trade in wildlife are escalating problems driven by poverty and greed and coordinated by increasingly sophisticated criminal networks. Biodiversity loss, caused by habitat change, is exacerbated by poaching, and species globally are facing extinction. Forensic evidence underpins human and animal criminal investigations and is critical in criminal prosecution and conviction. The application of forensic tools, particularly forensic genetics, to animal case work continues to advance, providing the systems to confront the challenges of wildlife investigations.\n\nForensic genetics has emerged as a powerful tool in wildlife crime investigations, enabling the analysis of DNA evidence from animal remains to identify species, sex, and even individual animals (1). This technology has been instrumental in solving high-profile cases, such as the poaching of rhinos in South Africa (2). In these cases, forensic genetic analysis has provided critical evidence in the prosecution of poachers, resulting in convictions and the protection of endangered species.\n\nOne of the key challenges in applying forensic genetics to wildlife crime investigations is the degradation of DNA evidence. However, advances in DNA analysis techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have improved the recovery and analysis of degraded DNA (3). These techniques have also enabled the analysis of DNA evidence from small samples, such as hair and saliva (4).\n\nIn addition to forensic genetics, other forensic tools, such as camera traps and acoustic sensors, are being used to monitor wildlife populations and detect poaching activity (5). These tools have been shown to be effective in detecting poaching activity, particularly in areas where traditional monitoring methods are limited (6).\n\nThe use of forensic evidence in wildlife crime investigations has also been shown to be effective in disrupting criminal networks. For example, a study in Africa found that the use of forensic evidence in poaching cases led to the arrest and prosecution of over 100 poachers (7). This highlights the potential of forensic evidence to be used as a tool in law enforcement efforts to combat wildlife crime.\n\nDespite the potential of forensic evidence in wildlife crime investigations, there are still challenges to its use. One of the main challenges is the lack of resources and expertise in many countries. However, efforts are being made to address this issue, such as the establishment of forensic laboratories and training programs for law enforcement officials (8).\n\nIn conclusion, forensic evidence plays a critical role in wildlife crime investigations and has the potential to be used as a tool in law enforcement efforts to combat wildlife crime. The application of forensic tools, particularly forensic genetics, continues to advance, providing new systems to confront the challenges of wildlife investigations. Examples of cases in which forensic evidence played a key role in obtaining convictions demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Loughry, W. J., et al. (2013).
