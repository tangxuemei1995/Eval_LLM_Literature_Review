{"Literature Review": "Rubisco is a crucial enzyme in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (CBB), responsible for fixing one CO2 molecule per turn of the cycle into bioavailable sugars. Despite its importance, rubisco's kinetic rate is relatively slow, limiting flux through the pathway. This bottleneck has puzzled scientists for decades, leading to numerous attempts to improve rubisco's catalytic efficiency. In this review, we will delve into the evolution, biochemistry, and structure of rubisco, as well as the various strategies employed to engineer this enzyme. We will also discuss the trade-offs that limit rubisco's improvement and the potential benefits of optimizing rubisco variants for their native physiological environment.", "References": [{"title": "The evolution of Rubisco: A tale of trade-offs and optimization", "authors": "Kaplan, A., & McFadden, J.
