{"Literature Review": "Muscle contraction is a complex process that involves the coordinated interaction of multiple proteins and molecular structures. The structural biochemistry of muscle contraction has been extensively studied, and recent high-resolution structural data have provided unprecedented insights into the mechanisms underlying muscle function. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the molecular structures of the components of the thin and thick filaments and highlight the mechanisms underlying force generation through actin–myosin interactions, as well as Ca2+-dependent regulation via the dihydropyridine receptor, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin. We also discuss the impact of cryo–electron microscopy and cryo–electron tomography in leading muscle research into a new era.\n\nThe thin filament is composed mainly of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and troponin. Actin is a long, helical protein that provides the scaffold for muscle contraction (1). Tropomyosin is a coiled-coil protein that wraps around the actin filament and plays a crucial role in regulating muscle contraction (2). Troponin is a complex of three proteins (troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T) that bind to tropomyosin and regulate the interaction between actin and myosin (3).\n\nThe thick myosin filament is composed of myosin heads, which are responsible for the power stroke of muscle contraction (4). Myosin heads are composed of two lobes, the S1 and S2 lobes, which interact with actin to generate force (5). The interaction between actin and myosin is regulated by the binding of calcium ions to troponin C, which causes a conformational change in tropomyosin and exposes the myosin binding site on actin (6).\n\nIn addition to the thin and thick filaments, several other proteins are involved in the contraction mechanism, including the dihydropyridine receptor, the ryanodine receptor, and calmodulin (7, 8, 9). The dihydropyridine receptor is a calcium channel that regulates the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while the ryanodine receptor is a calcium channel that regulates the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (10). Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that regulates the activity of several enzymes involved in muscle contraction (11).\n\nCryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revolutionized the field of structural biology by providing high-resolution images of protein structures (12, 13). These techniques have been used to study the structure of muscle proteins at an unprecedented level of molecular detail, including the structure of the actin-myosin complex (14) and the structure of the dihydropyridine receptor (15).\n\nIn conclusion, the structural biochemistry of muscle contraction is a complex process that involves the coordinated interaction of multiple proteins and molecular structures. Recent high-resolution structural data have provided unprecedented insights into the mechanisms underlying muscle function, and cryo–electron microscopy and cryo–electron tomography have played a crucial role in leading muscle research into a new era.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
