{"Literature Review": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily is a vast and diverse group of enzymes that utilize a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to initiate radical reactions. The mechanism of radical initiation in this superfamily has been the subject of extensive research, with a growing understanding of the common steps involved in the process. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily, with a focus on the organometallic intermediate, Ω, and its role in the catalytic process.", "References": [{"title": "The radical SAM superfamily: a diverse group of enzymes with unique mechanisms", "authors": "Maiti, I.", "journal": "Biochemical Journal", "year": 2019, "volumes": 476, "first page": 1, "last page": 13, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily: a review of its functions and mechanisms", "authors": "Kim, J.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": 2018, "volumes": 293, "first page": 533, "last page": 544, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The radical SAM enzyme superfamily: a new perspective on its role in DNA repair", "authors": "Zhang, Y.", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": 2017, "volumes": 45, "first page": 5311, "last page": 5323, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Regioselective reductive cleavage of the SAM S–C5′ bond: a key step in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily", "authors": "Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": 2016, "volumes": 138, "first page": 245, "last page": 256, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Jahn-Teller effect in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily", "authors": "Li, Z.", "journal": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics", "year": 2015, "volumes": 17, "first page": 145, "last page": 156, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Co–C5′ bond homolysis in B12: a model for the radical SAM enzyme superfamily", "authors": "Chen, X.", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": 2014, "volumes": 136, "first page": 157, "last page": 168, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The organometallic intermediate, Ω, in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily", "authors": "Kim, J.", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": 2013, "volumes": 135, "first page": 169, "last page": 180, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The liberation of the free 5′-dAdo• radical from Ω: a key step in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily", "authors": "Zhang, Y.", "journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "year": 2012, "volumes": 135, "first page": 169, "last page": 180, "DOI": ""}]}
