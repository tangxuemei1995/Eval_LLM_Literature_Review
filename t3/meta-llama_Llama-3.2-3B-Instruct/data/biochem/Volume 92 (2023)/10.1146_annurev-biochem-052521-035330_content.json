{"Literature Review": "The Proteins of mRNA Modification: Writers, Readers, and Erasers\n\nOver the past decade, mRNA modifications have emerged as important regulators of gene expression control in cells. Fueled in large part by the development of tools for detecting RNA modifications transcriptome wide, researchers have uncovered a diverse epitranscriptome that serves as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond simple RNA sequence.\n\nThe most abundant internal modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), has been extensively studied due to its widespread presence in the transcriptome and its role in regulating gene expression. m6A is deposited by methyltransferases (MTAs) and removed by demethylases (DMTs), and its dynamic modification status is read by m6A reader proteins.\n\nThe discovery of the key enzymes involved in m6A modification has significantly advanced our understanding of the epitranscriptome. The MTA1-4 family of enzymes, including METTL3 and METTL14, have been shown to be responsible for the majority of m6A methylation in mammals (1). The DMT1-3 family of enzymes, including FTO, TET1, and TET2, have been implicated in the demethylation of m6A (2-4).\n\nThe function of m6A reader proteins has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These proteins, including YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3, have been shown to bind to m6A-containing RNAs and regulate their translation, splicing, and stability (5-7). The binding of m6A reader proteins to m6A-containing RNAs is mediated by specific recognition motifs, including the YTH domain and the PUM domain (8).\n\nRecent studies have also highlighted the importance of m6A modification in regulating gene expression in various cellular contexts. For example, m6A modification has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival (9-11). Additionally, m6A modification has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental stressors, such as hypoxia and oxidative stress (12-14).\n\nDespite the significant progress made in understanding the epitranscriptome, there are still many unanswered questions. For example, the mechanisms by which m6A modification is regulated in response to cellular stressors are not yet fully understood. Additionally, the role of m6A modification in regulating gene expression in specific cell types, such as neurons and cancer cells, is still a subject of ongoing research.\n\nIn conclusion, the proteins that write, read, and erase m6A marks play critical roles in regulating gene expression in cells. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which m6A modification regulates gene expression and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A modification in disease states.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
