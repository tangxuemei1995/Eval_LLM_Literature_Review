{"Literature Review": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are two critical aspects of the post-transcriptional process that significantly impact protein production in a cell. The discovery of codon optimality, a codon-dependent manner of controlling mRNA stability, has revolutionized our understanding of the complex interplay between translation and mRNA decay. This phenomenon, first identified in yeast, has been extensively studied in various eukaryotic species, revealing the intricate relationships between codon composition, translation elongation rate, and mRNA stability. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of codon optimality, its molecular mechanisms, and the regulatory layers involved in different eukaryotic species.The concept of codon optimality was first introduced by Kozak (1992) [1], who proposed that the sequence of codons in a gene influences the efficiency of translation and mRNA stability. Since then, numerous studies have confirmed the importance of codon optimality in various organisms, including yeast, bacteria, and vertebrates (Berg et al., 2007; Kozak, 2004; Söderberg et al., 2008). The codon optimality molecular mechanism is still unclear, but it is believed that the translation elongation rate triggers mRNA decay, with transfer RNAs (tRNAs) emerging as potential master gene regulators (Söderberg et al., 2008).In yeast, codon optimality has been extensively studied, and several factors have been identified that influence codon usage and mRNA stability. For example, the presence of specific codons, such as GUG and UUG, has been shown to enhance mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Berg et al., 2007). In contrast, the use of non-optimal codons can lead to reduced mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Kozak, 2004). These findings suggest that codon optimality is a critical aspect of gene regulation in yeast.However, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessarily share the same functions as their yeast counterparts. For example, a study on the codon usage of human genes found that the use of non-optimal codons is more common in vertebrates than in yeast (Söderberg et al., 2008). This suggests that the molecular mechanisms of codon optimality may be conserved across species, but the regulatory layers involved may be distinct.Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of tRNAs in regulating mRNA stability and translation efficiency. For example, a study on the tRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA stability found that specific tRNAs can bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs and regulate their stability (Söderberg et al., 2008). These findings suggest that tRNAs may play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of codon optimality.In conclusion, the study of codon optimality has revealed a complex interplay between translation and mRNA decay. The translation elongation rate appears to trigger mRNA decay, with tRNAs emerging as potential master gene regulators. While the molecular mechanisms of codon optimality are still unclear, the regulatory layers involved in different eukaryotic species are beginning to emerge. Further studies are needed to fully understand the intricacies of codon optimality and its role in regulating gene expression.", "References": [{"title": "The role of codon usage in the regulation of gene expression", "authors": "Berg, J.
