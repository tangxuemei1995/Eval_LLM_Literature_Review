{"Literature Review": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple protein factors to cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription. This process is crucial for the production of mature transcripts, and any disruptions in this process can lead to aberrant gene expression. In this review, we will summarize the current understanding of mRNA 3′-end processing, including the machinery, regulation, and impact on gene expression.", "References": [{"title": "Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) in Humans", "authors": "Lerner, M., & Sharp, P.
