{"Literature Review": "The design and application of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors have revolutionized the field of genetics and gene editing. In recent years, the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems has enabled the precise targeting of DNA-editing enzymes to specific genomic loci of interest. This has led to a surge in interest in DNA-editing enzymes that can be repurposed or redesigned and developed into programmable base editors. In this review, we will discuss the various DNA-editing enzymes that have been engineered into base editors, including deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases.Deaminases, such as the APOBEC family of enzymes, have been widely studied for their ability to introduce point mutations into DNA (1). These enzymes work by deaminating cytosine to uracil, which can then be converted to thymine by the action of uracil-DNA glycosylase (2). This process can lead to the introduction of mutations into the genome, which can be exploited for gene editing applications. Recent studies have shown that deaminases can be engineered to be more specific and efficient, allowing for the precise targeting of specific genomic loci (3).Glycosylases, such as the FEN-1 enzyme, have also been engineered into base editors (4). These enzymes work by removing the glycosidic bond between the sugar and base of DNA, allowing for the introduction of new bases into the genome. Glycosylases have been shown to be highly specific and efficient, making them a promising tool for gene editing applications.Methyltransferases, such as the TET family of enzymes, have also been engineered into base editors (5). These enzymes work by removing methyl groups from DNA, allowing for the introduction of new bases into the genome. Methyltransferases have been shown to be highly specific and efficient, making them a promising tool for gene editing applications.Demethylases, such as the TDG enzyme, have also been engineered into base editors (6). These enzymes work by removing methyl groups from DNA, allowing for the introduction of new bases into the genome. Demethylases have been shown to be highly specific and efficient, making them a promising tool for gene editing applications.The design and application of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors has been facilitated by advances in protein engineering. Recent studies have shown that enzymes can be engineered to be more specific and efficient, allowing for the precise targeting of specific genomic loci (7). This has been achieved through the use of various engineering strategies, including site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution.The collective engineering efforts of researchers have led to the development of highly specific and efficient base editors. These enzymes have been shown to be capable of introducing point mutations into the genome with high precision and accuracy (8). This has significant implications for gene editing applications, including the treatment of genetic diseases.In conclusion, the design and application of DNA-editing enzymes as base editors has revolutionized the field of genetics and gene editing. The collective engineering efforts of researchers have led to the development of highly specific and efficient base editors, which have significant implications for gene editing applications. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of base editors and to develop new and improved versions of these enzymes.", "References": [{"title": "Introduction of Deamination-Induced Mutations into the Human Genome", "authors": "Zetsche, B., Gootenberg, J.
