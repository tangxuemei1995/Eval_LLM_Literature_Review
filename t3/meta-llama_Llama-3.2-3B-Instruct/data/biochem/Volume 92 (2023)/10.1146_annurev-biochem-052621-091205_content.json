{"Literature Review": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a crucial DNA repair pathway that recognizes and removes bulky DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. These lesions, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs), can cause significant damage to the genome, leading to mutations, chromosomal instability, and cell death. In contrast to global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), TC-NER is specifically activated in response to UV-induced DNA damage and is mediated by the stalled RNA polymerase II, Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA, and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA). The recognition of DNA lesions by TC-NER is distinct from GG-NER, with TC-NER being more efficient in removing CPDs and 6-4PPs. The ubiquitylation of proteins, such as CSB and UVSSA, plays a critical role in regulating TC-NER activity and is essential for the efficient removal of DNA lesions. Furthermore, UV irradiation induces a transcriptional response that involves the activation of signaling cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which regulates gene expression and DNA repair. Mutations in NER factors, such as CSB, CSA, and XPD, are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, two diseases characterized by impaired DNA repair and increased susceptibility to UV-induced skin cancer and premature aging. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of TC-NER, its role in the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage, and the pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome.", "References": [{"title": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair: A review", "authors": "S.
