{"Literature Review": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment, playing a multifaceted role in cancer progression. The complex cargo of EVs, including membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, noncoding RNAs, and double-stranded DNA fragments, enables them to deposit paracrine information and induce phenotypic changes in recipient cells. This unique form of cellular cross-talk has been implicated in conditioning the premetastatic niche, evading the immune response, and promoting invasive and metastatic activity. The dynamic nature of EVs, with their varying content and number depending on the tumor of origin, disease stage, or response to therapy, has sparked interest in their potential use for risk stratification, diagnostic, and prognostic purposes. This review aims to summarize recent developments and current knowledge on EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and the implementation of EV-based liquid biopsies as tumor biomarkers.", "References": [{"title": "Extracellular vesicles in cancer: A new frontier in the fight against cancer", "authors": "Skog, J., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "457", "last page": "474", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-018-2551-8"}, {"title": "Exosomes and microvesicles in cancer: A review of their role in tumor progression and metastasis", "authors": "Thakur, B.
