{"Literature Review": "Mastocytosis is a complex and heterogeneous group of neoplasms characterized by the accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in various organ systems. The disease can present as cutaneous mastocytosis or systemic mastocytosis (SM), which is further divided into indolent, smoldering, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia based on histopathological and molecular features, clinical variables, and organ involvement. The genetic background, additional somatic mutations, and comorbidities also contribute to the course and prognosis of SM. A key driver of MC expansion and disease evolution is the oncogenic machinery triggered by mutant forms of KIT, particularly the KIT D816V mutation, which is found in approximately 50-60% of SM patients (1). This mutation leads to the constitutive activation of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, resulting in the proliferation and survival of MCs (2). The genetic background of SM patients can also influence the disease course, with some studies suggesting that patients with a history of allergic disorders or atopic conditions may have a more favorable prognosis (3). In addition to the genetic factors, comorbidities such as anaphylaxis, which is a common mediator-related symptom in SM patients, can also impact the disease course and quality of life (4). The diagnosis of SM is often challenging, and a comprehensive diagnostic approach is necessary to accurately diagnose the disease. The diagnostic criteria for SM have been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and include histopathological, clinical, and molecular features (5). The WHO classification system also includes a risk stratification system, which takes into account the presence of KIT D816V mutation, organ involvement, and comorbidities to predict the prognosis of SM patients (6). In recent years, targeted therapies have emerged as a promising treatment option for SM patients. The most commonly used targeted therapy is imatinib, which has been shown to be effective in reducing MC counts and improving symptoms in SM patients (7). Other targeted therapies, such as sunitinib and dasatinib, have also been investigated in clinical trials, but their efficacy and safety have not been fully established (8). The use of targeted therapies in SM patients has also been associated with a reduced risk of anaphylaxis and other mediator-related symptoms (9). In conclusion, mastocytosis is a complex and heterogeneous disease that requires a comprehensive diagnostic approach and targeted therapies. The genetic background, additional somatic mutations, and comorbidities all contribute to the course and prognosis of SM. The use of targeted therapies has emerged as a promising treatment option for SM patients, and further research is needed to fully establish their efficacy and safety.", "References": [{"title": "Mastocytosis: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "L.
