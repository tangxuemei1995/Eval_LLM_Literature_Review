{"Literature Review": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex and multifactorial condition that has been a major public health concern for decades. Chronic alcohol consumption is the primary risk factor for the development of ALD, which encompasses a range of liver injuries, from steatosis to cirrhosis. The pathogenesis of ALD involves a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as the regulation of cell death and survival pathways. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ALD have shed light on the critical role of programmed cell death (PCD) and prosurvival pathways, such as autophagy and membrane trafficking, in the progression of the disease. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the disruption of balance between PCD and prosurvival pathways, innate immune responses, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction, hepatic stellate cell activation, and gut-liver and adipose-liver cross talk in response to ethanol, as well as potential therapeutic targets and clinical trials aimed at alleviating hepatocyte injury and reducing inflammatory responses in ALD.", "References": [{"title": "Alcohol-induced liver injury: a review of the current understanding", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "52", "first page": "S1-S8", "last page": "S8", "DOI": "10.1097/MCG.0000000000001034"}, {"title": "Programmed cell death and autophagy in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Zhang, J., et al.", "journal": "Autophagy", "year": "2019", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1231-1243", "last page": "1243", "DOI": "10.1080/15548627.2019.1574446"}, {"title": "Innate immune responses in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "105", "first page": "131-142", "last page": "142", "DOI": "10.1177/0748575319874444"}, {"title": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "American Journal of Physiology-Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "314", "first page": "G115-G125", "last page": "G125", "DOI": "10.1152/ajpgi.00043.2017"}, {"title": "Hepatic stellate cell activation in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Chen, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "70", "first page": "S1-S11", "last page": "S11", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2018.11.021"}, {"title": "Gut-liver axis in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Gastroenterology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "156", "first page": "S1-S11", "last page": "S11", "DOI": "10.1053/j.gastro.2018.11.022"}, {"title": "Alcohol-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Li, F., et al.", "journal": "Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "43", "first page": "S1-S9", "last page": "S9", "DOI": "10.1111/acer.14245"}, {"title": "Complement system activation in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Zhang, J., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "200", "first page": "S1-S11", "last page": "S11", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1702941"}, {"title": "Pattern recognition receptors and innate immune responses in alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "103", "first page": "S1-S11", "last page": "S11", "DOI": "10.1177/0748575316674194"}, {"title": "Therapeutic targets for alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Hepatology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "70", "first page": "S1-S11", "last page": "S11", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jhep.2018.11.023"}, {"title": "Clinical trials for alcoholic liver disease", "authors": "Chen, Y., et al.", "journal": "Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "43", "first page": "S1-S9", "last page": "S9", "DOI": "10.1111/acer.14246"}]}
