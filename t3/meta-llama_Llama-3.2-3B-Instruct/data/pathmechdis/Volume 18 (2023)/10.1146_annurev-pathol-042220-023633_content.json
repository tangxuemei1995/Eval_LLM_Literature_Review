{"Literature Review": "Adipose tissue has long been regarded as a passive storage depot for energy, but recent studies have revealed its complex endocrine function and active role in disease initiation and progression. The tissue is composed of distinct subtypes of adipocytes, including white adipocytes (WAT), brown adipocytes (BAT), and beige adipocytes (BAT), each with unique developmental origins and secretory roles. The interplay between these adipocyte subtypes and the surrounding microenvironment plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy systemic physiology. However, disruptions in this delicate balance can lead to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (1, 2). In this review, we will discuss the distinct subtypes of adipocytes, their developmental origins, and secretory roles, as well as the dynamic interplay at work within the tissue itself, with a focus on the relationship between adipose tissue and disease states, including obesity, cachexia, and infectious diseases (3-10).", "References": [{"title": "Adipose tissue biology", "authors": "Cronin, J.
