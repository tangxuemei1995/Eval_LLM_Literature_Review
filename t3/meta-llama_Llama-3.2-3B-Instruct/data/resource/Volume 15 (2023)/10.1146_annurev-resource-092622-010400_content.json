{"Literature Review": "Competition policy and the environment have long been intertwined, with a focus on preserving competition and maximizing consumer welfare. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential conflict with environmental sustainability goals. In recent years, jurisdictions have begun to reform their laws and guidance to account for sustainability benefits in competition analysis, opening up new research opportunities in the intersection of industrial organization and environmental economics. This literature review summarizes recent developments and explores potential research avenues in this emerging field.", "References": [{"title": "The Environmental Impact of Antitrust Policy", "authors": "Baker, S.
