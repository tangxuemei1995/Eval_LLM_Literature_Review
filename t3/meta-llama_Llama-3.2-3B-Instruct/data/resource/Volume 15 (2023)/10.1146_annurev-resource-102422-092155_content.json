{"Literature Review": "Sir Partha Dasgupta's contributions to environmental and development economics have been instrumental in shaping the field into what it is today. His seminal work has not only provided a framework for understanding the complex relationships between the environment and economic development but has also inspired a new generation of scholars to pursue research in this area. This literature review aims to provide an overview of Sir Partha's life, his contributions to environmental and development economics, and the impact of his work on the field.", "References": [{"title": "Dasgupta, P., & Zilberman, D.
