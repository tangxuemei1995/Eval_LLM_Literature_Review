{"Literature Review": "Agroecology has been increasingly recognized as a crucial approach to transform the agricultural and food system towards more sustainable and resilient practices. The concept of agroecology, which emphasizes the use of local, natural, and diverse resources to produce food, has been gaining attention in recent years due to its potential to address the complex challenges facing the agri-food system. This review aims to investigate the extent to which agroecology can become the mainstream model for transforming agriculture towards more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems within the given economic and political context. To achieve this, we need to consider the various drivers, actors, and stakeholders involved in the agro-food system, as well as the processes and relationships that shape its dynamics. In this context, we will examine the current state of agroecology, its potential benefits and limitations, and the challenges it faces in terms of large-scale adoption. We will also discuss the need for an integrated multiscale systems approach, new and emerging technologies, and adequate policy design to support the transformation towards agroecological practices.", "References": [{"title": "Agroecology and Sustainable Agriculture", "authors": "Gliessman, S.
