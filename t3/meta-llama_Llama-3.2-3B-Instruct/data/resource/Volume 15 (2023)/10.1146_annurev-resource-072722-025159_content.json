{"Literature Review": "Food loss in agrifood systems is a significant issue that affects global food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Despite the progress made since the United Nations and the G20 put food loss and food waste on the global agenda in 2015, the scale of the problem persists due to the lack of separate measurements and data. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on food loss, its causes, determinants, and interventions to reduce it. The review highlights the need for improved microdata collection and standardized measurements to separate food loss from food waste, which would enable the identification of intervention hot spots, trade-offs, and synergies across the value chain. The findings of this review have important implications for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working to address food loss and improve food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development.", "References": [{"title": "Measuring Food Losses and Food Waste", "authors": "Tilman, D., & Clark, M.
