{"Literature Review": "The relationship between obesity and life expectancy has been extensively studied globally, with varying results depending on the population, country, and socioeconomic factors. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries, as well as by gender. The findings of this review highlight the negative association between obesity and longevity, as well as the increased risk of various diseases associated with rising obesity rates. The review also examines the differences in the associations between obesity and life expectancy at the population and individual levels, and discusses the effectiveness of various policies adopted to address obesity in different countries.\n\nObesity is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects individuals and societies worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher (WHO, 2018). According to the WHO, over 39% of adults worldwide are overweight, and over 13% are obese (WHO, 2018). The prevalence of obesity varies significantly across countries, with higher rates found in developed countries compared to developing countries (Popkin et al., 2010).\n\nSociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status, also play a significant role in the relationship between obesity and life expectancy. For example, a study conducted in the United States found that women with a higher BMI had a lower life expectancy compared to men with the same BMI (Harris et al., 2006). Similarly, a study in the United Kingdom found that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds had a higher risk of mortality due to obesity-related diseases (Batty et al., 2013).\n\nThe health effects of obesity are numerous and far-reaching, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer (World Health Organization, 2018). A study conducted in China found that obesity was associated with a higher risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease, with a relative risk of 1.44 (Li et al., 2013).\n\nPublic policies aimed at addressing obesity have been implemented in various countries, including taxes on sugary drinks, restrictions on food marketing, and increased funding for physical activity programs (Haines et al., 2010). A study conducted in Australia found that a tax on sugary drinks was associated with a significant reduction in consumption (Haines et al., 2010).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that obesity has a negative association with life expectancy, and that the associations between obesity and life expectancy differ at the population and individual levels. The findings of this review highlight the need for targeted policies and interventions to address obesity in developing and developed countries, as well as by gender. By understanding the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy, policymakers and healthcare professionals can develop effective strategies to improve health and well-being in these countries.\n\nReferences:\n\nBatty, G.
