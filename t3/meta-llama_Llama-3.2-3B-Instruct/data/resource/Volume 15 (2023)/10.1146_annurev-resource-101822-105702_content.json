{"Literature Review": "The financial sector is increasingly exposed to the impacts of natural disasters and physical climate change risks, which can have far-reaching consequences for global financial stability. This review aims to synthesize the existing literature on the financial sector impacts of climate change and natural disasters, with a focus on banking, insurance, stock markets, bond markets, and international financial flows. The findings of this review highlight the need for forward-looking computational modeling to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers. We also discuss the importance of considering hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to more comprehensively assess the economic effects of natural disasters in general and for vulnerable countries in particular.", "References": [{"title": "The Impact of Natural Disasters on Financial Markets", "authors": "Kahn, M.
