{"Literature Review": "The implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes has been a widely recommended policy solution to address the growing burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases (CNDs) associated with overweight and obesity worldwide. Despite the widespread adoption of SSB taxes over the last decade, the literature suggests that only a portion of the tax is passed forward to consumers, resulting in mild and highly variable impacts on SSB purchases. This review aims to assess the state of knowledge regarding the impacts of SSB taxes and provide context for the results reported to date based on the recent consumer behavior literature and incentives of supply-chain intermediaries in modern food markets.The World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health authorities have consistently recommended the implementation of SSB taxes as a key strategy to reduce the consumption of SSBs and promote healthier diets (1). The rationale behind this recommendation is based on the evidence that SSBs are a major contributor to the global burden of CNDs, with sugary drinks accounting for approximately 44% of the global sugar intake (2). The implementation of SSB taxes has been seen as a potential solution to address this public health concern, as it can help to reduce the consumption of SSBs and promote healthier beverage choices.However, the literature suggests that the implementation of SSB taxes has been met with limited success in reducing SSB consumption. A systematic review of 32 studies on the impact of SSB taxes found that only a portion of the tax is passed forward to consumers, resulting in mild and highly variable impacts on SSB purchases (3). This finding is consistent with previous studies that have reported that the majority of the tax is retained by distributors or manufacturers, with only a small portion being passed forward to consumers (4, 5).The lack of consistency in the impact of SSB taxes on SSB consumption has been attributed to various factors, including the design of the tax, the level of tax revenue, and the incentives of supply-chain intermediaries in modern food markets (6). For example, a study found that the level of tax revenue can influence the behavior of distributors and manufacturers, with higher tax revenues leading to increased investment in healthier beverage options (7). Similarly, a study found that the incentives of supply-chain intermediaries can influence the behavior of consumers, with retailers offering discounts and promotions on healthier beverages in response to SSB taxes (8).Despite the limited success of SSB taxes in reducing SSB consumption, the literature suggests that these taxes can still have a positive impact on public health. A study found that SSB taxes can lead to a reduction in the consumption of SSBs among low-income households, which are disproportionately affected by the negative health effects of SSB consumption (9). Similarly, a study found that SSB taxes can lead to an increase in the consumption of healthier beverages among adults, particularly those who are overweight or obese (10).In conclusion, the literature suggests that SSB taxes have had limited success in reducing SSB consumption, with only a portion of the tax being passed forward to consumers. However, the evidence also suggests that SSB taxes can still have a positive impact on public health, particularly among low-income households and those who are overweight or obese. To improve the effectiveness of SSB taxes, policymakers may need to consider alternative policy approaches, such as increasing the level of tax revenue or implementing other policies to promote healthier beverage choices.", "References": [{"title": "World Health Organization.
