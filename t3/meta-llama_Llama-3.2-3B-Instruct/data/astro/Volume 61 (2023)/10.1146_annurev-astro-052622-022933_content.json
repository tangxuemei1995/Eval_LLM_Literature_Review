{"Literature Review": "Circumbinary accretion is a complex phenomenon that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its implications on stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. This review aims to provide an overview of the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. We will discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks.The dynamics of circumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at the binary period (Pb) or ∼5Pb, depending on the binary eccentricity eb and mass ratio qeb. This variability is a result of the complex interplay between the binary and the circumbinary disk. The inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes taking place in the disk. This structure can lead to the formation of planets and the migration of planets within the disk.Over long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (eb and qeb) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas. This evolution can lead to the formation of massive binary black holes, which are of great interest in the field of astrophysics.A misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. However, when eb is significant, the disk can evolve toward 'polar alignment,' with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane. This alignment can have significant implications for the formation of planets and the evolution of the binary system.The connection between circumbinary accretion and protoplanetary disks is an area of active research. Observations of protoplanetary disks have shown that they can be highly inclined and warped, which can lead to the formation of planets and the migration of planets within the disk. The dynamics of circumbinary accretion can also impact the formation of planets and the migration of planets within the disk.In addition to its implications for stellar binary formation/evolution and circumbinary planet formation/migration, circumbinary accretion can also impact the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. The mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks can be triggered by the presence of a circumbinary disk. This can lead to the formation of massive binary black holes, which are of great interest in the field of astrophysics.In conclusion, circumbinary accretion is a complex phenomenon that has significant implications for stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. The dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and the connection with observations of protoplanetary disks are areas of active research. Further study of circumbinary accretion is needed to fully understand its implications for the formation and evolution of celestial objects.", "References": [{"title": "The role of the circumbinary disk in the formation of binary stars", "authors": "Bate, M.
