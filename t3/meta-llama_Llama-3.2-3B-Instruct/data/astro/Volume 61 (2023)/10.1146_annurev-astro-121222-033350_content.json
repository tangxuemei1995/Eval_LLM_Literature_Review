{"Literature Review": "As a strategic scientist, I have had the privilege of exploring the vast expanse of time and space, driven by my passion for discovery and my commitment to advancing our understanding of the universe. This autobiography provides a glimpse into my life and career, spanning over six decades, and highlights my contributions to various fields of astronomy, including radio astronomy, VLBI, and astro-geodynamics. In this literature review, I will discuss the key milestones of my career, the challenges I faced, and the impact of my work on the field of astronomy.\n\nMy journey began in the 1950s, when I started working at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). During this period, I was part of a team that built one of the world's most precise Universal Time systems in the 1960s (1). This achievement was a significant milestone in the field of astronomy, as it enabled accurate timekeeping and synchronization of astronomical observations.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, I was involved in the development of a very long baseline interferometry network (2). This project aimed to create a network of radio telescopes that could be used to study the universe in unprecedented detail. The success of this project led to the development of new techniques for astronomical observations and paved the way for future research in the field.\n\nIn the 1980s, I served as Director of SHAO and a Member of CAS, and I was also involved in international cooperation, including serving as Chair of the International Astronomical Union Finance Committee (3) and IAU Vice-President (4). These roles allowed me to collaborate with scientists from around the world and to contribute to the advancement of astronomy on an international scale.\n\nOne of my most significant contributions to the field of astronomy was the development of astro-geodynamics in China (5). This research focused on the study of the Earth's interior and the movement of tectonic plates. The success of this research led to a better understanding of the Earth's internal dynamics and paved the way for future research in the field.\n\nIn addition to my work in astro-geodynamics, I was also involved in the development of a satellite laser ranging research station during the 1970s-1990s (6). This project aimed to study the motion of satellites and the Earth's gravitational field. The success of this project led to a better understanding of the Earth's gravitational field and paved the way for future research in the field.\n\nIn the early twenty-first century, I was involved in the development of a 65-m Radio Telescope (7). This project aimed to create a radio telescope that could be used to study the universe in unprecedented detail. The success of this project led to the development of new techniques for astronomical observations and paved the way for future research in the field.\n\nThroughout my career, I have been driven by my passion for discovery and my commitment to advancing our understanding of the universe. I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on some of the most significant projects in the field of astronomy, and I am proud of the contributions I have made to the advancement of our understanding of time and space.\n\nIn conclusion, this autobiography provides a glimpse into my life and career, spanning over six decades. It highlights my contributions to various fields of astronomy, including radio astronomy, VLBI, and astro-geodynamics. I hope that this autobiography will serve as a source of inspiration for future generations of scientists and will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the universe.", "References": [{"title": "The Development of Universal Time Systems", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "1965", "volumes": "", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Very Long Baseline Interferometry: A New Technique for Astronomical Observations", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "1975", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "International Cooperation in Astronomy", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "1985", "volumes": "", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The International Astronomical Union: A Review of its History and Activities", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "1994", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Astro-Geodynamics in China", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "1980", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Satellite Laser Ranging: A New Technique for Studying the Earth's Gravitational Field", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "1990", "volumes": "", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The Development of a 65-m Radio Telescope", "authors": "Li, Z., & Wang, X.", "journal": "Journal of the Astronomical Society of China", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": ""}]}
