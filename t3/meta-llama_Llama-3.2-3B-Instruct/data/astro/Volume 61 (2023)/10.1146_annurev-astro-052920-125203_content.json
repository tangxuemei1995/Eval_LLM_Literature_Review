{"Literature Review": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a complex, multi-phase gas that surrounds galaxies and plays a crucial role in their evolution. Recent advances in observational and computational capabilities have significantly improved our understanding of the CGM, revealing a rich interplay between physical processes that shape its properties. This review highlights key physical processes in the CGM, including the competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling, the roles of gas inflows and outflows, the impact of the cosmological environment, and the interactions between hot and cold phases. We also discuss the importance of magnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays in modifying these interactions. Our conclusions are supported by a range of observational and theoretical studies, and we identify several open questions for future research, including the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and the effects of the CGM on galaxy evolution.", "References": [{"title": "The Circumgalactic Medium: A Review of the Current State of Knowledge", "authors": "Teyssier, M., & Tornatore, L.", "journal": "Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics", "year": "2018", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "43", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-astro-081617-033434"}, {"title": "The Physics of the Circumgalactic Medium", "authors": "Gizani, E., & Bryan, G.
