{"Literature Review": "Metabolic Signatures from Genebank Collections: An Underexploited Resource for Human Health?\n\nThe relationship between diet and human health has been a topic of interest for centuries, with the phrase 'you are what you eat' being a widely accepted notion. However, despite its significance, investment in understanding diet-based nutrition has been relatively low compared to that for medicine-based interventions. Traditional breeding programs have primarily focused on increasing crop yields, often at the expense of nutritional quality. This has led to a rise in nutritional deficiencies and accompanying diseases, known as 'hidden hunger' (1).\n\nRecent advances in genome sequencing and metabolomics have opened up new avenues for exploring the nutritional potential of crops. By analyzing the metabolic signatures of genebank collections, researchers can identify superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. This approach has the potential to benefit a broader range of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health (2).\n\nPhytonutrients, such as carotenoids and polyphenols, are examples of compounds that have been linked to improved human health outcomes. These compounds are often found in plant-based foods and have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties (3, 4). However, the genetic diversity of phytonutrients is vast, and traditional breeding programs have often failed to capture this diversity (5).\n\nGenome sequencing and metabolomics can help to identify the genetic variants associated with phytonutrient content and metabolic pathways. For example, a study on the genetic variation of carotenoid content in tomatoes found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with a 25% increase in lycopene content (6). This study highlights the potential of genome sequencing and metabolomics to identify superior alleles related to phytonutrient content.\n\nIn addition to phytonutrients, other compounds with known relevance for human health, such as omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, are also present in plant-based foods. However, the genetic diversity of these compounds is often limited, and traditional breeding programs have failed to capture this diversity (7).\n\nThe use of genebank collections to identify superior alleles related to nutritional quality is an underexploited resource. Genebanks are repositories of crop genetic diversity, and they contain a vast array of genetic variants that have been accumulated over thousands of years of selective breeding. By analyzing the metabolic signatures of genebank collections, researchers can identify genetic variants that are associated with improved nutritional quality (8).\n\nOne of the challenges associated with using genebank collections to identify superior alleles related to nutritional quality is ensuring that the identified alleles do not introduce antinutrients. Antinutrients are compounds that can inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients, and they are often present in plant-based foods. For example, phytates and oxalates are antinutrients that can inhibit the absorption of minerals such as zinc and iron (9).\n\nDespite these challenges, the use of genebank collections to identify superior alleles related to nutritional quality is an approach that has the potential to benefit human health. By identifying genetic variants that are associated with improved nutritional quality, researchers can develop new crop varieties that are more nutritious and sustainable. This approach is complementary to metabolic engineering by transgenesis or gene editing, and it has the potential to reverse some of the losses incurred through a recent focus on breeding for yield (10).\n\nIn conclusion, the use of genebank collections to identify superior alleles related to nutritional quality is an underexploited resource that has the potential to benefit human health. By analyzing the metabolic signatures of genebank collections, researchers can identify genetic variants that are associated with improved nutritional quality, and develop new crop varieties that are more nutritious and sustainable.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
