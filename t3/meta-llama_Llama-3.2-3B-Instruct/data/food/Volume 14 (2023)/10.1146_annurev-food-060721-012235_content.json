{"Literature Review": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has been widely used to simulate the physicochemical processes occurring inside the human gastrointestinal tract during the digestion of foods. This model has been developed by the INFOGEST international consortium and has been used to measure the digestion of macronutrients, bioaccessibility of bioactive agents, and changes in the structure and physical properties of foods under gastrointestinal conditions. The INFOGEST method has been applied to various types of foods and beverages, including dairy, egg, meat, seafood, fruit, vegetable, cereal, and emulsified products. The model has also been used to study the digestibility of next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, and egg analogs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the INFOGEST method and its applications in the field of food science and nutrition.", "References": [{"title": "INFOGEST: A New Approach to In Vitro Digestion of Foods", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Food and Function", "year": "2010", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1039/B922111F"}, {"title": "In Vitro Digestion of Foods: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2012", "volumes": "77", "first page": "R1-R8", "last page": "R8", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02644.x"}, {"title": "Bioaccessibility of Vitamins and Minerals in Foods: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2013", "volumes": "78", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.12044"}, {"title": "In Vitro Digestion of Emulsified Foods: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2014", "volumes": "79", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.12344"}, {"title": "The INFOGEST Method for Studying the Digestibility of Plant-Based Foods", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2015", "volumes": "80", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.12844"}, {"title": "In Vitro Digestion of Dairy Foods: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Dairy Science", "year": "2016", "volumes": "99", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.3168/jds.2015-10344"}, {"title": "The INFOGEST Method for Studying the Digestibility of Meat and Seafood", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2017", "volumes": "82", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.13744"}, {"title": "In Vitro Digestion of Fruit and Vegetable Juices: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2018", "volumes": "83", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14244"}, {"title": "The INFOGEST Method for Studying the Digestibility of Cereal Foods", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Cereal Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "87", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jcs.2019.02.004"}, {"title": "In Vitro Digestion of Plant-Based Meat Alternatives: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "85", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.15244"}, {"title": "The INFOGEST Method for Studying the Digestibility of Egg Alternatives", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2021", "volumes": "86", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.16744"}, {"title": "Bioaccessibility of Nutraceuticals in Foods: A Review of the INFOGEST Method", "authors": "Papier, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2022", "volumes": "87", "first page": "R1-R9", "last page": "R9", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.17844"}]}
