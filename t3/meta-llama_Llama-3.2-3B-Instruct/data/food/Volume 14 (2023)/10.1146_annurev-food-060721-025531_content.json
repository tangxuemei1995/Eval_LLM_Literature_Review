{"Literature Review": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a bioactive phytochemical widely distributed in cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and cabbage. The occurrence of I3C in nature and foods has been extensively studied, with a significant amount found in the edible parts of these plants (1). The main in vivo metabolite of I3C is 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), formed by the condensation of two molecules of I3C (2). Both I3C and DIM have been shown to alter multiple signaling pathways and related molecules controlling diverse cellular events, including oxidation, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity (3, 4). These compounds have been found to possess strong potential to prevent several forms of chronic disease, such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases, and osteoporosis (5, 6). The mechanisms of action of I3C and DIM at cellular and molecular levels involve the modulation of key transcription factors, including NF-κB, AP-1, and STAT3 (7, 8). Additionally, I3C and DIM have been shown to induce the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, which play a crucial role in protecting cells against oxidative stress (9, 10). Furthermore, I3C and DIM have been found to inhibit the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as COX-2 and iNOS, which contribute to the development of chronic diseases (11, 12). The anti-cancer properties of I3C and DIM have been attributed to their ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation in various cancer cell lines (13, 14). In addition, I3C and DIM have been shown to have neuroprotective effects, inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (15, 16). Overall, the preclinical studies suggest that I3C and DIM have significant potential as preventive and therapeutic agents for various chronic diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Occurrence of Indole-3-Carbinol in Cruciferous Vegetables", "authors": "K.
