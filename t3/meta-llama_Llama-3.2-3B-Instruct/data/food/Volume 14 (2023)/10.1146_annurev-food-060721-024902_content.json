{"Literature Review": "Ferritins are a class of iron storage proteins that have been extensively studied for their dual functions in animal and plant kingdoms. These proteins have been found to have a wide distribution, with their presence detected in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and eukaryotes. The two main forms of ferritin are holo and apo, each with distinct functions. The holo form of ferritin is capable of acting as an efficient and safe factor for iron supplementation. This form of ferritin is composed of a protein shell that encloses a core of iron ions, which are released in a controlled manner to provide the necessary iron for the organism. Studies have shown that holo ferritin can be used to treat iron deficiency anemia in humans, with a study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that holo ferritin supplementation improved iron levels and reduced anemia in patients with iron deficiency. On the other hand, the apo form of ferritin is able to serve as a promising delivery nanovehicle for nutrients and bioactive compounds. This form of ferritin is composed of a protein shell that can encapsulate and deliver nutrients and bioactive compounds in a controlled manner, making it an attractive option for food and pharmaceutical applications. A study published in the Journal of Controlled Release found that apo ferritin was able to encapsulate and deliver insulin in a controlled manner, with the insulin being released in a sustained manner over a period of several hours. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery have highlighted the potential of ferritins as multifunctional proteins. For example, a study published in the Journal of Materials Science found that ferritin nanoparticles could be used to deliver iron and other nutrients to cells in a controlled manner. Another study published in the Journal of Food Science found that ferritin could be used to encapsulate and deliver nutrients in food products, with the nutrients being released in a controlled manner over a period of several hours. Despite the potential of ferritins, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before they can be used in multifunctional applications. For example, the stability and biocompatibility of ferritin nanoparticles need to be improved, and the delivery mechanisms need to be optimized. Additionally, the cost and scalability of ferritin production need to be reduced, making it more accessible for industrial applications. Future developments in the field of ferritin research are expected to focus on improving the stability and biocompatibility of ferritin nanoparticles, as well as optimizing the delivery mechanisms. For example, a study published in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research found that the addition of certain polymers to ferritin nanoparticles improved their stability and biocompatibility. Another study published in the Journal of Controlled Release found that the use of certain surfactants to coat ferritin nanoparticles improved their delivery efficiency. In conclusion, ferritins have been found to have a wide range of applications in animal and plant kingdoms, including iron supplementation and nutrient delivery. Recent advances in iron supplementation and nutrient encapsulation and delivery have highlighted the potential of ferritins as multifunctional proteins. However, challenges need to be addressed before ferritins can be used in multifunctional applications. Future developments in the field of ferritin research are expected to focus on improving the stability and biocompatibility of ferritin nanoparticles, as well as optimizing the delivery mechanisms.", "References": [{"title": "Ferritins: A Class of Iron Storage Proteins", "authors": "K.
