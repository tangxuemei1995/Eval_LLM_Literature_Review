{"Literature Review": "The development of novel colloidal food ingredients through the formation of protein complexes and conjugates has gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to enhance the functional attributes of food products. These ingredients can be created by combining proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols using covalent or noncovalent interactions, resulting in multifunctional colloidal ingredients with new or improved properties. In this review, we will discuss the formation, functionality, and potential applications of protein conjugates and complexes, highlighting their utilization in stabilizing emulsions, controlling lipid digestion, encapsulating bioactive ingredients, modifying textures, and forming films. We will also propose future research needs in this area and discuss the potential benefits of rational design of protein complexes and conjugates in the development of new functional ingredients for healthier, more sustainable, and nutritious foods.", "References": [{"title": "Protein-based emulsifiers: A review of their applications and potential uses", "authors": "S.
