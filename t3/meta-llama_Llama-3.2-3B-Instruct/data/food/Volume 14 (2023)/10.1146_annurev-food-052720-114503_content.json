{"Literature Review": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have gained significant attention in recent years due to their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Enzymatic methods are preferred for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides due to the predictability and controllability of the structure and composition of the reaction products. This review aims to provide an overview of the research progress on the enzymatic production of several typical nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, including galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, chito-oligosaccharides, and human milk oligosaccharides. The production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides can be achieved through various methods, including enzymatic hydrolysis, chemical synthesis, and microbial fermentation. However, enzymatic methods are preferred due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to produce oligosaccharides with specific structures and compositions. For instance, the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch or glycogen can produce galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, and manno-oligosaccharides, which have been shown to have prebiotic effects. Chito-oligosaccharides, on the other hand, can be produced through the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin, a polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects. Chito-oligosaccharides have been shown to have immunomodulatory effects and can be used as adjuvants in vaccine formulations. Human milk oligosaccharides, which are composed of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, can be produced through the enzymatic hydrolysis of human milk or through microbial fermentation. Human milk oligosaccharides have been shown to have prebiotic effects and can be used as prebiotic ingredients in infant formula. The physicochemical properties of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, such as their solubility, viscosity, and surface activity, can be tailored through the enzymatic production process. For instance, the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch can produce oligosaccharides with specific molecular weights and branchings, which can affect their solubility and viscosity. The surface activity of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides can also be tailored through the enzymatic production process, which can affect their ability to emulsify and stabilize foams. Prebiotic effects are one of the most significant benefits of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides can act as food for beneficial microorganisms in the gut, promoting the growth and activity of these microorganisms and improving gut health. The prebiotic effects of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been shown to be mediated by their ability to stimulate the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can be used as energy sources by beneficial microorganisms. In addition to their prebiotic effects, nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have been shown to have other benefits to intestinal health. For instance, they can act as anti-inflammatory agents, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides can also act as antioxidants, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species and promoting the production of antioxidants. The application potential of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides as functional food ingredients is vast. These oligosaccharides can be used as prebiotic ingredients in infant formula, yogurt, and other dairy products, improving the quality and physicochemical characteristics of these products. Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides can also be used as functional ingredients in baked goods, snacks, and other food products, improving their texture, flavor, and nutritional content. In conclusion, nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have gained significant attention in recent years due to their unique prebiotic activities, technological characteristics, and physiological effects. Enzymatic methods are preferred for the production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to produce oligosaccharides with specific structures and compositions. The physicochemical properties and prebiotic activities of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides can be tailored through the enzymatic production process, making them ideal functional food ingredients for various food products. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides as functional food ingredients and to develop new methods for their production and application.", "References": [{"title": "Production of galacto-oligosaccharides from starch using alpha-galactosidase", "authors": "Lee, S.
