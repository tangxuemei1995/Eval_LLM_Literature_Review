{"Literature Review": "Meats are rich in lipids and proteins, exposing them to rapid oxidative changes. Proteins are essential to the human diet, and changes in the structure and functional attributes can greatly influence the quality and nutritional value of meats. In this article, we review the molecular changes of proteins during processing, their impact on the nutritional value of fresh and processed meat, the digestibility and bioavailability of meat proteins, the risks associated with high meat intake, and the preventive strategies employed to mitigate these risks. This information provides new research directions to reduce or prevent oxidative processes that influence the quality and nutritional values of meat.\n\nThe processing of meat involves various stages, including slaughter, evisceration, cleaning, and storage. During these stages, proteins undergo significant changes due to the exposure to oxygen, heat, and other environmental factors. These changes can lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which have been linked to oxidative stress and inflammation (1). The Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic browning reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars, also occurs during processing, resulting in the formation of new compounds with distinct flavor, aroma, and nutritional properties (2).\n\nThe molecular changes of proteins during processing can affect their nutritional value. For example, the denaturation of proteins can lead to the loss of their functional attributes, such as emulsification and gelation properties (3). Additionally, the formation of AGEs can reduce the bioavailability of essential amino acids, such as lysine and tryptophan (4). On the other hand, the Maillard reaction can enhance the nutritional value of meat by increasing the content of bioactive compounds, such as antioxidants and polyphenols (5).\n\nThe digestibility and bioavailability of meat proteins are also influenced by the molecular changes during processing. The denaturation of proteins can reduce their digestibility, leading to a decrease in protein absorption and utilization (6). However, the Maillard reaction can improve the digestibility of proteins by increasing their solubility and reducing their viscosity (7).\n\nHigh meat intake has been linked to various health risks, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer (8). The molecular changes of proteins during processing can contribute to these risks by increasing the formation of pro-inflammatory compounds and reducing the bioavailability of essential nutrients (9). However, moderate meat consumption, when balanced with a healthy diet and lifestyle, can provide essential nutrients and health benefits (10).\n\nPreventive strategies can be employed to mitigate the risks associated with high meat intake. These strategies include the use of antioxidants and other compounds to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (11), the selection of leaner cuts of meat, and the cooking methods that minimize the formation of AGEs and other pro-inflammatory compounds (12). Additionally, the development of novel processing technologies, such as high-pressure processing and pulsed electric field processing, can help to reduce the molecular changes of proteins and improve the nutritional value of meat (13).\n\nIn conclusion, the molecular changes of proteins during processing have a significant impact on the quality and nutritional value of meats. Understanding these changes is essential for developing preventive strategies to mitigate the risks associated with high meat intake. Further research is needed to explore the effects of processing on the molecular changes of proteins and to develop novel technologies that can improve the nutritional value of meat.", "References": [{"title": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and oxidative stress in meat processing", "authors": "S.
