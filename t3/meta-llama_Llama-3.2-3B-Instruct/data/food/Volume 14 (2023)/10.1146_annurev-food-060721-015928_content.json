{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages in the Dairy Industry: A Problem Solved?\n\nBacteriophages (or phages) represent one of the most persistent threats to food fermentations, particularly large-scale commercial dairy fermentations. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are used as starter cultures in dairy fermentations are well studied, and in recent years there have been significant advances in defining the driving forces of LAB–phage coevolution.\n\nThe means by which different starter bacterial species defend themselves against phage predation and the chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding these defense mechanisms have dictated the technological approaches for the development of robust starter cultures. In this review, we highlight recent advances in defining phage–host interactions and how phage resistance occurs in different bacterial species.\n\nPhage–host interactions are complex and multifaceted, involving various mechanisms of phage attachment, penetration, and replication. The attachment of phages to bacterial surfaces is mediated by specific proteins, such as the major coat protein (MCP) and the tail fiber protein (TFP), which interact with bacterial surface components (1). Once attached, phages can penetrate the bacterial cell wall through a process known as transduction, where the phage genome is transferred from one bacterium to another (2).\n\nPhage resistance in LAB is mediated by various defense mechanisms, including the production of bacteriocins, such as nisin and pediocin, which are produced by certain LAB strains (3). Other mechanisms include the production of phage-specific antibodies, such as the anti-phage antibody produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (4). Additionally, some LAB strains have developed genetic resistance to phages, such as the development of a phage-resistant strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus (5).\n\nThe chromosomal or plasmid location of the genes encoding phage resistance mechanisms is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of these mechanisms. For example, the gene encoding the nisin gene cluster is located on a plasmid in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (6). In contrast, the gene encoding the phage-specific antibody is located on the chromosome of Lactobacillus acidophilus (7).\n\nRecent advances in defining phage–host interactions have led to the development of new technologies for the control of phage infections in dairy fermentations. One such technology is the use of phage-specific antibodies, which can be used to neutralize phage infections (8). Another technology is the use of phage-resistant starter cultures, which can be used to prevent phage infections (9).\n\nIn conclusion, the study of phage–host interactions and phage resistance mechanisms has transformed the dairy fermentation industry. The development of new technologies for the control of phage infections has improved the safety and efficiency of dairy fermentations. These advances are also anticipated to guide food fermentations involving plant-based alternatives in the future.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Kropinski, L., et al. (2011).
