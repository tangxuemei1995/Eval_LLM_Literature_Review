{"Literature Review": "Bovine colostrum has been extensively studied for its potential health benefits in both veterinary and human populations. The bioactive components present in colostrum, including immunoglobulins, growth factors, and bioactive proteins, have been shown to have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects (1, 2). These components have been isolated and purified from colostrum, resulting in the development of functional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals (3, 4). The safety profile of bovine colostrum has been established through numerous studies, demonstrating its suitability for use across all age groups (5, 6). In veterinary medicine, colostrum has been used to support the health and well-being of calves, as well as to promote immune function in adult animals (7, 8). In human health, colostrum has been investigated for its potential to support immune function, reduce inflammation, and promote overall health (9, 10). Recent studies have also explored the use of colostrum-based products for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and gastrointestinal diseases (11, 12, 13). The processing techniques used to produce high-value colostrum-based products have also been optimized, resulting in improved bioavailability and efficacy of the bioactive components (14, 15). Overall, the bioactive components present in bovine colostrum offer a wide range of potential health benefits, making it an attractive ingredient for the development of functional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals.", "References": [{"title": "Immunoglobulins and growth factors in bovine colostrum: A review", "authors": "S.
