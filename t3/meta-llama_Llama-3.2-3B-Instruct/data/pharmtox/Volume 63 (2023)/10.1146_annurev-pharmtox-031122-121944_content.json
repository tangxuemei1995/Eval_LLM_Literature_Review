{"Literature Review": "G Protein–Coupled Estrogen Receptor GPER: Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutic Applications\n\nGPER, a 7-transmembrane G protein–coupled estrogen receptor, plays a crucial role in various physiological systems, including cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic processes. The pharmacology of GPER has been extensively studied, revealing its involvement in responses to both natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds. This review aims to summarize the major physiological functions of GPER and discuss the therapeutic implications and ongoing applications of GPER-targeted compounds.\n\nEstrogen receptors, including classical nuclear hormone receptors (estrogen receptors α and β) and GPER, are involved in regulating various physiological processes. Estrogen receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to estrogen binding (1). In contrast, GPER activates a diverse array of signaling pathways, including the phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (2, 3).\n\nGPER has been implicated in various physiological systems, including the cardiovascular system, where it regulates blood pressure, vascular tone, and cardiac function (4, 5). In the immune system, GPER modulates immune responses, including the production of cytokines and the activation of immune cells (6, 7). Additionally, GPER plays a role in metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism (8, 9).\n\nThe therapeutic potential of GPER-targeted compounds has been explored in various disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. GPER agonists have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines (10, 11). In cardiovascular diseases, GPER agonists have been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve cardiac function (12, 13). Furthermore, GPER-targeted compounds have been explored as potential treatments for metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and obesity (14, 15).\n\nHowever, the pharmacology of GPER is complex, and the development of GPER-targeted compounds is challenging due to the lack of specificity and the potential for off-target effects. Recent studies have focused on developing GPER agonists with improved specificity and efficacy, which have shown promising results in preclinical studies (16, 17).\n\nIn conclusion, GPER plays a crucial role in various physiological systems, and its pharmacology and functional roles have important implications for the treatment of various disease states. Further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential of GPER-targeted compounds and to develop effective treatments for these diseases.\n\nReferences:\n", "References": [{"title": "Estrogen receptors: a review of their structure, function and regulation", "authors": "Bardouil, R., & Saez, E.
