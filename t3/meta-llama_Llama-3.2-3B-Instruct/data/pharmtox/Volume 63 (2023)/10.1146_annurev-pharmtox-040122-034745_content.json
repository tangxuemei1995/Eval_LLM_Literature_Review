{"Literature Review": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have been widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and certain urological disorders. However, recent studies have shown promising effects of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of various clinical disorders beyond erectile dysfunction. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PDE5 inhibitors and their potential therapeutic indications for various clinical disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Kumar, A., et al.
