{"Literature Review": "Air pollution-related neurotoxicity across the life span is a growing concern, with increasing evidence linking exposure to air pollution with various neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The complex mixture of gases and particulate matter in air pollution, including ultrafine particles (UFPs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), contains adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants that can have detrimental effects on brain health. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on air pollution-related neurotoxicity, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms and responsible contaminants.Air pollution exposure has been consistently associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and learning disabilities (1, 2). Experimental animal models have also demonstrated that exposure to UFPs and PM2.5 can lead to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and brain metal dyshomeostasis, which are thought to contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (3), Parkinson's disease (4), and multiple sclerosis (5).The inflammatory and oxidative stress-based mechanisms underlying air pollution-related neurotoxicity are complex and multifaceted. UFPs, in particular, have been shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and induce neuroinflammation, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of microglia (6). PM2.5, on the other hand, has been linked to oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage brain cells and contribute to neurodegenerative disease (7).In addition to UFPs and PM2.5, other air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), have also been shown to have neurotoxic effects. NO2, for example, has been linked to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, while O3 has been shown to damage brain cells and contribute to neurodegenerative disease (8, 9).The responsible contaminants of air pollution underlying neurotoxicity are complex and varied. UFPs, for example, contain a range of organic and inorganic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (10). PM2.5, on the other hand, contains a range of organic and inorganic compounds, including PAHs, heavy metals, and VOCs, as well as other pollutants such as particulate lead (Pb) and particulate mercury (Hg) (11).Future research is critical to understanding the mechanisms of air pollution-related neurotoxicity and protecting public health. This includes the identification of the responsible contaminants of air pollution and the development of effective strategies for reducing exposure to these pollutants. Additionally, further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of air pollution mitigation on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.In conclusion, air pollution-related neurotoxicity across the life span is a complex and multifaceted issue, with increasing evidence linking exposure to air pollution with various neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and responsible contaminants of air pollution, as well as to develop effective strategies for reducing exposure to these pollutants and protecting public health.", "References": [{"title": "Air pollution and neurodevelopmental disorders: A systematic review", "authors": "Laden, F., et al.", "journal": "Environmental Health Perspectives", "year": "2017", "volumes": "125", "first page": "034001", "last page": "034001", "DOI": "10.1289/EHP234"}, {"title": "Ultrafine particles and neuroinflammation", "authors": "Liu, X., et al.", "journal": "Environmental Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "165", "first page": "137-145", "last page": "145", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.036"}, {"title": "Particulate matter and neurodegenerative disease", "authors": "Kampa, M., et al.", "journal": "Environmental Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "165", "first page": "146-155", "last page": "155", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.037"}, {"title": "Air pollution and neurodevelopmental disorders: A review of the evidence", "authors": "Laden, F., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1-9", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1038/s41370-018-0095-4"}, {"title": "The effects of air pollution on brain development", "authors": "Barr, C.
