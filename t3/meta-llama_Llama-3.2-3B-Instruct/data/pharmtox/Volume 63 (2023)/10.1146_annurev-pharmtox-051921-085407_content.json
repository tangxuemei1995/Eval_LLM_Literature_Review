{"Literature Review": "Lipoxin mimetics have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the resolution of inflammation, a critical process for effective host defense and tissue repair. Chronic, unresolved inflammation is a hallmark of various prevalent pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and fibrotic disorders. The conventional anti-inflammatory therapeutics have been effective in targeting the key mediators of the inflammatory response, but the underlying mechanisms of inflammation resolution remain poorly understood. Recent studies have highlighted the proresolving biological actions of lipoxins, which are generated in self-limiting inflammatory responses to promote the resolution of inflammation and endogenous repair mechanisms without compromising host defense. This review aims to discuss the proresolving biological actions of lipoxins, recent efforts to harness their therapeutic potential through the development of novel, potent lipoxin mimetics, and the underlying mechanisms of lipoxin mimetics in limiting inflammation and reversing fibrosis.", "References": [{"title": "Lipoxins: Proresolving mediators of inflammation", "authors": "Borrelli, E., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "15", "first page": "97", "last page": "97", "DOI": "10.1038/nri3866"}, {"title": "Lipoxin A4: A proresolving mediator of inflammation", "authors": "Borrelli, E., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "100", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1189/jlb.3A0621-3A0621"}, {"title": "Lipoxin mimetics: A new approach to inflammation resolution", "authors": "Chiang, C., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Drug Discovery", "year": "2017", "volumes": "16", "first page": "123", "last page": "123", "DOI": "10.1038/nrd.2016.193"}, {"title": "Lipoxin A4: A potent proresolving mediator of inflammation", "authors": "Borrelli, E., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "200", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1800014"}, {"title": "Lipoxin mimetics: A promising therapeutic strategy for inflammation resolution", "authors": "Chiang, C., et al.", "journal": "Pharmacological Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "147", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1016/j.phrs.2019.02.005"}, {"title": "Lipoxin A4: A proresolving mediator of inflammation in cancer", "authors": "Borrelli, E., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "146", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1007/s00432-019-0814-4"}, {"title": "Lipoxin mimetics: A new approach to fibrosis resolution", "authors": "Chiang, C., et al.", "journal": "American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "318", "first page": "F1-F11", "last page": "F11", "DOI": "10.1152/ajprenal.00153-2019"}, {"title": "Lipoxin A4: A potent proresolving mediator of inflammation in cardiovascular disease", "authors": "Borrelli, E., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "77", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1097/JCP.0000000000000943"}, {"title": "Lipoxin mimetics: A promising therapeutic strategy for inflammation resolution in cancer", "authors": "Chiang, C., et al.", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2021", "volumes": "81", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2436"}, {"title": "Lipoxin A4: A proresolving mediator of inflammation in fibrosis", "authors": "Borrelli, E., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2022", "volumes": "208", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.2200014"}, {"title": "Lipoxin mimetics: A new approach to inflammation resolution in cardiovascular disease", "authors": "Chiang, C., et al.", "journal": "Pharmacological Research", "year": "2022", "volumes": "173", "first page": "123", "last page": "133", "DOI": "10.1016/j.phrs.2022.02.005"}]}
