{"Literature Review": "Age-Related Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders: Experimental Models and Druggable Targets\n\nThe increasing global lifespan has led to an aging population of surgical patients, who are at a higher risk of postoperative cognitive impairment (POCI). POCI can manifest as new onset or exacerbation of existing cognitive decline, making preoperative cognitive assessment and postoperative cognitive trajectory monitoring crucial for patient care. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), focusing on experimental models and potential druggable targets.\n\nPerioperative neurocognitive disorders are a growing concern in the surgical community, with studies suggesting that up to 50% of patients experience some degree of cognitive impairment after surgery. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying PNDs are multifactorial, involving factors such as age, anesthesia, surgery type, and postoperative care. Animal models have been instrumental in elucidating the underlying mechanisms, with excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation emerging as a key contributor.\n\nNeuroinflammation is a complex process involving the activation of immune cells, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. In the context of PNDs, neuroinflammation can lead to neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and disruption of normal brain function. The cellular and molecular species involved in postoperative neuroinflammation, such as microglia, astrocytes, and cytokines, are potential targets for therapeutic interventions.\n\nSeveral experimental models have been used to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of PNDs, including animal models of postoperative delirium and cognitive impairment. These models have provided valuable insights into the role of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and other factors in the development of PNDs. For example, a study using a rat model of postoperative delirium found that microglial activation and cytokine release were significantly increased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.\n\nIn addition to experimental models, several druggable targets have been identified as potential therapeutic interventions for PNDs. These include anti-inflammatory agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids, as well as neuroprotective agents, such as antioxidants and neurotrophic factors. However, the efficacy and safety of these interventions in human patients remain to be established.\n\nA tablet-based technique for rapid assessment of memory and attentiveness domains has been developed to aid in the evaluation of PNDs. This technique has been shown to be effective in identifying patients at risk of POCI and monitoring their cognitive trajectory postoperatively.\n\nIn conclusion, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying perioperative neurocognitive disorders involve excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation, which can lead to neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and disruption of normal brain function. Experimental models and druggable targets have been identified as potential therapeutic interventions for PNDs. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of these interventions in human patients.\n\n", "References": [{"title": "Perioperative cognitive dysfunction: a review of the literature", "authors": "Myles, I.
