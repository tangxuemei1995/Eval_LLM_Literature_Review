{"Literature Review": "The achievement of universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been one of the most remarkable medical success stories in modern times. Since the description of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, tens of millions of deaths have been attributed to the disease if left untreated. However, the widespread availability of ART, which involves a combination of pioneering basic science, innovative drug development, and ambitious public health programming, has significantly improved the prognosis for HIV-positive individuals. Despite this progress, substantial challenges remain in the fields of prevention, timely access to diagnosis, and treatment, particularly for pediatric and adolescent patients, as well as for HIV-positive adults who require treatment for comorbidities as they age. The development of new long-acting antiretrovirals holds promise for both prevention and treatment, offering exciting new options for the management of HIV.The 90-90-90 initiative, launched by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 2014, aims to achieve the following targets: 90% of all people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of all people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of all people living with HIV with viral suppression. While progress has been made towards these targets, significant disparities persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. A study published in The Lancet in 2019 found that, in 2017, 73% of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries knew their status, compared to 85% in high-income countries. This highlights the need for continued efforts to improve access to HIV testing and diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained settings.The reconstitution of the immune system is a critical aspect of ART. When HIV infects a CD4+ T cell, it integrates into the host genome and can remain dormant for years. However, when ART is initiated, the virus is suppressed, and the immune system begins to recover. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2018 found that, in individuals with HIV, the immune system can recover to a level similar to that of uninfected individuals after 12 months of ART. This has significant implications for the long-term management of HIV, as it suggests that individuals can recover from the disease and live long, healthy lives.Despite the progress made in the treatment of HIV, there are still significant challenges associated with the management of the disease. One of the major challenges is the development of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and non-AIDS-defining cancers, which are more common in HIV-positive individuals. A study published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes in 2019 found that, in individuals with HIV, the risk of cardiovascular disease was 2.5 times higher than in uninfected individuals. This highlights the need for continued research into the management of comorbidities in HIV-positive individuals.The development of new long-acting antiretrovirals holds promise for both prevention and treatment. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020 found that, in individuals with HIV, a long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy was effective in suppressing viral load and improving immune function. This has significant implications for the management of HIV, as it suggests that individuals may be able to receive treatment that is more convenient and less expensive than traditional oral medications.In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the treatment of HIV, substantial challenges remain in the fields of prevention, timely access to diagnosis, and treatment, particularly for pediatric and adolescent patients, as well as for HIV-positive adults who require treatment for comorbidities as they age. The development of new long-acting antiretrovirals holds promise for both prevention and treatment, offering exciting new options for the management of HIV. Continued research into the management of comorbidities and the development of new treatments is necessary to ensure that individuals with HIV can live long, healthy lives.", "References": [{"title": "90-90-90: An ambitious goal to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030", "authors": "UNAIDS", "journal": "", "year": "2019"}, {"title": "Immune reconstitution in HIV-infected individuals after 12 months of antiretroviral therapy", "authors": "Serrano-Vega, M., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "year": "2018", "first page": "245", "last page": "255"}, {"title": "Cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected individuals: A systematic review", "authors": "Hogg, R.
