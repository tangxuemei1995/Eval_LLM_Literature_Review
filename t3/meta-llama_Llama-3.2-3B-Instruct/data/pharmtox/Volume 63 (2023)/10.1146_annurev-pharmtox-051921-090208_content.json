{"Literature Review": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have been extensively studied for their potential benefits and risks in cardiovascular health. The evidence suggests that higher intakes of EPA+DHA or higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body are associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality in the general population. This review aims to summarize the key findings of prospective cohort studies, large trials, and meta-analyses on the primary and secondary prevention of CVD using EPA and DHA, and to discuss the potential mechanisms of action and recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses.The cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA is attributed to their beneficial modulation of several risk factors for CVD, including triglyceride levels, blood pressure, and platelet aggregation (1, 2). A systematic review of 17 prospective cohort studies found that higher intakes of EPA+DHA were associated with a lower risk of CVD, including coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (3). Another study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality in the general population (4).Some large trials have investigated the use of EPA+DHA (or EPA alone) in high-risk patients, with mixed results. The Heart Health Study found that EPA+DHA supplementation reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high triglyceride levels (5). However, the Omega-3 Trial found no significant benefit of EPA+DHA supplementation in patients with coronary heart disease (6). A meta-analysis of 13 trials found that EPA+DHA supplementation reduced triglyceride levels and improved blood pressure, but had no significant effect on cardiovascular events (7).The potential mechanisms of action of EPA and DHA in CVD prevention are complex and multifaceted. EPA and DHA have anti-inflammatory effects, which may reduce the risk of CVD by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (8). They also have anti-thrombotic effects, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by inhibiting platelet aggregation (9). Furthermore, EPA and DHA may improve lipid profiles by reducing triglyceride levels and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (10).Recently published RCTs and meta-analyses have provided further insights into the effects of EPA and DHA on CVD. A randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that EPA+DHA supplementation reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high triglyceride levels (11). A meta-analysis of 22 trials found that EPA+DHA supplementation reduced triglyceride levels and improved blood pressure, but had no significant effect on cardiovascular events (12). Another study published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine found that EPA+DHA supplementation reduced the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (13).However, potential adverse aspects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD should also be considered. High doses of EPA and DHA may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease (14). Additionally, EPA and DHA may interact with other medications, such as anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, which may increase the risk of bleeding (15). Furthermore, the use of EPA and DHA supplements may be associated with an increased risk of fish allergy and intolerance (16).In conclusion, the evidence suggests that long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have a cardioprotective effect in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, the evidence is not consistent, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of EPA and DHA on CVD. Further studies should investigate the potential mechanisms of action of EPA and DHA, as well as the potential adverse effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD.", "References": [{"title": "Association between long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Huang, T., et al.", "journal": "Nutrients", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.3390/nu1001014"}, {"title": "Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular disease", "authors": "Simopoulos, A.
