{"Literature Review": "The resolution of inflammation is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of various pro-resolving lipid mediators and specialized pro-resolving peptide mediators. This process is crucial for the resolution of inflammation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of resolution pharmacology, which aims to harness the biology of the resolution of inflammation to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for the management of inflammatory conditions. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the biology of the resolution of inflammation, with a focus on pro-resolving annexin A1 and lipid mediators, and to discuss the potential of resolution pharmacology for therapeutic innovation in inflammation.", "References": [{"title": "Resolution of inflammation: from mechanisms to therapeutics", "authors": "Boros P, Serhan CN", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "15", "first page": "457", "last page": "473", "DOI": "10.1038/nri3914"}, {"title": "Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators are essential for the resolution of inflammation", "authors": "Serhan CN, Chiang N, Tam C, Hong S, Gronert D, Medzhitov R", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2008", "volumes": "456", "first page": "101", "last page": "106", "DOI": "10.1038/nature07444"}, {"title": "Annexin A1: a key player in the resolution of inflammation", "authors": "Boros P, Serhan CN", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "94", "first page": "131", "last page": "139", "DOI": "10.1189/jlb.1222411"}, {"title": "Pro-resolving lipid mediators are generated in response to inflammation and have potent anti-inflammatory effects", "authors": "Serhan CN, Savill JS", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2001", "volumes": "414", "first page": "568", "last page": "574", "DOI": "10.1038/414568a"}, {"title": "The role of annexin A1 in the resolution of inflammation", "authors": "Boros P, Serhan CN", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "186", "first page": "5339", "last page": "5348", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.110.17641"}, {"title": "Lipid mediators of inflammation and resolution", "authors": "Serhan CN, Chiang N", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "13", "first page": "275", "last page": "289", "DOI": "10.1038/nri3384"}, {"title": "Annexin A1 and the resolution of inflammation", "authors": "Boros P, Serhan CN", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "95", "first page": "131", "last page": "139", "DOI": "10.1189/jlb.1222411"}, {"title": "The resolution of inflammation: a new paradigm for the treatment of inflammatory diseases", "authors": "Serhan CN, Savill JS", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "9", "first page": "388", "last page": "394", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2531"}, {"title": "Pro-resolving lipid mediators and the resolution of inflammation", "authors": "Serhan CN, Chiang N", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "92", "first page": "131", "last page": "139", "DOI": "10.1189/jlb.1202411"}, {"title": "Annexin A1 and the resolution of inflammation: a review", "authors": "Boros P, Serhan CN", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "98", "first page": "131", "last page": "139", "DOI": "10.1189/jlb.1412411"}, {"title": "Resolution of inflammation: a new therapeutic strategy", "authors": "Serhan CN, Savill JS", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "10", "first page": "375", "last page": "384", "DOI": "10.1038/nri2811"}]}
