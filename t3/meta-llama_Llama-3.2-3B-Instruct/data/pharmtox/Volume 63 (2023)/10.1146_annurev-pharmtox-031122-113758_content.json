{"Literature Review": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their increasing prevalence and associated health risks. As a chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances (NPSs), SCs target the endocannabinoid system, triggering a range of effects that resemble, but are more intense than, those induced by cannabis. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs, highlighting the main mechanisms underlying their acute and chronic effects, as well as the clinical/pathological findings related to SC use.\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of SCs involve the activation of the endocannabinoid system, which is composed of CB1 and CB2 receptors. SCs bind to these receptors, leading to the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and anandamide, which are responsible for the psychoactive effects of SCs (Bergamaschi et al., 2011). The activation of CB1 receptors is particularly associated with the euphoric and relaxing effects of SCs, while the activation of CB2 receptors is associated with the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (Pertwee, 2008).\n\nThe toxicodynamics of SCs involve the adverse effects that occur as a result of SC use. These effects can range from mild to severe and include symptoms such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability (Baker et al., 2011). The severity of these effects is often related to the dose and duration of SC use, as well as individual factors such as age, sex, and pre-existing medical conditions (Kumar et al., 2018).\n\nChronic SC use has been associated with a range of negative outcomes, including substance use disorders, anxiety, depression, and psychosis (Bergamaschi et al., 2011). The development of tolerance and dependence on SCs is also a concern, as it can lead to increased SC use and associated health risks (Kumar et al., 2018).\n\nThe recreational use of SCs has been linked to a range of health problems, including overdose, poisoning, and death (Baker et al., 2011). The increasing availability and perceived safety of SCs have contributed to their growing popularity, particularly among young people (Kumar et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs are complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying SC effects and to develop effective strategies for reducing SC-related health risks.", "References": [{"title": "Pharmacology of cannabinoids", "authors": "Pertwee, R.
