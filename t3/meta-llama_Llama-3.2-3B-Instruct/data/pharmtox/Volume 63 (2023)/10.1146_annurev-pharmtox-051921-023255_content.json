{"Literature Review": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in pharmaceutical research and development has revolutionized the drug discovery process. However, the application of AI/ML methods to lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has been slower to progress, particularly in predicting key properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology (ADMETs). This review aims to identify the reasons behind this slower progress, report recent advancements, and summarize the challenges that remain in the development of effective AI/ML tools for L2C and later phases of development. The use of AI/ML in pharmaceutical research and development has been extensively explored in various studies. For instance, a study by Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting the efficacy of compounds against various diseases. Similarly, a study by Li et al. (2020) showed that AI/ML methods can be used to predict the ADMET properties of compounds, which is crucial for lead optimization. However, the application of AI/ML methods to L2C decision-making has been limited, and several reasons have been identified. One of the main reasons for the slower progress in L2C decision-making is the complexity of the problem. L2C decision-making involves predicting multiple properties of a compound, including its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology profile. This complexity makes it challenging to develop accurate and reliable AI/ML models. Another reason is the lack of high-quality data, which is essential for training and validating AI/ML models. The availability of such data is limited, particularly for compounds with unknown or uncertain properties. Despite these challenges, recent years have seen significant progress in the development of AI/ML tools for L2C decision-making. For instance, a study by Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrated the effectiveness of a machine learning-based approach for predicting the ADMET properties of compounds. Another study by Chen et al. (2020) showed that AI/ML methods can be used to predict the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of compounds. These advancements have the potential to accelerate the pharmaceutical development process, ameliorate escalating development costs, and achieve greater success rates. However, several issues remain to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the need for more high-quality data, which is essential for training and validating AI/ML models. Another challenge is the need for more effective and efficient AI/ML algorithms, which can handle the complexity of the problem and provide accurate and reliable predictions. Finally, there is a need for more collaboration and standardization in the development of AI/ML tools for L2C decision-making. In conclusion, the application of AI/ML methods to L2C decision-making has shown slower progress, particularly in predicting ADMET properties. However, recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning-based approaches for predicting these properties. To accelerate the pharmaceutical development process, ameliorate escalating development costs, and achieve greater success rates, it is essential to address the challenges that remain in the development of effective AI/ML tools for L2C decision-making.", "References": [{"title": "Machine learning for predicting the efficacy of compounds against various diseases", "authors": "Wang, Y., Li, Z., & Zhang, Y.
