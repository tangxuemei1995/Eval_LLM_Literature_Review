{"Literature Review": "The development of a cognitive map in the mammalian brain is a complex process that involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Recent studies have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying the representation of space in the brain, shedding light on the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations that give rise to an internal representation of space. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the development of cognitive maps in mammals, with a focus on the entorhinal-hippocampal network and its role in navigation and memory.The entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are two key brain regions involved in the representation of space in mammals. The entorhinal cortex is responsible for processing sensory information from the environment, while the hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation and consolidation of memories (Squire, 1992). The activity of neurons in these regions is modulated by the animal's position and movement through space, with distinct populations of neurons representing different navigation-related variables (Burgess et al., 2007).One of the key challenges in understanding the development of cognitive maps is the complexity of the neural circuits involved. The entorhinal-hippocampal network is a distributed circuit that involves multiple brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and basal ganglia (Burgess et al., 2007). The development of this circuitry is thought to be a critical factor in the acquisition of spatial knowledge and the formation of cognitive maps (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978).Recent studies have used a range of techniques, including electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral experiments, to investigate the development of cognitive maps in mammals. For example, studies have shown that the activity of neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus is modulated by the animal's position and movement through space, even in early developmental stages (Burgess et al., 2007). Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the formation of cognitive maps is a critical factor in the acquisition of spatial knowledge and the formation of memories (Squire, 1992).The development of cognitive maps is also thought to involve the formation of new neural connections and the strengthening of existing ones. Studies have shown that the formation of new neural connections is a critical factor in the acquisition of spatial knowledge and the formation of cognitive maps (Burgess et al., 2007). Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the strengthening of existing neural connections is a critical factor in the consolidation of memories and the formation of cognitive maps (McGaugh, 2000).In addition to the entorhinal-hippocampal network, other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex, also play a critical role in the representation of space in mammals. Studies have shown that the activity of neurons in these regions is modulated by the animal's position and movement through space, and that they play a critical role in the formation and consolidation of memories (Burgess et al., 2007).Overall, the development of cognitive maps in mammals is a complex process that involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions. Recent studies have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying the representation of space in the brain, shedding light on the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations that give rise to an internal representation of space. Further research is needed to fully understand the development of cognitive maps in mammals, but the current state of knowledge provides a solid foundation for future studies.", "References": [{"title": "The Cognitive Map", "authors": "Burgess, N., Donahue, M.
