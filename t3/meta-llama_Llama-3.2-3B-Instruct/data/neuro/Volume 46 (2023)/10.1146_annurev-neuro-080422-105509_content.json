{"Literature Review": "Meningeal mechanisms play a crucial role in the development and progression of migraine headaches. The meninges, a border tissue surrounding the brain, are innervated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent fibers chiefly from the trigeminal nerve. These fibers are responsible for transmitting pain signals to the brain, which can lead to the characteristic migraine headache. The trigeminal nerve is a complex nerve with multiple branches, including the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves, which innervate the meninges and surrounding tissues. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of this nerve can evoke headache patterns similar to those experienced during a migraine attack (1). The brain, blood, and meninges are likely sources of headache triggers, and the meninges are particularly susceptible to neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies (2, 3). Cerebrospinal fluid may play a significant role in migraine by transferring signals released from the brain to overlying pain-sensitive meningeal tissues, including the dura mater (4). The dura mater is a thick, fibrous membrane that surrounds the brain and is innervated by meningeal afferents. These afferents are responsible for transmitting pain signals to the brain, which can lead to the characteristic migraine headache (5). Interactions between trigeminal afferents, neuropeptides, and adjacent meningeal cells and tissues cause neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies (6, 7). Emerging concepts, such as meningeal neuroimmune interactions, may one day prove therapeutically relevant (8, 9). The role of the trigeminal nerve in migraine is complex and multifaceted, and further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we will explore the properties of trigeminal meningeal afferents, the role of the meninges in migraine, and emerging concepts in meningeal neuroimmune interactions that may one day prove therapeutically relevant.", "References": [{"title": "The Trigeminal Nerve and Migraine", "authors": "Lipton, R.
