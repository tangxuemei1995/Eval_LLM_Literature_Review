{"Literature Review": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues is a complex process that has garnered significant attention in recent years. The vestibular sense, which is responsible for detecting changes in head position and movement, plays a crucial role in our sense of balance and spatial orientation. However, its involvement in higher-order cognitive functions, such as navigation, visual processing, and perception, is less well understood. Recent studies have employed novel experimental approaches to investigate the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals, revealing their widespread integration with vision to improve cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. Research has shown that the vestibular system is not just a simple reflex, but rather a complex system that interacts with the visual system to provide a unified sense of self-motion and orientation. This integration is thought to occur in the primary visual cortex (V1), where the vestibular system provides top-down inputs that modulate the activity of neurons in response to visual stimuli. The resulting cortical representation of self-motion and orientation is thought to be more accurate and robust than that obtained from visual cues alone. Studies have also investigated the neural mechanisms underlying vestibulo-visual integration. One key finding is that the vestibular system provides a continuous stream of information about self-motion, which is used to update the cortical representation of self-motion and orientation. This process is thought to be mediated by the vestibular nuclei, which receive inputs from the vestibular system and project to the visual cortex. The resulting updates to the cortical representation of self-motion and orientation are thought to be used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making. In addition to its role in navigation, the vestibular system has also been shown to play a critical role in visual processing and perception. Research has demonstrated that the vestibular system can modulate the activity of neurons in the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli. This modulation is thought to be mediated by the vestibular system's ability to provide a continuous stream of information about self-motion, which is used to update the cortical representation of self-motion and orientation. Studies have also investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the vestibular system's role in visual perception. One key finding is that the vestibular system can modulate the activity of neurons in the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli, particularly those that are related to self-motion and orientation. This modulation is thought to be mediated by the vestibular system's ability to provide a continuous stream of information about self-motion, which is used to update the cortical representation of self-motion and orientation. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that the vestibular system can also play a critical role in the development of visual perception. Studies have shown that the vestibular system is involved in the development of the cortical representation of self-motion and orientation, and that its dysfunction can lead to visual perception deficits. This suggests that the vestibular system plays a critical role in the development of visual perception, and that its dysfunction can have significant consequences for visual perception. In conclusion, the integration of vestibular and visual cues is a complex process that has garnered significant attention in recent years. The vestibular system plays a critical role in our sense of balance and spatial orientation, and its involvement in higher-order cognitive functions, such as navigation, visual processing, and perception, is less well understood. Recent studies have revealed the widespread integration of the vestibular system with vision to improve cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. The neural mechanisms underlying this integration are thought to involve the vestibular nuclei, which receive inputs from the vestibular system and project to the visual cortex. The resulting updates to the cortical representation of self-motion and orientation are thought to be used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making. The major remaining knowledge gaps in this field include the precise mechanisms underlying vestibulo-visual integration, and the specific neural circuits involved in this process. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the vestibular system in navigation, visual processing, and perception, and to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying this complex process.", "References": [{"title": "The vestibular system and the sense of balance", "authors": "Cullen, K.
