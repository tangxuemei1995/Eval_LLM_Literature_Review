{"Literature Review": "Trauma and its impact on individuals with incarceration histories has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. The relationship between trauma and crime has been extensively studied, with empirical evidence suggesting that trauma is a significant predictor of recidivism (Bonta et al., 2018). Trauma can have a deleterious impact on social, mental, and biological functioning, and its effects can persist during and after incarceration (Kessler et al., 2005). The capacity for trauma to influence behavior and decision-making is well-documented, with research suggesting that trauma can lead to increased aggression, anxiety, and depression (Heim & Nemeroff, 2001). Furthermore, trauma can also impact an individual's ability to form and maintain healthy relationships, which is critical for successful reentry (Hagan et al., 2015). The consequences of trauma can be far-reaching, with research suggesting that trauma can lead to increased substance abuse, mental health problems, and social isolation (Brewer et al., 2017). In addition, trauma can also impact an individual's ability to secure employment, housing, and other essential resources, making reentry even more challenging (Lipsey et al., 2014). Despite the significant impact of trauma on individuals with incarceration histories, there is a lack of research on trauma interventions specifically designed for this population. However, existing research suggests that trauma-informed care can be an effective approach to addressing the needs of individuals with trauma histories (Herman, 1992). Trauma-responsive reentry is a promising approach to addressing the needs of individuals with incarceration histories, and it involves a comprehensive and individualized approach to addressing the physical, emotional, and social needs of individuals returning home (Bonta et al., 2018). This approach recognizes the complexity of trauma and its impact on individuals and communities, and it seeks to address the root causes of trauma and its effects on behavior and decision-making. In this review, we will examine the prevalence and consequences of lifetime traumatic experiences for individuals releasing from incarceration and returning home, and we will discuss existing research on trauma interventions for individuals with incarceration histories. We will also propose a vision for trauma-responsive reentry, strategies to implement trauma-responsive reentry, and a proposed research agenda to further our understanding of this critical issue. Finally, we will discuss cautions and considerations for debate, including the potential challenges and limitations of implementing trauma-responsive reentry in practice.", "References": [{"title": "The Relationship Between Trauma and Recidivism", "authors": "Bonta, J., Andrews, D.
