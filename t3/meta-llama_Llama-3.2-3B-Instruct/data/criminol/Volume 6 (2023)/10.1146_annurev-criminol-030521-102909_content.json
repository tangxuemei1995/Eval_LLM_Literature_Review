{"Literature Review": "The measurement of homicide is a crucial aspect of cross-national research, as it can significantly impact the results and conclusions drawn from studies. The increasing number of cross-national homicide studies has led to a growing need to understand the details of how individual nations and centralized homicide data sources generate national homicide rates. This review aims to analyze the impact of homicide measurement on cross-national research and identify the limitations of the four main centralized homicide data sources: raw estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, adjusted estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and World Bank World Development Indicators. The WHO Mortality Database is widely regarded as the most reliable source of homicide data, as it provides raw estimates of homicide rates based on mortality data from various countries. However, these estimates have been criticized for being based on incomplete and inconsistent data, which can lead to biased results. In contrast, the WHO Global Health Observatory provides adjusted estimates of homicide rates, which are calculated using a combination of mortality and population data. While these estimates are considered more reliable than raw estimates, they are still subject to limitations, such as the availability of data and the quality of the underlying mortality data. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and World Bank World Development Indicators also provide homicide data, which are often based on self-reported crime data and other indirect sources. These data are often considered less reliable than those from the WHO Mortality Database and WHO Global Health Observatory, as they are subject to biases and inconsistencies. Studies have shown that the choice of homicide data source can significantly impact the results of cross-national research. For example, a study by the World Health Organization found that the use of raw estimates from the WHO Mortality Database led to different conclusions about the relationship between homicide rates and economic development compared to the use of adjusted estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory. Another study found that the use of self-reported crime data from the UNODC led to biased results about the relationship between homicide rates and social inequality. In addition to the limitations of the data sources, studies have also highlighted the importance of considering the methodology used to generate national homicide rates. For example, a study found that the use of different weighting schemes and population estimates can lead to different results about the relationship between homicide rates and demographic factors. Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) has been used to examine the relationships between homicide rates and structural covariates, such as economic development and social inequality. However, the choice of homicide data source can affect the results of these analyses, as different data sources may provide different estimates of homicide rates and structural covariates. In conclusion, the measurement of homicide is a complex and multifaceted issue, and the choice of homicide data source can significantly impact the results of cross-national research. While the WHO Mortality Database is widely regarded as the most reliable source of homicide data, other data sources, such as the WHO Global Health Observatory, UNODC, and World Bank World Development Indicators, also provide valuable information. However, researchers must be aware of the limitations of these data sources and consider the methodology used to generate national homicide rates.", "References": [{"title": "Homicide rates and
