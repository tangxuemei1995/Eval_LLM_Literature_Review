{"Literature Review": "The concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering has evolved significantly over the years, with a growing emphasis on the holistic nature of defense counsel's work. Traditionally, research has focused on the scarcity of resources, particularly in the context of public defender offices, and the impact of limited funding on case outcomes. However, recent studies have expanded the scope of inquiry to include the broader social conditions connected to the alleged criminal act and the effectiveness of defense counsel outside the courtroom. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the empirical research on criminal defense lawyering, with a focus on the theoretical understandings of the defense attorney's work and its impact on the broader social context.\n\nA key theme in the literature is the concept of effective assistance of counsel (EAC), which has been a cornerstone of the American legal system since the landmark case of Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) [1]. Research has consistently shown that EAC is a critical factor in determining the outcome of criminal cases, with studies demonstrating that defendants who receive high-quality representation are more likely to receive lenient sentences and avoid recidivism [2, 3]. However, the scarcity of resources in public defender offices has led to concerns about the adequacy of EAC, with some studies suggesting that defendants in these offices may not receive the level of representation they deserve [4, 5].\n\nIn recent years, researchers have begun to explore the concept of holistic defense counsel, which encompasses not only the provision of legal representation but also the provision of social support and advocacy outside the courtroom [6]. This approach recognizes that the defense attorney's work is not limited to the courtroom, but rather extends to the broader social context in which the alleged crime occurred. Studies have shown that holistic defense counsel can have a positive impact on defendants, including reduced recidivism rates and improved mental health outcomes [7, 8]. However, the implementation of holistic defense counsel remains a challenge, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\n\nAnother key theme in the literature is the issue of indigent defense, which has been a contentious issue in the United States for decades. Research has consistently shown that defendants who are indigent are more likely to receive inadequate representation, which can have serious consequences for their cases [9]. However, some studies have also highlighted the potential benefits of indigent defense, including the provision of free or low-cost representation to defendants who may not be able to afford it otherwise [10].\n\nThe literature also highlights the importance of the right to counsel in the American legal system. Research has consistently shown that the right to counsel is a critical factor in determining the outcome of criminal cases, with studies demonstrating that defendants who receive high-quality representation are more likely to receive lenient sentences and avoid recidivism [11, 12]. However, the implementation of the right to counsel remains a challenge, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\n\nFinally, the literature highlights the issue of mass incarceration, which has become a major concern in the United States in recent years. Research has consistently shown that the American criminal justice system is characterized by a high rate of incarceration, with some studies suggesting that this rate is disproportionate to other developed countries [13]. However, some studies have also highlighted the potential benefits of expanded criminal defense lawyering, including the provision of more effective representation to defendants and the reduction of recidivism rates [14, 15].\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on expanded criminal defense lawyering highlights the importance of a holistic approach to defense counsel's work, which encompasses not only the provision of legal representation but also the provision of social support and advocacy outside the courtroom. The literature also highlights the challenges associated with implementing this approach, particularly in resource-constrained settings. However, the potential benefits of expanded criminal defense lawyering, including the provision of more effective representation to defendants and the reduction of recidivism rates, make it an important area of research and policy focus.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Gideon v.
