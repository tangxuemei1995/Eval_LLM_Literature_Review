{"Literature Review": "Women's incarceration rates in the United States have experienced a significant increase over the past few decades, with women's rates growing faster than men's rates during the prison boom in the 1990s and 2000s (Minton & Harrison, 2016). Despite the recent decline in incarceration rates, women's rates have decreased less than men's rates, resulting in a historic high number of women in prisons and jails (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2020). This review aims to examine the trends in women's incarceration, highlighting important disparities for Black, Latina, and American Indian/Indigenous women, and contextualizing these trends in terms of the economic and social disadvantages of women prior to incarceration as well as inequalities that are created by women's incarceration for families, communities, and women themselves.Research has shown that women's incarceration is often linked to poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education and healthcare (Alexander, 2010). Women from marginalized communities, such as Black and Latina women, are disproportionately represented in the prison population, with rates of incarceration that are 3-4 times higher than those of white women (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2020). American Indian/Indigenous women also face significant barriers to justice, with rates of incarceration that are 2-3 times higher than those of white women (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2020).The consequences of women's incarceration are far-reaching, with research showing that women who are incarcerated are more likely to experience homelessness, unemployment, and mental health problems upon release (Lipsey et al., 2007). Furthermore, women's incarceration can have a disproportionate impact on families and communities, with research showing that children of incarcerated mothers are more likely to experience poverty, homelessness, and mental health problems (Gelb, 2013).Despite the significant disparities in women's incarceration, research on mass incarceration most often ignores women's imprisonment and confinement in jails (Minton & Harrison, 2016). This review argues that improved data on women's imprisonment and jail trends, particularly regarding race and ethnicity, is essential for understanding the complexities of women's incarceration. Furthermore, this review calls for more research and theoretical development on the topic of women's incarceration, with a focus on addressing the economic and social disadvantages of women prior to incarceration as well as inequalities that are created by women's incarceration.In conclusion, women's incarceration rates in the United States are a pressing issue that requires attention and action. This review highlights the disparities in women's incarceration, particularly for Black, Latina, and American Indian/Indigenous women, and argues that improved data and research are essential for addressing the complex issues surrounding women's incarceration.", "References": [{"title": "Trends in State Prison Admissions, 2000-2019", "authors": "Minton, T.
