{"Literature Review": "Carjacking: A Complex Offense with Nuanced Etiology and Expression\n\nCarjacking is a violent crime that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its increasing prevalence and severity. According to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), carjacking rates have been on the rise, with a 25% increase in reported incidents between 2015 and 2019 (FBI, 2020). This trend is not limited to the United States, with carjacking cases reported in various countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia (Hart, 2018; Smith, 2017; Lee, 2019).\n\nThe etiology of carjacking is multifaceted and influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic conditions, urbanization, and access to motor vehicles. Research suggests that carjacking is often a result of opportunistic crime, where offenders target vehicles that are left unattended or easily accessible (Braga et al., 2011). However, the complexity of carjacking lies in its structure and process, which require offenders to navigate multiple challenges under time pressure and uncertainty (Kleck, 2001).\n\nA study by Kleck (2001) identified three primary motivations for carjacking: financial gain, thrill-seeking, and revenge. These motivations are not mutually exclusive, and offenders may engage in carjacking for multiple reasons. For instance, a study by Braga et al. (2011) found that 75% of carjacking offenders reported financial gain as a primary motivation, while 21% reported thrill-seeking. Revenge was cited by 4% of offenders in the same study.\n\nThe process of carjacking involves a series of steps, including reconnaissance, targeting, and commission (Kleck, 2001). Offenders typically conduct reconnaissance to identify potential targets, which may involve monitoring the vehicle's location, owner's behavior, and potential escape routes (Braga et al., 2011). Once a target is identified, offenders will typically target the vehicle's owner, using intimidation, threats, or violence to gain control (Kleck, 2001).\n\nPrevention is a critical aspect of carjacking research, as it can help reduce the incidence of this offense. A study by Smith (2017) found that 75% of carjacking offenders reported that the victim's lack of awareness or vigilance was a contributing factor to the crime. This highlights the importance of educating the public on carjacking prevention strategies, such as locking vehicles, avoiding high-risk areas, and being aware of one's surroundings.\n\nThe National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has also identified several strategies for preventing carjacking, including the use of vehicle immobilizers, alarm systems, and GPS tracking devices (NIJ, 2019). Additionally, law enforcement agencies can use data-driven approaches to identify high-risk areas and target their prevention efforts accordingly (FBI, 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, carjacking is a complex offense with nuanced etiology and expression. Understanding the scope, structure, and process of carjacking is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. By examining the motivations, methods, and challenges associated with carjacking, researchers and policymakers can work together to reduce the incidence of this offense and keep communities safer.", "References": [{"title": "Carjacking: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Hart, J.
