{"Literature Review": "LatCrit and Criminology: Toward a Theoretical Understanding of Latino/a/x Crime and Criminal Legal System Involvement\n\nThe study of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement has been a long-overdue area of research in the field of criminology. While the work of scholars such as Loewen (2005) and Smedley et al. (2002) has highlighted the importance of considering race in the study of crime, the vast majority of research has focused on comparisons between Blacks and Whites. This review seeks to address this gap by examining the theoretical underpinnings of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement through the lens of Critical Race Theory (CRT).\n\nCRT, as outlined by scholars such as Delgado (1989) and Crenshaw (1989), posits that racism is not just an individual prejudice, but rather a systemic and institutionalized form of oppression that is embedded in the very fabric of our society. In the context of criminology, CRT highlights the ways in which racism metes out discrimination, cultural and linguistic devaluation, criminalization, and racial profiling that in turn shape and are shaped by levels of Latino/a/x crime and legal system involvement.\n\nA key tenet of LatCrit, as outlined by scholars such as Velasquez (2007) and Velasquez and Velasquez (2007), is the importance of centering race in the study of crime. This involves recognizing the ways in which dominant actors racialize Latino/a/xs as an innate, distinct, inferior, and criminogenic category, leading to their marginalized experiences across many domains. Moreover, Latino/a/xs increasingly view themselves as not White, which has significant implications for their experiences of crime and the criminal legal system.\n\nEmpirical research has consistently shown that Latino/a/xs are disproportionately represented in the criminal legal system, with higher rates of arrest, conviction, and incarceration compared to Whites (Braga et al., 2001; Rodriguez, 2008). This disparity is not solely the result of individual factors, but rather is shaped by systemic and institutionalized forms of racism. For example, research has shown that Latino/a/xs are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, and are more likely to be subjected to racial profiling (Garland, 2001; Skogan, 2006).\n\nFurthermore, research has highlighted the ways in which Latino/a/xs are disproportionately represented in certain types of crime, such as drug offenses (Braga et al., 2001). This is not solely the result of individual factors, but rather is shaped by systemic and institutionalized forms of racism. For example, research has shown that Latino/a/xs are more likely to be arrested and convicted of drug offenses due to discriminatory policing practices (Garland, 2001).\n\nIn addition to highlighting the ways in which racism shapes Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement, LatCrit also emphasizes the importance of centering the experiences of Latino/a/xs themselves. This involves recognizing the ways in which Latino/a/xs are actively resisting and challenging the dominant narratives and power structures that shape their experiences of crime and the criminal legal system.\n\nFor example, research has shown that Latino/a/xs are increasingly organizing and mobilizing to challenge the dominant narratives and power structures that shape their experiences of crime and the criminal legal system (Garcia, 2005). This includes the formation of community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and other forms of social activism.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement is a critical area of research in the field of criminology. By centering race and racism through the lens of LatCrit, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which systemic and institutionalized forms of oppression shape the experiences of Latino/a/xs. This, in turn, can inform the development of more effective policies and interventions aimed at reducing racial disparities in crime and the criminal legal system.", "References": [{"title": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness", "authors": "Michelle Alexander", "journal": "New Press", "year": "2010", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "416", "DOI": "10.7591/9780811028078"}, {"title": "Racial Formation in the United States: From the 1960s to the 1980s", "authors": "Michael O.
