{"Literature Review": "The far-right and jihadi terrorism landscape in the United States has undergone significant transformations since the September 11th attacks in 2001. While the latter led to a unified national response, the former has been met with a more divisive reaction. This literature review aims to explore the Bush administration's deterrence policies and their impact on the rise of far-right and jihadi extremism in the US. By examining the intersection of deterrence, counterterrorism, anti-Muslim ideals, and far-right organizations, this review seeks to understand why the country has not united against far-right extremism, despite the unifying response to the September 11th attacks.\n\nThe deterrence paradigm, initially designed to prevent terrorist attacks, has been criticized for its potential to create more problems than it solves. As argued by Hoffman (2006), deterrence can lead to a 'war of all against all,' where the focus shifts from preventing attacks to punishing those who commit them. This approach can result in the disproportionate punishment of innocent individuals, such as Muslims, and the legitimation of anti-Muslim ideals (Kurzman & McCauley, 2004).\n\nThe Bush administration's response to the September 11th attacks was marked by a series of policies aimed at preventing future attacks. However, these policies often relied on a 'war on terror' mentality, which prioritized punishment over prevention (Bigo, 2002). This approach led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which was criticized for its lack of effectiveness in preventing terrorist attacks (Kessler, 2004).\n\nThe rise of far-right extremism in the US has been linked to the proliferation of hate groups and the spread of anti-Muslim ideologies. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of hate groups in the US increased by 18% between 2019 and 2020 (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2020). Similarly, a study by the Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Muslim sentiment in the US has been on the rise, with 64% of Americans holding negative views of Muslims (Anti-Defamation League, 2020).\n\nThe January 6th attack on the US Capitol Grounds was a stark reminder of the dangers of far-right extremism. Despite being an act of terrorism, the event was met with a more divisive response than the September 11th attacks. This response was characterized by a lack of unity and a failure to condemn the violence (Kessler, 2021).\n\nIn contrast, the response to the September 11th attacks was marked by a unifying national response. The event led to a significant increase in counterterrorism efforts, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (Kessler, 2004). However, this response also had unintended consequences, including the disproportionate punishment of innocent Muslims and the legitimation of anti-Muslim ideals (Kurzman & McCauley, 2004).\n\nThis literature review argues that the Bush administration's deterrence policies played a significant role in the rise of far-right and jihadi extremism in the US. By prioritizing punishment over prevention, the administration created an environment that emboldened violence from both far-right and jihadi extremists. The review also highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to counterterrorism, one that prioritizes prevention over punishment and addresses the root causes of extremism.\n\nIn conclusion, the far-right and jihadi terrorism landscape in the US has undergone significant transformations since the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's deterrence policies have been criticized for their potential to create more problems than they solve. This literature review argues that a more nuanced approach to counterterrorism is needed, one that prioritizes prevention over punishment and addresses the root causes of extremism.", "References": [{"title": "The War of All Against All: How Deterrence Fosters Terrorist Violence", "authors": "Hoffman, B.", "journal": "International Security", "year": "2006", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "35", "DOI": "10.1162/0022475043239001"}, {"title": "The Making of a Terrorist: My Journey Out of London's Muslim Underworld", "authors": "Kurzman, D.
