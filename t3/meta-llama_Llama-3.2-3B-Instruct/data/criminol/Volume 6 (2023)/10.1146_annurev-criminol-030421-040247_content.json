{"Literature Review": "The use of deadly force by law enforcement agencies in the United States has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the high number of police killings. A comparative perspective can help identify the factors that contribute to this phenomenon. This literature review aims to explore the relationship between police killings, decentralization, and ethnoracial inequality in the context of comparative policing. The review will examine the existing literature on police killings, decentralization, and ethnoracial inequality, and discuss the implications of these findings for policing practices in the United States and other developed nations.\n\nResearch has shown that the United States stands out in the developed world for its reliance on deadly force (Bayley & Stenning, 2016). A study by the Washington Post found that between 2015 and 2019, police killed over 5,400 people in the United States, with African Americans being disproportionately represented among those killed (Washington Post, 2020). This disparity in police killings highlights the need for a comparative analysis of policing practices across different countries.\n\nDecentralization has been identified as a key factor contributing to high levels of police killings in the United States. The 'radically decentralized structure of U.S. policing' (Bayley & Stenning, 2016) limits the influence of external oversight, expertise, and resources for effective training, policy implementation, and accountability. This decentralized structure allows local police departments to make decisions without external oversight, which can lead to a lack of accountability and an increase in police killings.\n\nEthanoracial inequality and discord are also significant factors contributing to high levels of police killings in the United States. The'systemic racism' (Alexander, 2010) that pervades American society contributes to the disproportionate representation of African Americans in the prison population and the police force. This disparity in representation can lead to a lack of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, which can result in increased police killings.\n\nHowever, elevated rates of police killings among some Latin American countries with relatively centralized policing demonstrate that decentralization is not a necessary condition for high FPV. For example, a study by the Human Rights Watch found that in El Salvador, the police killings were largely concentrated in the capital city, San Salvador, and were often linked to the country's gang violence (Human Rights Watch, 2018). This suggests that the high levels of police killings in El Salvador were not solely due to decentralization, but rather were influenced by a range of factors, including gang violence and systemic racism.\n\nIn contrast, relatively low levels of police killings in Spain and Chile suggest that achieving low levels of police killings is possible without the extensive resources and training that appear to suppress FPV in wealthy Northern European nations. A study by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found that the Spanish police force had a low rate of police killings, with only 0.3% of the population killed by police in 2019 (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2020). This suggests that the low levels of police killings in Spain were due to a range of factors, including a strong emphasis on community policing and a high level of public trust in the police force.\n\nIn conclusion, the literature suggests that decentralization and ethnoracial inequality are significant factors contributing to high levels of police killings in the United States. However, the findings also suggest that these factors are not unique to the United States and that other countries have achieved low levels of police killings through different means. A comparative analysis of policing practices across different countries can help identify the stable and malleable factors that contribute to high levels of police killings and low levels of police killings.", "References": [{"title": "The Radical Decentralization of American Policing", "authors": "David H.
