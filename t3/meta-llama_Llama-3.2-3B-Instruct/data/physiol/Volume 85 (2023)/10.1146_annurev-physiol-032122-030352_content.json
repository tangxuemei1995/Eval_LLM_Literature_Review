{"Literature Review": "Fatty acid transport and signaling play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various physiological processes. Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are essential components of plasma membranes, serving as an efficient fuel source and metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been linked to major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes (1). The major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and FA signaling are CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4, which are discussed in detail below.\n\nCD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that facilitates the uptake of long-chain FAs into cells (2). It is widely expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the brain (3). CD36-mediated FA uptake is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism (4). In contrast, FFAR1 and FFAR4 are G protein-coupled receptors that respond to long-chain FAs and regulate various metabolic pathways, including β-oxidation and lipolysis (5, 6).\n\nFFAR1 is activated by palmitate, a short-chain FA, and regulates β-oxidation in the liver (7). FFAR4, on the other hand, is activated by oleate, a medium-chain FA, and regulates lipolysis in adipose tissue (8). Both FFAR1 and FFAR4 are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, with FFAR1 promoting the proliferation of adipocytes and FFAR4 inhibiting the proliferation of osteoblasts (9, 10).\n\nCaveolin, a structural component of caveolae, plays a crucial role in the regulation of FA signaling by facilitating the interaction between FAs and membrane receptors (11). Caveolin also regulates the activity of FA-dependent kinases, which are involved in the signaling pathways initiated by FA binding to membrane receptors (12).\n\nIn addition to their roles in regulating metabolic pathways, FAs also play a crucial role in tissue repair and regeneration. FAs are involved in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses, with FAs such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) being potent anti-inflammatory agents (13, 14).\n\nIn conclusion, the mechanisms of FA transport and signaling are complex and multifaceted, involving various membrane receptors and signaling pathways. Understanding the roles of CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 in regulating FA uptake and signaling is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disorders.", "References": [{"title": "CD36: A Key Player in Fatty Acid Uptake and Signaling", "authors": "K.
