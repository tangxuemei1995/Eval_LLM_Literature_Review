{"Literature Review": "Polycystin channel complexes have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their crucial roles in various cellular processes, including sensory functions and the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The polycystin subunits can form hetero- and homotetrameric ion channels in the membranes of various compartments of the cell, with distinct properties and functions. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent structural and functional characterization of polycystin channel complexes, highlighting their contributions to sensory cell biology and the physiology of various tissues.The polycystin subunits are encoded by the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which are mutated in approximately 90% of ADPKD cases (1). The disease is characterized by the formation of cysts in the kidneys, leading to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure (2). Recent studies have shown that polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2) are essential for the normal functioning of primary cilia, which are microtubular structures that protrude from the cell surface and play a critical role in sensory perception (3).Homotetrameric polycystin channels are voltage- and calcium-modulated, with PC1 and PC2 forming the channel pore (4). These channels are found in the membranes of sensory neurons, where they contribute to the detection of mechanical and chemical stimuli (5). In contrast, heterotetrameric polycystin channels are proposed to be ligand- or autoproteolytically regulated, with PC1 and PC2 forming the channel pore in a heterotetrameric configuration (6). These channels are found in the membranes of various tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, and testes (7).The structural characterization of polycystin channel complexes has provided valuable insights into their gating mechanisms. Studies have shown that PC1 and PC2 form a complex with the channel pore, which is stabilized by interactions between the polycystin subunits and the channel pore (8). The gating mechanism of homotetrameric polycystin channels involves the coordinated movement of the polycystin subunits, which leads to the opening of the channel pore (9). In contrast, heterotetrameric polycystin channels are proposed to be regulated by the binding of ligands or autoproteolytic cleavage of PC1 or PC2 (10).The diversity in polycystin assembly and subcellular distribution allows for a multitude of sensory functions by this class of channels. For example, polycystin channels in sensory neurons contribute to the detection of mechanical stimuli, such as touch and pressure (11). In contrast, polycystin channels in the kidneys contribute to the regulation of calcium homeostasis and the maintenance of renal function (12).In conclusion, the recent structural and functional characterization of polycystin channel complexes has provided a molecular blueprint to investigate the conformational changes required for channel opening in response to unique stimuli. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the diverse sensory functions of polycystin channels and their impact on the physiology of various tissues.", "References": [{"title": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: the PKD1 and PKD2 genes", "authors": "Hudson, J.
