{"Literature Review": "Engineering therapeutics to detoxify hemoglobin, heme, and iron is a critical area of research aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of hemolysis. Hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells, leads to the release of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb), heme (h), and iron (Fe) into the circulation. These species can cause vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative organ damage, necessitating the development of therapeutics strategies to detoxify them. In this review, we will discuss the characteristics of major plasma-derived protein scavengers of Hb/h/Fe, such as haptoglobin and hemopexin, and novel engineering approaches designed to address the toxicity of these hemolytic by-products.Hemolysis is a complex process involving the rupture of red blood cells, leading to the release of Hb, h, and Fe into the circulation. Under homeostasis, minor increases in these three hemolytic by-products are rapidly scavenged and cleared by natural plasma proteins. However, under certain pathophysiological conditions, scavenging systems become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. This accumulation can cause various side effects, including vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative organ damage.Haptoglobin (Hp) is a major plasma-derived protein scavenger of Hb/h/Fe. It binds to Hb, forming a complex that is rapidly cleared from the circulation by the liver. However, Hp has limitations in scavenging heme and iron, and its deficiency can lead to increased levels of these species in the circulation. Hemopexin (Hpx) is another plasma-derived protein that binds to heme, preventing its oxidation and facilitating its clearance from the circulation. However, Hpx has limited ability to scavenge Hb and Fe.To address the limitations of natural plasma protein scavengers, various therapeutics strategies are being developed. Supplementation with depleted plasma scavenger proteins, such as Hp, has been shown to reduce the levels of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. However, this approach has limitations, as it may not be effective in all cases of hemolysis. Engineered biomimetic protein constructs capable of scavenging multiple hemolytic species are another promising approach. These constructs can be designed to bind to Hb, h, and Fe, facilitating their clearance from the circulation.One such engineered protein construct is the hemoglobin-binding protein, which has been shown to bind to Hb and facilitate its clearance from the circulation. Another approach is the use of nanoparticles, which can be engineered to bind to Hb/h/Fe and facilitate their clearance from the circulation. These nanoparticles can be designed to target specific tissues or organs, reducing the risk of side effects.In addition to these therapeutics strategies, novel engineering approaches are being developed to address the toxicity of Hb/h/Fe. For example, the use of gene therapy to increase the expression of plasma scavenger proteins, such as Hp, has been shown to reduce the levels of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. Another approach is the use of RNA interference to reduce the expression of genes involved in the production of Hb/h/Fe.In conclusion, engineering therapeutics to detoxify hemoglobin, heme, and iron is a critical area of research aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of hemolysis. Novel engineering approaches, such as the use of engineered biomimetic protein constructs and nanoparticles, hold promise in addressing the toxicity of Hb/h/Fe. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of these therapeutics strategies and to develop effective treatments for hemolytic disorders.", "References": [{"title": "Hemolysis and the acute phase response", "authors": "Ward, P.
