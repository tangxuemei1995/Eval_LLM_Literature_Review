{"Literature Review": "Engineered compounds to control ice nucleation and recrystallization have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in biopreservation. The ability to control ice nucleation and recrystallization is crucial in maintaining the viability of cells, tissues, and organs during subzero storage. In nature, certain organisms have evolved mechanisms to avoid ice nucleation and recrystallization, which enable them to sustain internal temperatures below the physiologic freezing point for extended periods of time. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research in this field, highlighting the latest developments and advancements in the design and application of engineered compounds to control ice nucleation and recrystallization. The concept of antifreeze proteins, which are capable of inhibiting ice nucleation, has been extensively studied in various organisms, including insects, fish, and plants. These proteins work by binding to ice nucleation sites, thereby preventing the formation of ice crystals and maintaining the structural integrity of cells and tissues. In addition to antifreeze proteins, other compounds have been engineered to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, including peptides, polymers, and nanoparticles. One of the key challenges in controlling ice nucleation and recrystallization is the development of materials that can exhibit thermal hysteresis, which is the ability to maintain a stable temperature despite changes in the surrounding environment. Thermal hysteresis is critical in preventing ice nucleation and recrystallization, as it allows materials to maintain a stable temperature below the freezing point. Researchers have made significant progress in developing materials with thermal hysteresis, including hydrogels, polymers, and nanomaterials. The design and application of engineered compounds to control ice nucleation and recrystallization have been explored in various biopreservation applications, including the storage of cells, tissues, and organs. These compounds have been shown to be effective in preventing ice nucleation and recrystallization, thereby maintaining the viability of cells and tissues during subzero storage. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of these compounds and to optimize their design and application. In conclusion, engineered compounds to control ice nucleation and recrystallization have shown significant promise in biopreservation applications. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of these compounds and to optimize their design and application. The development of materials with thermal hysteresis is critical in preventing ice nucleation and recrystallization, and researchers should continue to explore new materials and designs to improve the efficacy of these compounds.", "References": [{"title": "Antifreeze proteins from insects: structure, function, and applications", "authors": "L.
