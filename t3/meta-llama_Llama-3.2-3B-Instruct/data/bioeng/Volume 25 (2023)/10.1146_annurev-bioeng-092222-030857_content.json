{"Literature Review": "Sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years, with growing recognition of the importance of considering sex differences in cellular function and behavior, therapy efficacy, and disease incidence and outcomes. Despite this, the adoption of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine remains limited, with many studies failing to account for sex differences in their design and analysis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, with a focus on the tissue engineering triad of cells, matrices, and signals. By contextualizing sex as a biological variable within this triad, we can begin to develop personalized, precision medicine approaches that take into account the unique characteristics of each individual patient. This review will discuss the current state of sex differences in cellular function and behavior, therapy efficacy, and disease incidence and outcomes, and will highlight the need for a cultural shift in science and engineering research to achieve equity in biological sex within medicine. We will also examine the current state of sex-specific tissue models and stem cells, and will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating sex characteristics into tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a foundation for considering biological sex as a critical variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and to highlight the need for further research in this area to advance the field of precision medicine.", "References": [{"title": "Sex differences in the response to tissue engineering scaffolds", "authors": "L.
