{"Literature Review": "Epitranscriptional regulation is a complex and dynamic process that plays a crucial role in the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of RNA modifications in gene translation, DNA damage response, and cell fate regulation. In this review, we will provide an overview of the epitranscriptome landscape, recent findings in epitranscriptional regulations, and tools for epitranscriptome analysis. We will also discuss the potential applications of this field in biomedical engineering research.\n\nEpitranscriptional regulation refers to the post-transcriptional modifications of RNAs, including methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. These modifications can lead to functional changes in RNAs, influencing gene expression and cellular behavior (1, 2). In the cardiovascular system, epitranscriptional modifications have been implicated in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration (3-6).\n\nOne of the key epitranscriptional modifications in the cardiovascular system is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation. m6A methylation has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to DNA damage (7). In the context of cardiovascular disease, m6A methylation has been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in atherogenesis and cardiac remodeling (8).\n\nAnother important epitranscriptional modification is pseudouridylation, which has been shown to play a role in regulating gene expression in response to mechanical stress (9). In the cardiovascular system, pseudouridylation has been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in mechanosensing and cardiac function (10).\n\nDeamination and hydroxylation are also important epitranscriptional modifications in the cardiovascular system. Deamination has been shown to play a role in regulating gene expression in response to oxidative stress (11), while hydroxylation has been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in atherogenesis and cardiac remodeling (12).\n\nRecent studies have also highlighted the importance of epitranscriptome analysis in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease. Epitranscriptome analysis has been used to identify novel epitranscriptional modifications and to understand their role in regulating gene expression (13-16).\n\nIn conclusion, epitranscriptional regulation plays a crucial role in the cardiovascular system, influencing gene expression and cellular behavior. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying epitranscriptional regulation in the cardiovascular system and to explore its potential applications in biomedical engineering research.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
