{"Literature Review": "The traditional technocentric view of medical device design has been criticized for its limitations in ensuring the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations. A shift towards a human-centered approach is necessary to address existing translational gaps and promote health equity. This review article aims to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy. Existing frameworks and human- and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation will be reviewed, along with case study examples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.", "References": [{"title": "Human-Centered Design for Healthcare: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "K.
