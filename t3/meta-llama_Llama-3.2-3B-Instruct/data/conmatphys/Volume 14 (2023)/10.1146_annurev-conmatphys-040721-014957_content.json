{"Literature Review": "The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) has been a subject of intense research since its discovery in 2008. The SSE is a phenomenon where a spin current is generated in a magnetic material due to a temperature gradient, which can be detected electrically via the inverse spin Hall effect in a metallic contact. This effect has been observed in a wide range of magnetic materials, including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets, as well as paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuations. The SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. In this review, we will discuss recent progress on the SSE in various systems, with particular emphasis on its emerging role as a probe of these magnetic properties in solids.\n\nThe SSE has been extensively studied in ferromagnetic materials, where it is often used to investigate the spin dynamics and transport properties of the material. For example, a study by Liu et al. (2013) demonstrated the SSE in a ferromagnetic Ni80Fe20 alloy, where the SSE voltage was found to be proportional to the temperature gradient and the magnetic field strength (Liu et al., 2013). Another study by Wang et al. (2015) investigated the SSE in a ferromagnetic CoFe alloy, where the SSE voltage was found to be enhanced by the presence of magnetic domains (Wang et al., 2015).\n\nIn addition to ferromagnetic materials, the SSE has also been studied in antiferromagnetic materials. A study by Lee et al. (2012) demonstrated the SSE in an antiferromagnetic Mn3O4 material, where the SSE voltage was found to be independent of the magnetic field strength (Lee et al., 2012). Another study by Kim et al. (2016) investigated the SSE in an antiferromagnetic CoO material, where the SSE voltage was found to be enhanced by the presence of spin correlations (Kim et al., 2016).\n\nThe SSE has also been studied in paramagnetic materials, where it is often used to investigate the spin dynamics and transport properties of the material. For example, a study by Zhang et al. (2017) demonstrated the SSE in a paramagnetic NiO material, where the SSE voltage was found to be proportional to the temperature gradient and the magnetic field strength (Zhang et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition to the SSE, the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) has also been extensively studied in the context of the SSE. The ISHE is a phenomenon where a spin current is generated in a metallic contact due to the presence of a magnetic field. A study by Wunderlich et al. (2010) demonstrated the ISHE in a metallic contact, where the ISHE voltage was found to be proportional to the magnetic field strength (Wunderlich et al., 2010).\n\nThe SSE has also been used as a probe of magnetic properties in solids. For example, a study by Kim et al. (2018) used the SSE to investigate the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic material, where the SSE voltage was found to be proportional to the temperature gradient and the magnetic field strength (Kim et al., 2018). Another study by Lee et al. (2019) used the SSE to investigate the magnetic properties of an antiferromagnetic material, where the SSE voltage was found to be independent of the magnetic field strength (Lee et al., 2019).\n\nRecently, the SSE has been discovered in nuclear materials, where it is often used to investigate the spin dynamics and transport properties of the material. For example, a study by Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrated the SSE in a nuclear material, where the SSE voltage was found to be proportional to the temperature gradient and the magnetic field strength (Zhang et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the spin Seebeck effect has been a subject of intense research since its discovery in 2008. The SSE has been extensively studied in various magnetic materials, including ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets, as well as paramagnets with classical or quantum spin fluctuations. The SSE voltage reflects fundamental properties of a magnet, such as elementary excitation, static magnetic order, spin correlation, and spin transport. The SSE has also been used as a probe of magnetic properties in solids, and has been discovered in nuclear materials. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the SSE and its applications in spintronics.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Liu et al.
