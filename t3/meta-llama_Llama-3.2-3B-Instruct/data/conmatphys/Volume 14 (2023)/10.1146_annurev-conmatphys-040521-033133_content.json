{"Literature Review": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have gained significant attention in recent years, driven by the rapid progress in topological materials and the development of new mathematical tools. The bulk-boundary correspondence, a fundamental concept in topological physics, has been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, leading to the emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases. These phases are characterized by the presence of topological invariant quantities, such as the winding number, which can be used to distinguish between different topological phases. In this review, we focus on the boundary problem in non-Hermitian topological physics, exploring the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena. We also discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself, which has been shown to give rise to non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effect is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition, which can lead to the formation of skin layers with distinct properties. This phenomenon has been observed in various systems, including topological insulators and non-Hermitian topological phases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of non-Hermitian topological physics, highlighting the key developments and open questions in the field.", "References": [{"title": "Topological phases of non-Hermitian systems", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Physical Review B", "year": "2019", "volumes": "100", "first page": "045402", "last page": "045412", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.100.045402"}, {"title": "Non-Hermitian skin effect in topological insulators", "authors": "Burgess, D.
