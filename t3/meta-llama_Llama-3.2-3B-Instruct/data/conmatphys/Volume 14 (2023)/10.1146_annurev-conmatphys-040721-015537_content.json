{"Literature Review": "Floquet states in open quantum systems have garnered significant attention in recent years due to the growing interest in nonequilibrium statistical physics. The Floquet theory, which provides a recipe for obtaining a static effective Hamiltonian from periodic driving, has been widely applied to closed systems. However, the inclusion of dissipation, a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, is crucial for understanding the behavior of open Floquet systems. In this review, we will provide a detailed exposition on the formalism of quantum master equations for open Floquet systems and highlight recent work investigating the applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics to Floquet states.\n\nThe Floquet theory, introduced by Floquet in 1883, is based on the idea that a periodic driving can be represented as a unitary transformation in time. This allows for the derivation of a static effective Hamiltonian, which can be used to study the behavior of the system in the long-time limit. However, the inclusion of dissipation is essential for understanding the behavior of open systems, which are subject to energy loss due to interactions with the environment.\n\nOne of the key challenges in studying open Floquet systems is the need to balance the effects of periodic driving and dissipation. This is because the periodic driving can lead to the creation of Floquet states, which are states that are periodic in time but not in energy. However, the dissipation can also lead to the destruction of these states, making it challenging to understand their behavior.\n\nRecent work has shown that the inclusion of dissipation can lead to the emergence of novel phases of matter in open Floquet systems. For example, a study by [1] demonstrated that the inclusion of dissipation can lead to the creation of a topological phase in a driven-dissipative system. Another study by [2] showed that the inclusion of dissipation can lead to the emergence of a non-equilibrium phase transition in a Floquet system.\n\nIn addition to the emergence of novel phases of matter, the inclusion of dissipation can also lead to the modification of the Floquet states. For example, a study by [3] showed that the inclusion of dissipation can lead to the creation of a non-equilibrium Floquet state, which is different from the equilibrium Floquet state. Another study by [4] demonstrated that the inclusion of dissipation can lead to the modification of the Floquet state, resulting in a non-equilibrium Floquet state with different properties than the equilibrium Floquet state.\n\nThe formalism of quantum master equations provides a powerful tool for studying the behavior of open Floquet systems. The quantum master equation is a differential equation that describes the time evolution of the density matrix of the system. The formalism of quantum master equations has been widely applied to study the behavior of open quantum systems, including Floquet systems.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the formalism of quantum master equations is its ability to incorporate the effects of dissipation. The formalism of quantum master equations provides a way to describe the time evolution of the density matrix of the system, taking into account the effects of dissipation. This allows for a more accurate description of the behavior of open Floquet systems.\n\nIn addition to the formalism of quantum master equations, recent work has also shown that the study of Floquet states can be approached using other methods, such as the use of numerical simulations. For example, a study by [5] used numerical simulations to study the behavior of a Floquet system with dissipation. Another study by [6] used numerical simulations to study the behavior of a Floquet system with periodic driving.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of Floquet states in open quantum systems is a rapidly evolving field that is receiving growing interest. The inclusion of dissipation is crucial for understanding the behavior of open Floquet systems, and the formalism of quantum master equations provides a powerful tool for studying the behavior of these systems. Recent work has shown that the study of Floquet states can be approached using other methods, such as numerical simulations.
