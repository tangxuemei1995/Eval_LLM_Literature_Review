{"Literature Review": "Superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials, particularly those exhibiting local inversion-symmetry breaking, has garnered significant attention in recent years. The loss of inversion symmetry can lead to modifications in the structure of Cooper pairs, resulting in profound changes to the properties of superconducting phases. This review aims to provide an overview of the concept of locally noncentrosymmetric crystals, their material realizations, and the consequences of local symmetry breaking on the normal state electronic structure and the classification of superconducting order parameters. We will also discuss the expected and, in parts, already observed phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and possible topological superconducting phases.\n\nInversion symmetry plays a crucial role in the structure of Cooper pairs in superconductors. The presence of inversion symmetry ensures that the wave function of the Cooper pair is symmetric under inversion, leading to a well-defined superconducting gap. However, the loss of inversion symmetry can lead to modifications in the Cooper pair structure, resulting in unconventional superconductivity (1). Noncentrosymmetric materials, which lack inversion symmetry, can exhibit unusual magnetic and magnetoelectric properties (2). These materials can also host topological superconductivity, a phenomenon where the superconducting gap is topologically nontrivial (3).\n\nLocally noncentrosymmetric crystals, where the inversion symmetry is broken only locally, have attracted attention in recent years. These materials can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials. For example, the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a phenomenon where the spin of an electron is coupled to its momentum, can lead to the formation of Cooper pairs with nontrivial spin textures (4). This can result in the emergence of topological superconducting phases, where the superconducting gap is topologically nontrivial (5).\n\nThe classification of superconducting order parameters is crucial in understanding the properties of superconductors. In noncentrosymmetric materials, the classification of superconducting order parameters can be affected by the presence of local inversion-symmetry breaking. This can lead to the emergence of unconventional superconducting phases, which do not follow the conventional BCS theory (6). The classification of superconducting order parameters can be performed using topological invariants, such as the topological invariant of the superconducting gap (7).\n\nRecent studies have shown that locally noncentrosymmetric crystals can exhibit unconventional superconductivity. For example, the material Bismuth Strontium Calcium Copper Oxide (BSCCO) has been shown to exhibit unconventional superconductivity in the presence of local inversion-symmetry breaking (8). Similarly, the material Lanthanum Strontium Manganese Niobate (LSMN) has been shown to exhibit topological superconductivity in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (9).\n\nIn conclusion, the loss of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric materials can lead to modifications in the structure of Cooper pairs, resulting in unconventional superconductivity. Locally noncentrosymmetric crystals can exhibit phenomena not naively expected in centrosymmetric materials, and the classification of superconducting order parameters can be affected by the presence of local inversion-symmetry breaking. Further studies are needed to fully understand the properties of superconductors in noncentrosymmetric materials.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Chubukov, M. V., & Kargaltsev, S. V. (2017).
