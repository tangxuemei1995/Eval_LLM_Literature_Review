{"Literature Review": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act has been a cornerstone of suicide prevention efforts in the United States since its inception in 2004. This comprehensive, community-based initiative has been shown to have a positive impact on reducing suicide attempts and mortality among young people. A key aspect of the GLS Memorial Act is its focus on community-based programs, which have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing population rates of suicide attempts and mortality. The act's emphasis on continuous funding and support has allowed for the long-term sustainability of these programs, leading to more pronounced positive outcomes. Cost analyses have also shown that the implementation of GLS suicide prevention activities can lead to significant reductions in healthcare costs associated with emergency department visits and hospitalizations. However, the heterogeneity of community suicide prevention programs and the lack of randomized trials have precluded definitive determination of causal effects associated with the GLS initiative. Despite these limitations, the findings of the GLS Memorial Act are encouraging, and its impact on reducing youth suicide rates has been significant. However, the initiative has never been brought fully to scale, which has limited its ability to have a nationwide impact on suicide rates.", "References": [{"title": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Smith, K.
