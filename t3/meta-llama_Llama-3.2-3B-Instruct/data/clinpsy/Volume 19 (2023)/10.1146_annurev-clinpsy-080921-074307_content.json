{"Literature Review": "Behavioral interventions for tic disorders have gained significant attention in recent years due to their effectiveness in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for individuals with tic disorders. The past decade has seen a substantial increase in research on behavioral interventions, with a growing body of evidence supporting their use as first-line therapies for treating tics. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the theoretical and conceptual framework underlying behavioral interventions for tics, with a focus on the three primary interventions with the strongest empirical support: habit reversal, Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT), and exposure and response prevention (ERP). We will also discuss the research evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments, as well as the delivery of these treatments in different formats and modalities. Finally, we will review the possible mechanisms of change underlying behavioral interventions for tics and identify areas for future research.", "References": [{"title": "Habit Reversal Training for Tourette Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial", "authors": "Scahill, L., et al.
