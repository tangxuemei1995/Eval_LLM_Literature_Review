{"Literature Review": "Community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives have been a topic of increasing interest in recent years, driven by the need to address the significant disparities in mental health outcomes within these populations. The historical trauma and ongoing systemic injustices faced by American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have resulted in high rates of addiction, trauma, and suicide, underscoring the need for culturally responsive and community-based mental health services (Gone & Trimble, 2012). This review aims to update and extend the prior work of Gone and Trimble (2012) by examining the key literature on AI/AN community mental health services since 2010, including randomized controlled trials of evidence-based treatments and alternative, Indigenized therapeutic interventions.The AI/AN population in the USA is complex and multifaceted, comprising over 570 federally recognized tribes and millions of individuals living in semisovereign Tribal Nations (Bureau of Indian Affairs, 2020). The importance of political citizenship in these communities cannot be overstated, as it is a primary factor in determining access to resources, services, and opportunities (Deloria, 1995). The AI/AN population has been historically marginalized and excluded from mainstream healthcare systems, leading to a lack of culturally responsive services and a reliance on traditional, community-based healing practices (Cohen, 2011).Recent studies have highlighted the need for community-based mental health services that are tailored to the unique needs and experiences of AI/AN populations (Wang et al., 2018). A randomized controlled trial conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) found that community-based treatment programs that incorporated traditional healing practices and cultural adaptations resulted in improved treatment outcomes and reduced recidivism rates among AI/AN individuals with substance use disorders (SAMHSA, 2019).However, the evidence-based practice (EBP) approach has been criticized for its limitations in addressing the complex, intergenerational trauma and cultural trauma experienced by AI/AN populations (Cohen, 2011). The EBP approach has been criticized for its failure to account for the historical and ongoing injustices faced by AI/AN communities, leading to a lack of cultural relevance and effectiveness (Wang et al., 2018). In response to these criticisms, an 'alter-Native psy-ence' has emerged, which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions (Gone & Trimble, 2012).Indigenized therapeutic interventions have been shown to be effective in addressing the unique needs and experiences of AI/AN populations (Wang et al., 2018). A randomized controlled trial conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health found that a culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program resulted in improved treatment outcomes and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety among AI/AN individuals (National Institute of Mental Health, 2017). Another study found that a traditional healing practice-based intervention resulted in improved treatment outcomes and reduced substance use among AI/AN individuals with substance use disorders (SAMHSA, 2019).In conclusion, the literature suggests that community mental health services for AI/AN populations must be tailored to the unique needs and experiences of these communities. The EBP approach has limitations in addressing the complex, intergenerational trauma and cultural trauma experienced by AI/AN populations. Indigenized therapeutic interventions have shown promise in addressing these needs and improving treatment outcomes. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.", "References": [{"title": "Theories of resistance in postcolonial thought", "authors": "C.
