{"Literature Review": "Eating disorders in boys and men have garnered significant attention in recent years, with a growing body of research aimed at understanding the complexities of this issue. Despite historical underrepresentation, the twenty-first century has seen a surge in research, contributing valuable insights to the field. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology of eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia in boys and men, as well as specific groups at increased risk, sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors, and male-specific assessment measures. We will also examine current research on prevention efforts, treatment outcomes, and mortality risk in samples of boys and men, highlighting priorities for future research.", "References": [{"title": "Eating Disorders in Boys and Men: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Haines, J., Neumark-Sztainer, D., & Crow, S.
