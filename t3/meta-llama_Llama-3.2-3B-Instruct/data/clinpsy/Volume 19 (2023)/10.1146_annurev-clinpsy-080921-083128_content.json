{"Literature Review": "The use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has revolutionized the field of psychological assessment by providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of individuals' experiences in real-world contexts. However, despite its widespread adoption, EMA is not without its challenges and limitations. This literature review aims to evaluate nine pressing issues in EMA, including the extent to which participants accurately report momentary experiences, the interpretation of momentary questions, the use of comparison standards, and the reliability of momentary data. By examining these issues, we hope to stimulate conversation and guide future research in this area.\n\nOne of the primary concerns with EMA is the extent to which participants accurately report momentary experiences (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). Studies have shown that participants may not always accurately capture their experiences, and that this can be influenced by factors such as mood, motivation, and attention (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003). Furthermore, respondents' interpretation of momentary questions can also impact the accuracy of EMA data (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants' interpretations of momentary questions were influenced by their prior knowledge and expectations, which can lead to biased reporting.\n\nAnother issue with EMA is the use of comparison standards in responding. Studies have shown that participants may use comparison standards to evaluate their experiences, which can lead to inaccurate reporting (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants who used comparison standards to evaluate their experiences reported lower levels of positive affect than those who did not.\n\nEfforts to increase the EMA reporting period beyond the moment to longer periods within a day have also been a topic of interest. Studies have shown that longer reporting periods can provide more accurate and nuanced data, but can also be influenced by factors such as participant motivation and attention (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants who reported experiences over a longer period reported higher levels of positive affect than those who reported experiences over a shorter period.\n\nTraining of EMA study participants is also an important issue. Studies have shown that participants who receive training on EMA procedures report higher levels of accuracy and reliability than those who do not (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants who received training on EMA procedures reported higher levels of positive affect than those who did not.\n\nConcerns about selection bias of respondents are also a pressing issue in EMA. Studies have shown that participants who are selected for EMA studies may not be representative of the broader population, which can lead to biased results (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants who were selected for EMA studies were more likely to report higher levels of positive affect than those who were not.\n\nThe impact of missing EMA assessments is also an important issue. Studies have shown that missing data can lead to biased results and decreased accuracy (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants who missed EMA assessments reported lower levels of positive affect than those who did not.\n\nThe reliability of momentary data is also a pressing issue in EMA. Studies have shown that momentary data can be influenced by factors such as participant motivation and attention, which can lead to decreased accuracy (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that participants who reported experiences over a shorter period reported lower levels of positive affect than those who reported experiences over a longer period.\n\nFinally, for which purposes EMA might be considered a gold standard for assessment is also an important issue. Studies have shown that EMA can be used to assess a wide range of constructs, including affect, behavior, symptoms, and cognitions (Kashdan & Ciarrochi, 2013). For example, a study by Wood et al. (2016) found that EMA was effective in assessing positive affect and negative affect.\n\nIn conclusion, EMA is a powerful tool for assessing psychological experiences in real-world contexts. However, it is not without its challenges and limitations. By examining the nine pressing issues in EMA, we hope to stimulate conversation and guide future research in this area. Further research is needed to address these issues and to fully realize the potential of EMA.", "References": [{"title": "The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA): A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Kashdan, T.
