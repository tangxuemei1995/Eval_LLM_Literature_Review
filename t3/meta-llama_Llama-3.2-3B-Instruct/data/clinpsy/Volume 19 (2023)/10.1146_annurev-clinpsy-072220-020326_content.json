{"Literature Review": "The mental health of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention. Research has consistently shown that TGD children and adolescents experience higher levels of psychological distress compared to their cisgender, heterosexual peers and even their cisgender, sexual minority peers. This disparity is attributed to the cumulative effect of minority stress, which arises from the intersection of multiple forms of stigma and marginalization. In this review, we will document these mental health disparities, discuss potential explanations using a minority stress framework, and examine factors that may increase or decrease TGD youth's vulnerability to psychological distress. We will also review interventions, including gender-affirming medical care, that may improve mental health in TGD youth. Finally, we will discuss limitations of current research and suggest avenues for future investigation.", "References": [{"title": "The Minority Stress Model: A Framework for Understanding the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Youth", "authors": "Meyer, I.
