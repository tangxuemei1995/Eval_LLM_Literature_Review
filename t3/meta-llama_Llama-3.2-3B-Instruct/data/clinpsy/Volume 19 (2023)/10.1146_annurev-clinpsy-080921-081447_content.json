{"Literature Review": "Parental incarceration has been a persistent and pervasive issue in the United States, affecting millions of children and increasing their risk for emotional and behavioral problems. The consequences of parental incarceration on children's adjustment have been extensively studied, with research indicating that children with incarcerated parents are more likely to experience emotional and behavioral difficulties, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Amato, 2001; Grogan-Kaylor, 2005). These difficulties can have long-lasting effects, impacting children's academic performance, social relationships, and overall well-being (Hill, 2010; Lutz, 2013). Furthermore, children with incarcerated parents are more likely to experience poverty, food insecurity, and housing instability, exacerbating their risk for adverse outcomes (McLanahan, 2004; Ziol-Grimm et al., 2012). Despite these challenges, research also suggests that children exhibit resilience in the context of parental incarceration, with some studies finding that children with incarcerated parents are more likely to develop coping strategies, form supportive relationships, and exhibit positive outcomes (Hill, 2010; Lutz, 2013). However, these findings are often based on limited samples and lack contextualization, failing to account for the complex and intersecting inequalities that shape children's experiences (Murray, 2013; Sullivan, 2014). A critical reframing of resilience research is necessary to address these limitations and provide a more nuanced understanding of children's experiences with parental incarceration. This review aims to provide an overview of the literature on risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, with a focus on naturally occurring processes and interventions that may mitigate risk and contribute to positive youth development. We also examine the need for a more contextualized approach to resilience research and argue that resilience research and practice should be conceptualized as important complements to, rather than substitutes for, social and institutional change. Our analysis is guided by the principles of social justice and intersectionality, highlighting the need for research and practice that prioritize the needs and experiences of marginalized populations (Crenshaw, 1991; hooks, 2000). In the following sections, we review the literature on risk and resilience among children with incarcerated parents, discuss the limitations of current research, and offer recommendations for future research and practice that prioritize social justice and intersectionality.", "References": [{"title": "The Effects of Parental Incarceration on Children's Adjustment", "authors": "Amato, P.
