{"Literature Review": "Electrochemical additive manufacturing (ECAM) has emerged as a promising technology for creating complex micro- and nanoscale structures with unparalleled geometrical complexity. This technology combines the ability to process conductive materials, design freedom, and micro- to nanoscale resolution, making it an attractive option for various applications in microelectronics, sensing, robotics, and energy storage (1, 2). The fundamental principles of ECAM involve the deposition of metal ions onto a substrate through an electrochemical process, allowing for the creation of intricate features and structures (3). Recent advances in ECAM have focused on improving the resolution, control, and scalability of the print process, enabling the production of high-aspect-ratio structures and complex geometries (4, 5). One of the key techniques used in ECAM is meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), which involves the use of a nanopipette or a microchannel to control the meniscus and deposit metal ions onto a substrate (6). This technique has been shown to produce high-resolution structures with precise control over dimensions and morphology (7). Another technique used in ECAM is fluid dynamics-based methods, such as scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), which utilize fluid flow and electrochemical reactions to deposit metal ions onto a substrate (8, 9). These techniques have been demonstrated to produce complex structures with high resolution and precision. In addition, the use of nanopipettes and microchannels has enabled the creation of micro- and nanoscale structures with precise control over dimensions and morphology (10). The unique combination of ECAM and fluid dynamics-based methods has opened up new possibilities for the creation of complex micro- and nanoscale structures with unparalleled geometrical complexity. By controlling the fundamental phenomena that underpin the print process, researchers can vary dimensions, morphology, and microstructure of printed structures, enabling the creation of complex devices and systems for various applications. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles of ECAM, recent advances in the field, and the use of fluid dynamics-based methods to create complex micro- and nanoscale structures.", "References": [{"title": "Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing: A Review", "authors": "S.
