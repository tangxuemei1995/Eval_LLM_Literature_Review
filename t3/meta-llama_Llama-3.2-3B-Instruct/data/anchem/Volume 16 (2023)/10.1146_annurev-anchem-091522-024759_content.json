{"Literature Review": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose a significant threat to the health and well-being of millions of people in tropical and subtropical countries. The lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare in these regions exacerbates the spread of these diseases, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. Portable and low-cost microfluidic systems have emerged as a promising solution for clinical diagnosis, offering fast, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tests in developing countries. This review provides a critical overview of microfluidic devices reported in the literature for the detection of the most common NTDs over the past 5 years.", "References": [{"title": "Microfluidic devices for the detection of neglected tropical diseases", "authors": "S.
