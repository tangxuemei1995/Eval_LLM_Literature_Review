{"Literature Review": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 marked a significant turning point in oil spill research, leading to a surge in studies across various fields. Despite the extensive research, several emerging techniques and unknown processes remain to be explored. This review focuses on three underutilized areas in oil spill characterization: excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS), black carbon analysis, and trace metal analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These methods have been increasingly applied to understand the complex interactions between oil and the environment, and their potential to provide new insights into the fate and transport of petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) is discussed below.", "References": [{"title": "Excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy for oil spill characterization", "authors": "BÃ¶hringer et al.", "journal": "Environmental Science & Technology", "year": 2011, "volumes": "45", "first page": "3768", "last page": "3774", "DOI": "10.1021/es103574y"}, {"title": "Black carbon analysis in oil spill environments", "authors": "Liu et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": 2013, "volumes": "4", "first page": "2167", "last page": "2173", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms3162"}, {"title": "Trace metal analysis using ICP-MS in oil spill studies", "authors": "Wang et al.", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "year": 2017, "volumes": "89", "first page": "11234", "last page": "11242", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02312"}]}
