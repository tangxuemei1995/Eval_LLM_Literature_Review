{"Literature Review": "Microfluidics has revolutionized the field of biofilm studies by providing a precise control of hydrodynamic and physicochemical microenvironments. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that are held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix, exhibiting properties that distinguish them from free-living bacteria. The unique properties of biofilms make them an attractive model system for studying bacterial adhesion, biofilm development, and the effects of mechanical and chemical cues on bacterial behavior. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in microfluidics-based biofilm research, including understanding the mechanism of bacterial adhesion and biofilm development, assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties, development of advanced in vitro infection models, and advancement in methods to characterize biofilms. The mechanism of bacterial adhesion to surfaces is a critical step in biofilm formation. Studies have shown that the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces is influenced by factors such as shear stress, surface roughness, and the presence of extracellular matrix. Microfluidics-based studies have demonstrated that the application of controlled shear stress can influence the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces, with higher shear stress leading to increased adhesion. In contrast, studies have shown that the presence of extracellular matrix can inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, highlighting the importance of matrix composition and structure in biofilm formation. Biofilm development is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple bacterial species and the production of extracellular matrix. Microfluidics-based studies have demonstrated that the application of controlled flow rates and shear stresses can influence the development of biofilms, with higher flow rates leading to increased biofilm thickness and density. Additionally, studies have shown that the presence of antimicrobial agents can inhibit biofilm development, highlighting the potential of microfluidics-based systems for studying the effects of antimicrobial agents on biofilm formation. Assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties is critical for the development of effective biofilm-based systems. Microfluidics-based studies have demonstrated that the application of controlled flow rates and shear stresses can influence the antifouling properties of surfaces, with higher flow rates leading to increased antifouling activity. Additionally, studies have shown that the presence of antimicrobial agents can inhibit biofilm formation, highlighting the potential of microfluidics-based systems for studying the effects of antimicrobial agents on biofilm formation. Development of advanced in vitro infection models is critical for the study of biofilm-based systems.
