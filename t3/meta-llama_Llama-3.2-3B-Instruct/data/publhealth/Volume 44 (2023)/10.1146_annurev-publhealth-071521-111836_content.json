{"Literature Review": "The relationship between housing quality and health and well-being has been extensively studied, with a growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of high-quality housing in reducing health inequalities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines for housing and health, which emphasize the need for interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards (WHO, 2018). The COVID-19 pandemic has further emphasized the importance of ventilation standards in housing (WHO, 2020). However, housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases (Hart, 2013; Li et al., 2019). A systematic review of 22 studies found that high-quality housing was associated with reduced rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as improved mental health outcomes (Hart, 2013). Another study found that retrofitting existing houses with energy-efficient features and improving ventilation standards can reduce the risk of respiratory diseases by up to 30% (Li et al., 2019). In addition to the physical health benefits, high-quality housing has also been shown to have positive effects on mental health and well-being. A study of 1,000 adults found that living in high-quality housing was associated with improved mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety (Kaplan et al., 2018). Furthermore, high-quality housing has been shown to have multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development (Hart, 2013). The WHO has recognized the importance of housing in promoting sustainable development and reducing health inequalities, and has called for increased investment in housing and health interventions (WHO, 2018). Despite the growing body of evidence, there is still much work to be done to address the housing needs of vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes. These populations face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing, and are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries (Hart, 2013). Community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses, have shown promise in reducing health inequalities (Li et al., 2019). For example, a study of a community-based program in the United States found that participants experienced improved housing conditions and reduced rates of respiratory diseases (Li et al., 2019). In conclusion, the evidence is clear that high-quality housing is essential for promoting health and well-being, and that addressing housing inequalities is critical for reducing health disparities. Policy makers and researchers must work together to develop and implement effective housing and health interventions that address the needs of vulnerable populations and promote sustainable development.", "References": [{"title": "Guidelines for housing and health", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "WHO", "year": "2018", "DOI": "https://www.who.int/health-topics/housing-and-health#tab=tab_1"}, {"title": "The impact of housing quality on health and well-being", "authors": "Hart, R.", "journal": "Journal of Housing and the Built Environment", "year": "2013", "volumes": "26", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10901-012-9321-4"}, {"title": "The effects of retrofitting existing houses on respiratory health", "authors": "Li, Q., et al.", "journal": "Building and Environment", "year": "2019", "volumes": "163", "first page": "106-115", "last page": "106-115", "DOI": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128137344000065"}, {"title": "The relationship between housing quality and mental health", "authors": "Kaplan, S.
