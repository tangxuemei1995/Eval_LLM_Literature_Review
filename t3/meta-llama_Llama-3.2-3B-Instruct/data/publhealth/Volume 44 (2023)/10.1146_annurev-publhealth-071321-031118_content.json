{"Literature Review": "Health misinformation exposure and health disparities have been increasingly recognized as significant public health concerns. Health disparities refer to the unequal distribution of health outcomes and healthcare access among different populations, often resulting from structural and systemic factors such as racism, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare (1, 2). Misinformation, on the other hand, refers to the spread of false or misleading information that can influence health-related decisions and behaviors (3, 4). The relationship between misinformation and health disparities is complex, but research suggests that misinformation can exacerbate existing health disparities by perpetuating misperceptions and misconceptions about health risks and healthcare (5, 6). For instance, studies have shown that exposure to misinformation about vaccines has been linked to lower vaccination rates among certain populations, which can lead to increased rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (7, 8). Similarly, misinformation about the benefits of certain diets or lifestyle choices can lead to unhealthy behaviors and poor health outcomes among vulnerable populations (9, 10). Furthermore, structural racism and other forms of systemic oppression can contribute to the spread of misinformation, as marginalized communities may have limited access to accurate health information and healthcare resources (11, 12). Therefore, it is essential to consider the potential role of misinformation in explaining health disparities and to develop targeted interventions to address these disparities. Research has shown that misinformation-focused interventions can be effective in improving health literacy and reducing health disparities (13, 14). For example, a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that a misinformation-focused intervention program improved health literacy and reduced health disparities among low-income patients (15). Another study published in the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice found that a misinformation-focused intervention program reduced health disparities among African American patients with diabetes (16). However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between misinformation and health disparities and to develop effective interventions to address these disparities. Future research should focus on the following areas: (1) examining the mechanisms by which misinformation contributes to health disparities, (2) developing targeted interventions to address misinformation and health disparities, and (3) evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing health disparities. In conclusion, the relationship between misinformation and health disparities is complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of misinformation in explaining health disparities and to develop effective interventions to address these disparities. By addressing the root causes of misinformation and health disparities, we can work towards reducing health disparities and promoting health equity for all populations.", "References": [{"title": "Health disparities and health inequities: A review of the literature", "authors": "Smedley, B.
