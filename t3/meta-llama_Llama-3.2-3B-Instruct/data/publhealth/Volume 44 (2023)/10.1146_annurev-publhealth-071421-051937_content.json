{"Literature Review": "Sustainable and resilient health care in the face of a changing climate is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention from policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers. Climate change is a threat multiplier, exacerbating underlying vulnerabilities, worsening human health, and disrupting health systems' abilities to deliver high-quality continuous care. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified climate change as a major threat to global health, with rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events projected to have devastating impacts on human health. The health care sector is not immune to the impacts of climate change, with rising temperatures and changing weather patterns affecting the distribution and prevalence of diseases, as well as the availability of healthcare resources. For example, heatwaves have been linked to increased mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Similarly, droughts and water scarcity have been shown to impact the availability of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, leading to increased risk of waterborne diseases. To adapt to a changing climate, the health care sector must prioritize climate resilience and sustainability. This can be achieved through a range of strategies, including the implementation of climate-resilient infrastructure, the development of climate-informed health policies, and the promotion of climate-resilient practices among healthcare professionals. For example, the use of green infrastructure, such as green roofs and walls, can help to mitigate the urban heat island effect and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. However, there are also significant barriers to change, including limited resources, lack of awareness, and resistance to change among healthcare professionals. Additionally, the health care sector is often slow to respond to climate-related disasters, with many healthcare facilities and services being located in areas that are vulnerable to extreme weather events. This can lead to disruptions in healthcare services, increased mortality rates, and decreased access to healthcare for vulnerable populations. In conclusion, sustainable and resilient health care in the face of a changing climate requires a comprehensive approach that prioritizes climate resilience and sustainability. This can be achieved through the implementation of climate-resilient infrastructure, the development of climate-informed health policies, and the promotion of climate-resilient practices among healthcare professionals. By working together, we can build healthcare systems that are better equipped to respond to the challenges of a changing climate and provide high-quality, continuous care to vulnerable populations.", "References": [{"title": "Quantifying the health benefits of climate change mitigation", "authors": "WHO (2018) Quantifying the health benefits of climate change mitigation.
