{"Literature Review": "The impacts of climate change on human migration and health are multifaceted and far-reaching. As the global community continues to grapple with the challenges posed by climate change, it is essential to examine the complex relationships between climate-related mobility, health risks, and opportunities for adaptation. This literature review provides an overview of recent research on the climate change–mobility–health nexus, focusing on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries.", "References": [{"title": "Climate Change and Human Migration: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Kerr, J.
