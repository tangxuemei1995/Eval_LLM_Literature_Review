{"Literature Review": "Promoting Health Equity Through Preventing or Mitigating the Effects of Gentrification: A Theoretical and Methodological Guide\n\nGentrification, a process of urban renewal characterized by the influx of affluent residents and businesses, has been increasingly linked to negative health outcomes and exacerbation of health inequities. The rapid increase in public health publications on the health effects of gentrification has highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon. This literature review aims to provide a theoretical and methodological guide for researchers seeking to investigate the relationship between gentrification and health equity.\n\nTheoretical frameworks have long recognized the potential for gentrification to disrupt social and economic structures, leading to increased health inequities (Massey & Denton, 1993). The concept of gentrification as a form of urban renewal has been linked to the displacement of low-income and minority populations, who are often forced to relocate to less desirable neighborhoods (Logan & Molotch, 1987). This displacement can lead to a range of negative health outcomes, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression (Hart & Sallmann, 2004).\n\nDespite the growing body of research on the health effects of gentrification, methodological challenges remain a significant obstacle to understanding this complex phenomenon. Quantitative studies have been criticized for their inability to capture the nuances of gentrification, which often involve complex social and economic processes (Katz, 2016). Qualitative research, on the other hand, has provided valuable insights into the experiences of displaced populations, highlighting the need for more nuanced and contextualized approaches to understanding gentrification (Burgess, 1987).\n\nOne key challenge in integrating gentrification into public health research is the conceptualization of gentrification itself. Researchers have proposed a range of definitions, from the narrow focus on property values and demographic changes (Logan & Molotch, 1987) to more nuanced approaches that consider the social and economic contexts in which gentrification occurs (Katz, 2016). The choice of definition can have significant implications for the design and analysis of research studies.\n\nAnother challenge is the measurement of gentrification, which can be difficult to quantify due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the phenomenon. Researchers have proposed a range of measurement techniques, including the use of census data, property values, and community surveys (Katz, 2016). However, these measures may not capture the full range of gentrification-related outcomes, including displacement, poverty, and health inequities.\n\nIn addition to methodological challenges, there is also a need for more interdisciplinary approaches to understanding gentrification. Researchers from a range of disciplines, including sociology, economics, and public health, can provide valuable insights into the complex social and economic processes that underlie gentrification. By considering the conceptualization of gentrification in measurement techniques and conceiving this process as a direct exposure or as a part of broader neighborhood changes, researchers can develop more nuanced and contextualized approaches to understanding gentrification.\n\nPolicy approaches to mitigating and preventing gentrification are also an important area of research. Researchers have proposed a range of strategies, including community-led development initiatives, affordable housing programs, and zoning regulations (Katz, 2016). However, the effectiveness of these strategies can be difficult to evaluate due to the complex and multifaceted nature of gentrification.\n\nIn conclusion, promoting health equity through preventing or mitigating the effects of gentrification requires a comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon. By considering the theoretical and methodological challenges associated with gentrification, researchers can develop more nuanced and contextualized approaches to understanding the relationship between gentrification and health equity.", "References": [{"title": "The New Urban Poverty", "authors": "Dennis R.
