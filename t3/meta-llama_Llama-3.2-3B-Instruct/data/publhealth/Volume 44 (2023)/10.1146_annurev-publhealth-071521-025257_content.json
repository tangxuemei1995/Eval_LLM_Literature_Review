{"Literature Review": "The implementation of paid family and medical leave (PFML) policies has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years, with a growing body of research examining its impacts on workers' health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. This literature review aims to synthesize the existing evidence on the effects of PFML policies, with a focus on employees who need leave to care for older children, adult family members, or elderly relatives, as well as employers. The review will also discuss the policy parameters that influence the effectiveness of PFML policies and the potential benefits and costs associated with their implementation.", "References": [{"title": "The Impact of Paid Family Leave on Child Health", "authors": "Hunt, A.
