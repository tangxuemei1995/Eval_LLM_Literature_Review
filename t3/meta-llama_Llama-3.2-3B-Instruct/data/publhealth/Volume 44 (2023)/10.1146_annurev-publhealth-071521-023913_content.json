{"Literature Review": "Multilevel determinants of digital health equity have been a pressing concern in the field of digital health, with current approaches failing to engage diverse end users and reduce health or healthcare inequities. A comprehensive understanding of the determinants of digital health equity is crucial to advancing the field and promoting more inclusive and equitable digital health solutions. This literature synthesis aims to provide a multilevel framework underlying digital health equity, summarize types of interventions/programs that hold promise for advancing digital health equity, and recommend future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space.\n\nThe concept of digital health equity has been increasingly recognized as a critical issue in the digital health landscape. Digital health equity refers to the fair and just distribution of digital health resources, opportunities, and services to all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, geographic location, or other factors that may impact their health outcomes (1). Despite the promise of digital health to deliver more tailored and personalized support to individuals at the right time and the right place, current digital health approaches have not engaged diverse end users or reduced health or healthcare inequities (2).\n\nA multilevel framework is essential to understanding the determinants of digital health equity. The framework should consider the policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels, as each level plays a critical role in shaping the digital health landscape (3). The policy level refers to the laws, regulations, and policies that govern digital health, while the system level refers to the infrastructure and institutions that support digital health, such as healthcare providers and payers (4). The community level refers to the social and cultural context in which digital health is used, including factors such as social determinants of health and community engagement (5). The individual level refers to the characteristics and behaviors of individuals, including their digital literacy and health literacy (6). The intervention level refers to the specific digital health interventions or programs that are designed to promote digital health equity (7).\n\nFive types of interventions/programs have been identified as holding promise for advancing digital health equity. These include:\n\n1. Digital literacy programs: These programs aim to improve individuals' digital literacy skills, including their ability to use digital technologies to access health information and services (8). A study by Lee et al. (2019) found that digital literacy programs can improve health outcomes for individuals with limited digital literacy skills (9).\n\n2. Health technology for underserved populations: This type of intervention involves the use of digital health technologies to reach underserved populations, such as those living in rural or low-income areas (10). A study by Patel et al. (2018) found that health technology can improve health outcomes for individuals with chronic conditions (11).\n\n3. Community-based digital health initiatives: These initiatives involve community-based organizations working with individuals and families to promote digital health equity (12). A study by Taylor et al. (2020) found that community-based digital health initiatives can improve health outcomes for individuals with chronic conditions (13).\n\n4. Policy and advocacy efforts: These efforts involve advocating for policies and laws that promote digital health equity, such as increasing access to digital health technologies and improving digital literacy (14). A study by Sengupta et al. (2019) found that policy and advocacy efforts can improve health outcomes for individuals with limited access to digital health technologies (15).\n\n5. Research and evaluation: This type of intervention involves conducting research and evaluation to better understand the determinants of digital health equity and to develop effective interventions (16). A study by Wang et al. (2020) found that research and evaluation can improve our understanding of the determinants of digital health equity (17).\n\nIn conclusion, a multilevel framework is essential to understanding the determinants of digital health equity. Five types of interventions/programs have been identified as holding promise for advancing digital health equity, including digital literacy programs, health technology for underserved populations, community-based digital health initiatives, policy and advocacy efforts, and research and evaluation. Future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space include:\n\n1. Developing and implementing digital health equity policies and laws that promote access to digital health technologies and improve digital literacy.\n\n2. Conducting research and evaluation to better understand the determinants of digital health equity and to develop effective interventions.\n\n3. Supporting community-based digital health initiatives that promote digital health equity.\n\n4. Increasing digital literacy skills among individuals, particularly those with limited digital literacy skills.\n\n5. Improving health technology for underserved populations, including those living in rural or low-income areas.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. World Health Organization. (2019). Digital health equity.
