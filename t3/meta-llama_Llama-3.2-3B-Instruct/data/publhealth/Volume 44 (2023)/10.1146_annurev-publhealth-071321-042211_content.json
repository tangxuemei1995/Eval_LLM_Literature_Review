{"Literature Review": "The relationship between physical activity and public health has been extensively studied, with a significant body of research focusing on the role of choice in promoting physical activity. However, this choice-based model has been criticized for being overly simplistic and neglecting the complex realities of physical activity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these settings, physical activity is often driven by economic necessity, rather than a desire to engage in physical activity for its own sake. This literature review aims to explore the concept of necessity versus choice in the context of physical activity in LMICs, and to discuss the implications of this framework for research, program, and policy development in these settings.Research has shown that in LMICs, physical activity is often a necessary component of daily life, rather than a leisure activity. For example, in many urban areas of LMICs, walking is the primary mode of transportation, and individuals may walk long distances to access basic services, such as markets, schools, and healthcare facilities. This necessity-driven physical activity is often characterized by high levels of intensity and duration, and is closely tied to social and economic contexts.In contrast, the choice-based model of physical activity has been widely adopted in high-income countries, where physical activity is often seen as a leisure activity that individuals can choose to engage in. However, this model has been criticized for being overly individualistic and neglecting the role of social and economic factors in shaping physical activity behaviors. For example, research has shown that in high-income countries, physical activity is often associated with higher socioeconomic status, and that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may be less likely to engage in physical activity due to lack of access to safe and accessible spaces.The necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models framework offers a more nuanced understanding of physical activity in LMICs, and highlights the need for research, program, and policy development that takes into account the complex social and economic contexts in which physical activity occurs. This framework also emphasizes the importance of promoting equity and social justice in physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs.One key implication of the necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models framework is the need to prioritize active transport as a means of promoting physical activity in LMICs. Active transport, such as walking, cycling, and using public transportation, is often the primary mode of transportation in LMICs, and can be an effective way to promote physical activity. However, research has shown that in many LMICs, active transport is often hindered by lack of infrastructure, safety concerns, and limited access to safe and accessible spaces.To promote equity and social justice in physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs, it is essential to prioritize the needs and perspectives of local communities. This may involve working with community leaders and organizations to develop research, program, and policy initiatives that are responsive to local contexts and needs. For example, research has shown that community-based initiatives, such as community-led physical activity programs, can be effective in promoting physical activity and improving health outcomes in LMICs.In conclusion, the necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models framework offers a nuanced understanding of physical activity in LMICs, and highlights the need for research, program, and policy development that takes into account the complex social and economic contexts in which physical activity occurs. By prioritizing active transport and community-based initiatives, and working to promote equity and social justice in physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs, we can help ensure that physical activity is accessible and beneficial for all members of these communities.", "References": [{"title": "Urban planning and physical activity", "authors": "Sarmiento, O.
