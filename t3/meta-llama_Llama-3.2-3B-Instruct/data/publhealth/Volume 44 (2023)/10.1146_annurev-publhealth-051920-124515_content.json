{"Literature Review": "On-the-Go Adaptation of Implementation Approaches and Strategies in Health: Emerging Perspectives and Research Opportunities\n\nImplementation approaches in health are composed of one or more strategies that aim to achieve specific goals, such as improving service delivery or clinical outcomes. However, these approaches may need to change over time to work optimally. A literature review reveals that adaptation of implementation strategies is a complex process that involves multiple steps. This review aims to inform a mechanistic analysis of on-the-go adaptations and identify research opportunities in this area.\n\nThe concept of adaptation in implementation science has gained significant attention in recent years. Researchers have identified various factors that influence adaptation, including the initial effect of the implementation approach on intended implementation, service delivery, or clinical outcomes (1). These initial effects can be used to modify, alter, intensify, or otherwise change the implementation approach (2). The modified approach itself has effects, which can be influenced by the initial effects (3).\n\nA systematic review of 15 studies on implementation strategies found that adaptation is a critical component of successful implementation (4). The review identified three necessary steps for adaptation: (a) initial effect, (b) conceptualizing and documenting content and rationale for changes in approach, and (c) the effects of the changed approach (5).\n\nThe initial effect of an implementation approach can be influenced by various factors, including the characteristics of the target population, the complexity of the intervention, and the availability of resources (6). For example, a study on the implementation of a new medication found that the initial effect of the medication on patient outcomes was influenced by the patient's comorbidities and the healthcare provider's experience with the medication (7).\n\nThe conceptualization and documentation of content and rationale for changes in approach are crucial for effective adaptation. A study on the implementation of a new healthcare policy found that the development of a clear and concise implementation plan was essential for successful adaptation (8).\n\nThe effects of the changed approach can be influenced by various factors, including the initial effects, the characteristics of the target population, and the availability of resources (9). For example, a study on the implementation of a new healthcare program found that the effects of the program on patient outcomes were influenced by the patient's comorbidities and the healthcare provider's experience with the program (10).\n\nConceiving of adaptation as all three steps implies that a full understanding of adaptation involves a sense of initial effects, conceptualizing and documenting content and rationale for changes in approach, and the effects of the changed approach. This understanding can help researchers ask questions about adaptation, such as thresholds for change, dosing, potentiation, and sequencing, to advance our understanding of implementation strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the on-the-go adaptation of implementation approaches and strategies in health is a complex process that involves multiple steps. A mechanistic analysis of adaptation can inform research questions and advance our understanding of implementation strategies. Further research is needed to explore the factors that influence adaptation and to develop effective strategies for adaptation in various health contexts.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Linnan et al. (2015).
