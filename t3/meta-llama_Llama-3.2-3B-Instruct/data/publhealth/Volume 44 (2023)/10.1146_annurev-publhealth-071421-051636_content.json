{"Literature Review": "Public health implications of drought in a climate change context are a pressing concern, with increasing drought severity expected to exacerbate existing health burdens. The relationship between drought and human health is complex, involving multiple pathways and mechanisms. This review aims to critically examine the existing literature on the public health implications of drought in a climate change context, with a focus on the impacts on morbidity and mortality, as well as the factors influencing population resilience.", "References": [{"title": "Climate Change and Human Health: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Kerr, M.
