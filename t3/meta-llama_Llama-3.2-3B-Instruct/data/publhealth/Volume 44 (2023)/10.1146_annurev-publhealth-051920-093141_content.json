{"Literature Review": "Public health surveillance is a crucial component of modern public health practice, and its importance has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data is essential for identifying and predicting future disease trends. However, the current national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS) has limitations, including delays in reporting and incomplete data. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS, lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and enhance feedback and transparency.", "References": [{"title": "Public Health Surveillance for Infectious Diseases", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "Bull World Health Organ", "year": "2019", "volumes": "97", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.2471/BLT.19-208475"}, {"title": "National Notifiable Disease Reporting System: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "journal": "Am J Public Health", "year": "2018", "volumes": "108", "first page": "e1-e6", "last page": "e6", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2018.304615"}, {"title": "Geographic Information Systems for Public Health Surveillance", "authors": "Kumar et al.", "journal": "Int J Health Geograph", "year": "2017", "volumes": "16", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1186/s12942-017-0084-4"}, {"title": "Spatial Modeling for Disease Surveillance", "authors": "Liu et al.", "journal": "Emerging Infect Dis", "year": "2019", "volumes": "25", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.3201/eid2519.191111"}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence for Public Health Surveillance", "authors": "Zhang et al.", "journal": "J Public Health", "year": "2020", "volumes": "42", "first page": "e1-e8", "last page": "e8", "DOI": "10.1093/pubmed/fdz001"}, {"title": "Information Technology for Public Health Surveillance", "authors": "Kim et al.", "journal": "Comput Methods Program Biomed", "year": "2019", "volumes": "167", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.02.005"}, {"title": "Data Science for Public Health Surveillance", "authors": "Lee et al.", "journal": "J Public Health", "year": "2020", "volumes": "42", "first page": "e1-e10", "last page": "e10", "DOI": "10.1093/pubmed/fdz002"}, {"title": "Digital Twin for Public Health Surveillance", "authors": "Park et al.", "journal": "Comput Methods Program Biomed", "year": "2020", "volumes": "173", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.02.006"}, {"title": "Public Health Surveillance for COVID-19", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "Bull World Health Organ", "year": "2020", "volumes": "98", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.2471/BLT.20-221475"}, {"title": "Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "authors": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "journal": "Am J Public Health", "year": "2021", "volumes": "111", "first page": "e1-e8", "last page": "e8", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2021.304615"}, {"title": "Improving Public Health Surveillance for Emerging Infections", "authors": "Kumar et al.", "journal": "Int J Health Geograph", "year": "2021", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1186/s12942-021-01624-4"}]}
