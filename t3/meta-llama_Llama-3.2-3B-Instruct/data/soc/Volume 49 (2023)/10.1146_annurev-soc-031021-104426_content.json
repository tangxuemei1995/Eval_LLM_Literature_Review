{"Literature Review": "The concept of embedded autonomy has been a cornerstone of comparative political economy, particularly in the context of developing countries. This literature review explores the evolution of this concept over the past six decades, from the early 1960s to the present day. We examine the work of the author, focusing on their contributions to the field, including Dependent Development (1979) and Embedded Autonomy (1995). We also discuss recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities, including the development of a 21st century developmental state and counter-hegemonic globalization.The concept of embedded autonomy, first introduced by Evans (1979), refers to the relationship between the state and society in developing countries. It suggests that the state plays a crucial role in mediating the interests of different social groups and promoting economic development. The author's work on embedded autonomy builds on this concept, highlighting the importance of state-society synergies in expanding human capabilities.In the 1990s, the author's work shifted towards the concept of embedded autonomy, which was further developed by Evans (1995). This work emphasized the need for a more nuanced understanding of the state-society relationship in developing countries. The author's research focused on the ways in which the state can promote economic development while also addressing the needs of different social groups.In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the concept of counter-hegemonic globalization. This refers to the idea that globalization can be harnessed to promote progressive social and economic change, rather than simply serving the interests of the wealthy and powerful. The author's work on counter-hegemonic globalization draws on the concept of embedded autonomy, highlighting the importance of state-society synergies in promoting economic development and social justice.One key aspect of counter-hegemonic globalization is the role of transnational advocacy networks. These networks bring together individuals and organizations from different countries and regions to promote progressive social and economic change. The author's research has highlighted the importance of these networks in promoting counter-hegemonic globalization.Another key aspect of counter-hegemonic globalization is the development of a 21st century developmental state. This refers to a state that is capable of promoting economic development while also addressing the needs of different social groups. The author's work on this topic has emphasized the importance of deliberation and state-society synergies in promoting economic development and social justice.In conclusion, the concept of embedded autonomy has been a cornerstone of comparative political economy, particularly in the context of developing countries. The author's work has contributed significantly to this field, highlighting the importance of state-society synergies in promoting economic development and social justice. Recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities, including the development of a 21st century developmental state and counter-hegemonic globalization, have further emphasized the importance of this concept.", "References": [{"title": "Dependent Development", "authors": "P.
