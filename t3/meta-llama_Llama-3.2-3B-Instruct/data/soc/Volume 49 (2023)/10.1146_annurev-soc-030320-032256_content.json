{"Literature Review": "The concept of LGBTQ+ has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals identifying as part of this diverse group. This literature review aims to explore the evolving nature of sexual identities, their intersections with other identities, and the ways in which they are shaped by social, cultural, and economic factors. We examine the theoretical frameworks that underpin our understanding of sexual identity, including the social construction of identity, intersectionality, and the life course. Our analysis draws on recent research that highlights the complexity and diversity of sexual identities, as well as the ways in which they intersect with other identities, such as race and social class. We also consider the life course perspective, which examines how sexual identities develop and evolve over time, including during different life stages and in various relationships.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Construction of Sexual Identity", "authors": "Sedgwick, E.
