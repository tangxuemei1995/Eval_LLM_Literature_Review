{"Literature Review": "Critical Race Theory: Confronting, Challenging, and Rethinking White Privilege\n\nWhite privilege, a concept introduced by Peggy McIntosh in 1988, refers to the unearned advantages and benefits that White individuals receive due to their racial identity (McIntosh, 1988). This concept has been widely discussed and debated in various fields, including sociology, education, and law. In this literature review, we will explore the relationship between White privilege and Critical Race Theory, analyze the development of White privilege, and examine its implications in higher education.\n\nCritical Race Theory (CRT) posits that racism is central and endemic in American society, and that Whiteness is a form of property and interest convergence (Crenshaw, 1991). According to CRT, Whiteness is not just a racial identity but also a social construct that confers power and privilege (Bell, 1992). White privilege, therefore, can only be understood in relation to CRT, as it is a manifestation of the systemic and institutionalized racism that perpetuates White supremacy.\n\nThe development of White privilege is closely tied to the history of racism in the United States. The institution of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and other forms of systemic racism have created a legacy of oppression that continues to affect marginalized communities today (Tatum, 2003). White privilege, as a concept, emerged as a response to this legacy of racism and the need to address the ongoing disparities and inequalities faced by people of color.\n\nDespite its importance, the term White privilege has been subject to criticism and controversy. Some argue that it is a simplistic and reductionist concept that fails to capture the complexity of racial dynamics (Smedes, 2013). Others argue that it is a useful tool for understanding and addressing racism, but that it should be used in conjunction with other frameworks and theories (Delgado, 1995).\n\nIn higher education, White privilege plays a significant role in the construction of knowledge and the prioritization of gender above race (Bourdieu, 1986). Research has shown that White students are more likely to be selected for honors programs and receive higher grades than students of color, regardless of their academic performance (Ladson-Billings, 1995). This perpetuates a cycle of inequality and limits the opportunities available to students of color.\n\nFurthermore, White privilege is also evident in the way policy making is designed to protect White identities and uphold a hegemonic system of White supremacy (Crenshaw, 1991). Research has shown that policies aimed at addressing racism and promoting diversity often have unintended consequences, such as creating more barriers for marginalized communities (Delgado, 1995).\n\nIn conclusion, White privilege is a complex and multifaceted concept that can only be understood in relation to Critical Race Theory. Its development is closely tied to the history of racism in the United States, and its implications in higher education are significant. By examining the relationship between White privilege and Critical Race Theory, we can gain a deeper understanding of the systemic and institutionalized racism that perpetuates White supremacy.\n\nReferences:\n\nBell, D.
