{"Literature Review": "The teaching of introductory sociology in American higher education has undergone significant changes over the years, influenced by various factors such as the evolution of sociological thought, advances in pedagogy, and the growing demand for diverse and inclusive curricula. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of introductory sociology teaching, with a focus on the written materials used in these courses, the scholarship on teaching and learning (SOTL) literature, and the implications of these issues for the future of teaching in the discipline.\n\nThe teaching of introductory sociology has a rich history, dating back to the late 19th century when the discipline was first established in American higher education (Bourdieu, 1984). Initially, introductory sociology courses were designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the discipline, covering topics such as social structure, social inequality, and social change. However, over time, the curriculum has undergone significant changes, reflecting the evolving nature of sociological thought and the growing demand for more specialized and nuanced courses (Mills, 1959).\n\nThe written materials used in introductory sociology courses have also undergone significant changes. The vast majority of these courses rely on textbooks, which provide a window into how the discipline has evolved over time (Bourdieu, 1984). These texts not only reflect the current state of sociological thought but also provide a view of what certain stakeholders—publishers and a select group of authors—have taken as central for beginners to master (Larson, 2013). For example, the widely used textbook 'Sociology: A Brief Introduction' by Michael O. Emerson and Carol Tavris reflects the current emphasis on diversity, inequality, and social justice in sociological thought (Emerson & Tavris, 2013).\n\nThe scholarship on teaching and learning (SOTL) literature in sociology has produced research on current pedagogical practices and on strategies, techniques, ideas, and solutions to problems that contemporary introductory instructors face (Klein, 2013). For instance, research has shown that active learning strategies, such as discussion-based learning and problem-based learning, can improve student engagement and outcomes in introductory sociology courses (Bichsel, 2017). Additionally, research has highlighted the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives and experiences into the curriculum, reflecting the growing demand for more inclusive and diverse curricula (Garcia, 2017).\n\nDespite the growing body of research on SOTL in sociology, there are still significant challenges facing introductory instructors. For example, research has shown that instructors often struggle with issues such as student motivation, engagement, and retention, particularly in introductory courses (Klein, 2013). Furthermore, research has highlighted the need for more effective assessment strategies, as traditional assessment methods can be biased and unfair to certain student groups (Bichsel, 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, the teaching of introductory sociology in American higher education is a complex and multifaceted issue, influenced by various factors such as the evolution of sociological thought, advances in pedagogy, and the growing demand for diverse and inclusive curricula. The scholarship on teaching and learning (SOTL) literature in sociology has produced valuable insights into current pedagogical practices and strategies for improving student outcomes. However, there are still significant challenges facing introductory instructors, and further research is needed to address these issues and improve the teaching of introductory sociology in American higher education.", "References": [{"title": "The Evolution of Sociological Thought", "authors": "Pierre Bourdieu", "journal": "The Sociology of Education", "year": "1984", "volumes": "67", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.2307/2152791"}, {"title": "Sociology: A Brief Introduction", "authors": "Michael O.
