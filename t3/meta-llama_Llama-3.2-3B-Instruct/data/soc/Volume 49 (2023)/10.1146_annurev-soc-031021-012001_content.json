{"Literature Review": "Social isolation is a pervasive and complex phenomenon that affects individuals from diverse backgrounds, with far-reaching consequences for their physical and mental health. A substantial body of research has established a causal link between social isolation and poor health outcomes, including increased mortality risk, dementia, and a range of chronic diseases (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; Seeman et al., 2011). The mechanisms underlying these associations are multifaceted, involving the loss of social support, decreased physical activity, and altered stress responses (Cohen et al., 2015; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). However, the distribution of social isolation is not uniform, with certain populations experiencing disproportionate levels of isolation. For instance, women, particularly those from marginalized groups, are more likely to experience social isolation due to caregiving responsibilities, domestic violence, and socioeconomic disadvantage (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; Seeman et al., 2011). Similarly, racial and ethnic minorities, as well as LGBTQ+ individuals, face unique barriers to social connection, including systemic racism, homophobia, and transphobia (Cohen et al., 2015; Mays et al., 2017). Socioeconomic status also plays a critical role in shaping social isolation, with individuals from lower-income backgrounds experiencing reduced access to social resources, networks, and opportunities for social interaction (Seeman et al., 2011). Despite these findings, research has primarily focused on the consequences of social isolation rather than the structural systems that foster isolation over the life course. A systematic assessment of these systems is essential to understanding the root causes of inequality in social isolation and identifying targeted policy levers to reduce isolation in vulnerable populations. This review aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the existing literature on inequities in social isolation and developing a conceptual framework to guide future research in this area. Our analysis will focus on the intersectional relationships between social isolation, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex factors that contribute to social isolation. By examining the life course dynamics of social isolation, we can identify key periods of vulnerability and develop targeted interventions to reduce isolation and promote health equity. Ultimately, this review seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of social isolation as a health hazard that is both a consequence of and a contributor to health inequities. By addressing the structural systems that foster social isolation, we can work towards reducing health disparities and promoting health equity for all populations.", "References": [{"title": "Social isolation and health: A systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Holt-Lunstad, J., Smith, T.
