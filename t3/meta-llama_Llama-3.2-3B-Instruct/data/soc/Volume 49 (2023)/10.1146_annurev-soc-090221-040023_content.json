{"Literature Review": "The social consequences of forced and refugee migration have been a pressing concern for scholars, policymakers, and communities worldwide. This review aims to provide an overview of the sociological perspectives and research on the outcomes and implications of forced and refugee migration for migrants and communities of settlement. The literature highlights the complexities and nuances of forced and refugee migration, and the need for a social demographic lens to understand the consequences of displacement and settlement. The review will examine the empirical literature on patterns of spatial mobility, health and well-being, social and economic integration, and family and community dynamics at different scales, with a focus on the intersections and lack thereof between forced migration, refugee studies, and migration policy analysis. The implications of global issues such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic will also be considered. This review will provide a comprehensive analysis of the social consequences of forced and refugee migration, and highlight the critical opportunities for contributions by sociologists and social scientists more generally.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Consequences of Forced Migration", "authors": "Kerr, R.
