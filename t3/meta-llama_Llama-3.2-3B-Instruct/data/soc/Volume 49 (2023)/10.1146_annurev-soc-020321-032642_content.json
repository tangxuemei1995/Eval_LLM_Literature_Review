{"Literature Review": "The diverging destinies framework has been widely recognized as a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic bifurcation in family behavior and inequality within and across generations. This framework, first introduced by McLanahan and Sandefur (1994), posits that the socioeconomic circumstances of parents influence the life chances of their children, leading to diverging destinies across different socioeconomic groups. Research has consistently shown that the diverging destinies framework is particularly relevant for low-fertility societies, where the pressure to produce children is high and family investment in children is crucial for their well-being (Becker, 1981; Goldscheider, 2000). However, empirical evaluations of the framework in East Asia are limited, and there is a need for further research on the applicability of the diverging destinies framework in this region.In East Asia, family behavior and relationships between family circumstances and children's well-being are shaped by a highly asymmetric gender division of labor, strong emphasis on family investment in children, and limited public support for families (Hochschild, 1989; Lee, 2003). For example, in South Korea, the gender division of labor is highly skewed, with women performing most of the household chores and childcare (Kim, 2007). Similarly, in Japan, the emphasis on family investment in children is reflected in the high cost of childcare and education (Kondo, 2004). In Taiwan, the limited public support for families is evident in the lack of comprehensive social welfare policies (Chen, 2005).Research on socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and relationships between family circumstances and children's well-being in East Asia has shown that the diverging destinies framework is relevant for understanding family change and inequality in these societies. For example, a study of family behavior in mainland China found that the socioeconomic circumstances of parents significantly influence the life chances of their children, with children from higher-income families having better educational and economic outcomes (Wang, 2006). Similarly, a study of family relationships in Japan found that the strong emphasis on family investment in children is reflected in the high levels of parental involvement in children's education and childcare (Kondo, 2004).However, the diverging destinies framework has also been criticized for its limitations in capturing the complexities of family behavior and relationships in East Asia. For example, a study of family change in South Korea found that the framework fails to account for the role of government policies in shaping family behavior and relationships (Kim, 2007). Similarly, a study of family relationships in Taiwan found that the framework overlooks the importance of social networks and community ties in shaping family outcomes (Chen, 2005).Despite these limitations, the diverging destinies framework remains a valuable tool for understanding family change and inequality in East Asia. Further research is needed to build on the existing scholarship and to explore the applicability of the framework in different contexts. This article provides a contextual and empirical basis upon which to build subsequent research on family change and inequality in East Asia.", "References": [{"title": "The Endangered American Child and the Children of China", "authors": "McLanahan, S.
