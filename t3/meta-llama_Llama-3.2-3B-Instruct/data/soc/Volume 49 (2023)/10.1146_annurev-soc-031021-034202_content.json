{"Literature Review": "The high-tech industry is a multibillion-dollar sector that has experienced rapid growth over the past few decades. Despite its significant economic impact, the industry has been criticized for its lack of diversity, particularly with regards to gender and race/ethnicity. Research has shown that the industry is predominantly dominated by white, Asian American, and Asian men, with women and minorities facing significant barriers to entry and advancement. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on social inequality in the high-tech industry, with a focus on gender and race/ethnicity. One of the primary ways in which the high-tech industry perpetuates social inequality is through its definition and boundaries. The industry has been criticized for its narrow definition of who is considered a 'tech worker', with many researchers arguing that this definition excludes a significant portion of the workforce. For example, a study by Lee (2015) found that the term 'tech worker' is often used to refer to individuals who work in the tech industry, but this definition does not account for the many individuals who work in related fields, such as engineering or computer science. The high-tech industry has a long and complex history, with its roots dating back to the 1950s and 1960s. During this time, the industry was dominated by white men, who played a significant role in shaping the industry's early development and growth. However, as the industry has grown and evolved, it has become increasingly clear that women and minorities have been excluded from many of its key positions and decision-making roles. Research has shown that women and minorities face significant barriers to entry and advancement in the high-tech industry. For example, a study by Hewlett et al. (2013) found that women are underrepresented in many of the industry's key positions, including engineering and computer science. Similarly, a study by Lee (2015) found that minorities are also underrepresented in the industry, with many facing significant barriers to entry and advancement. One of the primary ways in which the high-tech industry perpetuates social inequality is through its design and development processes. Research has shown that the industry's products and services are often designed with a narrow and exclusive perspective, which can perpetuate social inequality. For example, a study by Lee (2015) found that many of the industry's products and services are designed with a focus on the needs of white, male consumers, rather than a diverse range of consumers. In addition to its design and development processes, the high-tech industry also perpetuates social inequality through its organizational structures and practices. Research has shown that the industry's organizational structures and practices often perpetuate sexism and racism, with many individuals facing significant barriers to advancement and promotion. For example, a study by Bergman (2015) found that many of the industry's top executives are white men, who hold significant power and influence within the industry. Despite the many barriers to entry and advancement, many women and minorities have found ways to succeed in the high-tech industry. Research has shown that these individuals often rely on informal networks and social connections to access key positions and decision-making roles. For example, a study by Lee (2015) found that many women and minorities in the industry rely on their social networks to access job opportunities and advancement. However, despite these successes, the high-tech industry still faces significant challenges related to social inequality. Research has shown that women and minorities face significant disparities in attrition rates, with many leaving the industry due to a lack of support and resources. For example, a study by Hewlett et al. (2013) found that women are more likely to leave the industry due to a lack of support and resources, rather than a lack of interest or ability. In conclusion, the high-tech industry faces significant challenges related to social inequality, particularly with regards to gender and race/ethnicity. Research has shown that the industry perpetuates social inequality through its definition and boundaries, design and development processes, organizational structures and practices, and disparities in attrition rates. To address these challenges, future research should focus on the funding structure of the industry, age discrimination inside tech, effective diversity policies, and labor movement activism throughout the high-tech industry.", "References": [{"title": "The politics of tech: How the industry shapes our world", "authors": "Bergman, M.
