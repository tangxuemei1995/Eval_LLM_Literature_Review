{"Literature Review": "The legitimacy of science is a multifaceted concept that has been extensively studied in various disciplines, including sociology, philosophy, and science studies. The current global crises, such as the pandemic and climate change, have highlighted the importance of science and its policy in addressing these challenges. However, the legitimacy of science is not immune to challenges, both internal and external. This review aims to interrogate the concept of science as culture in the context of a fragmented and polarized social environment, and the idea that scientific knowledge and expertise are experiencing a legitimacy crisis.\n\nInternal threats to the legitimacy of science include fraud, replicability, knowledge diffusion, and equability. These issues can undermine the credibility of scientific research and its applications. Additionally, disciplinary fragmentation and overproduction of research can lead to a proliferation of conflicting findings and interpretations, further eroding the legitimacy of science.\n\nExternal threats to the legitimacy of science are equally significant. Polarization, authoritarianism, and religious beliefs can all impact the public's perception of science and its role in society. The increasing influence of information technology and economic capital can also shape the direction of scientific research and its applications.\n\nThe sociology of science is uniquely positioned to study these composite issues, but it also faces its own legitimacy crisis. The field has been criticized for its lack of diversity, its focus on Western epistemologies, and its failure to engage with non-Western perspectives. Furthermore, the increasing commercialization of science and the growing influence of industry on scientific research have raised concerns about the integrity of scientific inquiry.\n\nThe concept of science as culture is particularly relevant in the context of a fragmented and polarized social environment. Science is not just a neutral, objective pursuit of knowledge, but a cultural practice that is shaped by social, historical, and institutional factors. The legitimacy of science is therefore not just a matter of its technical merits, but also of its cultural relevance and its ability to engage with the broader public.\n\nIn conclusion, the legitimacy of science is a complex and multifaceted concept that is shaped by both internal and external factors. The current global crises have highlighted the importance of science and its policy in addressing these challenges, but they have also underscored the need for a more nuanced understanding of the legitimacy of science. By interrogating science as culture in the context of a fragmented and polarized social environment, we can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges facing science and its policy, and develop more effective strategies for promoting the legitimacy of science.", "References": [{"title": "The Matthew Effect in Science", "authors": "Robert K.
