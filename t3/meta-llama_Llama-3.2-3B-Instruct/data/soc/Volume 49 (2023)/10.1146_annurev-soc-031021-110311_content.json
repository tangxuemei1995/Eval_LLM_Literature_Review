{"Literature Review": "The study of neighborhood-school structures has garnered significant attention in recent years, as researchers have sought to understand the complex interplay between these two social contexts and their impact on children's outcomes. While separate literatures have estimated the effects of neighborhoods and schools on various outcomes, a growing body of research has acknowledged the importance of considering both contexts jointly. This review synthesizes the results from these studies and critiques the tendency to evaluate which context matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes, and argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood-school structures.", "References": [{"title": "The Neighborhood Effect on Children's Educational Outcomes", "authors": "J.
