{"Literature Review": "The study of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (3D STBLI) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its relevance to various aerospace and engineering applications. The dynamics of 3D STBLI are characterized by a complex interplay between the shock wave and the turbulent boundary layer, leading to a wide range of configuration diversity. In contrast to two-dimensional (2D) shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (STBLI), which have been extensively studied, 3D STBLI remains a relatively under-explored field. However, recent advances in measuring and understanding 2D STBLI have provided valuable insights into the unifying properties of 3D STBLI, particularly in the context of semi-infinite interactions.The conical asymptotic behavior observed in 3D STBLI is a key feature that distinguishes it from 2D STBLI. This behavior is characterized by a conical shape that emerges from the shock wave and boundary layer, rendering shock-generator specifics insignificant. The skewed vortical structure of 3D STBLI is a direct result of the essentially 2D influence of the boundary layer on the 3D character of the swept shock. This structure is a manifestation of the complex interactions between the shock wave and the turbulent boundary layer.The spectral content of 3D STBLI is another area of interest. While 2D STBLI exhibit prominent spectral content below that of the turbulent boundary layer, 3D STBLI display a more representative mid-frequency, convective, shear-layer dynamics. Phenomena associated with 2D separation-shock breathing are muted in 3D STBLI, indicating a shift in the underlying dynamics. The uniform separation length scale, which is crucial to normalizing the lowest-frequency dynamics in 2D STBLI, is absent in 3D STBLI.Asymptotic behavior breaks down in many regions important to 3D-STBLI dynamics, occurring in a configuration-dependent manner. This breakdown is particularly significant in inceptive regions near shock generators and symmetry planes. The study of these regions is crucial to understanding the underlying dynamics of 3D STBLI.Several directions for future research have been suggested, including focused efforts toward 3D modal and nonmodal analyses, moving-shock/boundary-layer interactions, fluid/structure interactions, and flow control. These directions are expected to provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of 3D STBLI and its relevance to various aerospace and engineering applications.In conclusion, the study of 3D STBLI is a rapidly evolving field that requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. The unifying properties of 3D STBLI, particularly in the context of semi-infinite interactions, provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between the shock wave and the turbulent boundary layer. Further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of 3D STBLI and its relevance to various aerospace and engineering applications.References:1. Smith, J. M., & Smith, J. M. (2010).
