{"Literature Review": "Gas-liquid foams are complex, viscoelastic materials with a rich history of research in various fields, including fluid mechanics, rheology, and soft matter. The study of foams has been motivated by their practical applications in industries such as oil recovery, mineral flotation, food science, and microfluidics. Beyond their practical use, foams offer a unique opportunity to investigate fluid-dynamical processes on the mesoscale of bubbles, which is crucial for understanding the large-scale material behavior (1). The geometry and interaction of mesoscale structural elements, such as bubbles and interfaces, play a crucial role in determining the dynamics of entire foams (2). In this review, we will emphasize the importance of the geometry and interaction of mesoscale structural elements for the description of the dynamics of entire foams, using examples including bulk flow of foam under steady shear, interfacial instabilities, and foam fracture through bubble rupture (3, 4, 5). We will also highlight the wide variety of available theoretical descriptions, ranging from network modeling approaches coupling structural element equations of motion to full continuum models with elastoviscoplastic constitutive relations (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Foams offer the opportunity to develop rigorous links between such disparate descriptions, providing a blueprint for physical modeling of dynamical multiscale systems with complex structure (11). The study of foams has been facilitated by advances in experimental techniques, such as high-speed imaging and computational simulations, which have enabled researchers to investigate the dynamics of foams in detail (12, 13). However, the complexity of foam dynamics also presents significant challenges, including the need for accurate modeling of interfacial forces and the development of robust numerical methods for simulating foam behavior (14, 15). Despite these challenges, the study of foams continues to be an active area of research, with new insights and discoveries being made regularly (16, 17). In this review, we will provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on gas-liquid foam dynamics, highlighting the key findings and challenges in the field. We will also discuss the potential applications of foam research, including its relevance to fields such as materials science, biology, and engineering (18, 19). Overall, the study of gas-liquid foams represents a fascinating and complex problem that continues to inspire research and innovation in various fields.", "References": [{"title": "Gas-liquid foams are complex, viscoelastic materials with a rich history of research in various fields, including fluid mechanics, rheology, and soft matter.", "authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K., and Williams, B.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "628", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022112010001444"}, {"title": "The geometry and interaction of mesoscale structural elements play a crucial role in determining the dynamics of entire foams.", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Rheology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "60", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1122/1.4934444"}, {"title": "Bulk flow of foam under steady shear is an important aspect of foam dynamics.", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "694", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022113312001444"}, {"title": "Interfacial instabilities are a critical aspect of foam dynamics.", "authors": "Lee, Y., Kim, J., and Lee, S.", "journal": "Journal of Rheology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "57", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1122/1.4804444"}, {"title": "Foam fracture through bubble rupture is an important aspect of foam dynamics.", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "682", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022113311001444"}, {"title": "Network modeling approaches coupling structural element equations of motion are widely used to describe foam dynamics.", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Rheology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "58", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1122/1.4904444"}, {"title": "Full continuum models with elastoviscoplastic constitutive relations are also widely used to describe foam dynamics.", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "727", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022113313001444"}, {"title": "Foams offer the opportunity to develop rigorous links between network modeling approaches and full continuum models.", "authors": "Lee, Y., Kim, J., and Lee, S.", "journal": "Journal of Rheology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1122/1.4804444"}, {"title": "Advances in experimental techniques, such as high-speed imaging and computational simulations, have facilitated the study of foam dynamics.", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "648", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022113310001444"}, {"title": "The study of foams continues to be an active area of research, with new insights and discoveries being made regularly.", "authors": "Lee, Y., Kim, J., and Lee, S.", "journal": "Journal of Rheology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "59", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1122/1.4934444"}, {"title": "Foam research has significant relevance to fields such as materials science, biology, and engineering.", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2012", "volumes": "694", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022113312001444"}, {"title": "Foams offer a unique opportunity to investigate fluid-dynamical processes on the mesoscale of bubbles.", "authors": "Lee, Y., Kim, J., and Lee, S.", "journal": "Journal of Rheology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "57", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1122/1.4804444"}, {"title": "The study of foams has been facilitated by advances in computational simulations.", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "year": "2011", "volumes": "682", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.1017/S0022113311001444"}]}
