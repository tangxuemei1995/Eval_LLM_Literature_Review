{"Literature Review": "Fluid mechanics in France in the first half of the twentieth century was a period marked by significant contributions from French scientists, despite the prevailing perception that their work was modest. This review aims to rectify this misconception by highlighting the achievements of French researchers in the field of fluid mechanics during this period. The establishment of the French Air Ministry's Institutes of Fluid Mechanics and teaching centers in faculties of science in the 1930s played a crucial role in fostering this growth. This paper will examine the key figures and institutions involved in these achievements, and explore the social and cultural context in which they worked. The review will also discuss the impact of these contributions on the development of fluid mechanics as a field, and their significance in the broader context of international relationships and the creation of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) in 1946.", "References": [{"title": "A History of Fluid Mechanics", "authors": "J.
