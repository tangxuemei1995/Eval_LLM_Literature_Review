{"Literature Review": "The world's oceans are facing unprecedented threats due to human activities, particularly industrial fishing, which has severe impacts on marine biodiversity (1). The importance of fisheries in providing food for the world's population cannot be overstated, but the negative consequences of overfishing and destructive fishing practices have become increasingly evident (2). To address these issues, civil society requires access to comprehensive and accurate fisheries data, which is essential for informing policy decisions and promoting sustainable fishing practices (3). However, the official fisheries statistics supplied by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have been criticized for their deficiencies, particularly in underestimating small-scale fisheries (4). This article documents the creation of a database and website that provides reconstructed catch data by ecosystem, country, species, gear type, commercial value, and other indicators, which can be accessed by anyone interested in fisheries data (5). The database is based on the geographically coarse FAO data and aims to provide a more comprehensive picture of global fisheries, including small-scale fisheries (6). The reconstructed catch data can be used to track changes in fishing patterns, monitor the impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems, and inform policy decisions (7). The website also provides catch-derived indicators, such as the total catch and the catch per unit effort, which can be used to assess the sustainability of fisheries (8). The database and website can serve as a valuable resource for civil society, researchers, and policymakers, providing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of global fisheries (9). The use of open data and data science approaches can help to promote transparency, accountability, and sustainability in fisheries management (10). Overall, the creation of the Sea Around Us database and website represents a significant step towards addressing the challenges facing global fisheries and promoting sustainable fishing practices (11).", "References": [{"title": "The impact of industrial fishing on marine biodiversity", "authors": "M.
