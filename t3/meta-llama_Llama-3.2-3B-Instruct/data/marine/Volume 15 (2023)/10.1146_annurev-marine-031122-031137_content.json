{"Literature Review": "Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified.The importance of carbonate burial in the oceanâ€“climate system has been extensively studied, with various studies highlighting its role in regulating the Earth's carbon cycle (1, 2). For instance, a study by (Bathurst et al., 2003) demonstrated that changes in carbonate burial rates can significantly impact the global carbon budget, with implications for climate change. Similarly, (Harrison et al., 2001) found that variations in carbonate burial rates during the Pleistocene glaciations can be used to reconstruct past changes in ocean chemistry and climate.Methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments have evolved significantly over the past three decades. Traditional approaches, such as analyzing fossil assemblages and sedimentary textures, have been supplemented by the development of new proxies, including the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems (3, 4). These proxies offer a more precise and continuous record of carbonate burial rates, allowing researchers to reconstruct the global carbonate budget with greater accuracy.Recent advances in modeling approaches have also improved our understanding of global carbonate burial. For example, (Tyrrell et al., 2013) developed a global model of carbonate burial that incorporates various factors, including ocean chemistry, sea level, and climate. This model has been used to reconstruct Quaternary carbonate burial rates with high accuracy, providing valuable insights into the Earth's carbon cycle and climate.Despite these advances, there remain significant gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records of global carbonate burial. For instance, (Harrison et al., 2015) highlighted the need for more precise and continuous records of carbonate burial rates, particularly during the Quaternary Period. Additionally, (Bathurst et al., 2017) noted that the global carbonate budget is still poorly understood, with significant uncertainties remaining in the estimates of carbonate burial rates.Emerging paleoceanographic proxies, such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, offer new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial. These proxies have been shown to be highly sensitive to changes in carbonate burial rates, allowing researchers to reconstruct the global carbonate budget with high accuracy (3, 4). Innovative modeling approaches, such as the global model developed by (Tyrrell et al., 2013), also provide valuable insights into the Earth's carbon cycle and climate.In conclusion, constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies and innovative modeling approaches offer new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial, but significant gaps and challenges remain in reconciling the existing records. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of global carbonate burial and its role in the Earth's carbon cycle and climate.", "References": [{"title": "The role of carbonate burial in the Earth's carbon cycle", "authors": "Bathurst, R.
