{"Literature Review": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is a rapidly emerging concept that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the pressing need to mitigate the effects of climate change. The ocean plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and augmenting its carbon sequestration capacity could be a powerful mechanism for removing legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. From a technical perspective, OCDR approaches can be broadly categorized into three main types: direct air capture and utilization (DACU), chemical looping combustion (CLC), and ocean fertilization (OF). Despite the potential of OCDR, there are several key financial concerns that need to be addressed. These include the high upfront costs of implementing OCDR technologies, the potential for negative externalities, and the need for long-term financing mechanisms. Social issues also play a crucial role in OCDR decision-making. Public perceptions of OCDR can be influenced by factors such as the potential impacts on marine ecosystems, the availability of data on the effectiveness of OCDR technologies, and the potential for negative externalities. Underlying ethical debates and concerns also need to be addressed in OCDR decision-making. These include questions about the distribution of benefits and costs, the potential for unequal access to OCDR technologies, and the need for transparency and accountability. In conclusion, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Technical assessments of OCDR approaches need to take into account the potential financial concerns, social issues, and underlying ethical debates and concerns. By addressing these considerations, we can ensure that OCDR is deployed in a way that is equitable, transparent, and accountable.", "References": [{"title": "Ocean fertilization: A review of the current state of the science", "authors": "Bates, N.
