{"Literature Review": "The deep ocean's water column, extending below 200 m, is a vast and largely unexplored habitat that harbors approximately 70% of the prokaryotic biomass in the oceanic water column. This region is characterized by extreme conditions, including low temperatures, increasing hydrostatic pressure, and decreasing organic matter supply with depth. Despite these challenges, recent advances in microbial oceanography have significantly improved our understanding of the ecology of prokaryotes in the dark ocean. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge on the ecology of prokaryotes in the deep ocean, focusing on biomass distribution, heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic production, phylogenetic and functional diversity, and the molecular adaptations of piezophilic prokaryotes to high hydrostatic pressure. Prokaryotes are the primary producers and consumers in the deep ocean, playing a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles. The majority of prokaryotic biomass in the deep ocean is composed of bacteria and archaea, which are capable of surviving in extreme conditions. Bacteria, such as those belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, are known to thrive in deep-sea environments, where they can utilize organic matter and participate in the decomposition process. In contrast, archaea, such as those belonging to the phylum Euryarchaeota, are more commonly associated with chemolithoautotrophic processes, where they use inorganic compounds as energy sources. The distribution of prokaryotic biomass in the deep ocean is influenced by various factors, including temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. Studies have shown that prokaryotic biomass is highest in the mesopelagic zone, where sunlight is still present, and decreases with depth. However, recent studies have revealed that prokaryotes can also thrive in the bathypelagic zone, where sunlight is scarce. Heterotrophic prokaryotes, which obtain energy by consuming organic matter, are abundant in the deep ocean. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the decomposition process, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients. Chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotes, which use inorganic compounds as energy sources, are also present in the deep ocean, where they participate in the cycling of essential nutrients. Phylogenetic and functional diversity of prokaryotes in the deep ocean is vast and complex. Recent studies have revealed that prokaryotes in the deep ocean are closely related to those found in surface waters, suggesting a high degree of connectivity between these environments. However, the deep ocean is also home to unique and endemic prokaryotic species, which have evolved to occupy specific ecological niches. Piezophilic prokaryotes, which are capable of surviving in high hydrostatic pressure, are a key component of the deep ocean ecosystem. These microorganisms have evolved unique molecular adaptations, such as increased cell membrane fluidity and specialized enzymes, to cope with the extreme pressure conditions. Recent studies have revealed that piezophilic prokaryotes play a crucial role in the cycling of nutrients and the decomposition process in the deep ocean. Despite the significant advances in our understanding of prokaryotes in the deep ocean, there are still many knowledge gaps in this field. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the ecology of prokaryotes in the dark ocean and their role in the biogeochemical cycles in the largest habitat of the biosphere. In conclusion, the deep ocean's water column is a vast and complex habitat that harbors a diverse range of prokaryotic life. Recent advances in microbial oceanography have significantly improved our understanding of the ecology of prokaryotes in the dark ocean, highlighting their importance in the biogeochemical cycles and the cycling of nutrients. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the ecology of prokaryotes in the deep ocean and their role in the largest habitat of the biosphere.", "References": [{"title": "Prokaryotic diversity in the deep sea", "authors": "Whitman, W.
