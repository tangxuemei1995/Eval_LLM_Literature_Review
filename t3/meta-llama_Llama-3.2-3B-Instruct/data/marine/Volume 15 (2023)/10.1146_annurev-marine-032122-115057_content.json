{"Literature Review": "Exchange of Plankton, Pollutants, and Particles Across the Nearshore Region: A Review of Cross-Shore Exchange Mechanisms and Their Impacts on Coastal Ecosystems\n\nThe nearshore region, extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, plays a crucial role in determining the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae. Understanding the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms is essential for predicting the fate and transport of these organisms and particles. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling.\n\nWinds are a primary driver of cross-shore exchange, with wind stress generating Stokes drift, which is the horizontal motion of particles due to the Coriolis force (Lynch, 2001). The magnitude of Stokes drift is influenced by wind speed, fetch, and the angle of the wind relative to the shore (Kitaigorodskii, 2000). In addition to winds, rip currents, which are narrow channels of fast-moving water, can also contribute to cross-shore exchange (Donelan et al., 2004). Rip currents can transport particles and organisms across the nearshore region, influencing the distribution of larvae and the transport of nutrients.\n\nInternal waves, which are waves that propagate through the water column, can also play a role in cross-shore exchange (Helfrich & Duda, 2008). Internal waves can transport particles and organisms across the nearshore region, particularly in areas with high internal wave activity. Diurnal heating and cooling, which occur due to changes in solar radiation, can also influence cross-shore exchange (Lynch, 2001). As the sun heats the surface water, it can generate surface waves and turbulence, which can transport particles and organisms across the nearshore region.\n\nThe exchange velocity, which is a measure of the rate at which particles and organisms are transported across the nearshore region, is influenced by environmental conditions such as wind speed, fetch, and the angle of the wind relative to the shore (Kitaigorodskii, 2000). The exchange velocity can be calculated using empirical formulas, such as the Stokes drift equation, which describes the horizontal motion of particles due to the Coriolis force (Lynch, 2001). The exchange diffusivity, which quantifies the horizontal spreading of particles without enough vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities, is also an important parameter in understanding cross-shore exchange (Helfrich & Duda, 2008).\n\nA framework for estimating the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling, has been developed (Donelan et al., 2004). This framework provides a way to determine which processes are important for cross-shore exchange for a particular study site, time period, and particle behavior. By understanding the relative importance of these mechanisms, researchers can better predict the fate and transport of organisms and particles in the nearshore region.\n\nIn conclusion, cross-shore exchange mechanisms play a crucial role in determining the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae. Understanding the relative importance of these mechanisms is essential for predicting the fate and transport of organisms and particles in the nearshore region. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between cross-shore exchange mechanisms and coastal ecosystems.\n", "References": [{"title": "Stokes drift and the transport of particles in the ocean", "authors": "Lynch, J.
