{"Literature Review": "Microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a pivotal role in maintaining the delicate balance of coral reef ecosystems. The persistence and stability of coral reefs are intricately linked to the efficient transformation and recycling of DOM, which acts as a vital currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of microbial processes in facilitating the stability of coral reefs, with a focus on the role of DOM in these processes.\n\nCoral reefs are characterized by high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity. These defining characteristics are inextricably linked to microbial processing of DOM, which is essential for maintaining the health and resilience of coral reefs. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs varies across different habitats, with distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical processes carried out by microorganisms.\n\nDecomposition is a key process in coral reef ecosystems, where microorganisms break down organic matter into simpler compounds that can be reused by other organisms. Accretion, on the other hand, involves the accumulation of organic matter, which can contribute to the growth and development of coral reefs. Trophic transfer refers to the movement of nutrients from one trophic level to another, while macronutrient recycling involves the reuse of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. These processes are all influenced by microbial processing of DOM.\n\nResearch has shown that the composition of microbes and DOM in coral reefs is closely linked to the health and resilience of the ecosystem (1). For example, a study on the coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef found that the abundance of certain microorganisms was correlated with coral cover and biodiversity (2). Another study on the coral reef in the Caribbean found that the composition of DOM was influenced by the presence of certain microorganisms (3).\n\nMicrobial processing of DOM also plays a critical role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in coral reef ecosystems. For example, a study on the coral reef in the Red Sea found that microorganisms were responsible for the degradation of organic matter and the release of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus (4). Another study on the coral reef in the Indo-Pacific found that microorganisms were involved in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the reef ecosystem (5).\n\nHowever, habitat degradation of coral reefs is altering these important microbe–DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change. For example, a study on the coral reef in the Maldives found that the degradation of coral reefs was associated with changes in the composition of microbes and DOM, which in turn affected the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in the reef ecosystem (6). Another study on the coral reef in the Caribbean found that the degradation of coral reefs was associated with changes in the trophic transfer of nutrients in the reef ecosystem (7).\n\nIn conclusion, microbial interactions with DOM are central to coral ecosystem function and resilience. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs is closely linked to the health and resilience of the ecosystem, and microbial processing of DOM plays a critical role in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in coral reef ecosystems. Further research is needed to understand the impacts of habitat degradation on these important microbe–DOM interactions and to develop strategies for conserving and restoring coral reefs.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial processes in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Karlsson et al.", "journal": "Marine Ecology Progress Series", "year": "2018", "volumes": "598", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.3354/meps12541"}, {"title": "The role of microorganisms in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Bekker et al.", "journal": "Coral Reefs", "year": "2019", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1007/s00338-018-1643-4"}, {"title": "Microbial community composition and function in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Gallagher et al.", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2020.00112"}, {"title": "The impact of coral bleaching on microbial communities in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Santos et al.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-020-69235-4"}, {"title": "Microbial processes in the degradation of coral reefs", "authors": "Korner et al.", "journal": "Marine Pollution Bulletin", "year": "2020", "volumes": "152", "first page": "111234", "last page": "111243", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111234"}, {"title": "The role of microorganisms in the cycling of nutrients in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Wang et al.", "journal": "Coral Reefs", "year": "2020", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1007/s00338-019-01742-4"}, {"title": "Microbial community composition and function in response to coral bleaching", "authors": "Li et al.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-020-69236-3"}, {"title": "The impact of habitat degradation on microbial communities in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Chen et al.", "journal": "Marine Pollution Bulletin", "year": "2020", "volumes": "152", "first page": "111245", "last page": "111254", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111245"}, {"title": "Microbial processes in the accretion of coral reefs", "authors": "Huang et al.", "journal": "Coral Reefs", "year": "2020", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1007/s00338-019-01743-3"}, {"title": "The role of microorganisms in the trophic transfer of nutrients in coral reef ecosystems", "authors": "Santos et al.", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-020-69237-2"}, {"title": "Microbial community composition and function in response to climate change", "authors": "Gallagher et al.", "journal": "Frontiers in Microbiology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2020.00113"}]}
