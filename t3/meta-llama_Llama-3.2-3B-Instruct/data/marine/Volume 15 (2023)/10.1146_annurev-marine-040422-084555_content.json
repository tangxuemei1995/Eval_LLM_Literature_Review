{"Literature Review": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) is a complex phenomenon that has been extensively studied in recent decades. Traditionally, PDV has been defined as statistical patterns of variance, which reflect the ocean's integration of atmospheric forcing. However, these patterns do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. Research has shown that PDV is characterized by two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific–central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. The NP-CP mode captures interannual- to decadal-scale variability, while the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific. The primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV are two-way tropical–extratropical teleconnection dynamics. These dynamics involve the interaction between the tropics and the extratropics, with the Pacific Ocean playing a crucial role in mediating these interactions. The Pacific Ocean's role in PDV is further supported by research on ocean–atmosphere teleconnections, which highlight the importance of the ocean's thermocline and thermohaline circulation in driving PDV. In addition to teleconnections, coupled feedbacks between the atmosphere and ocean also play a key role in PDV. These feedbacks involve the interaction between the atmosphere and ocean in response to changes in the climate system, with the Pacific Ocean's thermocline and thermohaline circulation being critical components of these feedbacks. Research has also shown that PDV is closely linked to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with the Pacific Ocean's thermocline and thermohaline circulation playing a key role in the development and maintenance of ENSO. The relationship between PDV and ENSO highlights the importance of considering the complex interactions between the atmosphere and ocean in understanding PDV. In conclusion, PDV is a complex phenomenon that is driven by a range of dynamical processes, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks. The two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes of PDV, the NP-CP and KOE modes, highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between the atmosphere and ocean in understanding PDV. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms driving PDV and its relationship to ENSO and other climate phenomena.", "References": [{"title": "Trenberth, K. E. (1997).
