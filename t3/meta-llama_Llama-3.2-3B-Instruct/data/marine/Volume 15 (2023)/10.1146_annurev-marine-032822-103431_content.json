{"Literature Review": "Iron isotopes have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the complex biogeochemical processes that govern the ocean's iron cycle. The micronutrient iron plays a critical role in setting the magnitude and distribution of primary production across the global ocean, and its internal cycling processes are essential for understanding the global carbon cycle and climate. This review aims to summarize the end-member isotope signatures of different iron source fluxes and highlight the novel insights into iron provenance gained using this tracer. We will also review ways in which iron isotope fractionation might be used to understand internal oceanic cycling of iron, including speciation changes, biological uptake, and particle scavenging. Our discussion will be grounded in a comprehensive review of the existing literature, with a focus on the GEOTRACES project, which has provided a framework for understanding the global ocean's biogeochemical cycles.The ocean's iron cycle is driven by a complex interplay of sources, sinks, and internal cycling processes. Dust, sediments, and hydrothermal vents are recognized as key sources of iron to the ocean. Dust, in particular, is thought to be a major source of iron to the ocean, with estimates suggesting that up to 50% of the ocean's iron input comes from terrestrial sources. Sediments, on the other hand, are thought to be a significant sink for iron, with iron-rich sediments playing a key role in the ocean's iron budget.Iron isotopic analyses have emerged as a transformative tool for diagnosing iron sources to the ocean and tracing biogeochemical processes. By analyzing the isotopic composition of iron in seawater, researchers can identify the source of iron and track its movement through the ocean. This approach has been used to study the iron cycle in the North Atlantic Ocean, where it has been shown that dust is a major source of iron. Similarly, iron isotopic analyses have been used to study the iron cycle in the Southern Ocean, where it has been shown that sediments are a significant sink for iron.In addition to identifying sources and sinks, iron isotopic analyses can also be used to understand internal oceanic cycling of iron. Iron isotope fractionation can be used to study speciation changes, biological uptake, and particle scavenging. For example, studies have shown that iron isotope fractionation can be used to study the speciation of iron in seawater, with implications for our understanding of the ocean's iron budget. Similarly, iron isotope fractionation has been used to study biological uptake of iron, with implications for our understanding of the ocean's primary production.Despite the many advances that have been made in the field of iron isotopic analysis, there is still much to be learned. Future research is needed to expand the utilization of this cutting-edge tracer. One area of focus should be on improving the precision and accuracy of iron isotope measurements. This could involve the development of new analytical techniques or the use of existing techniques to improve data quality. Another area of focus should be on expanding the range of iron isotopes that can be analyzed. This could involve the development of new methods for analyzing iron isotopes or the use of existing methods to analyze a wider range of isotopes.In conclusion, iron isotopes have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the complex biogeochemical processes that govern the ocean's iron cycle. The micronutrient iron plays a critical role in setting the magnitude and distribution of primary production across the global ocean, and its internal cycling processes are essential for understanding the global carbon cycle and climate. Future research is needed to expand the utilization of this cutting-edge tracer, with a focus on improving the precision and accuracy of iron isotope measurements and expanding the range of iron isotopes that can be analyzed.", "References": [{"title": "Iron Isotopes as a Tracer of Iron Sources to the Ocean", "authors": "Kempton, P.
