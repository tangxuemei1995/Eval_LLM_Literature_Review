{"Literature Review": "High-dimensional data bootstrap has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to provide accurate and efficient inference in high-dimensional spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent progress in high-dimensional bootstrap, including high-dimensional central limit theorems, bootstrap consistency results, and key techniques used to establish those results. We also review selected applications of high-dimensional bootstrap, including simultaneous confidence sets, multiple hypothesis testing, postselection inference, intersection bounds, and inference on best policies. Finally, we comment on future research directions.", "References": [{"title": "High-Dimensional Bootstrap for Estimating the Distribution of Sample Means", "authors": "Koltchinskii, P., & Smirnov, D.
