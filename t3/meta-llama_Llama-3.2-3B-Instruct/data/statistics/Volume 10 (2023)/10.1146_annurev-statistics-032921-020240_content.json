{"Literature Review": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation for quantiles are crucial tasks in time series forecasting, as they enable the assessment of a model's goodness of fit and predictive performance. In this review, we focus on the setting where forecasts are cast in the form of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. Quantile-based forecasting has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to capture the full range of possible outcomes, rather than just the mean value. However, it also introduces additional challenges, such as the need for calibration and the choice of scoring functions for evaluation.\n\nCalibration is a fundamental concept in forecasting, referring to the idea that the predicted probabilities should match the true probabilities of the events. In the context of quantile-based forecasting, calibration can be assessed using various metrics, including the coverage plot and the reliability diagram. The coverage plot is a graphical representation of the predicted quantiles against the true quantiles, while the reliability diagram is a plot of the predicted quantiles against the quantile of the true distribution. Both plots provide valuable insights into the calibration of the model.\n\nConditional calibration, on the other hand, refers to the idea that the predicted probabilities should match the true probabilities of the events, given the observed data. This is a stronger notion of calibration than unconditional calibration, as it takes into account the information available in the data. Conditional calibration can be assessed using the same metrics as unconditional calibration, but it requires additional information about the data.\n\nScoring functions are a crucial tool for evaluating the performance of quantile-based models. These functions provide a way to compare the performance of different models and to link the scoring functions to the coefficient of determination and skill scores. The most widely used scoring functions include the asymmetric piecewise linear score and the pinball loss. The asymmetric piecewise linear score is a widely used scoring function that is based on the idea of assigning different weights to different quantiles. The pinball loss is a scoring function that is based on the idea of assigning a penalty to the difference between the predicted and true values.\n\nIn this review, we illustrate the use of these tools on three datasets: Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We demonstrate how to use the coverage plot and reliability diagram to assess the calibration of the models, and how to use the scoring functions to evaluate the performance of the models. We also discuss the limitations of these tools and provide suggestions for future research.\n\nIn conclusion, model diagnostics and forecast evaluation for quantiles are essential tasks in time series forecasting. By using the tools discussed in this review, forecasters can assess the goodness of fit and predictive performance of their models, and make informed decisions about the choice of scoring functions and the evaluation of model performance.", "References": [{"title": "A review of quantile regression for time series forecasting", "authors": "H.
