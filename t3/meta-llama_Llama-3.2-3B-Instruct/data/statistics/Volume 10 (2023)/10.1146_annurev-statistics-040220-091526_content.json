{"Literature Review": "Innovation diffusion processes have been a subject of extensive research across various disciplines, including mathematics, physics, statistics, social sciences, marketing, economics, and technological forecasting. The formal representation of innovation diffusion processes has historically relied on epidemic models borrowed from biology, which depart from the logistic equation. These models assume that an innovation spreads in a social system through communication between people, similar to an epidemic spreading through contagion. However, this perspective has been challenged by the Bass model, which provides a more nuanced understanding of innovation diffusion by incorporating the role of marketing and social networks.The Bass model, developed by Philip Bass in 1969, is a widely used innovation diffusion model that describes the adoption of a new product or technology over time (Bass, 1969). The model assumes that the adoption of an innovation is influenced by two factors: the number of adopters in the population and the rate at which adopters acquire the innovation. The Bass model has been widely applied in marketing and has been shown to be effective in predicting the adoption of new products (Bass, 1991).However, the Bass model has limitations, particularly in its assumption that the adoption of an innovation is independent of other factors. To address this limitation, researchers have developed more complex models that incorporate additional factors, such as social networks and word-of-mouth. One such model is the critical diffusion model, which assumes that the adoption of an innovation is influenced by a critical mass of adopters (Rogers, 2003).The critical diffusion model has been shown to be effective in predicting the adoption of innovations in social systems (Rogers, 2003). The model assumes that the adoption of an innovation is influenced by a critical mass of adopters, which is defined as the minimum number of adopters required to create a self-sustaining diffusion process. The model has been applied in a variety of contexts, including marketing, public health, and technological forecasting.In addition to the critical diffusion model, researchers have also developed models that incorporate the role of policy interventions in shaping innovation diffusion processes. One such model is the structured intervention model, which assumes that policy interventions can be designed to assist beneficial diffusions and prevent harmful ones (Goyal, 2013). The model has been applied in a variety of contexts, including marketing and public health.Another important issue in innovation diffusion processes is the role of word-of-mouth in shaping adoption decisions. Word-of-mouth has been shown to play a critical role in shaping adoption decisions, particularly in social systems (Goyal, 2013). Researchers have developed models that incorporate the role of word-of-mouth in shaping adoption decisions, including the Bass model and the critical diffusion model.Despite the advances in innovation diffusion models, there are still several challenges to be addressed. One of the key challenges is the identification of barriers to diffusion, which can significantly impact the adoption of an innovation. Researchers have developed models that incorporate the role of barriers to diffusion, including the critical diffusion model and the structured intervention model.In conclusion, innovation diffusion processes are complex phenomena that are influenced by a variety of factors, including social networks, word-of-mouth, and policy interventions. The development of more complex models that incorporate these factors is essential for predicting the adoption of innovations in social systems. The critical diffusion model and the structured intervention model are two examples of models that have been developed to address these challenges.", "References": [{"title": "The Diffusion of Innovations", "authors": "Rogers, E.
