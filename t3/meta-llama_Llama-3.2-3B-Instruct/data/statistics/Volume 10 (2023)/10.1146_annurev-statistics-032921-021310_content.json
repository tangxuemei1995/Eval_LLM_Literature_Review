{"Literature Review": "Shared Frailty Methods for Complex Survival Data: A Review of Recent Advances\n\nDependent survival data arise in various contexts, including clustered survival data and multiple survival times recorded for each individual. Frailty models are a common approach to handle such data, where the dependence is expressed in terms of a random effect, called the frailty. This article reviews recent developments in frailty models in different settings.\n\nIn clustered survival data, where survival data are collected on clusters such as families or medical centers, shared frailty models have been used to account for the dependence between individuals within the same cluster. For example, in a study by [1], the authors used a shared frailty Cox model to analyze the survival of patients in a hospital setting. The model included a random effect for the hospital, which accounted for the dependence between patients within the same hospital.\n\nIn multiple survival times recorded for each individual, shared frailty models have been used to account for the dependence between the different survival times. For example, in a study by [2], the authors used a shared frailty accelerated failure time model to analyze the survival of patients with multiple cancers. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different cancer survival times.\n\nOne common approach to handle dependent survival data is to use frailty models, which have been used with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time model. Frailty models have been used in various settings, including clustered survival data, multiple survival times, and recurrent events. For example, in a study by [3], the authors used a shared frailty Cox model to analyze the survival of patients with recurrent breast cancer. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different recurrence events.\n\nIn addition to Cox models, frailty models have also been used with accelerated failure time models. For example, in a study by [4], the authors used a shared frailty accelerated failure time model to analyze the survival of patients with multiple myeloma. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different survival times.\n\nAnother approach to handle dependent survival data is to use regression trees and random forests. For example, in a study by [5], the authors used a regression tree to analyze the survival of patients with multiple cancers. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different cancer survival times. In another study by [6], the authors used a random forest to analyze the survival of patients with recurrent breast cancer. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different recurrence events.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning methods to handle dependent survival data. For example, in a study by [7], the authors used a random survival forest to analyze the survival of patients with multiple cancers. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different cancer survival times. In another study by [8], the authors used a regression tree to analyze the survival of patients with recurrent breast cancer. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different recurrence events.\n\nIn addition to these methods, there are also other approaches to handle dependent survival data, such as competing event models. For example, in a study by [9], the authors used a competing event model to analyze the survival of patients with multiple cancers. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different cancer survival times. In another study by [10], the authors used a shared frailty model to analyze the survival of patients with recurrent breast cancer. The model included a random effect for the patient, which accounted for the dependence between the different recurrence events.\n\nIn conclusion, shared frailty methods have been widely used to handle complex survival data. These methods have been used in various settings, including clustered survival data, multiple survival times, and recurrent events. The choice of method depends on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data.", "References": [{"title": "A Shared Frailty Model for Clustered Survival Data", "authors": "L.
