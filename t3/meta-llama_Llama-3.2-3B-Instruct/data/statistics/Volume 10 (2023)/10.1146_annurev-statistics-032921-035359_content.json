{"Literature Review": "Surrogate endpoints in clinical trials have been a topic of interest for decades, particularly when direct measures of the outcome are not feasible or practical. The use of surrogate markers has been extensively studied, with various approaches proposed to evaluate their quality and potential risks. This review focuses on the causal inference paradigm, which views a good surrogate marker as one that is located in the causal pathway between the treatment and outcome. We also examine efforts to assess the risk of the surrogate paradox, a situation where the surrogate is positively associated with the outcome, but the causal effect of the treatment on the surrogate is in a helpful direction, yet the ultimate causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is harmful. Recent work on robust surrogate marker estimation is also discussed, highlighting the need for more advanced methods to address the challenges of surrogate endpoint evaluation. The Prentice criteria, causal effectiveness, causal association, principal stratification, and surrogate paradox are key concepts in this field, and their interplay is crucial for understanding the complexities of surrogate endpoint evaluation.", "References": [{"title": "Surrogate Endpoints in Clinical Trials", "authors": "Hill, A.
