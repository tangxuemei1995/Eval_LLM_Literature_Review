{"Literature Review": "High-dimensional survival analysis has become a crucial aspect of precision medicine, where the analysis of time-to-event outcomes is often accompanied by high-throughput covariates. These high-dimensional data pose significant challenges to classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability due to overfitting (1). Recent emphasis has been placed on developing novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication, which can effectively handle high-dimensional predictors and provide accurate predictions (2, 3). This review aims to provide an overview of cutting-edge methods for high-dimensional survival analysis, highlighting recent innovations in machine learning approaches for survival prediction.\n\n\nIn the context of high-dimensional data, feature selection is a critical step in survival analysis. Traditional feature selection methods, such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) and LASSO regression, have been widely used to select a subset of relevant features from the high-dimensional predictor space (4, 5). However, these methods often suffer from high computational costs and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between features and the survival outcome.\n\n\nRecent advances in machine learning have led to the development of novel feature selection methods, such as random forest-based feature selection and gradient boosting-based feature selection. These methods have been shown to be effective in handling high-dimensional data and providing accurate feature selection (6, 7). For example, a study by Li et al. (8) demonstrated the effectiveness of random forest-based feature selection in a high-dimensional survival analysis setting, where the method was able to identify a subset of relevant features that were associated with improved survival outcomes.\n\n\nIn addition to feature selection, machine learning approaches have also been widely used for survival prediction. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been shown to be effective in predicting survival outcomes, particularly in high-dimensional data settings (9, 10). ANNs can learn complex relationships between features and the survival outcome, and have been shown to outperform traditional survival regression models in terms of accuracy and interpretability.\n\n\nOne of the key challenges in high-dimensional survival analysis is the handling of competing events. Competing events refer to the simultaneous occurrence of multiple events, such as death and progression, which can complicate the analysis of survival outcomes. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of novel methods for handling competing events, such as the use of competing risks models and the incorporation of competing events into survival regression models (11, 12).\n\n\nIn conclusion, high-dimensional survival analysis is a rapidly evolving field that requires novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of effective methods for handling high-dimensional data and providing accurate predictions. The Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort study is an excellent example of a high-dimensional survival analysis setting, where the analysis of time-to-event outcomes is often accompanied by high-throughput covariates. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of novel approaches for high-dimensional survival analysis, and highlight the importance of continued research in this area.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
