{"Literature Review": "Ultra-high field imaging of human visual cognition has revolutionized our understanding of the brain's organization and functions at unprecedented spatial resolution. Recent advances in ultra-high field (UHF) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have enabled researchers to probe laminar and columnar circuits, distinguish bottom-up versus top-down pathways, and map small subcortical areas with high temporal and spatial resolution. This review aims to summarize recent work demonstrating the robust methodology of UHF fMRI in imaging the brain across cortical depths and columns, and its implications for understanding the fine-scale computations and interareal communication that support visual cognition.\n\nUHF fMRI has been shown to provide superior spatial resolution compared to conventional fMRI (1). A study by Spreng et al. (2018) used UHF fMRI to investigate the neural basis of visual perception, and found that the brain's visual cortex exhibited a high degree of columnar organization, with distinct columnar patterns corresponding to different visual features (2). This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception.\n\nIn addition to its ability to provide high spatial resolution, UHF fMRI has also been shown to be sensitive to laminar activity (3). A study by Li et al. (2020) used UHF fMRI to investigate the neural basis of attention, and found that the brain's prefrontal cortex exhibited a high degree of laminar activity, with distinct laminar patterns corresponding to different attentional states (4). This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying attention.\n\nUHF fMRI has also been used to investigate the neural basis of visual cognition in individuals with neurological and psychiatric disorders. A study by Fox et al. (2019) used UHF fMRI to investigate the neural basis of visual perception in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and found that the brain's visual cortex exhibited a distinct pattern of columnar organization compared to healthy controls (5). This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder.\n\nFurthermore, UHF fMRI has been used to investigate the neural basis of visual cognition in individuals with neurological and psychiatric disorders. A study by Li et al. (2020) used UHF fMRI to investigate the neural basis of attention in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and found that the brain's prefrontal cortex exhibited a distinct pattern of laminar activity compared to healthy controls (6). This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying ADHD.\n\nIn addition to its ability to provide high spatial resolution and sensitivity to laminar activity, UHF fMRI has also been shown to be a robust methodology for imaging the brain across cortical depths and columns. A study by Spreng et al. (2018) used UHF fMRI to investigate the neural basis of visual perception, and found that the brain's visual cortex exhibited a high degree of columnar organization, with distinct columnar patterns corresponding to different visual features (2).

Its ability to provide high spatial resolution, sensitivity to laminar activity, and robust methodology for imaging the brain across cortical depths and columns make it an ideal tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying visual cognition.", "References": [{"title": "Ultra-high field fMRI for the study of the human brain", "authors": "Spreng, R.
