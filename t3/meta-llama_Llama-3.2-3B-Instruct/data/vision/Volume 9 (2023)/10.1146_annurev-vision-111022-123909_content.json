{"Literature Review": "The concept of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) has gained significant attention in the field of ophthalmology, particularly in patients with macular diseases. Understanding the PRL is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. In this review, we will examine the current state of knowledge on the PRL, including its identification, development, and implications for ocular motor system and binocular viewing.The PRL is defined as the point of fixation that is most stable and comfortable for a patient when viewing a visual target (1). However, identifying the PRL can be challenging, as it may vary depending on the patient's visual status and the type of visual task being performed (2). One common pitfall in measuring the PRL is the use of monocular viewing, which may not accurately reflect the patient's binocular vision (3). Binocular viewing is essential for understanding the PRL, as it allows for the evaluation of the patient's ability to perceive and process visual information in a more natural and dynamic manner (4).Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the development of the PRL in patients with macular diseases. One theory is that the PRL is a compensatory mechanism that allows patients to adapt to central vision loss by shifting their fixation to a more peripheral area of the retina (5). Another theory suggests that the PRL is influenced by the patient's visual experience and learning (6). However, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of PRL development.The PRL has been proposed as the new reference point of the ocular motor system, with implications for the development of new treatment strategies (7). However, this idea is still speculative, and more research is needed to confirm its validity. The functional implications of the PRL are also significant, as it may affect the patient's ability to perform daily activities and interact with their environment (8). For example, patients with a PRL may experience difficulties with reading and other visually demanding tasks (9).The clinical implications of the PRL are also important, as it may influence the choice of treatment options and the development of new therapeutic strategies (10). For example, patients with a PRL may benefit from treatments that target the peripheral retina, such as photoreceptor transplantation (11). However, more research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of the PRL and to develop effective treatment strategies.In conclusion, the current definition of the PRL is probably incomplete and should incorporate the need to evaluate the PRL in the framework of binocular viewing. Further research is needed to fully understand the PRL and its implications for ocular motor system, binocular viewing, and clinical practice. The PRL has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of macular diseases, but more research is needed to confirm its validity and to develop effective treatment strategies.References:(1) Schmid, K.
