{"Literature Review": "The traditional view of perception and memory as separate cognitive functions supported by distinct brain regions has been challenged by a growing body of evidence. The canonical perspective posits that the ventral visual stream is responsible for perceptual processing of visual information, while the medial temporal lobe is specialized for long-term declarative memory. However, this modular framework is no longer tenable in light of recent findings that blur the boundaries between these two systems. Research conducted in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents has consistently shown that early visual areas are involved in long-term recognition memory. In contrast, medial temporal lobe structures, such as the perirhinal cortex, have been implicated in high-level perceptual processing. A key finding that challenges the traditional view is the presence of overlap between the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe. Furthermore, research has shown that the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe are not mutually exclusive. The implications of these findings are significant. They suggest that the traditional view of perception and memory as separate cognitive functions supported by distinct brain regions is no longer tenable. Instead, the evidence supports a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content, rather than in cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe. This model is supported by research that has shown that the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe are involved in different aspects of visual information processing. In addition, research has shown that the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe are involved in different types of visual information. Overall, the evidence suggests that the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe are not separate cognitive functions supported by distinct brain regions. Instead, they are part of a complex network that is involved in different aspects of visual information processing.", "References": [{"title": "The neural basis of visual perception and memory", "authors": "Kilner, J.
