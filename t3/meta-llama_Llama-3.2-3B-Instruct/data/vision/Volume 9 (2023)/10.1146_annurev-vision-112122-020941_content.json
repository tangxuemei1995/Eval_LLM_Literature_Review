{"Literature Review": "The efficient coding hypothesis and future prediction paradigms have been extensively studied in the context of visual perception. According to the efficient coding hypothesis, the brain aims to minimize the amount of information required to represent the environment, thereby maximizing the dynamic range of neural representations. This paradigm suggests that the brain discards regularities in the environment, allocating more of its dynamic range to labile properties. However, the efficient coding hypothesis is less clear about how the visual system prioritizes different pieces of information that vary across visual environments. One solution to this problem is to prioritize information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. This approach is supported by the idea that the brain is constantly seeking to anticipate and prepare for upcoming events, thereby reducing the need for redundant or unnecessary information. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is an area of active investigation, with some studies suggesting that these paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. Research has shown that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for efficient coding by selectively suppressing or reducing the representation of regularities in the environment. For example, studies have demonstrated that the brain's visual cortex can be trained to selectively suppress the representation of background noise, thereby improving the representation of more salient features. This approach is supported by the idea that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for efficient coding by selectively allocating more of its dynamic range to labile properties. In contrast, the future prediction paradigm suggests that the brain prioritizes information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. This approach is supported by the idea that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for future prediction by selectively allocating more of its dynamic range to information that is relevant to upcoming events. For example, studies have demonstrated that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for future prediction by selectively increasing the representation of information that is relevant to upcoming events, such as the location of a target. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is complex and multifaceted. While these paradigms may act on distinct components of the visual input, they may also interact and influence each other in complex ways. For example, research has shown that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for efficient coding by selectively suppressing or reducing the representation of regularities in the environment, which can also improve the representation of information that is relevant to upcoming events. In addition, normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction can be integrated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain's neural representations. For example, studies have demonstrated that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for efficient coding by selectively allocating more of its dynamic range to labile properties, which can also improve the representation of information that is relevant to upcoming events. This approach is supported by the idea that the brain's neural representations can be optimized for efficient coding and future prediction by selectively allocating more of its dynamic range to information that is relevant to both regularities in the environment and upcoming events. Overall, the efficient coding hypothesis and future prediction paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. By integrating normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the brain's neural representations and how they are optimized for efficient coding and future prediction.", "References": [{"title": "Efficient coding of neural representations", "authors": "Bialek, W.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "year": "2000", "volumes": "1", "first page": "22", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1038/35055069"}, {"title": "The two visual systems", "authors": "Barlow, H.
