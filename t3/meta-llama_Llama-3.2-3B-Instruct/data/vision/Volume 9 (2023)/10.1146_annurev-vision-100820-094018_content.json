{"Literature Review": "The expanding role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing physiology has garnered significant attention in recent years, challenging the long-held notion that mammals lack this capacity. This review aims to summarize the current findings in this field and their implications for human physiology.\n\nNonvisual opsins, a family of G proteinâ€“coupled receptors, have been traditionally associated with the visual sense. However, research has revealed that these proteins also play a crucial role in extraocular light sensing, which is essential for various physiological processes, including seasonal behavior and camouflage.\n\nOne of the key players in this field is encephalopsin (OPN3), which has been shown to mediate extraocular light sensing in mice. Studies have demonstrated that OPN3 is involved in photoentrainment of circadian clocks in skin, suggesting a link between light exposure and the regulation of physiological processes (Bouman et al., 2017).\n\nAnother nonvisual opsin, neuropsin (OPN5), has also been implicated in extraocular light sensing. Research has shown that OPN5 is involved in the acute light-dependent regulation of metabolic pathways, highlighting the importance of light exposure in modulating physiological processes (Lam et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to these specific examples, studies have also explored the broader implications of nonvisual opsin-mediated light sensing in extraocular physiology. For instance, research has suggested that nonvisual opsins may play a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms and metabolic processes in humans (Khalsa et al., 2003; Rea et al., 2017).\n\nFurthermore, the discovery of nonvisual opsins in humans has sparked interest in the potential therapeutic applications of these proteins. For example, research has suggested that targeting nonvisual opsins may provide a novel approach to treating circadian rhythm disorders, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (Lam et al., 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the expanding role of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing physiology has significant implications for our understanding of human physiology and the potential therapeutic applications of these proteins.", "References": [{"title": "Photoentrainment of the circadian clock in skin by the nonvisual photopigment melanopsin", "authors": "Bouman, K.
