{"Literature Review": "Groundwater quality deterioration due to contaminants has significant impacts on human health and ecosystem functions. The spatiotemporal evolution and public health effects of groundwater quality remain unclarified, posing a grand challenge for the safe and sustainable supply of global groundwater resources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the complexity and dynamics of groundwater quality, as well as the impacts of various groundwater substances on human health. Key substances include nutritional elements (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+), pollutants (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, and emerging contaminants), and pathogenic microorganisms. The review highlights the need for concerted efforts in source control, cross-scale rehabilitation, and social hydrology-based groundwater governance to safeguard groundwater-dependent public health.", "References": [{"title": "Groundwater quality and public health", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "WHO", "year": "2011", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.envpol.2011.01.004"}, {"title": "Arsenic contamination of groundwater in India", "authors": "Kumar, A., Singh, V.
