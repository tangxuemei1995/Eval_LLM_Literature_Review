{"Literature Review": "Qualitative research methods have emerged as a crucial tool in environmental research, enabling researchers to explore complex issues and gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between human and natural systems. Over the past few decades, innovative qualitative methods have been developed and applied to address various scientific goals in environmental research. This literature review aims to highlight the advances in qualitative methods in environmental research, drawing from social science disciplines such as sociology, geography, anthropology, political science, public policy, and psychology. We will examine five scientific goals that qualitative research methods have addressed: describing the world, predicting the world, acknowledging researcher positionality and reflexivity, integrating imaginaries into empirical research, and helping scholars grapple with socioecological complexity. We will also explain foundational qualitative approaches and provide examples of environmental qualitative research that apply these approaches.", "References": [{"title": "Qualitative Research in Environmental Studies: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Hart, K., & Bond, A.
