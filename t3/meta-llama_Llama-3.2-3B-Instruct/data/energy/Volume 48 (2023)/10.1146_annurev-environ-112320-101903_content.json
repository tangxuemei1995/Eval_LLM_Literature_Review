{"Literature Review": "Coastal critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards, and its interconnectedness and interdependencies amplify its systemic instability and fragility. This review aims to provide an objective and critical assessment of the risks to coastal critical infrastructure from climate change, highlighting the need for climate-resilient infrastructure that can predict, prepare for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances. The literature review reveals that climate change poses significant threats to coastal critical infrastructure, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. The review also highlights the importance of resilience and adaptability in the design, implementation, and operation of climate-resilient infrastructure. The findings of this review have significant implications for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers, emphasizing the need for a coordinated and proactive approach to addressing the risks to coastal critical infrastructure from climate change.", "References": [{"title": "Assessment of climate change impacts on coastal infrastructure", "authors": "Kundzewicz, Z.
