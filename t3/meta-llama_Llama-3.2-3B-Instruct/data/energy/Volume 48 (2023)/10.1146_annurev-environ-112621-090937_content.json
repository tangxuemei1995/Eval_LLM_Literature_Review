{"Literature Review": "Fungi are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth, with estimates suggesting that they comprise approximately 20% of all eukaryotic species (Kirk et al., 2004). Despite their importance, the diversity of fungi remains poorly understood, with many species remaining undescribed. Recent studies have highlighted the need for a more comprehensive understanding of fungal diversity, distribution, and conservation (Hawksworth et al., 2017). In this review, we will synthesize current knowledge on the global diversity, distribution, and conservation of fungi, with a focus on the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, which are the most diverse groups of fungi (James et al., 2012). The current estimate of fungal species is around 2–3 million, with a 'best estimate' of 2.5 million (Schlosser et al., 2017). However, this number is likely an underestimate, as many species remain undescribed, particularly in tropical regions (Lücking et al., 2016). The distribution of fungi is also poorly understood, with many species found in specific habitats, such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands (Taylor et al., 2017). The conservation of fungi is also neglected, with many species facing threats such as habitat destruction, climate change, and over-exploitation (Hawksworth et al., 2017). One of the main challenges in understanding fungal diversity is the lack of a universal classification system. Different classification systems have been proposed, including the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, which are the most diverse groups of fungi (James et al., 2012). However, these systems are not universally accepted, and there is a need for a more comprehensive and inclusive classification system (Lücking et al., 2016). Recent advances in metabarcoding have improved our understanding of fungal diversity and distribution. Metabarcoding involves the use of DNA sequencing to identify fungal species (Schlosser et al., 2017). This technique has been used to study fungal diversity in various ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands (Taylor et al., 2017). However, metabarcoding also has its limitations, as it can only identify species that are present in the sample, and it may not detect rare or endangered species (Hawksworth et al., 2017). The IUCN Red List is a widely used classification system for species, including fungi (IUCN, 2019). However, the IUCN Red List for fungi is still in its early stages, and there is a need for more comprehensive assessments and management guidelines (Hawksworth et al., 2017). In situ conservation, which involves the conservation of species in their natural habitats, is also an important approach for fungal conservation (Lücking et al., 2016). Ex situ conservation, which involves the conservation of species in controlled environments, such as museums and greenhouses, is also an important approach for fungal conservation (Hawksworth et al., 2017). In conclusion, fungi are a diverse and important group of organisms that require further research and conservation efforts. The current estimate of fungal species is around 2–3 million, with a 'best estimate' of 2.5 million. The distribution of fungi is poorly understood, and many species face threats such as habitat destruction, climate change, and over-exploitation. The conservation of fungi is also neglected, with many species facing threats such as habitat destruction, climate change, and over-exploitation. We argue that fungi constitute the next frontier of biodiversity research, and that further research and conservation efforts are needed to protect these important organisms.", "References": [{"title": "Fungal diversity", "authors": "Kirk, P.
