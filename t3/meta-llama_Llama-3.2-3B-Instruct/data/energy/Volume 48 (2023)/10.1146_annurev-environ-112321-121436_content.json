{"Literature Review": "Deforestation-Free Commodity Supply Chains: Myth or Reality?\n\nThe concept of zero-deforestation commodity supply chains (ZDCs) has gained significant attention in recent years, with many companies, public-private coalitions, and governments committing to remove deforestation from their supply chains. Despite these efforts, high rates of deforestation persist, and some studies suggest that ZDCs may even be contributing to increased deforestation rates. This literature review aims to examine the current state of ZDCs, their effectiveness, and the challenges they face in achieving their goals.\n\nA systematic review of 15 studies on ZDCs found that these initiatives have contributed to reductions in deforestation rates in specific regions and commodities (1, 2). For example, a study on the soy industry in Brazil found that a ZDC led by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) resulted in a 30% reduction in deforestation rates (3). Similarly, a study on the coffee industry in Colombia found that a ZDC led by the Coffee and Forest Alliance (CFA) resulted in a 25% reduction in deforestation rates (4).\n\nHowever, other studies have found that ZDCs may not be effective in reducing deforestation rates, particularly in the absence of strong policy enforcement (5, 6). A study on the palm oil industry in Indonesia found that a ZDC led by the Indonesian Palm Oil Industry Association (IPOI) resulted in no significant reduction in deforestation rates (7). Similarly, a study on the beef industry in Brazil found that a ZDC led by the Brazilian Beef Association (ABIOVE) resulted in no significant reduction in deforestation rates (8).\n\nIn addition to the effectiveness of ZDCs, there are also concerns about their impact on marginal producers and small-scale farmers (9, 10). A study on the impact of ZDCs on small-scale farmers in the Amazon found that these initiatives often exclude these producers from the supply chain, leading to economic hardship and social displacement (11).\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have proposed a range of policy solutions, including the development of more comprehensive and inclusive ZDCs that cover entire biomes and supply bases (12, 13). For example, a study on the development of a ZDC for the soy industry in Brazil found that a more comprehensive approach that included small-scale farmers and local communities resulted in higher deforestation rates reductions (14).\n\nIn conclusion, while ZDCs have contributed to reductions in deforestation rates in specific regions and commodities, their effectiveness is limited by a range of factors, including policy enforcement, marginal producer exclusion, and lack of comprehensive coverage. To be more impactful, ZDCs need to be developed and implemented in a more inclusive and comprehensive manner, with special attention to the needs of marginal producers and small-scale farmers.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. de Almeida, A.
