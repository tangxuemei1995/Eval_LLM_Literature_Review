{"Literature Review": "Brine is a complex, saline solution that contains a variety of valuable elements, including cations such as potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), magnesium (Mg2+), lithium (Li+), boron (B3+), rubidium (Rb2+), and cesium (Cs2+), as well as anions such as sulfate (SO42−), chloride (Cl−), bicarbonate (HCO32−), carbonate (CO32−), nitrate (NO32−), bromide (Br−), and iodide (I−) (1). These elements are widely distributed in salt lakes around the world, particularly in the three enormous plateaus of the Himalayas, the Andes, and the Arabian Peninsula (2). Brines are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines, each with distinct formation mechanisms and characteristics (3, 4). Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes through the evaporation of seawater, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity (5). Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine (6). The unique composition of brines makes them an attractive source of valuable elements, particularly lithium (Li) and potassium (K), which are critical for clean energy transitions and potash production, respectively (7, 8). Recent advances in processing techniques have enabled the large-scale, comprehensive development of brines, which has formed the basis for a recycling economic model (9). This model contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) development and CO2 emission reduction (10). In this review, we will discuss the genesis of brines, new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development of brines worldwide.", "References": [{"title": "Genesis and Characteristics of Brines in Salt Lakes", "authors": "S.
