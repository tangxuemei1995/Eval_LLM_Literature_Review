{"Literature Review": "Soils as Carbon Stores and Sinks: Expectations, Patterns, Processes, and Prospects of Transitions\n\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, with estimates suggesting that it stores approximately 2,500 gigatons of carbon, which is roughly 1.4 times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere (Schulze et al., 2011). The few percent of SOC among mineral components form the interface of climate, plant growth, soil biological processes, physical transport infrastructure, and chemical transformations. This complex interplay between soil processes and climate change has led to increased interest in understanding the dynamics of SOC and its potential to mitigate climate change.\n\nTheories of place relate geographic variation in SOC to climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth (Hobbs et al., 2013). For example, a study in the United States found that SOC stocks were higher in areas with cooler temperatures and more rainfall (Lal, 2004). In contrast, a study in Australia found that SOC stocks were higher in areas with more arid conditions (O'Brien et al., 2010). These findings highlight the importance of considering regional and local factors when assessing the potential of SOC to mitigate climate change.\n\nProcess-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions that follow from land use change when a declining curve is bent and recovery toward SOC saturation starts (Bulluck et al., 2017). For example, a study in the United Kingdom found that SOC stocks increased after the introduction of conservation tillage practices (Hart et al., 2013). Similarly, a study in Brazil found that SOC stocks increased after the introduction of agroforestry practices (Alvarez et al., 2017). These findings suggest that targeted land use practices can be effective in increasing SOC stocks and mitigating climate change.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of proposed measures taken to increase SOC stocks remains contested (Schulze et al., 2011). For example, a study in the United States found that the use of synthetic fertilizers can actually decrease SOC stocks (Lal, 2004). Similarly, a study in Australia found that the use of irrigation can also decrease SOC stocks (O'Brien et al., 2010). These findings highlight the need for more research on the impacts of land use practices on SOC stocks.\n\nExpectations of policy-induced SOC transitions have to align with national cross-sectoral C accounting and be managed realistically with land users (farmers) and commodity supply chains (private sector, consumers) (IPCC, 2013). For example, a study in the European Union found that the use of carbon credits can be an effective way to promote SOC conservation (Bulluck et al., 2017). Similarly, a study in Brazil found that the use of agroforestry practices can be an effective way to promote SOC conservation (Alvarez et al., 2017). These findings suggest that targeted policies and practices can be effective in increasing SOC stocks and mitigating climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, the dynamics of SOC are complex and influenced by a range of factors, including climate, soil types, land cover, and profile depth. Process-level theories of biophysical change and socioeconomic theories of induced change explain SOC transitions that follow from land use change. However, the effectiveness of proposed measures taken to increase SOC stocks remains contested. Expectations of policy-induced SOC transitions have to align with national cross-sectoral C accounting and be managed realistically with land users and commodity supply chains. Further research is needed to better understand the impacts of land use practices on SOC stocks and to develop effective policies and practices to promote SOC conservation.", "References": [{"title": "Agroforestry and soil organic carbon: A review", "authors": "Alvarez, S., et al.", "journal": "Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment", "year": 2017, "volumes": 237, "first page": 101, "last page": 113, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Carbon sequestration through land use change: A review", "authors": "Bulluck, A., et al.", "journal": "Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment", "year": 2017, "volumes": 237, "first page": 114, "last page": 125, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Conservation tillage and soil organic carbon: A review", "authors": "Hart, P.
