{"Literature Review": "The past three decades have witnessed a significant increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation policies, with a growing number of countries implementing various policy instruments to reduce their carbon footprint. This literature review aims to synthesize the empirical evidence on the impact of these policies on three key outcomes: GHG emissions, energy intensity, land use, and low-carbon technologies. Our analysis reveals that mitigation policies have had a discernible impact on emissions and multiple emission drivers, leading to reductions in energy use, declines in deforestation rates, and cost reductions and capacity expansions of low-carbon technologies in many instances. We also find that implemented policies are likely to have reduced global emissions by several billion tons of CO2eq per year compared to a world without mitigation policies. However, despite the evidence of policy effectiveness, current ambitions on climate action are falling short of what is required to limit global warming to the Paris temperature goals. Therefore, we conclude that efforts need to be hugely strengthened and expanded, with a greater emphasis on policy monitoring, evaluation, and learning to strengthen the basis for future policy and the attribution of its impacts.", "References": [{"title": "The Effectiveness of Climate Policies", "authors": "Böhringer, C., & Rauscher, M.
