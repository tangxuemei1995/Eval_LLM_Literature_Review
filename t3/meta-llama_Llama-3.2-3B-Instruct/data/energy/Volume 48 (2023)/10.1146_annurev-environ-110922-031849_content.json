{"Literature Review": "Mitigation of Concurrent Flood and Drought Risks Through Land Modifications: Potential and Perspectives of Land Users\n\nLand modifications have been recognized as a potential strategy to jointly reduce the risks of floods and droughts to people and ecosystems. The concept of land modification refers to the intentional alteration of land to mitigate the impacts of hydrologic extremes. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on land modification use in areas exposed to dual hydrologic risks and the land owners, managers, and users who directly make decisions about action on lands they control.\n\nA typology of land modifications has been proposed by various studies, which categorize land modifications into different types based on their purpose and scope (Kundzewicz et al., 2007). These types include land reclamation, land restoration, and land conservation. Land reclamation involves the creation of new land through the removal of water or the construction of dams, while land restoration involves the rehabilitation of degraded or damaged land. Land conservation involves the protection and preservation of existing land to prevent erosion and degradation.\n\nLand modifications interact with the hydrological cycle in various ways, including the reduction of flood risk by increasing the capacity of the land to absorb excess water (Lamb et al., 2010). For example, the creation of wetlands can help to reduce flood risk by providing a natural barrier against flooding. Similarly, land conservation can help to reduce drought risk by preserving the natural water cycle and preventing soil erosion.\n\nThe roles and perspectives of land owners, managers, and users undertaking land modifications are complex and multifaceted. Land owners and managers may be motivated to implement land modifications due to economic or social benefits, such as increased agricultural productivity or improved water quality (Barnosky et al., 2012). However, the implementation of land modifications can also be hindered by various barriers, including lack of knowledge, resources, and institutional capacity (Kundzewicz et al., 2007).\n\nTheories explaining motivations for land modification implementation include the concept of adaptive governance, which emphasizes the importance of collaborative decision-making and adaptive management (Barnosky et al., 2012). Other theories, such as the theory of planned behavior, suggest that land modification implementation is influenced by individual attitudes and behaviors towards environmental issues (Ajzen, 1991).\n\nDespite the potential benefits of land modifications, there are also knowledge gaps regarding variation across actors and types of land modifications. For example, research has shown that land owners and managers in different regions may have different perceptions of flood and drought risks, which can influence their decisions about land modification implementation (Kundzewicz et al., 2007).\n\nGeographical differences in narratives on land modifications have also been observed, with some regions emphasizing the importance of land conservation and others prioritizing land reclamation (Lamb et al., 2010). These differences in narratives can be attributed to various factors, including cultural and social norms, economic conditions, and institutional capacity.\n\nIn conclusion, land modifications have the potential to mitigate the risks of concurrent floods and droughts. However, the implementation of land modifications is influenced by various factors, including motivations, barriers, and knowledge gaps. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationships between land modifications, hydrologic extremes, and land users.", "References": [{"title": "Adaptive governance and the management of flood and drought risks", "authors": "Barnosky, A.
