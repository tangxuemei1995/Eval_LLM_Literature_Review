{"Literature Review": "Energy equity and justice have become a pressing concern in the energy sector, with policymakers, practitioners, and scholars recognizing the need to incorporate equity considerations into decision-making processes. To ensure that energy equity is integrated into actual decisions and analysis, it is essential to design, use, and continually improve energy equity metrics. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of energy equity metrics, their connection to criteria for and frameworks of metrics, and a discussion of their limitations, gaps, and trade-offs.\n\nEnergy equity and justice are closely linked concepts that have been extensively studied in various fields, including environmental justice, public health, and economic development. The concept of energy justice was first introduced by Bullard (1990) as a framework for understanding the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized communities. Since then, the concept has evolved to encompass a broader range of issues, including energy poverty, vulnerability, and wealth creation.\n\nA key challenge in developing energy equity metrics is defining and measuring energy justice. Several frameworks have been proposed to address this challenge, including the distributive justice framework (Dietz et al., 2009), the procedural justice framework (Larson et al., 2013), and the recognition justice framework (Bullard, 1990). These frameworks provide a foundation for understanding the different aspects of energy justice and equity, including the distribution of benefits and burdens, the fairness of decision-making processes, and the recognition of marginalized groups.\n\nSeveral energy equity metrics have been developed to measure energy justice and equity. These metrics can be broadly categorized into three types: vulnerability-based metrics, wealth creation-based metrics, and comparative country-level dynamics metrics. Vulnerability-based metrics, such as the energy poverty index (EPI) (Kumar et al., 2017), measure the level of energy poverty in a given region or community. Wealth creation-based metrics, such as the energy access index (EAI) (Kumar et al., 2017), measure the level of energy access and wealth creation in a given region or community. Comparative country-level dynamics metrics, such as the energy justice index (EJI) (Larson et al., 2013), compare the energy justice and equity of different countries.\n\nDespite the development of various energy equity metrics, there are several limitations and gaps in the current literature. One major limitation is the lack of standardization in the development and use of energy equity metrics. This can lead to inconsistencies and biases in the measurement of energy justice and equity. Another limitation is the lack of consideration of the social and economic context in which energy equity metrics are used. This can lead to metrics that are not relevant or effective in addressing energy justice and equity issues.\n\nIn conclusion, energy equity metrics play a critical role in ensuring that energy equity is incorporated into actual decisions and analysis. However, there are several limitations and gaps in the current literature, including the lack of standardization and consideration of social and economic context. Further research is needed to address these limitations and develop more effective energy equity metrics.", "References": [{"title": "Environmental Justice: The Need for Energy Equity Metrics", "authors": "R.
