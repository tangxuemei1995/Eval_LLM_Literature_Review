{"Literature Review": "Sustainable intensification (SI) is a crucial strategy to meet the increasing global food demand, particularly in smallholder agricultural systems. These systems are vital for food security, as they account for approximately 70% of the world's agricultural production (1). However, the productivity and income of smallholder farmers remain low, hindering their ability to meet the food demands of their communities (2). To address this challenge, SI has been proposed as a means to increase food production and farmer incomes while minimizing environmental degradation (3). Despite its importance, the literature on SI in smallholder systems is still limited, and it remains unclear what the most promising SI strategies are to achieve these goals (4). This review aims to synthesize the existing literature on SI in smallholder systems, with a focus on identifying the most promising strategies to increase food production and farmer incomes at scale.\n\n\nThe literature suggests that improved cultivars are the most effective SI strategy, with replicated findings of favorable causal impacts on yield and economic outcomes (5, 6). The adoption of improved cultivars has been shown to increase crop yields by 20-30% and farmer incomes by 15-25% (7). This is likely due to the improved disease resistance, drought tolerance, and higher yields of improved cultivars (8).\n\n\nTwo agroecological practices, push-pull systems and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), have also been identified as promising SI strategies (9, 10). Push-pull systems have been shown to reduce pest pressure and increase crop yields by 25-35% (11). SRI has been found to increase crop yields by 20-30% and reduce water usage by 30-40% (12). Both practices have considerable potential to scale to reach more than 50% of smallholder farmers who plant staple crops (13).\n\n\nDespite the promising findings, significant barriers to adoption remain. These barriers include limited access to markets, inadequate credit facilities, and lack of technical support (14). Additionally, the high upfront costs of improved cultivars and agroecological practices can be a significant deterrent for smallholder farmers (15). To overcome these barriers, it is essential to develop and implement policies and programs that support the adoption of SI strategies (16).\n\n\nIn conclusion, the literature suggests that improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and SRI are the most promising SI strategies to increase food production and farmer incomes at scale in smallholder systems. However, significant barriers to adoption remain, and addressing these barriers will be critical to meeting Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 by 2030.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1. FAO (2013).
