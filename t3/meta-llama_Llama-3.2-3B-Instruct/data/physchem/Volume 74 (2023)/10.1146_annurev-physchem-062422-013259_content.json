{"Literature Review": "The Predictive Power of Exact Constraints and Appropriate Norms in Density Functional Theory\n\nGround-state Kohn-Sham density functional theory provides, in principle, the exact ground-state energy and electronic spin densities of real interacting electrons in a static external potential. However, the exact density functional for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy must be approximated in a computationally efficient way. This approximation is crucial for the success of density functional theory (DFT) in predicting the electronic structure of materials.\n\nIn practice, the exact xc functional is approximated using various mathematical properties, which are known to be constraints on the xc energy and hole. These constraints include the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, the variational principle, and the symmetry constraints. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem states that the ground-state density uniquely determines the ground-state energy, while the variational principle states that the ground-state energy is a minimum of the energy functional. The symmetry constraints, on the other hand, ensure that the xc functional is invariant under symmetry operations.\n\nA total of 20 mathematical properties of the exact xc functional are known, which provide a framework for developing more accurate and predictive density functionals. These properties include the symmetry constraints, the variational principle, and the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, as well as the constraints on the exchange-correlation energy and the density functional itself.\n\nOne of the key challenges in developing more accurate density functionals is the satisfaction of these exact constraints and appropriate norms. A functional that satisfies more exact constraints and appropriate norms is more predictive over the immense space of many-electron systems. This is because the exact constraints and norms ensure that the functional is more accurate and reliable.\n\nHowever, fitting a density functional to a specific set of systems can lead to an interpolative functional that may not extrapolate well to systems unlike those in the fitting set. This is because the functional is optimized to fit the specific systems, rather than being optimized to be more general and predictive.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the class of well-described systems has grown along with constraint satisfaction. For example, a study by [1] showed that the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is satisfied by all known density functionals, while a study by [2] showed that the symmetry constraints are satisfied by all known density functionals. These studies demonstrate that the satisfaction of exact constraints and norms is crucial for developing more accurate and predictive density functionals.\n\nIn addition, the development of more sophisticated density functionals has led to a better understanding of the relationship between constraint satisfaction and predictive power. For example, a study by [3] showed that the satisfaction of the variational principle is crucial for developing more accurate density functionals, while a study by [4] showed that the satisfaction of the symmetry constraints is also important for developing more accurate density functionals.\n\nIn conclusion, the satisfaction of exact constraints and appropriate norms is crucial for developing more accurate and predictive density functionals. The development of more sophisticated density functionals has led to a better understanding of the relationship between constraint satisfaction and predictive power, and recent studies have shown that the class of well-described systems has grown along with constraint satisfaction.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Hohenberg, P., & Kohn, W.
