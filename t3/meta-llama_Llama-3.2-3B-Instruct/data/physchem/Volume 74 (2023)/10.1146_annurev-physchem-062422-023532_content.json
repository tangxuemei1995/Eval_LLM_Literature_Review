{"Literature Review": "Many-body effects in aqueous systems have been a subject of intense research in the field of computational chemistry. The study of complex molecular interactions has led to the development of various interaction analysis techniques, which provide an intuitive understanding of these interactions. This review aims to discuss the synergy between these interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields aimed at accurately reproducing the Bornâ€“Oppenheimer potential energy surface. We will focus on ab initio-based force fields that aim to explicitly reproduce many-body terms and are fitted to high-level electronic structure results. The literature review will be structured as follows: first, we will provide a historical context for the study of many-body interactions and discuss how nonadditivities emerge from Hamiltonians containing strictly pairwise-additive interactions. Then, we will elaborate on the synergy between interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields. Finally, we will discuss the emerging use of the many-body expansion (MBE) to improve the accuracy and speed of ab initio molecular dynamics.", "References": [{"title": "A historical perspective on the development of ab initio methods for molecular interactions", "authors": "J.
