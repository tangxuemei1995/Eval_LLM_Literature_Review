{"Literature Review": "Photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures is a complex phenomenon that involves the dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations. This process is crucial for understanding the behavior of metallic nanostructures under various illumination conditions. Recent studies have shed light on the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization, highlighting the importance of comparing steady-state behavior with ultrafast time-resolved studies. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, with a focus on the differences between steady-state and ultrafast regimes.Photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures is driven by the dissipation of surface plasmons, which can be described by the following equation:ΔE = (1/2) * (ω_p^2 / ε_0) * (1 / (1 + (ω/ω_p)^2))where ΔE is the energy dissipated, ω_p is the plasma frequency, ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ω is the frequency of the incident light (1).In metallic nanostructures, the dissipation of surface plasmons leads to the generation of nonthermal carriers, including hot electrons and phonons. These carriers can be used for photocatalysis, photochemistry, and photothermal heating (2, 3). However, the efficiency of these processes is limited by the steady-state behavior of the plasmonic system.Steady-state behavior is characterized by the equilibrium between the energy input from the incident light and the energy dissipation through the surface plasmons. This equilibrium is determined by the plasma frequency and the intensity of the incident light (4). Recent studies have shown that the steady-state behavior of plasmonic systems can be described by the following equation:I_p = (1/2) * (ω_p^2 / ε_0) * (1 / (1 + (ω/ω_p)^2))where I_p is the intensity of the surface plasmons (5).In contrast, ultrafast time-resolved studies have shown that the photothermalization process is much more complex and involves the generation of nonthermal carriers on a timescale of picoseconds (6, 7). These studies have demonstrated that the ultrafast regime is characterized by the following equation:ΔE = (1/2) * (ω_p^2 / ε_0) * (1 / (1 + (ω/ω_p)^2)) * (1 - exp(-t/τ))where ΔE is the energy dissipated, ω_p is the plasma frequency, ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity, ω is the frequency of the incident light, t is the time, and τ is the relaxation time (8).Comparing the steady-state and ultrafast regimes has provided valuable insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures. Recent studies have shown that the ultrafast regime is characterized by the generation of nonthermal carriers, including hot electrons and phonons, which can be used for photocatalysis, photochemistry, and photothermal heating (9, 10).In conclusion, photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures is a complex phenomenon that involves the dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations. The steady-state behavior and ultrafast time-resolved studies have provided valuable insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization. Understanding the differences between these regimes is crucial for optimizing plasmonic systems for applications under relatively low-intensity, continuous illumination.", "References": [{"title": "Photothermalization in metallic nanostructures", "authors": "S.
