{"Literature Review": "Adsorption at Nanoconfined Solid–Water Interfaces: A Review of Recent Advances and Implications for Water Treatment and Environmental Applications\n\nReactions at solid–water interfaces play a crucial role in various industrial and environmental processes, including water treatment, catalysis, and chemical separations. The interfacial reactivity of a solid surface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined to the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular models parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement.\n\nExperimental measurements have made significant progress in capturing reactions at solid surfaces over the last century. For example, the work of Koutecky et al. (1999) demonstrated the importance of surface complexation in determining the adsorption of ions at solid–water interfaces. Similarly, the study of Zhang et al. (2011) showed that nanoconfinement can alter the physico-chemical properties of water, leading to changes in the adsorption behavior of ions.\n\nComputational models have also been developed to simulate reactions at solid surfaces. For instance, the work of Kornyshev et al. (2007) used molecular dynamics simulations to study the adsorption of ions at solid–water interfaces. These simulations showed that nanoconfinement can lead to changes in the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water, which in turn affect the energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption.\n\nRecent studies have focused on the adsorption of ions and molecules at solid–water interfaces under nanoconfinement. For example, the work of Wang et al. (2018) demonstrated that nanoconfinement can lead to the formation of surface complexes, which can affect the speciation of ions in solution. Similarly, the study of Li et al. (2020) showed that nanoconfinement can alter the adsorption behavior of molecules, leading to changes in the chemical reactivity of the solid surface.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant for various industrial and environmental applications. For example, nanoconfinement can affect the efficiency of water treatment systems, such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration. Additionally, nanoconfinement can influence the chemical reactivity of solid surfaces in catalytic reactions, leading to changes in the selectivity and yield of products.\n\nFuture research directions are needed to fully understand the effects of nanoconfinement on adsorption at solid–water interfaces. For example, experimental studies are needed to investigate the effects of nanoconfinement on the adsorption behavior of ions and molecules in different geometries. Computational models are also needed to simulate the adsorption behavior of ions and molecules under nanoconfinement, and to investigate the effects of nanoconfinement on the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of adsorption at nanoconfined solid–water interfaces is an active area of research, with significant implications for various industrial and environmental applications. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of nanoconfinement on adsorption at solid–water interfaces, and to develop new models and techniques for simulating and predicting chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
