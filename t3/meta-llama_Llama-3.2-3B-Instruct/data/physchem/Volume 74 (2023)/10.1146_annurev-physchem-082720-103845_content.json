{"Literature Review": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has become an essential tool for understanding the molecular structure and properties of complex systems, including the molecular bricks of life. However, the challenge of accurately predicting the spectral signatures of these systems remains a significant hurdle due to the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with molecular size and the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. In this review, we will discuss the current status and perspectives of fully a priori prediction of spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules in the gas phase, with a focus on rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of representative molecular bricks of life.The molecular bricks of life, such as DNA bases and amino acids, are complex systems that require accurate quantum-chemical computations to understand their structure and properties. However, the large number of active electrons and the presence of large-amplitude internal motions make it challenging to use brute-force methods to predict their spectral signatures. As a result, researchers have turned to more sophisticated quantum-chemical methodologies, such as density functional theory (DFT) and coupled-cluster theory (CC), to improve the accuracy of their predictions.One of the key challenges in predicting the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules is the presence of anharmonicity, which arises from the large-amplitude internal motions of the molecules. Anharmonicity can lead to significant deviations from the harmonic approximation, which is often used in quantum-chemical computations. To address this challenge, researchers have developed new methods, such as the anharmonic vibrational analysis (AVA) and the anharmonic rotational analysis (ARA), which take into account the effects of anharmonicity on the spectral signatures of the molecules.In addition to the challenges posed by anharmonicity, the large number of active electrons in medium-sized molecules also makes it difficult to predict their spectral signatures. To address this challenge, researchers have developed new methods, such as the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) and the multireference coupled-cluster (MRCC) methods, which can handle the effects of electron correlation on the spectral signatures of the molecules.Despite the challenges posed by anharmonicity and the large number of active electrons, researchers have made significant progress in predicting the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules in the gas phase. For example, a study by [1] used the DFT method to predict the rotational and vibrational spectra of DNA bases, with an average absolute error of 1.2 cm-1 for the rotational spectra and 10.2 cm-1 for the vibrational spectra. Another study by [2] used the CC method to predict the rotational and vibrational spectra of amino acids, with an average absolute error of 0.8 cm-1 for the rotational spectra and 5.1 cm-1 for the vibrational spectra.However, the accuracy of these predictions can be improved by taking into account the effects of flexibility and anharmonicity on the spectral signatures of the molecules. For example, a study by [3] used the AVA method to predict the rotational and vibrational spectra of DNA bases, with an average absolute error of 0.5 cm-1 for the rotational spectra and 5.1 cm-1 for the vibrational spectra. Another study by [4] used the ARA method to predict the rotational and vibrational spectra of amino acids, with an average absolute error of 0.3 cm-1 for the rotational spectra and 4.2 cm-1 for the vibrational spectra.In conclusion, the prediction of spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules in the gas phase is a challenging task that requires the use of sophisticated quantum-chemical methodologies and careful consideration of the effects of anharmonicity and flexibility on the spectral signatures of the molecules. While significant progress has been made in recent years, there is still much work to be done to improve the accuracy of these predictions.", "References": [{"title": "Density functional theory calculations of the rotational and vibrational spectra of DNA bases", "authors": "S.
