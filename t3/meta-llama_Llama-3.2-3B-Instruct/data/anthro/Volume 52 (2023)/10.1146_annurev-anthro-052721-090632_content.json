{"Literature Review": "The concept of biological normalcy has been a subject of debate among anthropologists and biologists, with implications for understanding human biology and population biology. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the term normal in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation. The framework of biological normalcy will be proposed to illustrate how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology.\n\nThe term normal is often understood as a descriptive concept, referring to a characteristic that is within a certain range of the mean or median of a population. However, this understanding of normal is often challenged by anthropologists who argue that the concept of normal is culturally and historically relative. For example, the concept of normal body shape or size can vary significantly across different cultures.\n\nIn biomedicine, the term normal is often used to describe a healthy state, but this usage is also subject to cultural and historical biases. For instance, the concept of normal blood pressure or cholesterol levels can be influenced by factors such as diet, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status.\n\nAnthropologists have also challenged the idea of a single, universal normal, arguing that there are multiple norms and standards that vary across different cultures and historical periods. For example, the concept of beauty standards can vary significantly across different cultures, with some cultures valuing thinness or youthfulness, while others value strength or wisdom.\n\nThe normative meaning of normal is also subject to cultural and historical biases. For instance, the concept of normal intelligence or cognitive ability can be influenced by factors such as education, socioeconomic status, and cultural background.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of considering the statistical and normative meanings of normal in understanding human biology and population biology. This includes the use of statistical methods to analyze data and identify patterns and trends in human biology.\n\nThe biological normalcy framework proposes that the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology. This framework recognizes that the concept of normal is both descriptive and evaluative, and that the statistical and normative meanings of normal are intertwined and reciprocal.\n\nSeveral examples illustrate the biological normalcy framework. For instance, the concept of normal blood pressure can be understood both as a descriptive concept, referring to a range of blood pressure values that are within a certain range of the mean or median of a population, and as an evaluative concept, referring to a healthy state that is desirable and valued by society.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of biological normalcy is complex and multifaceted, and is subject to cultural and historical biases. The biological normalcy framework provides a useful tool for understanding how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology.", "References": [{"title": "A General Introduction to Statistics", "authors": "Kendall, O.
