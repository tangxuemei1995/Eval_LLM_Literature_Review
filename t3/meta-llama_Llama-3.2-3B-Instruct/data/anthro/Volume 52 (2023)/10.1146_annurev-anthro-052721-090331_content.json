{"Literature Review": "Water needs, water insecurity, and human biology are intricately linked, with each influencing the other in complex ways. This review aims to provide an integrative overview of the current state of knowledge on human water needs, thirst, and hydration strategies from a biocultural perspective, as well as the experiences of water insecurity and coping strategies used to mitigate it. By examining the intersection of these factors through the lens of the embodiment framework, this review seeks to elucidate the far-reaching implications for human biology.\n\nWater needs are a critical aspect of human biology, with the human body requiring approximately 2.3 liters of water per day (1). However, the amount of water needed can vary significantly depending on factors such as age, sex, weight, and activity level (2). Thirst is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a range of factors, including temperature, humidity, and individual differences in thirst perception (3).\n\nHydration strategies are also an important aspect of human water needs, with research suggesting that adequate hydration is essential for maintaining cognitive function, physical performance, and overall health (4). However, the effectiveness of hydration strategies can be influenced by a range of factors, including the type of fluid consumed, the timing of consumption, and individual differences in fluid intake (5).\n\nWater insecurity (WI) is a growing concern worldwide, with millions of people lacking access to safe and reliable drinking water (6). WI can have significant implications for human biology, including increased risk of dehydration, malnutrition, and mental health problems (7). Coping strategies used to mitigate WI can also have implications for human biology, including the use of alternative sources of water, such as rainwater harvesting or water purification tablets (8).\n\nThe embodiment framework provides a useful lens for examining the intersection of water needs, WI, and hydration strategies with human biology. This framework suggests that the body is not just a passive recipient of water, but rather an active participant in the regulation of water balance (9). As such, disruptions to water needs and WI can have far-reaching implications for human biology, including cellular damage, dehydration, nutrition, stress, mental health, cognitive impairment, aging-related effects, cardiometabolic health, and kidney function (10).\n\nLifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity or changes in diet, can also have implications for water needs and WI. For example, research has shown that increased physical activity can lead to increased water loss through sweat, while changes in diet can affect fluid intake and hydration status (11).\n\nClimate change is also having a significant impact on water needs and WI, with changes in precipitation patterns and increased frequency of droughts and floods affecting access to safe and reliable drinking water (12). This can have significant implications for human biology, including increased risk of dehydration, malnutrition, and mental health problems.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between water needs, water insecurity, and human biology is complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these factors for human biology and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of WI.", "References": [{"title": "Water needs and human biology", "authors": "K.
