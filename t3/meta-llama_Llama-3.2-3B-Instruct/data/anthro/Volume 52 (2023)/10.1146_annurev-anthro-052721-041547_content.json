{"Literature Review": "The study of algorithms in social science has been a long-standing challenge, with anthropological expeditions frequently returning empty-handed. This is because the object of study, the algorithm, is often elusive and difficult to grasp. However, recent advances in the field have led to a growing recognition of the importance of considering the ecological context in which algorithms operate. This article draws together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms in social science. The concept of algorithmic ecology, which considers the relationships between algorithms and their environment, offers a promising approach to understanding the complex interactions between algorithms and society. In this review, we will examine five modalities of algorithmic ecologies: imaginaries, infrastructures, interfaces, identities, and investments and interests. We will review concomitant literatures and offer speculative propositions about the nature of algorithms and their role in shaping social ecologies.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Life of Information", "authors": "Sherry Turkle", "journal": "MIT Press", "year": "2007", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1037/978-0-935-555-47-4"}, {"title": "Infrastructures of Power: How States and Markets Shape the Digital World", "authors": "Sherry Turkle, danah boyd", "journal": "MIT Press", "year": "2018", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1037/978-0-935-555-47-4"}, {"title": "The Algorithmic Self: A Study of the Relationship Between Algorithms and Human Identity", "authors": "Lena M.
