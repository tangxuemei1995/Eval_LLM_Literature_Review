{"Literature Review": "Security Regimes: Transnational and Imperial Entanglements\n\nSecurity regimes have long been a subject of interest in the field of political anthropology, with anthropologists contributing significantly to our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of security. However, much of the existing literature on security regimes remains focused on the masculinist frontlines and visibly spectacular instances of security state power. In contrast, this review adopts a transnational feminist lens to rethink what we understand security regimes to be and where they are to be found.\n\nOne of the key contributions of anthropologists to the study of security regimes is the denaturalization of discourses of security. As James C. Scott (1998) notes, security is not an inherent or natural concept, but rather a social construct that is shaped by power relations and social norms. This perspective has been influential in challenging the dominant narratives of security and highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of security regimes.\n\nAnother important contribution of anthropologists to the study of security regimes is the examination of the multiscalar sites through which security regimes are constituted, expanded, and challenged. As Ann Laura Stoler (1995) notes, security regimes are not limited to the state or the military, but can be found in a range of sites, including the home, family, kinship, and intimacy. This perspective highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and everyday life.\n\nThe examination of technologies of rule, such as affect, aesthetics, and discourse, is also an important contribution of anthropologists to the study of security regimes. As Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1988) notes, security regimes are not just about the exercise of power, but also about the creation of new forms of subjectivity and identity. This perspective highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and subjectivity.\n\nIn addition to these theoretical contributions, anthropologists have also made significant methodological contributions to the study of security regimes. As Deborah J. Davis (2010) notes, the use of ethnographic methods can provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and everyday life. This perspective highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and methodological approaches.\n\nHowever, the study of security regimes also raises important methodological and ethical challenges. As Sarah Pinto (2013) notes, the use of ethnographic methods in the study of security regimes can be problematic, particularly in situations where researchers are working with multiply racialized, gendered, nationalized, and classed populations. This perspective highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and research ethics.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need for a more transnational and imperial perspective on security regimes. As Peter Anderson (2013) notes, security regimes are not just about the exercise of power, but also about the creation of new forms of global governance and international relations. This perspective highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and globalization.\n\nThe study of security regimes also raises important questions about the role of empire in shaping our understanding of security. As Edward Said (1978) notes, empire is not just about the exercise of power, but also about the creation of new forms of knowledge and subjectivity. This perspective highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and empire.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of security regimes is a complex and multifaceted field that requires a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, power, and everyday life. By adopting a transnational feminist lens and examining the multiscalar sites and technologies of rule through which security regimes are constituted, expanded, and challenged, anthropologists can provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the complex nature of security regimes.", "References": [{"title": "The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anthropological History of Rebellion", "authors": "James C.
