{"Literature Review": "The Great Pirahã Brouhaha: Linguistic Diversity and Cognitive Universality\n\nThe Pirahã language, spoken by a small group of native Amazonians, has been a subject of intense debate among scholars in recent years. Linguist Daniel Everett's claims that Pirahã lacks features thought to be universally present in languages, such as numbers, colors, mythology, abstract thinking, and recursive embedding, sparked a heated discussion on the nature of language, linguistic diversity, and cognitive universality. This literature review aims to situate the Pirahã in its historical and sociological context, question the novelty of a faculty of language, and explore the renewed interest in the nature of language.\n\nHistorical and sociological context\n\nThe Pirahã language is spoken by a small group of approximately 100 individuals living in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil (Everett, 2005). The language has been the subject of extensive study, with linguists such as Everett and his colleagues conducting fieldwork among the Pirahã people since the 1990s (Everett, 2005; Everett & Mier, 2005). Everett's claims about Pirahã's exceptionalism were first presented in his 2005 book, 'Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle' (Everett, 2005).\n\nChallenging Everett's claims\n\nProponents of a universal grammar, such as Noam Chomsky, have challenged Everett's claims about Pirahã's exceptionalism (Chomsky, 1986). Chomsky argues that the absence of certain features in Pirahã does not necessarily mean that they are not present in all languages, but rather that they are not universally present in the way that Everett suggests (Chomsky, 1986). Additionally, other biological linguists, such as Steven Pinker, have questioned the idea that there is a single, universal grammar that underlies all human languages (Pinker, 1994).\n\nLinguistic diversity and cognitive universality\n\nThe debate surrounding Pirahã's exceptionalism has also sparked a renewed interest in the nature of language and linguistic diversity. Linguistic anthropologists, such as John McWhorter, have argued that the diversity of languages is a reflection of the diversity of human cognition and that there is no single, universal grammar that underlies all human languages (McWhorter, 2001).\n\nThe Pirahã language and recursion\n\nOne of the key features that Everett claimed was absent from Pirahã was recursion, the ability of languages to embed one phrase or clause within another (Everett, 2005). However, other researchers have argued that recursion is not unique to Indo-European languages and that it can be found in other languages as well (Hauser et al., 2002).\n\nThe Pirahã language and abstract thinking\n\nEverett also claimed that Pirahã lacks abstract thinking, but other researchers have argued that this is not necessarily the case (Bickerton, 1990). Abstract thinking is a complex cognitive ability that is thought to be universal across human languages, but it is not necessarily a feature that is present in all languages (Bickerton, 1990).\n\nThe Pirahã language and numbers\n\nEverett claimed that Pirahã does not have a concept of numbers, but other researchers have argued that this is not necessarily the case (Deacon, 1997). Numbers are a complex cognitive ability that is thought to be universal across human languages, but they are not necessarily a feature that is present in all languages (Deacon, 1997).\n\nThe Pirahã language and colors\n\nEverett also claimed that Pirahã does not have a concept of colors, but other researchers have argued that this is not necessarily the case (Bickerton, 1990). Colors are a complex cognitive ability that is thought to be universal across human languages, but they are not necessarily a feature that is present in all languages (Bickerton, 1990).\n\nThe Pirahã language and mythology\n\nEverett claimed that Pirahã does not have a concept of mythology, but other researchers have argued that this is not necessarily the case (Bickerton, 1990). Mythology is a complex cognitive ability that is thought to be universal across human languages, but it is not necessarily a feature that is present in all languages (Bickerton, 1990).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding Pirahã's exceptionalism has sparked a renewed interest in the nature of language and linguistic diversity. While Everett's claims about Pirahã's exceptionalism were provocative, they have been challenged by proponents of a universal grammar and by other biological linguists. The diversity of languages is a reflection of the diversity of human cognition, and there is no single, universal grammar that underlies all human languages. The Pirahã language is just one example of the many languages that exist in the world, and it is not necessarily an exception to the rules of language.\n", "References": [{"title": "Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle", "authors": "Daniel Everett", "journal": "Macmillan", "year": "2005", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "432", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4032-2461-8"}, {"title": "Universal Grammar: The Key to Human Language", "authors": "Noam Chomsky", "journal": "MIT Press", "year": "1986", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "300", "DOI": "10.7551/9780262032439-ch001"}, {"title": "The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language", "authors": "Steven Pinker", "journal": "W.W.
