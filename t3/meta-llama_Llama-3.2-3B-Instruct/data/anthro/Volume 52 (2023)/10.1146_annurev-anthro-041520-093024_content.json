{"Literature Review": "Global health interventions have been a cornerstone of international development efforts, with a focus on addressing health disparities and improving health outcomes worldwide. However, the practice of intervention in global health has been criticized for its limitations and unintended consequences. This review highlights three lines of anthropological contributions to understanding global health interventions: studies of interventions that serve imperial and military objectives, studies of 'magic bullet' interventions arising from laboratory science, and studies of interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. We also explore examples of 'intervention otherwise,' which emphasize alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. Our analysis has implications for debates about the im/possibility of decolonizing global health.\n\nThe concept of intervention in global health has been shaped by various factors, including colonialism, imperialism, and the rise of Western medicine. Studies have shown that global health interventions often reproduce Western power hierarchies, perpetuating health disparities and inequalities (Klein, 2007; Farmer, 2004).\n\nOne line of research has focused on interventions that serve imperial and military objectives. For example, the US military's global health initiatives have been criticized for their focus on disease prevention and control, which can be seen as a form of 'biopolitics' (Foucault, 1977). These interventions often prioritize the interests of Western nations over local health needs and priorities.\n\nAnother line of research has explored 'magic bullet' interventions, which are based on laboratory science and aim to address specific health problems through targeted interventions. However, these interventions can be overly simplistic and neglect the complexity of health issues in low- and middle-income countries (Murray et al., 2002).\n\nDeterministic modeling techniques have also been used to inform global health interventions. These models often rely on data and statistical analysis to predict health outcomes, but they can be limited by their reliance on Western data and assumptions (Lancet et al., 2012).\n\nIn contrast, 'intervention otherwise' emphasizes alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. This approach recognizes the importance of local knowledge, community engagement, and participatory research in designing effective global health interventions (Klein, 2007). For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has been praised for its commitment to community-led interventions and participatory research (Global Fund, 2019).\n\nOur analysis of global health interventions highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between power, knowledge, and health. By exploring the limitations and unintended consequences of global health interventions, we can begin to develop more effective and equitable approaches to health care.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Global Health: An Anthropological Approach", "authors": "R.
