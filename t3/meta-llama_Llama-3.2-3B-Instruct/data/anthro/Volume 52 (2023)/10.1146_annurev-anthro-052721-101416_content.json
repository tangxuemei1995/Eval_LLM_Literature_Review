{"Literature Review": "The concept of religious conversion has long been a subject of interest in anthropology, with scholars exploring its various meanings and implications. This literature review examines the anthropological scholarship that engages with religious conversion as a political phenomenon, broadly defined. By framing conversion in political terms, anthropologists have sought to understand how it makes a difference in the lives of individuals, collectives, and polities. This review aims to scrutinize and contextualize the belated consolidation of this area of inquiry, map its major strands, and identify the interrelated theoretical developments within anthropology. The findings of this review will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between religion, politics, and social change.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Conversion", "authors": "Turner, Victor W.
