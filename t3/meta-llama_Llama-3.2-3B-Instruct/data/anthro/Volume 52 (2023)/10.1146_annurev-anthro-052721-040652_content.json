{"Literature Review": "Decolonizing Museums: Toward a Paradigm Shift\n\nThe concept of decolonization in museums has gained significant attention in recent years, with scholars and curators from diverse backgrounds contributing to the discourse. This review aims to provide an overview of the discourses and practices that have shaped the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, with a particular focus on the care of Native North American heritage.\n\nDecolonizing moments in theory and practice have been a subject of interest among scholars. One of the earliest critiques of ethnographic museums emerged in the 1990s, which highlighted the problematic nature of these institutions in representing Native American cultures (Bucholtz, 1999). The passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990 marked a significant turning point in the history of museum decolonization, as it led to the repatriation of Native American remains and cultural items to their communities of origin (National NAGPRA Resource Center, n.d.).\n\nWorks on Native American representation and public displays have also been instrumental in shaping the decolonization of museums. For instance, a study by Karp and Karp (2006) examined the representation of Native American cultures in museums and argued that these representations often perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce colonial narratives. In contrast, a study by Horsman (2013) highlighted the importance of involving Native American communities in the care and management of their cultural heritage, which has led to the development of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization of museums.\n\nThe involvement of Native American communities in museum practices has been a key aspect of decolonization efforts. A study by Deloria (1998) argued that Native American communities have the right to control their own cultural heritage and that museums should prioritize their involvement in the care and management of their cultural items. This perspective is supported by a study by Kowal (2011), which examined the role of indigenous peoples in the management of cultural heritage and argued that their involvement is essential for the decolonization of museums.\n\nThe varied collaborations that are changing museum practices have also been a subject of interest among scholars. A study by Horsman (2013) examined the collaborations between museums and Native American communities and argued that these collaborations have led to the development of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization of museums. In contrast, a study by Karp and Karp (2006) highlighted the challenges faced by museums in engaging with Native American communities and argued that these challenges are often rooted in the historical and ongoing legacies of colonialism.\n\nThe fluorescence of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization and indigenization of museums have been a subject of interest among scholars. A study by Horsman (2013) examined the role of tribal museums in the decolonization of museums and argued that these museums have played a crucial role in the repatriation of Native American cultural items and the promotion of Native American cultures. In contrast, a study by Kowal (2011) highlighted the importance of tribal museums in the management of cultural heritage and argued that these museums have the potential to contribute to the decolonization of museums.\n\nIn conclusion, the literature on decolonization in museums suggests that a paradigm shift is necessary to address the historical and ongoing legacies of colonialism in museums. The involvement of Native American communities in museum practices, the development of tribal museums, and the repatriation of Native American cultural items are all essential components of this paradigm shift. As the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums continue to evolve, it is essential that scholars and curators prioritize the decolonization of museums and the promotion of Native American cultures.\n\nReferences:\n\nBucholtz, M.
