{"Literature Review": "Targeting driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens using T cell receptor-based cellular therapy has emerged as a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. The concept of targeting tumor-specific neoantigens has been extensively explored, with a focus on developing personalized therapies. However, the majority of tumor-specific neoantigens are unique to each patient, making it challenging to develop effective treatments. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting public neoantigens, which are shared across patients and uniformly expressed within a tumor. These antigens include epitopes derived from oncogenic drivers, such as mutant KRAS and mutant p53, as well as epitopes arising from viral oncogenic proteins. In this review, we will discuss the efforts to target these public neoantigens using T cells engineered with off-the-shelf T cell receptors, and explore the challenges and strategies to achieving more effective T cell therapies, particularly in the context of solid tumors. The concept of neoantigens was first introduced by Old and Boyse in 1966, who described the presence of tumor-specific antigens that could stimulate an immune response. Since then, numerous studies have explored the role of neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy. A key finding is that most tumor-specific neoantigens are unique to each patient, making it challenging to develop effective treatments. However, recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting public neoantigens, which are shared across patients and uniformly expressed within a tumor. Mutant KRAS and mutant p53 are two of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer. These mutations can lead to the formation of neoantigens that are recognized by the immune system. Studies have shown that T cells engineered with T cell receptors (TCRs) targeting mutant KRAS and mutant p53 can induce potent anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, epitopes derived from viral oncogenic proteins, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have also been identified as potential targets for T cell therapy. One of the challenges in targeting public neoantigens is the limited immunogenicity of these antigens. Studies have shown that T cells engineered with TCRs targeting public neoantigens can induce potent anti-tumor responses, but the responses are often short-lived. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of public neoantigens, such as using adjuvants and cytokines to stimulate T cell activation. Another challenge in targeting public neoantigens is the heterogeneity of tumors. Studies have shown that tumors can exhibit significant heterogeneity, with different subclones expressing different neoantigens. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored strategies to identify and target the most immunogenic neoantigens within a tumor. In conclusion, targeting driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens using T cell receptor-based cellular therapy has emerged as a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. While there are challenges to achieving effective T cell therapies, recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting public neoantigens and explored strategies to enhance their immunogenicity. Further research is needed to fully realize the potential of this approach and to develop effective treatments for solid tumors.", "References": [{"title": "Old and Boyse, 1966", "authors": "Old, L.
