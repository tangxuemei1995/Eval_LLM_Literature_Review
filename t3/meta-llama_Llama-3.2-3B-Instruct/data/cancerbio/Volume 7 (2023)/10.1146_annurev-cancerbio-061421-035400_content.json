{"Literature Review": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a crucial component of the tumor microenvironment in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The prevalence of CAFs in PDAC is significantly higher than in other malignancies, with studies suggesting that they often outnumber cancer cells. The origin and function of CAFs are still not fully understood, and targeting this cell population as part of combination therapy has been challenging. Recent studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of CAFs, which is essential for understanding their complex role in PDAC. The concept of heterogeneity of origin is a topic of ongoing debate. Traditionally, it was believed that CAFs uniformly derive from pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). However, recent findings have challenged this notion, suggesting that multiple types of resident fibroblasts contribute to CAF expansion. For instance, a study by Liu et al. (2018) demonstrated that CAFs in PDAC can be classified into two distinct subpopulations based on their gene expression profiles. These subpopulations exhibit different functional roles, with one subset promoting tumor progression and the other subset inhibiting it. The heterogeneity in gene expression of CAFs further divides them into different subpopulations. A study by Wang et al. (2020) identified six distinct CAF subpopulations in PDAC, each with unique gene expression profiles and functional roles. These subpopulations were found to be associated with distinct clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of understanding CAF heterogeneity in PDAC. The functional role of CAFs is complex and multifaceted. CAFs deposit components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the high interstitial pressure in PDAC. This pressure can hinder the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to cancer cells, creating a low-nutrient environment that promotes tumor progression. CAFs also serve as 'feeder' cells for cancer cells, providing metabolites that mitigate the effects of this low-nutrient environment. Furthermore, CAFs regulate the function of the immune system, inhibiting antitumor immune responses. This immunosuppressive function of CAFs is mediated by the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines, which create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that favors tumor growth and progression. Understanding the functional role of different CAF populations and the drivers of each of their functional roles is essential for devising new ways to target this cell population in PDAC. In conclusion, the heterogeneity of CAFs is a key concept in understanding their complex role in PDAC. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional roles of different CAF subpopulations and the drivers of each of their functional roles. Targeting CAFs as part of combination therapy may offer new avenues for treating PDAC.", "References": [{"title": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2018", "volumes": "78(11)", "first page": "3491", "last page": "3502", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3246"}, {"title": "Pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts: a review", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "146(10)", "first page": "2695", "last page": "2706", "DOI": "10.1007/s00432-020-02945-4"}, {"title": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer: a review of the literature", "authors": "Santos, R.
