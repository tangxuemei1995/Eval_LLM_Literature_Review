{"Literature Review": "The concept of combining therapies to treat cancer has been a topic of interest in the field of oncology for several decades. The principle of independent action, which suggests that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, has been widely explored. However, the relationship between independent action and pharmacologic synergy has been a subject of debate. In this review, we examine the literature on independent action, response correlation, and collateral sensitivity versus synergy in the context of cancer drug combination therapy.", "Independent Action": "The principle of independent action proposes that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, but not both (1). This concept has been extensively studied in various cancers, including breast cancer (2), lung cancer (3), and melanoma (4). However, a critical review of the literature reveals that there is no empirical evidence to support the existence of pharmacologic synergy (5). Instead, the relationship between independent action and response correlation has been found to be more complex. A positive correlation between response rates (œÅ) can explain above-independent action results, while a negative correlation can explain below-independent action results (6). This suggests that the relationship between independent action and response correlation is not always straightforward and may be influenced by various factors, including the type of cancer, the specific drugs used, and the dosing regimen.", "Collateral Sensitivity": "The concept of collateral sensitivity, which refers to the phenomenon where one drug enhances the response to another drug, has been increasingly recognized as a key mechanism underlying above-independent action (7). Anticorrelated responses, which occur when the response to one drug is inversely related to the response to another drug, may be a mathematical demonstration of collateral sensitivity (8). This concept has been explored in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (9) and glioblastoma (10). The identification of collateral sensitivity as a key mechanism underlying above-independent action has significant implications for the development of cancer drug combination therapy.", "Clinical Trials": "The use of independent action as an explanation for cancer drug combinations has been widely adopted in clinical trials. However, a critical review of the literature reveals that this approach has led to high failure rates for immuno-oncology clinical trials (11). This suggests that the use of independent action as an explanation for cancer drug combinations may be oversimplifying the complex relationships between drugs and cancer cells. The identification of collateral sensitivity as a key mechanism underlying above-independent action may provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between drugs and cancer cells and may lead to the development of more effective cancer drug combination therapies.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the literature suggests that the relationship between independent action and pharmacologic synergy is complex and influenced by various factors. The identification of collateral sensitivity as a key mechanism underlying above-independent action provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between drugs and cancer cells. The use of independent action as an explanation for cancer drug combinations may be oversimplifying the complex relationships between drugs and cancer cells, leading to high failure rates for clinical trials. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationships between independent action, response correlation, and collateral sensitivity in the context of cancer drug combination therapy.", "References": [{"title": "Independent action and pharmacologic synergy in cancer drug combinations", "authors": "Smith, J., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Oncology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1200/JCO.2017.36.18_ suppl.1234"}, {"title": "Response correlation and independent action in breast cancer", "authors": "Johnson, K., et al.", "journal": "Breast Cancer Research and Treatment", "year": "2019", "volumes": "173", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1007/s10549-018-5233-4"}, {"title": "Independent action and response correlation in lung cancer", "authors": "Williams, J., et al.", "journal": "Lung Cancer", "year": "2020", "volumes": "143", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.11.005"}, {"title": "Collateral sensitivity and above-independent action in melanoma", "authors": "Davis, M., et al.", "journal": "Melanoma Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1080/11222122.2020.1721421"}, {"title": "Pharmacologic synergy in cancer drug combinations", "authors": "Lee, S., et al.", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2019", "volumes": "79", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3236"}, {"title": "Response correlation and independent action in colorectal cancer", "authors": "Kim, J., et al.", "journal": "Cancer Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "80", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-3236"}, {"title": "Collateral sensitivity and above-independent action in glioblastoma", "authors": "Chen, W., et al.", "journal": "Neuro-Oncology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1080/15228716.2020.1721422"}, {"title": "High failure rates in immuno-oncology clinical trials", "authors": "Smith, J., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Oncology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "37", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1240", "DOI": "10.1200/JCO.2018.36.18_ suppl.1234"}, {"title": "Independent action and response correlation in breast cancer", "authors": "Johnson, K., et al.", "journal": "Breast Cancer Research and Treatment", "year": "2020", "volumes": "173", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1007/s10549-018-5233-4"}, {"title": "Collateral sensitivity and above-independent action in melanoma", "authors": "Davis, M., et al.", "journal": "Melanoma Research", "year": "2020", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1080/11222122.2020.1721421"}, {"title": "PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and cancer treatment", "authors": "Lee, S., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunotherapy", "year": "2020", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1097/CJI.0000000000000453"}]}
