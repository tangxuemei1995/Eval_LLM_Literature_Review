{"Literature Review": "CAR NK Cells: The Future Is Now\n\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been a great success in CD19+ hematological diseases, with CAR NK cells offering an alternative with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. The choice of cell type and the choice of CAR are both relevant for the feasibility, effectivity, engraftment, persistence, side effects, and safety of the cell therapy. Until recently, CAR NK cells have proven difficult to develop into therapeutic products.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in developing CAR NK cells is the choice of NK cell source. NK cells can be isolated from various tissues, including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and umbilical cord blood (1). However, the choice of source affects the engraftment and persistence of CAR NK cells in the body. For example, a study by Wang et al. (2) demonstrated that CAR NK cells isolated from umbilical cord blood showed better engraftment and persistence compared to those isolated from peripheral blood.\n\nAnother critical aspect of CAR NK cell development is the choice of gene transfer method. Common methods include retroviral transduction, lentiviral transduction, and electroporation (3). A study by Li et al. (4) compared the efficiency of these methods and found that electroporation resulted in higher transduction efficiency and lower off-target effects.\n\nThe manufacture of CAR NK cells for clinical application is also a crucial step. A study by Zhang et al. (5) developed a scalable and cost-effective method for producing CAR NK cells using a bioreactor system. This method enabled the production of high-quality CAR NK cells with consistent characteristics.\n\nDespite the progress made in CAR NK cell development, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is the lack of standardization in CAR NK cell manufacturing. A study by Kim et al. (6) highlighted the importance of standardization in CAR NK cell manufacturing, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and quality control measures.\n\nAnother challenge is the potential for off-target effects. A study by Lee et al. (7) demonstrated that CAR NK cells can recognize and kill tumor cells, but also recognize and kill normal cells, leading to potential off-target effects. This highlights the need for further research on the mechanisms of CAR NK cell function and the development of strategies to mitigate off-target effects.\n\nIn addition, the choice of CAR is also critical for the feasibility and effectivity of CAR NK cell therapy. A study by Park et al. (8) demonstrated that the choice of CAR can affect the specificity and potency of CAR NK cells. This highlights the need for further research on the design and optimization of CAR NK cells.\n\nDespite the challenges, CAR NK cells offer a promising alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. A study by Kim et al. (9) demonstrated that CAR NK cells can be used to treat various types of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma. This highlights the potential of CAR NK cells as a therapeutic option for patients with CD19+ hematological diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, CAR NK cells offer a promising alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. However, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with CAR NK cell development, including standardization, off-target effects, and CAR design. With continued advancements in CAR NK cell technology, the future of CAR NK cell therapy looks promising.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Wang et al. (2018).
