{"Literature Review": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain's extracellular fluid, playing a crucial role in maintaining the brain's microenvironment and protecting it from harmful substances. The BBB's selective permeability is achieved through a complex interplay of tight junction proteins, ion channels, and transporters, which restrict the passage of molecules larger than 500 Da. This selective barrier is essential for the proper functioning of the brain, but it also poses a significant challenge for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB's role in limiting the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS has significant implications for the treatment of CNS tumors. Primary CNS tumors, such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma, have poor clinical outcomes, with median survival times ranging from 12 to 18 months. The incidence of CNS metastases from extracranial solid tumors is also on the rise, due in part to the increasing use of systemically active agents. Despite advances in surgical care and radiation therapy, the ability to deliver an effective dose of a therapeutic agent to all cancerous cells remains a significant challenge. Several studies have investigated the role of the BBB in limiting the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS. To overcome the limitations imposed by the BBB, researchers have developed various strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the CNS. Despite these advances, the development of effective treatments for CNS tumors remains a significant challenge. A nuanced examination of CNS drug exposure is needed to understand the complex interactions between the BBB, the brain's microenvironment, and the therapeutic agents being used. This requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving researchers from fields such as pharmacology, neuroscience, and engineering. In conclusion, the blood-brain barrier plays a critical role in limiting the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS, with significant implications for the treatment of CNS tumors. Further research is needed to develop effective strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the CNS, and to understand the complex interactions between the BBB, the brain's microenvironment, and the therapeutic agents being used.", "References": [{"title": "The blood-brain barrier: A review of its structure and function", "authors": "Farbman, A.
