{"Literature Review": "Immune cell metabolism and immuno-oncology have emerged as critical areas of research in the fight against cancer. The success of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cellular therapy has led to the establishment of immunotherapy as a treatment option for various types of cancer. However, the full potential of this treatment modality remains untapped, as tumors continue to evade immune destruction through various mechanisms. One key mechanism is metabolic reprogramming, which not only supports tumor growth but also creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This review aims to elucidate the major metabolic programs of cancer cells and immune cells, as well as the role of metabolic checkpoints that promote immune evasion and tumor growth. We will also discuss current and potential future strategies to target metabolism in order to enhance antitumor immune responses and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.", "References": [{"title": "Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells", "authors": "DeBerardinis, R.
