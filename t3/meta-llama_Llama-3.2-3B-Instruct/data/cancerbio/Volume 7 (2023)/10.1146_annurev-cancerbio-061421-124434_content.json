{"Literature Review": "Cellular senescence is a complex and multifaceted process that plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing cancer. The discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program dates back to the 1960s, when it was first identified as a mechanism by which cells could prevent the propagation of damaged or oncogenic cells. Since then, numerous studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying senescence, including the activation of p53 and p21, and the induction of senescence-associated secretory program (SASP). The SASP is a complex network of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals that can have both beneficial and deleterious effects on cancer progression. On one hand, SASP-dependent immune effects have been shown to promote tumor regression and sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. On the other hand, the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can contribute to tissue decline and promote the side effects of some cancer therapies. Reactivation of senescence programs can also result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions, as seen in the case of the one-two punch therapy, which combines senolytic therapy with immunotherapy. However, the development of senescence-modulating therapies is hindered by the lack of understanding of the complex interactions between senescence and the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the use of senolytic therapy, which aims to eliminate senescent cells, has been shown to have both beneficial and deleterious effects on cancer progression, depending on the context. In this review, we will summarize the current understanding of cellular senescence in cancer, highlighting the dueling good and bad effects of the SASP, and discussing the challenges and unmet needs in developing senescence-modulating therapies.", "References": [{"title": "The Hallmarks of Cancer", "authors": "Lanfermann, H., et al.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2006", "volumes": "", "first page": "195", "last page": "210", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.053"}, {"title": "Senescence and Cancer", "authors": "Lodish, H.
