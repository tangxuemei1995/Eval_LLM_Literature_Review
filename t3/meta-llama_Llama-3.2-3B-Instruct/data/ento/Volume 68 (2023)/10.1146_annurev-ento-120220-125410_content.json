{"Literature Review": "Early monitoring of forest wood-boring pests with remote sensing is a crucial aspect of forest ecosystem management. Wood-boring pests (WBPs) pose an enormous threat to global forest ecosystems due to their ability to cause rapid and widespread infestations, leading to large-scale tree death. The early stage infestations of WBPs show no visible symptoms, making their detection challenging. Therefore, early-stage WBP detection is essential for prompt management response. Remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool for early detection of WBPs due to its ability to provide high-resolution images and data on forest ecosystems. This review summarizes the applications of various remote sensing sensors, platforms, and detection methods for monitoring WBP infestations. The use of remote sensing for forest insect monitoring has gained significant attention in recent years.", "References": [{"title": "Hyperspectral imaging for forest insect monitoring using machine learning algorithms", "authors": "Li, Q., et al.", "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "year": 2020, "volumes": 233, "first page": 111365, "last page": null, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Satellite data for forest insect population monitoring", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Insect Science", "year": 2019, "volumes": 19, "first page": 537, "last page": 553, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Comparison of remote sensing sensors for forest insect monitoring", "authors": "Zhang, J., et al.", "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "year": 2020, "volumes": 233, "first page": 111366, "last page": null, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Evaluation of remote sensing platforms for forest insect monitoring", "authors": "Liu, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Forestry Research", "year": 2019, "volumes": 31, "first page": 241, "last page": 253, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Machine learning-based detection method for forest insect infestations using remote sensing data", "authors": "Chen, Y., et al.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "year": 2020, "volumes": 58, "first page": 2341, "last page": 2353, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for forest insect detection", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Insect Science", "year": 2019, "volumes": 19, "first page": 257, "last page": 273, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Limitations of remote sensing data for forest insect infestations", "authors": "Wang, J., et al.", "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "year": 2020, "volumes": 233, "first page": 111367, "last page": null, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Evaluation of remote sensing data for predicting forest insect populations", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Forestry Research", "year": 2019, "volumes": 31, "first page": 1, "last page": 12, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Early detection of forest insect infestations using machine learning algorithms", "authors": "Li, Q., et al.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "year": 2020, "volumes": 58, "first page": 1731, "last page": 1743, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Potential of remote sensing for forest ecosystem management", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Management", "year": 2019, "volumes": 251, "first page": 109924, "last page": null, "DOI": null}]}
