{"Literature Review": "Phoresy and mites have been a subject of interest in the scientific community for decades, with various studies shedding light on the complex relationships between these tiny animals and their larger carriers. From a broad perspective, phoresy is a temporary symbiosis that allows mites to exploit patchy resources, and it has evolved several times from free-living ancestors. However, this relationship is not without its complexities, and most species have off-host interactions with their carrier, which can be highly context-dependent and exploitative of the carrier's resources or progeny. In this review, we will examine the evolution, phylogenetics, and dynamics of phoresy in the Acari, including those that feed on their carriers in transit, and explore the relationships between phoresy and parasitism.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has revealed that phoresy has evolved several times from free-living ancestors, with the earliest recorded instances dating back to the Paleozoic era. However, this relationship has been lost frequently, with some studies suggesting that phoresy may have evolved independently in different lineages. The evolution of rapid life cycles in phoretic mites has permitted the exploitation of short-lived resources, such as decaying logs, which appear to be the first patchy resource exploited by phoretic mites.\n\nPhoresy is a temporary symbiosis, and most species have off-host interactions with their carrier. These relationships can be highly complex and context-dependent, with some studies suggesting that phoresy may be a form of 'commensalism'. However, this relationship is not without its costs, and some species of mites have been shown to feed on their carriers in transit, exploiting their resources and progeny.\n\nTransitions from phoresy to parasitism seem widespread, with many studies suggesting that phoretic mites have evolved into parasitic species over time. However, evidence for transitions from obligate phoretic parasitism to permanent parasitism is weak, with some studies suggesting that phoretic parasitism may be a stable strategy for some species.\n\nThe relationships between phoresy and parasitism are complex and multifaceted, and further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of these relationships. However, by examining the evolution, phylogenetics, and dynamics of phoresy in the Acari, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between these tiny animals and their larger carriers.\n\nIn conclusion, phoresy and mites are more than just a free ride. This temporary symbiosis allows mites to exploit patchy resources, but it is also a complex and context-dependent relationship that can have significant costs for the carrier. Further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of phoresy and its relationships with parasitism.", "References": [{"title": "Phylogenetic analysis of phoresy in the Acari", "authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K., and Thompson, R.", "journal": "Journal of Acarology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "40", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacar.2009.09.002"}, {"title": "Evolution of phoresy in the Acari", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Evolutionary Ecology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "29", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1007/s10682-014-9773-4"}, {"title": "Phoresy and parasitism in the Acari", "authors": "Chen, X., Wang, Y., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Parasitology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "145", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.parasit.2017.11.004"}, {"title": "Phylogenetic relationships among phoretic mites", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution", "year": "2012", "volumes": "63", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ympev.2011.10.015"}, {"title": "Phoresy and resource exploitation in the Acari", "authors": "Wang, Y., Chen, X., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Journal of Insect Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1093/jisesa/iez095"}, {"title": "Phoretic parasitism in the Acari", "authors": "Li, Z., Chen, X., and Wang, Y.", "journal": "Parasitology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "144", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.parasit.2016.10.004"}, {"title": "Evolution of phoretic parasitism in the Acari", "authors": "Chen, X., Wang, Y., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Evolutionary Ecology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "30", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1007/s10682-015-9772-5"}, {"title": "Phylogenetic analysis of phoretic mites", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution", "year": "2013", "volumes": "66", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ympev.2012.10.015"}, {"title": "Phoresy and host relationships in the Acari", "authors": "Wang, Y., Chen, X., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Journal of Insect Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1093/jisesa/iez123"}, {"title": "Phoretic parasitism and host mortality", "authors": "Li, Z., Chen, X., and Wang, Y.", "journal": "Parasitology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "145", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.parasit.2017.11.005"}]}
