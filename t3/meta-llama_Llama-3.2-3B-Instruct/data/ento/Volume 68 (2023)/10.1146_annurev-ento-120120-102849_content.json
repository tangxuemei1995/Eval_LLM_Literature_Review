{"Literature Review": "The study of arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has significantly advanced our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages. The functional feeding group–damage type system has been instrumental in analyzing these interactions, providing valuable insights into the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. This literature review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge in this field, focusing on the major questions that have been addressed and those that remain to be explored.\n\nThe early fossil record provides a unique window into the history of herbivory, with evidence of arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants dating back to the Neoproterozoic era (1). The earliest fossil record of herbivory is found in the fossilized remains of ancient plants, such as those found in the 420-Myr-old Rhynie chert (2). These early interactions likely played a crucial role in shaping the evolution of plant morphology and ecology.\n\nThe Permian–Triassic ecological crisis had a profound impact on herbivore diversity, leading to the formation of biologically diverse herbivore communities on gymnosperms (3). This crisis also marked the beginning of the end of the Permian period, with widespread extinctions and a significant shift in the global climate (4). The subsequent expansion of angiosperms led to a major shift in herbivory, with new groups of herbivores emerging to exploit the diverse range of plant species (5).\n\nStudies of herbivory resulting from more recent transient spikes and longer-term climate trends have provided valuable insights into the responses of herbivore communities to environmental change (6, 7). For example, research on the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) has shown that herbivore communities responded to the rapid warming of the climate by shifting their ranges and behavior (8). Similarly, studies of the Cretaceous–Paleogene ecologic crisis have highlighted the importance of herbivore diversity in maintaining ecosystem resilience (9).\n\nThe expansion of databases that include a multitude of specimens has greatly improved our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages (10). Improvements in sampling strategies and the development of new analytical methods have also enabled researchers to address conceptually stimulating ecological and evolutionary questions (11). For example, studies of the differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms have provided insights into the evolution of plant morphology and ecology (12).\n\nOngoing paleoecological themes remaining to be addressed include the antiquity of modern interactions, the differential herbivory between ferns and angiosperms, and the origins of modern tropical forests. Further research is needed to address these questions and to continue advancing our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of arthropod and pathogen interactions with plants has significantly advanced our understanding of herbivory in fossil plant assemblages. Further research is needed to address the remaining questions and to continue exploring the origins and evolution of herbivory on land.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Briggs, D. E. G., & Crowther, T. N.
