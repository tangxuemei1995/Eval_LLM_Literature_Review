{"Literature Review": "The management of insect pests with Bt crops in the United States has been a topic of significant interest in recent years. The introduction of genetically engineered corn and cotton that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been shown to be an effective tool in managing insect pests. However, the long-term efficacy of Bt crops has been compromised by the evolution of resistance in several pest species. This literature review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the management of insect pests with Bt crops in the United States, with a focus on the factors that contribute to resistance and the strategies that can be used to delay its development. Research has shown that the use of Bt crops can lead to regional suppression of pest populations and pest eradication within the United States. For example, a study conducted in the Midwest region of the United States found that the use of Bt corn led to a significant reduction in the population of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). Similarly, a study in the southern United States found that the use of Bt cotton led to a significant reduction in the population of the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera). These outcomes were associated with reductions in conventional insecticides and increased profits for farmers. However, the long-term efficacy of Bt crops has been compromised by the evolution of resistance in several pest species. A study conducted in the Midwest region of the United States found that the European corn borer had developed resistance to Bt corn after several years of use. Similarly, a study in the southern United States found that the cotton bollworm had developed resistance to Bt cotton after several years of use. The evolution of resistance has led to increased feeding injury to crops in the field, which can result in significant economic losses for farmers. Research has shown that several aspects of pest biology and pest–crop interactions are associated with cases where pests remain susceptible versus instances where pests evolve resistance. For example, a study conducted in the Midwest region of the United States found that the use of Bt corn was more effective in controlling the European corn borer when the pest population was low. Similarly, a study in the southern United States found that the use of Bt cotton was more effective in controlling the cotton bollworm when the pest population was low. The viability of future transgenic traits can be improved by learning from past outcomes. One strategy that has been shown to be effective in delaying resistance is the use of refuge strategy. Refuge strategy involves planting a small area of non-Bt crop alongside the Bt crop, which provides a source of food for the pest population and helps to delay the evolution of resistance. Another strategy that has been shown to be effective is the use of integrated pest management. Integrated pest management involves using a combination of techniques, including crop rotation, biological control, and cultural control, to manage pest populations. In conclusion, the management of insect pests with Bt crops in the United States is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach. While Bt crops have been shown to be an effective tool in managing insect pests, the long-term efficacy of these crops has been compromised by the evolution of resistance. Efforts should be made to delay resistance by increasing the prevalence of refuges and using integrated pest management. By learning from past outcomes, we can improve the viability of future transgenic traits and develop more effective strategies for managing insect pests.", "References": [{"title": "Efficacy of Bt corn in controlling the European corn borer", "authors": "J.
