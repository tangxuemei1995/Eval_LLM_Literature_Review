{"Literature Review": "Historical and Contemporary Control Options Against Bed Bugs, Cimex spp. \n\nBed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) are an important group of obligate hematophagous urban insect pests. The global resurgence of bed bugs, involving the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L., and the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), over the past two decades is believed to be primarily due to the development of insecticide resistance, along with global travel and poor pest management, which have contributed to their spread. This review examines and synthesizes the literature on bed bug origins and their global spread and the literature on historical and contemporary control options. This includes bed bug prevention, detection and monitoring, nonchemical and chemical control methodologies (and their limitations), and potential future control options. Future research needs are highlighted, especially the factors behind the modern resurgence, the necessity of identifying differences between the two bed bug species relevant to control, and the need to improve insecticide test protocols and management strategies.\n\nThe origins of bed bugs date back to ancient times, with evidence of their presence in human dwellings found in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome (1). However, the modern resurgence of bed bugs is believed to have begun in the 1970s in the United States, where they were first detected in the 1980s (2). The global spread of bed bugs has been facilitated by international travel, trade, and human migration (3). The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius L., is found in temperate regions, while the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), is found in tropical and subtropical regions (4).\n\nHistorical control options against bed bugs have included the use of insecticides, such as pyrethroids and organophosphates, as well as nonchemical methods, such as heat treatment and sealing of cracks and crevices (5). However, the development of insecticide resistance has limited the effectiveness of these methods (6). In recent years, there has been a shift towards nonchemical control methods, such as the use of mattress encasements and bed bug interceptors (7).\n\nContemporary control options against bed bugs include the use of chemical insecticides, such as neem oil and permethrin, as well as nonchemical methods, such as cold treatment and steam cleaning (8). The use of bed bug interceptors and mattress encasements has also been shown to be effective in preventing bed bug infestations (9). However, the limitations of these methods, including the development of resistance and the need for repeated treatments, highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to bed bug control.\n\nOne of the key challenges in controlling bed bugs is the difficulty in detecting them. Bed bugs are small and can be difficult to spot, especially in the early stages of infestation (10). However, the use of bed bug detection kits and the implementation of regular monitoring programs can help to identify infestations early, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, the resurgence of bed bugs is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach to control. Historical and contemporary control options, including nonchemical and chemical methods, have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating bed bug infestations. However, the development of resistance and the need for repeated treatments highlight the need for a more sustainable approach to bed bug control. Future research should focus on identifying the factors behind the modern resurgence, the necessity of identifying differences between the two bed bug species relevant to control, and the need to improve insecticide test protocols and management strategies.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
