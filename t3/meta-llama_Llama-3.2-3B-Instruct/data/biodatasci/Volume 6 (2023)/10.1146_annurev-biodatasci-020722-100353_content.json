{"Literature Review": "Statistical learning methods have revolutionized the field of neuroimaging data analysis, enabling researchers to extract valuable insights from complex neuroimaging data. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), have been widely used to study the brain's structure and function. However, the increasing availability of large-scale neuroimaging datasets has introduced new statistical challenges, including data heterogeneity, study design, and population-based analysis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive survey of statistical challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, from neuroimaging techniques to large-scale neuroimaging studies and statistical learning methods. We briefly review eight popular neuroimaging techniques and their potential applications in neuroscience research and clinical translation. We delineate four themes of neuroimaging data and review major image processing analysis methods for processing neuroimaging data at the individual level. We briefly review four large-scale neuroimaging-related studies and a consortium on imaging genomics and discuss four themes of neuroimaging data analysis at the population level. We review nine major population-based statistical analysis methods and their associated statistical challenges and present recent progress in statistical methodology to address these challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Causal pathway inference in neuroimaging data using Bayesian networks", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.
