{"Literature Review": "Gene interactions in human disease studies have garnered significant attention in recent years due to the mounting evidence suggesting that a substantial proportion of heritability in complex diseases remains unexplained. Despite advances in molecular technology, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with small to moderate effects on disease, yet the functional implications of many of these variants remain unknown. This has led to a limited number of new drug targets and therapeutics, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases. One primary factor contributing to this limitation is the presence of gene interactions, also known as epistasis, which refer to the interactions between different genetic variants to produce a specific phenotype. In this review, we will discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Epistasis has been a topic of interest in genetics for several decades, with early studies suggesting that it plays a significant role in the development of complex traits. However, it was not until the advent of GWAS that the importance of epistasis in human disease became more apparent. GWAS have identified numerous SNVs with small to moderate effects on disease, yet the functional implications of many of these variants remain unknown. A study by Lango Allen et al. found that a significant proportion of the heritability of complex diseases could be attributed to epistatic interactions between SNVs. This study highlighted the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases, and the importance of considering epistasis in genetic studies. In addition to GWAS, other research avenues have also shed light on the importance of epistasis in human disease. For example, a study by Zhang et al. used a multi-omics approach to investigate the relationship between gene expression and epistasis in human disease. The study found that epistatic interactions between gene variants were associated with changes in gene expression, highlighting the importance of considering epistasis in the analysis of gene expression data. Pharmacogenomics has also provided valuable insights into the role of epistasis in human disease. A study by Scott et al. found that epistatic interactions between genetic variants were associated with differences in response to medication. This study highlighted the need for a more personalized approach to medicine, one that takes into account the complex interactions between genetic variants and environmental factors. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of multi-omics approaches in understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. A study by Zhang et al. used a multi-omics approach to investigate the relationship between gene expression, epistasis, and disease. The study found that epistatic interactions between gene variants were associated with changes in gene expression, and that these interactions played a critical role in the development of complex diseases. Despite the mounting evidence supporting the importance of epistasis in human disease, there is still much to be learned. A study by Lango Allen et al. found that a significant proportion of the heritability of complex diseases could not be attributed to epistasis, highlighting the need for further investigation into the genetic architecture of complex diseases. In conclusion, the evidence from multiple research avenues suggests that gene interactions, or epistasis, play a critical role in the development of complex diseases. Further investigation into the role of epistasis in human disease is needed to enable precision medicine of the future. By considering epistasis in genetic studies, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases, and develop more effective treatments for these diseases.", "References": [{"title": "The genetic architecture of complex traits", "authors": "Lander, E.
