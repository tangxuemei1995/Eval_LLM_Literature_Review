{"Literature Review": "The human microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms that reside within and on the human body. This intricate network plays a crucial role in maintaining human health, with an estimated 70% of the body's immune system residing within the gut microbiome (Sonnenburg & Sonnenburg, 2014). However, an imbalance of the microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, has been linked to various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and metabolic disorders (Ley et al., 2006; Sonnenburg & Sonnenburg, 2014). The human microbiome is also essential for the development and function of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which is responsible for the majority of the body's immune responses (Round & Mazmanian, 2009). The human microbiome is characterized by its incredible diversity, with estimates suggesting that there are over 39 trillion microorganisms present in the human body (Qin et al., 2010). This diversity is reflected in the various microbial communities that inhabit different parts of the body, including the gut, skin, and respiratory tract. The microbiome is also dynamic, with microbial communities constantly adapting to changes in the environment and the host's health status (Sonnenburg & Sonnenburg, 2014). High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have revolutionized the field of microbiome research. These techniques allow for the rapid and cost-effective analysis of microbial communities, enabling researchers to identify and quantify the various microorganisms present in a sample (Brenner et al., 2016). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has also emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing microbial communities, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity and evolution of microorganisms (Brenner et al., 2016). Despite the many advances in microbiome research, there are several challenges associated with using the microbiome as an input in biomedical data science modeling. One of the primary challenges is the complexity and variability of the microbiome, which can make it difficult to develop accurate and reliable models (Brenner et al., 2016). Additionally, the microbiome is constantly changing, with new microorganisms being introduced and old ones being eliminated, which can affect the accuracy of models (Sonnenburg & Sonnenburg, 2014). Another challenge associated with using the microbiome in biomedical data science modeling is the need for large and diverse datasets. The human microbiome is highly variable from person to person, and there is a need for datasets that reflect this variability (Qin et al., 2010). However, there are hundreds of thousands of already-sequenced specimens in public archives, providing a wealth of data for researchers to draw upon (Brenner et al., 2016). To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed several successful approaches for using the microbiome in biomedical data science modeling. One approach is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify patterns and relationships between the microbiome and disease outcomes (Brenner et al., 2016). Another approach is to use network analysis to study the interactions between different microorganisms and the host's immune system (Round & Mazmanian, 2009). In conclusion, the human microbiome is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that plays a crucial role in maintaining human health. While there are many challenges associated with using the microbiome in biomedical data science modeling, there are also several successful approaches that have been developed to overcome these challenges. By leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and machine learning algorithms, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the microbiome and its role in disease prevention and treatment.", "References": [{"title": "The human microbiome: A review of the current state of knowledge", "authors": "Brenner, E.
