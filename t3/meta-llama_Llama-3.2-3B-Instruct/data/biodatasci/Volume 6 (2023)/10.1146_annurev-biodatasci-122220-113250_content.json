{"Literature Review": "The importance of diversity in precision medicine has been increasingly recognized in recent years, particularly in the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS have revolutionized our understanding of common genetic variation and its impact on common human disease and traits. However, the initial GWAS landscape was predominantly composed of European populations, neglecting the genetic diversity of non-European descent populations. This limitation has significant implications for the generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups, which is crucial for the identification of disease susceptibility variants. The GWAS revolution was swift and specific, leading to the establishment of a genotype–phenotype catalog that is now recognized as inadequate for a complete understanding of complex human genetics. The catalog is predominantly based on data from European populations, which may not accurately represent the genetic diversity of other populations. This limitation has led to concerns about the applicability of GWAS findings to non-European descent populations. In recent years, efforts have been made to augment the genotype–phenotype catalog by studying non-European descent populations and establishing collaborative consortia to promote data sharing and analysis. These consortia have provided valuable resources for the discovery of genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. For example, the African Genome-Wide Association Study (AGWA) consortium has identified several novel associations with complex traits in African populations. Similarly, the East Asian Genome-Wide Association Study (EAGAS) consortium has identified associations with several complex traits in East Asian populations. The use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) has also been proposed as a way to improve the generalizability of GWAS findings across ancestry groups. PRS combines multiple genetic variants to predict an individual's risk of developing a complex trait. However, the performance of PRS can be limited by the availability of data from diverse populations. Therefore, it is essential to develop and validate PRS in diverse populations to ensure their accuracy and applicability. In conclusion, the importance of diversity in precision medicine cannot be overstated, particularly in the context of GWAS. The generalizability of genetic associations across ancestry groups is crucial for the identification of disease susceptibility variants. Efforts to augment the genotype–phenotype catalog and promote data sharing and analysis have provided valuable resources for the discovery of genome-wide associations in non-European descent populations. Further research is needed to develop and validate PRS in diverse populations and to ensure the accuracy and applicability of GWAS findings across ancestry groups.", "References": [{"title": "Genome-wide association studies: past, present and future", "authors": "Lango Allen, et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Genetics", "year": "2010", "volumes": "11", "first page": "49", "last page": "56", "DOI": "10.1038/nrg2776"}, {"title": "The genetic architecture of human disease", "authors": "Lander, E.
