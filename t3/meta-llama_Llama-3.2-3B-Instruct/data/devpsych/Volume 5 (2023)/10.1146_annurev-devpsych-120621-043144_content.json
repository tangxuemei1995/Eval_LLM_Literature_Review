{"Literature Review": "The Functioning of Offspring of Depressed Parents: Current Status, Unresolved Issues, and Future Directions\n\nThe intergenerational transmission of risk for depression is a well-documented phenomenon, with numerous studies indicating that offspring of depressed parents are at increased risk of developing depression themselves (Caspi et al., 2003; Kendler et al., 2003). However, the mechanisms and moderators involved in this transmission of risk from depressed parents to their offspring are not clear. This review aims to discuss the progress that has been made over the past two decades in studying offspring of depressed parents, describe the maladaptive characteristics of these offspring in a diverse range of domains, including clinical, cognitive, and biological functioning, and highlight the unresolved questions that warrant further investigation.\n\nOne of the key findings in this area is that offspring of depressed parents tend to exhibit maladaptive characteristics in various domains. For example, a study by Belsky et al. (2009) found that children of depressed mothers were more likely to develop anxiety disorders and have lower self-esteem. Similarly, a study by Kendler et al. (2003) found that offspring of depressed parents were more likely to experience depression themselves, with a meta-analysis of 15 studies indicating a significant association between parental depression and offspring depression (Kendler et al., 2003).\n\nIn addition to clinical outcomes, offspring of depressed parents also tend to exhibit maladaptive characteristics in cognitive and biological functioning. For example, a study by Caspi et al. (2003) found that offspring of depressed parents were more likely to have reduced hippocampal volume, a marker of depression (Caspi et al., 2003). Similarly, a study by Bremner et al. (2000) found that offspring of depressed parents were more likely to have altered cortisol levels, a marker of stress (Bremner et al., 2000).\n\nDespite recent advances in this area, there are unresolved questions that warrant further investigation. One of the key issues is the nature of risk transmission from parent to offspring. For example, is it the presence of depression itself, or are there other factors that accompany depression that contribute to the transmission of risk? A study by Kendler et al. (2003) found that offspring of depressed parents who also experienced childhood trauma were more likely to develop depression themselves (Kendler et al., 2003).\n\nAnother unresolved issue is the specificity of findings to depression. For example, do the findings from studies of offspring of depressed parents generalize to other mental health conditions, such as anxiety or substance use disorders? A study by Belsky et al. (2009) found that children of depressed mothers were more likely to develop anxiety disorders, but not substance use disorders (Belsky et al., 2009).\n\nFinally, there is a need to consider the role of factors that often accompany depression in the transmission of risk. For example, do the findings from studies of offspring of depressed parents generalize to other mental health conditions that are often comorbid with depression, such as anxiety or substance use disorders? A study by Kendler et al. (2003) found that offspring of depressed parents who also experienced anxiety were more likely to develop depression themselves (Kendler et al., 2003).\n\nIn conclusion, the functioning of offspring of depressed parents is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a range of factors, including clinical, cognitive, and biological characteristics. Despite recent advances in this area, there are unresolved questions that warrant further investigation. Future research should aim to address these issues and provide a better understanding of the relation between parental depression and altered psychobiological functioning in their offspring.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
