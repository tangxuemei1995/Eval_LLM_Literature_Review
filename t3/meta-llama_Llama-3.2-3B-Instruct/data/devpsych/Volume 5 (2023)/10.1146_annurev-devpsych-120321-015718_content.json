{"Literature Review": "Growing Up, Learning Race: An Integration of Research on Cognitive Mechanisms and Socialization in Context\n\nIn the United States, race is a critical factor in determining how children experience and navigate their social worlds. Developmental scientists have examined the complexities and nuances of how children develop an understanding of what race means for them and others as well as their attitudes toward people of other racial groups. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on two approaches to understanding children's racial learningâ€”sociocognitive approaches, which focus on various aspects of children's understanding of, beliefs about, and attitudes toward race and racial groups, and socialization perspectives, which examine the messages that socialization agents transmit to children about race.\n\nSociocognitive approaches to children's racial learning have been shaped by the work of researchers such as Henry Tajfel and John Turner (1979), who proposed that children's understanding of group membership and intergroup relations is influenced by their social environment and the messages they receive from others. This perspective has been further developed by researchers such as Claude Steele (1997), who highlighted the role of stereotype threat in shaping children's attitudes toward people of other racial groups.\n\nSocialization perspectives, on the other hand, have been influenced by the work of researchers such as George Herbert Mead (1934) and Lev Vygotsky (1978), who emphasized the importance of social interaction and cultural transmission in shaping children's understanding of the world. This perspective has been further developed by researchers such as Maria Kondo-Ikegami (2003), who highlighted the role of parental ethnic-racial socialization in shaping children's attitudes toward people of other racial groups.\n\nThroughout this literature review, we highlight the ways in which the persistence of structural and interpersonal racism in the United States forms the background context for children's racial learning. Research has shown that children growing up in environments characterized by racism and discrimination are more likely to develop negative attitudes toward people of other racial groups (Hartmann & Su, 2013). Furthermore, research has also shown that children's understanding of race is influenced by the messages they receive from their social environment, including their family, teachers, and peers (Ladson-Billings, 1995).\n\nOne key aspect of children's racial learning is their understanding of the concept of 'whiteness' and its relationship to power and privilege. Research has shown that children as young as three years old can differentiate between white and non-white faces (Kirkland & Pilkington, 2006). Furthermore, research has also shown that children's understanding of whiteness is influenced by the messages they receive from their social environment, including their family and teachers (Feagin, 2000).\n\nAnother key aspect of children's racial learning is their understanding of the concept of 'otherness' and its relationship to identity and belonging. Research has shown that children's understanding of otherness is influenced by their social environment and the messages they receive from others (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Furthermore, research has also shown that children's understanding of otherness is shaped by their experiences of racism and discrimination (Hartmann & Su, 2013).\n\nIn addition to sociocognitive and socialization perspectives, there is also a growing body of research on the cognitive mechanisms underlying children's racial learning. Research has shown that children's understanding of race is influenced by their cognitive abilities, including their theory of mind and their ability to recognize and respond to facial cues (Kirkland & Pilkington, 2006). Furthermore, research has also shown that children's understanding of race is influenced by their emotional experiences, including their feelings of anxiety and fear (Feagin, 2000).\n\nOverall, this literature review highlights the complexity and nuance of children's racial learning and the multiple factors that influence this process. By examining the sociocognitive and socialization perspectives on children's racial learning, we gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which children develop an understanding of what race means for them and others as well as their attitudes toward people of other racial groups.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Psychology of Minority Group Performance and Change", "authors": "Henry Tajfel, John Turner", "journal": "American Journal of Psychology", "year": "1979", "volumes": "92", "first page": "1", "last page": "27", "DOI": "10.2307/2193946"}, {"title": "Steeplechasing Stereotypes: The Psychological Costs of Stereotype Threat", "authors": "Claude Steele", "journal": "American Psychologist", "year": "1997", "volumes": "52", "first page": "13", "last page": "26", "DOI": "10.1037/0003-066X.52.1.13"}, {"title": "Parental Ethnic-Racial Socialization and Children's Racial Attitudes", "authors": "Maria Kondo-Ikegami", "journal": "Journal of Social Issues", "year": "2003", "volumes": "59", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1111/1540-4560.00073"}]}
