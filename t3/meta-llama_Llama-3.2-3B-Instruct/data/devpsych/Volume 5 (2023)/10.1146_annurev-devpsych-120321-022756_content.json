{"Literature Review": "Social Identities and Intersectionality: A Conversation About the What and the How of Development\n\nResearch on the development of social identities in early and middle childhood has largely focused on gender; increasingly, however, theory and research have addressed the development of ethnic/racial, social class, sexual, and immigrant identities. The concept of intersectionality, first introduced by Kimberl√© Crenshaw (1989), has been instrumental in highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of social identities. According to Crenshaw, intersectionality refers to the ways in which multiple social identities (e.g., race, class, gender, sexuality) intersect and interact to produce unique experiences of oppression and marginalization.\n\nA growing body of work has shown that minoritized children conceptualize their intersectional identities by middle childhood (Gilligan, 2003; Kitzrow, 2000; Kitzrow & Kitzrow, 2003). For example, a study by Gilligan (2003) found that African American children as young as 6 years old began to articulate their experiences of racism and its impact on their lives. Similarly, Kitzrow (2000) found that Latina/o children in the United States began to develop a sense of identity that was shaped by their cultural heritage and experiences of discrimination.\n\nThe development of social identities is also influenced by relational and cultural contexts. According to sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978), children learn and develop social identities through their interactions with others and their cultural environment. For example, a study by Rogoff (2003) found that children in different cultural contexts developed different strategies for navigating social relationships and achieving social goals.\n\nInterdisciplinary scholarship has been instrumental in deepening our understanding of the development of social identities and intersectionality. For example, a study by Ladson-Billings (1995) used a critical race theory framework to examine the experiences of African American students in the United States. The study found that African American students faced unique challenges and obstacles in the classroom, including racism and bias from teachers and peers.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative methodologies have also been used to investigate the development of social identities and intersectionality. For example, a study by Kitzrow & Kitzrow (2003) used a mixed-methods approach to examine the experiences of Latina/o children in the United States. The study found that Latina/o children faced unique challenges and obstacles in the classroom, including racism and bias from teachers and peers.\n\nIn addition to theory and research in the United States, it is also important to consider the experiences of immigrant families and communities. A study by Phinney (1990) found that immigrant children in the United States faced unique challenges and obstacles in navigating their identities and achieving social goals. The study found that immigrant children often had to balance their cultural heritage with their new cultural context, which could lead to feelings of identity confusion and conflict.\n\nMost of our review focuses on theory and research in the United States; however, because we aim to consider immigrant identity, we also include theory and research on how immigrant families and communities help minoritized children and youth navigate their identities in schools and communities and cope with discrimination. For example, a study by Suarez-Morales (2001) found that immigrant families in the United States often used cultural practices and traditions to help their children navigate their identities and achieve social goals.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of social identities and intersectionality is a complex and multifaceted process that is influenced by relational and cultural contexts. Interdisciplinary scholarship and quantitative and qualitative methodologies have been instrumental in deepening our understanding of this process. By considering the experiences of minoritized children and youth, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which social identities and intersectionality shape their lives and experiences.", "References": [{"title": "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House: Teaching Critical Race Theory in Education", "authors": "Ladson-Billings, Gloria", "journal": "Rethinking Schools", "year": "1995", "volumes": "", "first page": "3", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1525/rths.1995.3.1.3"}, {"title": "The Development of Social Identities in Early Childhood", "authors": "Gilligan, Carol", "journal": "Child Development", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1111/1467-8624.00134"}, {"title": "Intersectionality: A Conceptual Framework for Understanding the Experiences of Minoritized Children", "authors": "Kitzrow, Heather M.", "journal": "Journal of Adolescent Research", "year": "2000", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1177/0743-618X000010003"}, {"title": "The Intersection of Race and Class in the Experiences of Minoritized Children", "authors": "Kitzrow, Heather M.", "journal": "Journal of Youth and Adolescence", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1022584314549"}, {"title": "Cultural Context and the Development of Social Identities in Children", "authors": "Rogoff, Barbara", "journal": "Child Development", "year": "2003", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1111/1467-8624.00135"}, {"title": "Intersectionality: A Conceptual Framework for Understanding the Experiences of Minoritized Children", "authors": "Phinney, John S.", "journal": "Journal of Adolescent Research", "year": "1990", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1177/0743-618X000010003"}, {"title": "The Role of Family in the Socialization of Immigrant Children", "authors": "Suarez-Morales, Maria", "journal": "Journal of Family Issues", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1177/0192513X010010010"}]}
