{"Literature Review": "The response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change is a critical area of research, as it plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Over 70% of SOC is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground, and a portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. In this review, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Research has shown that warming can lead to increased SOC decomposition and release of CO2. Additionally, warming can alter the composition of microbial communities, leading to changes in SOC cycling. Shifting precipitation patterns can also impact SOC cycling, with some studies showing that increased precipitation can lead to increased SOC decomposition. However, other studies have found that changes in precipitation patterns can also lead to increased SOC storage. Elevated CO2 levels can also impact SOC cycling, with some studies showing that increased CO2 can lead to increased SOC decomposition. However, other studies have found that increased CO2 can also lead to increased SOC storage. Land use and land cover change can also impact SOC cycling, with some studies showing that changes in land use can lead to increased SOC storage. However, other studies have found that changes in land use can also lead to decreased SOC storage. Despite the complexity of SOC cycling, there is evidence to suggest that deep SOC responses to global change differ from surface SOC responses. In conclusion, the response of deep SOC to global change is a complex and multifaceted area of research. Further studies are needed to fully understand the impacts of global change on deep SOC cycling. Incorporating deep soils into manipulations, measurements, and models is crucial for accurately predicting the response of deep SOC to global change.", "References": [{"title": "The impact of warming on soil organic carbon decomposition", "authors": "Schimel, J.
