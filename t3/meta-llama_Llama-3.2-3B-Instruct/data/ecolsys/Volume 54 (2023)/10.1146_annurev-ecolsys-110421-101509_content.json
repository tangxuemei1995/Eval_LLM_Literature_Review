{"Literature Review": "The origin of life is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been extensively studied in the fields of astrobiology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology. One of the most widely accepted theories is that life emerged from simple prebiotic chemistry, with the reaction between CO2 and H2 being a crucial step in the formation of organics (1). Hydrothermal systems, such as those found on Earth and other planets, provide a structured, far-from-equilibrium environment that drives this reaction and promotes the self-organization of molecules into protocells (2). These protocells are thought to have generated a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism, including CO2 fixation (3). This process is believed to have occurred through the action of enzymes, which are thought to have emerged through the direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network (4). The genetic code, which is the set of rules that governs the translation of genetic information into proteins, is also thought to have emerged through these interactions (5). Random genetic sequences are believed to have template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells (6). This context-dependent emergence of information gives rise to an autotrophic last universal common ancestor (LUCA), which is thought to have been the first self-replicating molecule on Earth (7). The emergence of genes and molecular machines is thought to have been driven by the need for increased complexity and the promotion of growth through positive feedback loops (8). The role of FeS clusters in the generation of proton-motive force, which is a key energy source for many metabolic processes, is also an area of active research (9). The RNA world hypothesis, which proposes that RNA was the first molecule to store and transmit genetic information, is also supported by evidence from various fields, including biochemistry and evolutionary biology (10). Overall, the origin of life is a complex and multifaceted topic that is still not fully understood, but the study of life as a guide to its own origins provides a powerful framework for understanding the emergence of complex systems and the origins of life on Earth and elsewhere in the universe.", "References": [{"title": "The origin of life: a review of the evidence", "authors": "J.
