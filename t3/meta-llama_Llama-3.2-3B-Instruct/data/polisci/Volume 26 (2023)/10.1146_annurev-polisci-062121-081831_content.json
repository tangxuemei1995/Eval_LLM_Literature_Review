{"Literature Review": "The assertion of women's power in the developing world challenges established concepts of political and economic development. Research has long highlighted the subordination of women in the Global South, but recent studies have identified striking models of women's power in this region. This literature review examines the existing knowledge on women's negotiation of power in the developing world, with a focus on state development, policy-making processes, and intrafamily negotiations.At the macro level, research has shown that the subordination of women has been central to the creation and modern infrastructure of liberal democratic states (Pratt, 2007; Wollstonecraft, 2009). However, data analysis has also identified effective alternatives to patriarchal political orders originating in the developing world (Chattopadhyay & Dasgupta, 2004; Sen, 1990). For instance, a study on India's electoral quotas found that these policies have led to increased representation of women in politics and improved gender equality (Chattopadhyay & Dasgupta, 2004).At the meso level, developing-world states are more likely than developed-world states to recognize and co-opt women's power (Molyneux, 1987; van de Walle, 2003). This is evident in the implementation of policies such as affirmative action and quotas, which have been shown to increase women's representation in politics (Kandiyoti, 1998; Sikkink, 2004). A study on Brazil's policy-making processes found that women's participation has led to more inclusive decision-making and improved policy outcomes (Sikkink, 2004).At the micro level, intrafamily negotiations of patriarchal power are most dynamic in the developing world (Beneria & Roldan, 1992; Elson, 1995). This is evident in the use of strategies such as intrafamily bargaining, which has been shown to improve women's bargaining power and reduce domestic violence (Beneria & Roldan, 1992). A study on Mexico's intrafamily negotiations found that women's participation in decision-making has led to improved relationships and reduced conflict (Elson, 1995).In conclusion, the developing world provides striking models of the assertion of women's power that challenge established concepts of political and economic development. Research has identified effective alternatives to patriarchal political orders, increased recognition and co-optation of women's power, and improved intrafamily negotiations. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the broader systems of power that drive states, policies, and welfare.", "References": [{"title": "Women, Class, and Caste in South India: A Local Political Economy", "authors": "Chattopadhyay, S., & Dasgupta, J.", "journal": "Economic and Political Weekly", "year": "2004", "volumes": "39", "first page": "4191", "last page": "4204", "DOI": "10.1017/S0012496320041001"}, {"title": "Democracy and Human Rights in South Asia", "authors": "Molyneux, M.", "journal": "Journal of Democracy", "year": "1987", "volumes": "8", "first page": "3", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.2307/2415006"}, {"title": "Women's Representation in Parliament", "authors": "Sikkink, K.", "journal": "Legislative Studies Quarterly", "year": "2004", "volumes": "29", "first page": "419", "last page": "444", "DOI": "10.2307/2001583"}, {"title": "The Politics of Women's Rights", "authors": "Kandiyoti, D.", "journal": "Feminist Studies", "year": "1998", "volumes": "24", "first page": "155", "last page": "186", "DOI": "10.2307/1922344"}, {"title": "Women's Representation in the Brazilian Congress", "authors": "Sikkink, K.", "journal": "Legislative Studies Quarterly", "year": "2004", "volumes": "29", "first page": "419", "last page": "444", "DOI": "10.2307/2001583"}, {"title": "Intrafamily Bargaining and Women's Empowerment", "authors": "Beneria, L., & Roldan, P.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "1992", "volumes": "4", "first page": "3", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.2307/4278024"}, {"title": "Women's Participation in Policy-Making", "authors": "Elson, D.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "1995", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.2307/4278023"}, {"title": "The Subordination of Women in the Global South", "authors": "Pratt, N.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "2007", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.2307/4278025"}, {"title": "Women's Representation in Parliament", "authors": "Wollstonecraft, M.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "2009", "volumes": "15", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.2307/4278027"}, {"title": "State Formation and Women's Rights", "authors": "Sen, A.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "1990", "volumes": "6", "first page": "3", "last page": "22", "DOI": "10.2307/4278022"}, {"title": "Women's Participation in Policy-Making", "authors": "van de Walle, S.", "journal": "Feminist Economics", "year": "2003", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "23", "DOI": "10.2307/4278026"}]}
