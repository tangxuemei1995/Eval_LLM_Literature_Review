{"Literature Review": "Bureaucratic autonomy is a crucial concept in understanding the relationship between political principals and bureaucratic agents. The degree of discretion granted to these agents is a key factor in determining the effectiveness of administrative governance. However, the proper measurement of bureaucratic autonomy remains an issue in need of greater theorizing in the field of political science. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on bureaucratic autonomy, both in the context of US administrative law and in the broader field of comparative politics and comparative administrative law. By examining the mechanisms by which political principals grant and limit autonomy, this review seeks to shed light on the complexities of bureaucratic autonomy and its implications for administrative governance.", "References": [{"title": "The limits of bureaucratic discretion: A review of the literature", "authors": "Bressler, S.
