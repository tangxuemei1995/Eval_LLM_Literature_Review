{"Literature Review": "Historical Political Economy (HPE) has emerged as a vibrant field in recent years, leveraging statistical methods and formal theory to examine the past and its impact on the present. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the development of HPE, its common uses, trade-offs, and challenges, as well as its future directions. We begin by examining the historical roots of HPE and its evolution over time, highlighting key milestones and contributions from prominent scholars.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential works in HPE is Adam Smith's 'The Wealth of Nations' (1776), which laid the foundation for modern economic thought (Smith, 1776). However, it was not until the 20th century that HPE began to take shape as a distinct field, with scholars such as Karl Polanyi and E.H. Carr contributing to its development (Polanyi, 1944; Carr, 1961).\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, HPE began to gain momentum, with the work of scholars such as Douglass North and Robert Fogel pushing the boundaries of causal inference and formal theory (North, 1990; Fogel, 1994). Their work demonstrated the power of HPE in understanding the past and its impact on the present, and paved the way for the current wave of research in the field.\n\nA key aspect of HPE is its use of history to understand the past for its own sake. This approach, often referred to as 'historical curiosity,' involves examining historical events and processes in their own right, without necessarily seeking to draw causal inferences or make theoretical conjectures (Hobsbawm, 1994). While this approach can be valuable for understanding the complexities of historical events, it can also be limited by its lack of focus on causal inference and theoretical development.\n\nAnother common use of history in HPE is to understand the present. This approach, often referred to as 'historical contextualization,' involves examining historical events and processes in relation to contemporary issues and concerns (Skocpol, 2003). By doing so, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the causal relationships between historical events and contemporary outcomes, and develop more effective policies and interventions.\n\nA third common use of history in HPE is to explore theoretical conjectures. This approach, often referred to as 'historical experimentation,' involves using historical data to test theoretical hypotheses and develop new theories (Leeson, 2011). By doing so, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the causal relationships between historical events and theoretical concepts, and develop more effective theories and models.\n\nDespite the many advances made in HPE, the field is not without its challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the accessibility of data that exist. Many historical datasets are incomplete, fragmented, or difficult to access, which can limit the scope and accuracy of HPE research (Maddison, 2001). Additionally, the lack of data can make it difficult to draw causal inferences and develop theoretical models, which can limit the field's ability to make meaningful contributions to our understanding of the past and its impact on the present.\n\nLooking to the future, we see several key trends and developments that will shape the field of HPE. One of the most significant trends is the increased focus on training and education for scholars entering the field. As HPE continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that scholars have the necessary skills and knowledge to conduct high-quality research and make meaningful contributions to the field (Bloom, 2017).\n\nAnother key trend is the heightened focus on the accumulation of knowledge. As HPE continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that scholars prioritize the accumulation of knowledge and the development of new theories and models (Kuran, 2013). By doing so, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the causal relationships between historical events and theoretical concepts, and develop more effective theories and models.\n\nFinally, we see a growing focus on underexplored topics such as race, gender, ethnicity, and climate change. These topics are critical to understanding the past and its impact on the present, and scholars must prioritize their study in order to make meaningful contributions to the field (Miesner, 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, HPE is a vibrant and dynamic field that continues to evolve and grow. By examining the development of HPE, its common uses, trade-offs, and challenges, we can gain a deeper understanding of the field's strengths and limitations. As HPE continues to grow and evolve, it is essential that scholars prioritize the accumulation of knowledge, the development of new theories and models, and the study of underexplored topics.", "References": [{"title": "The future of historical research", "authors": "Bloom, S.
