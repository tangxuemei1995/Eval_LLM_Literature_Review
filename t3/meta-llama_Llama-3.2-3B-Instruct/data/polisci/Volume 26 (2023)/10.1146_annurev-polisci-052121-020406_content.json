{"Literature Review": "Authoritarian Power Sharing: Concepts, Mechanisms, and Strategies\n\nPower sharing in authoritarian regimes has long been a topic of interest among scholars of politics and international relations. The concept of power sharing entails not only the distribution of spoils between a ruler and a challenger but also the establishment of an enforcement mechanism to prevent the ruler from renegeing on the agreement. This review aims to provide a unified language for studying power sharing in authoritarian regimes, highlighting the concepts, mechanisms, and strategies involved in such arrangements.\n\nOne of the key challenges in power sharing is the commitment problem. As noted by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), weak institutions create a Catch-22 that inhibits credible commitment. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible if challengers have coercive means to defend their spoils. However, challengers can leverage their coercive capabilities to overthrow the ruler. This double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator shares power only under specific conditions: challengers can credibly punish an autocratic ruler; if the ruler shares power, the challenger must willingly forgo taking harmful actions; and the ruler willingly acquiesces to diminished power and rents.\n\nInstitutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers, can reallocate power and create an enforcement mechanism (Linz and Stepan 1996). However, these concessions can also be costly for the ruler, as they may limit their ability to make decisions or exert control over the regime. Furthermore, the ruler may attempt to undermine the effectiveness of these concessions by exploiting loopholes or manipulating the system (Przeworski 1991).\n\nThe concept of power sharing has been studied in various contexts, including civil wars and coups. In the context of civil wars, power sharing can be seen as a means of reducing violence and promoting stability (Collier and Hoeffler 2000). However, the effectiveness of power sharing in civil wars is often dependent on the strength of institutions and the willingness of challengers to compromise. In the context of coups, power sharing can be seen as a means of preventing the overthrow of the ruler and promoting stability (Linz and Stepan 1996).\n\nStrategies for power sharing in authoritarian regimes can vary widely, depending on the specific context and the interests of the parties involved. One common strategy is to establish a power-sharing agreement that allocates specific responsibilities and decision-making powers to each party (Przeworski 1991). However, this approach can be vulnerable to manipulation by the ruler, who may attempt to exploit loopholes or undermine the effectiveness of the agreement. Another strategy is to establish a third-party enforcer, such as an independent electoral commission or a neutral mediator, to monitor the implementation of the agreement and prevent the ruler from renegeing (Linz and Stepan 1996).\n\nIn conclusion, power sharing in authoritarian regimes is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that requires a nuanced understanding of the concepts, mechanisms, and strategies involved. By examining the commitment problem, institutional concessions, and strategies for power sharing, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of power sharing in authoritarian regimes and develop more effective strategies for promoting stability and reducing violence.\n", "References": [{"title": "The Spirit of Democracy", "authors": "Acemoglu, D., & Robinson, J.", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "2012", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9781139052247"}, {"title": "Institutional Analysis and Institutional Change", "authors": "Linz, J.
