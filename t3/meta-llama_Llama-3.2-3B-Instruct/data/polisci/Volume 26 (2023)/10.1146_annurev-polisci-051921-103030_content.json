{"Literature Review": "Same Trend, Different Paths: Growth and Welfare Regimes Across Time and Space\n\nThe recent advances in comparative political economy have led to a renewed interest in understanding the dynamics of growth and welfare regimes across time and space. This literature review synthesizes the existing knowledge on growth regimes and welfare regimes, with a focus on how governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments. The analysis of the main trends of three eras of capitalism - Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy - reveals the various paths of change in the evolution of capitalism.\n\nThe concept of growth regimes has been extensively studied in the field of comparative political economy. According to Hall and Soskice (2000), growth regimes refer to the institutional and policy frameworks that shape the dynamics of economic growth. These frameworks can be characterized by different engines of growth, such as technological innovation, institutional change, and policy coordination. The literature suggests that growth regimes can be classified into different types, such as the Fordist regime, the neoliberal regime, and the knowledge-based economy (KBE) regime (Hall and Soskice, 2000; Iversen and Soskice, 2009).\n\nThe concept of welfare regimes, on the other hand, has been studied extensively in the field of social policy and comparative politics. Welfare regimes refer to the institutional and policy frameworks that shape the provision of social services and the distribution of income (Esping-Andersen, 1990). The literature suggests that welfare regimes can be classified into different types, such as the liberal, conservative, and social democratic regimes (Esping-Andersen, 1990).\n\nThe relationship between growth and welfare regimes has been a subject of interest in the field of comparative political economy. The literature suggests that governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments, focusing in particular on welfare state reforms (Hall and Soskice, 2000). For example, the neoliberal regime has been characterized by a focus on market-oriented reforms and a reduction in the role of the state in the economy (Hall and Soskice, 2000).\n\nThe analysis of the main trends of three eras of capitalism - Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy - reveals the various paths of change in the evolution of capitalism. The Fordist regime was characterized by a focus on mass production and a strong role for the state in the economy (Hall and Soskice, 2000). The neoliberal regime, on the other hand, was characterized by a focus on market-oriented reforms and a reduction in the role of the state in the economy (Hall and Soskice, 2000). The KBE regime, which emerged in the late 20th century, is characterized by a focus on technological innovation and a strong role for the state in the economy (Iversen and Soskice, 2009).\n\nThe five growth strategies pursued by governments to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era are: (1) export-led growth, (2) innovation-led growth, (3) financialization, (4) human capital accumulation, and (5) institutional change (Hall and Soskice, 2000). These strategies reflect the different engines of growth and the different institutional and policy frameworks that shape the dynamics of economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of the main trends of three eras of capitalism reveals the various paths of change in the evolution of capitalism. The five growth strategies pursued by governments to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era reflect the different engines of growth and the different institutional and policy frameworks that shape the dynamics of economic growth.\n\n", "References": [{"title": "Hall, R.
