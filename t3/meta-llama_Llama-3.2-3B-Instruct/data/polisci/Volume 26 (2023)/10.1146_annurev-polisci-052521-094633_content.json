{"Literature Review": "The politics of global health governance has undergone significant transformations over the years, shaped by various historical, economic, and social factors. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the seven eras in the field, from the period of empire and colonialism to the COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the key dynamics and debates surrounding global health governance. The review will examine the tensions between state-centered and cosmopolitan approaches to global health, the impact of financing and political attention on the field, and the recent events that have reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases.\n\nThe field of global health has long been characterized by a statist approach, focusing on national health systems and policies (Klein, 2007). This approach has been criticized for its limitations in addressing transnational global health problems (Mayer, 2009). In contrast, cosmopolitan visions of global health emphasize the need for broader health system strengthening and international cooperation (Pogge, 2008).\n\nThe mid-2000s marked a golden age in global health, with increased financing and political attention devoted to addressing HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as reducing the risk posed by infectious disease outbreaks to economies of the Global North (World Health Organization, 2006). This period saw significant progress in the development of international health organizations, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund, 2002).\n\nHowever, recent events, including the COVID-19 outbreak, have reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases (Begley et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the limitations of the global health architecture, including the lack of preparedness and coordination among countries (Koplan et al., 2020).\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has played a crucial role in shaping the global health governance landscape. The WHO has been instrumental in developing and implementing global health policies, including the International Health Regulations (IHR) (World Health Organization, 2005).\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there are opportunities for strengthening global health governance. The pandemic has highlighted the need for greater international cooperation and coordination, as well as the importance of investing in health systems and infrastructure (Begley et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the politics of global health governance is a complex and dynamic field, shaped by various historical, economic, and social factors. The review has highlighted the tensions between state-centered and cosmopolitan approaches to global health, the impact of financing and political attention on the field, and the recent events that have reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Global Health Governance", "authors": "R.
