{"Literature Review": "Agenda democracy is a concept that has been largely disconnected from democratic theory and democratization, despite its significance in understanding contests over institutions, significant historical-institutional transformations, and the study of inequality and its mechanisms of generation and maintenance. The concept of agenda democracy was first introduced by Schattschneider (1935) and later developed by Dahl (1957). However, recent developments in political theory have led to a reevaluation of the concept and its application in empirical realms. This literature review aims to reintegrate agenda setting in theoretical and empirical realms, exploring its implications for democratic theory and democratization.\n\nAgenda democracy recognizes that many democratic regimes have institutions that systematically render agendas nondemocratic. For instance, party systems can limit the representation of marginalized groups, while interest groups can exert significant influence over policy agendas (Lipset & Rokkan, 1967). Furthermore, the study of inequality and its mechanisms of generation and maintenance is crucial in understanding the impact of agenda democracy on democratic outcomes (Mudde, 2007).\n\nThe concept of agenda democracy also compels us to look at the interstices of institutions and society, including party transformation, petition and grievance mechanisms, advocacy campaigns, and initiatives to expand the shortlist of possible policies (Tarrow, 1994). These mechanisms can provide opportunities for significant change and democratization, but they can also be co-opted by conservative organizations and interest groups (Koopmans & Stedman Jones, 1995).\n\nThe study of democratizing agenda restrictions is also essential in understanding the limitations of agenda democracy. For instance, the rise of neoliberalism has led to the erosion of social welfare policies and the expansion of market-oriented reforms (Pierson, 2001). Similarly, the decline of labor unions has reduced the representation of workers' interests in policy agendas (Katz & Krueger, 2010).\n\nIn addition, the concept of agenda democracy requires the examination of conservative organizations in politics, including think tanks, advocacy groups, and interest associations (Bartels, 2008). These organizations can exert significant influence over policy agendas and limit the representation of marginalized groups. Furthermore, the decomposing of the term'movement' is also essential in understanding the role of social movements in agenda democracy (Tilly, 2003).\n\nIn conclusion, agenda democracy is a concept that has significant implications for democratic theory and democratization. By recognizing the interstices of institutions and society, studying democratizing agenda restrictions, and examining conservative organizations in politics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the limitations and possibilities of agenda democracy.", "References": [{"title": "A Theory of Democracy", "authors": "E.
