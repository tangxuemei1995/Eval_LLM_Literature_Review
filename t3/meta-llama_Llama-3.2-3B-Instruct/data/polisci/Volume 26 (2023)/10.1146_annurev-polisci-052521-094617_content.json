{"Literature Review": "Political inequality in rich democracies has become a pressing concern in recent years, with rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions contributing to a decline in civic engagement and representation. This review aims to examine the relationship between participation and representation in rich democracies, with a focus on the impact of income inequality and the decline of trade unions. The literature suggests that individuals with fewer resources participate less in the political process, while those with more resources are more likely to engage in civic activities. Similarly, the opinions of decision-makers are more congruent with those of the better off, and policy choices reflect their preferences more clearly. This review will discuss the findings of previous studies on participation and representation, and explore the implications of these trends for democratic governance.", "References": [{"title": "The Relationship Between Income Inequality and Civic Engagement", "authors": "Campbell, A.
