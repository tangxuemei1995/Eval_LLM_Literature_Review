{"Literature Review": "The relationship between democracy and corporations has been a subject of interest among scholars for centuries. The concept of corporate republicanism, which emerged in the 17th century, posits that corporations can serve as a means of promoting republican values such as representation, accountability, and civic engagement. This idea is rooted in the notion that corporations can provide a framework for collective action and decision-making that is distinct from the individualistic nature of modern democracy. However, as the article argues, the modern democratic state has largely abandoned this approach, instead chartering authoritarian corporations that concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few individuals or corporations. The constitutive relationship between states and corporations, where the state charts the corporation, is a key aspect of modern democracy. This relationship is often seen as a means of promoting economic development and growth, as corporations can provide a framework for investment and innovation. However, this relationship also raises concerns about the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few individuals or corporations, which can undermine democratic values such as representation and accountability. The mimetic relationship between states and corporations, where the state and corporation copy one another's organizational features, is another key aspect of modern democracy. This relationship is often seen as a means of promoting cooperation and coordination between the state and corporation, but it can also lead to a loss of autonomy and independence for both parties. For example, the rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s led to a proliferation of corporate universities that were modeled on the organizational structures of corporations, rather than traditional universities. The instrumental relationship between states and corporations, where each party leans on the other to advance its own purposes, is a key aspect of modern democracy. This relationship is often seen as a means of promoting economic development and growth, but it can also lead to a loss of democratic values such as representation and accountability. For example, the rise of corporate lobbying in the United States has led to a proliferation of laws and regulations that benefit corporations at the expense of citizens. The article argues that the Great Inversion, where authoritarian corporations are chartered by modern democracies, poses a significant challenge to constitutional democracy. This challenge is rooted in the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few individuals or corporations, which can undermine democratic values such as representation and accountability. The article also argues that a partial reversal of the Great Inversion, where corporations are chartered in a more democratic and participatory manner, could reduce the challenges posed by corporate economies to constitutional democracy. In conclusion, the relationship between democracy and corporations is complex and multifaceted. The constitutive, mimetic, and instrumental relationships between states and corporations pose significant challenges to constitutional democracy, and a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce these challenges. However, this requires a fundamental transformation of the way in which corporations are chartered and governed, and a greater emphasis on democratic values such as representation and accountability.", "References": [{"title": "Acts of Resistance: Against the Normalization of Poverty", "authors": "P.
