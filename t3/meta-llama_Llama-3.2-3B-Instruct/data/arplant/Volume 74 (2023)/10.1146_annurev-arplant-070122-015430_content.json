{"Literature Review": "Between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and common mycelial networks (CMNs) has been increasingly recognized as a crucial mechanism for plant interactions with other organisms and adaptation to environmental factors. This phenomenon involves the transfer of biomolecules and systemic signals between plants, which can have profound implications for plant ecology and evolution. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of between-plant signaling, focusing on the role of parasitic plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and CMNs in this process.\n\nParasitic plants, such as Cuscuta and Striga, have evolved specialized organs, the haustorium, to attach to and penetrate host tissues, forming phloem and/or xylem fusion with the host vascular systems (1). This interface allows for the exchange of water, nutrients, and secondary metabolites between the parasite and host (2). Recent studies have also shown that messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs, proteins, and systemic signals can be transferred between the parasite and host, and even among different hosts connected by a parasite (3, 4).\n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are another key player in between-plant signaling. These fungi form common mycelial networks (CMNs) that interconnect multiple plants, allowing for the transfer of stress-related systemic signals between plants (5). CMNs have been shown to play a crucial role in plant defense against pathogens and pests (6), and can also facilitate the transfer of nutrients and water between plants (7).\n\nThe physiological and ecological implications of between-plant signaling are far-reaching. For example, studies have shown that CMNs can facilitate the transfer of stress-related signals between plants, allowing them to coordinate their defense responses and optimize their growth and development (8). Additionally, between-plant signaling can also influence plant-herbivore interactions, with plants that are connected by CMNs able to coordinate their defense responses and reduce herbivory (9).\n\nIn conclusion, between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and CMNs is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has significant implications for plant ecology and evolution. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and ecological significance of this process.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Givnish, T. J. (1989).
