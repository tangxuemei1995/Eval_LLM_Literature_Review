{"Literature Review": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a complex and dynamic relationship between plant roots and fungi, which plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation. This symbiosis involves the exchange of nutrients between the plant and the fungi, with the fungi providing essential nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, and the plant delivering photosynthetic carbon to the fungi. This nutrient exchange affects key soil processes, the carbon cycle, and plant health, and has a strong influence on the plant and microbe ecosystems. In recent years, the framework of nutrient exchange and regulation between host plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has been established, highlighting the local and systemic regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by plant nutrient status and the autoregulation of mycorrhizae. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of mycorrhizal symbiosis, its effects on plant growth and stress adaptation, and its potential applications in sustainable agriculture and forestry management.", "References": [{"title": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi influence plant nutrient acquisition", "authors": "Johnson, N.
