{"Literature Review": "Salt-tolerant crops have been a long-standing goal in agriculture, with the potential to improve crop yields and food security in saline environments. Despite significant advances in understanding the physiology and molecular genetics of salinity tolerance, the application of these findings to improve crop salt tolerance has been limited. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on salt-tolerant crops and identify the key challenges and opportunities for improving crop salt tolerance.", "References": [{"title": "Salt tolerance in crops: A review of the physiological and molecular mechanisms", "authors": "Raghuwanshi, S., & Prasad, M.
