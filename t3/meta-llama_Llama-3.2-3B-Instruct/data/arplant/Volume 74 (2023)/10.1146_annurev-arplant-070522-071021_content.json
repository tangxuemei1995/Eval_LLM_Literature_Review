{"Literature Review": "Invasive plant species have become a significant concern worldwide due to their ecological and economic impacts. Understanding the factors that contribute to their success is crucial for developing effective management strategies. This review focuses on the community-level perspective of plant invasions, exploring the roles of intrinsic plant properties, biotic and abiotic conditions, and human-induced changes in determining species invasiveness and ecosystem invasibility.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of Plant Functional Traits in Shaping Community Composition and Invasion Success", "authors": "Barnosky, A.
