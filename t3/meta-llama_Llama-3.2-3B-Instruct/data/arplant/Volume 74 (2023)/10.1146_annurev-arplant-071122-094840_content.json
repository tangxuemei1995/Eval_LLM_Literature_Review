{"Literature Review": "Optogenetics has revolutionized the field of plant biology by providing a noninvasive and spatiotemporally resolved means to manipulate cellular processes in plants. The introduction of Channelrhodopsin-2 and phytochrome-based switches nearly 20 years ago marked the beginning of optogenetic research in plants. However, the dependence of plant growth on light and the absence of retinal, the rhodopsin chromophore, hindered the establishment of plant optogenetics until recent progress overcame these difficulties. Recent studies have successfully applied optogenetic tools to control plant growth and cellular motion via green light-gated ion channels, and to regulate light-control gene expression with single or combined photoswitches in plants. This review aims to summarize the recent results of work in the field and highlight the technical requirements and options for future plant optogenetic research.", "References": [{"title": "Optogenetic control of plant growth and development", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.
