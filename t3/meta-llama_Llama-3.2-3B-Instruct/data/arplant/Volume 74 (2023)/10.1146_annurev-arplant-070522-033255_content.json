{"Literature Review": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes have been a subject of interest for nearly two decades, with their expansion along the lineage of land plants leading to the emergence of a multiclade system among flowering plants. The functions of GLRs have been extensively studied, with evidence suggesting their involvement in various physiological processes, including wound signaling, transcriptional regulation, and sexual reproduction. The conservation of fundamental functions among different groups of plants has been a recurring theme in the literature, with studies demonstrating the universal role of GLRs in cellâ€“cell communication and calcium signaling.", "References": [{"title": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes encode ion channels with demonstrated roles in electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling.", "authors": "Zhu, J.
