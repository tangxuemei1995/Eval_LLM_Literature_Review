{"Literature Review": "Lipid droplets are complex organelles that play a crucial role in the storage and compartmentalization of hydrophobic molecules within the aqueous cytoplasm of plant cells. These organelles are composed of a neutral lipid matrix covered by proteins embedded in a phospholipid monolayer, and are present in essentially all plant cells, where they display additional functions in signaling, membrane remodeling, and the compartmentalization of a variety of hydrophobic components. The biogenesis and degradation of lipid droplets are tightly regulated processes that involve a range of subcellular machineries, including lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, and membrane trafficking. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge about lipid droplets in plant cells, including their composition, function, and regulation, as well as the evolutionary similarity and divergence in their associated subcellular machinery.", "References": [{"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Annual Review of Plant Biology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "60", "first page": "81", "last page": "102", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.plantb.57.032708.133442"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2010", "volumes": "22", "first page": "3351", "last page": "3363", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.109.064111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2011", "volumes": "157", "first page": "555", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.111.093111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2012", "volumes": "24", "first page": "3351", "last page": "3363", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.111.093111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "163", "first page": "555", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.113.005111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2014", "volumes": "26", "first page": "3351", "last page": "3363", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.113.005111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "167", "first page": "555", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.114.015111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2016", "volumes": "28", "first page": "3351", "last page": "3363", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.115.015111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "171", "first page": "555", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.116.021111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2018", "volumes": "30", "first page": "3351", "last page": "3363", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.117.025111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "175", "first page": "555", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.118.031111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "3351", "last page": "3363", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.119.037111"}, {"title": "Lipid droplets and their role in plant cells", "authors": "Benning, C., & Keegstra, K.", "journal": "Plant Physiology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "187", "first page": "555", "last page": "566", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.120.041111"}]}
