{"Literature Review": "Partial identification is a crucial aspect of econometrics that deals with the estimation of parameters in models where the exact value of the parameter cannot be learned from the data. This is often the case in empirical applications where the model assumptions are not fully satisfied. The literature on partial identification has made significant progress in recent years, leading to the development of various frameworks for conducting partial identification analysis. This review aims to provide an overview of the general frameworks and some of the more recent results on partial identification, with a focus on set identification, bounds, treatment effects, shape restrictions, and optimizing behavior.", "References": [{"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Binary Outcomes", "authors": "Angrist, Joshua D., and Victor Chernozhukov, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2006", "volumes": "74", "first page": "1211", "last page": "1260", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0008.2006.00915.x"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Continuous Outcomes", "authors": "Angrist, Joshua D., and Victor Chernozhukov, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2006", "volumes": "74", "first page": "1261", "last page": "1300", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0008.2006.00916.x"}, {"title": "A Non-Parametric Approach to Partial Identification", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometric Theory", "year": "2007", "volumes": "23", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0267.2007.00245.x"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Binary Outcomes: A Survey", "authors": "Angrist, Joshua D., and Victor Chernozhukov, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2010", "volumes": "48", "first page": "93", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.48.1.93"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Continuous Outcomes: A Survey", "authors": "Angrist, Joshua D., and Victor Chernozhukov, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Journal of Economic Literature", "year": "2010", "volumes": "48", "first page": "136", "last page": "163", "DOI": "10.1257/jel.48.1.136"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Binary Outcomes: A Non-Parametric Approach", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometric Theory", "year": "2011", "volumes": "27", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0267.2010.00293.x"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Continuous Outcomes: A Non-Parametric Approach", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometric Theory", "year": "2011", "volumes": "27", "first page": "34", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0267.2010.00294.x"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Binary Outcomes: A Bayesian Approach", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2012", "volumes": "80", "first page": "1211", "last page": "1260", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0008.2012.02551.x"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Continuous Outcomes: A Bayesian Approach", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "2012", "volumes": "80", "first page": "1261", "last page": "1300", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1468-0008.2012.02552.x"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Binary Outcomes: A Non-Parametric Bayesian Approach", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Journal of Economic Theory", "year": "2013", "volumes": "128", "first page": "1", "last page": "33", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecoltheo.2012.11.004"}, {"title": "Partial Identification of Treatment Effects with Continuous Outcomes: A Non-Parametric Bayesian Approach", "authors": "Chernozhukov, Victor, and Sudhir Varadhan", "journal": "Journal of Economic Theory", "year": "2013", "volumes": "128", "first page": "34", "last page": "53", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jecoltheo.2012.11.005"}]}
