{"Literature Review": "The rise of non-bank financial intermediation, particularly investment funds, has significantly altered the landscape of international capital flows to emerging markets. Over the last two decades, these funds have accounted for nearly half of the external financing flows to emerging markets, surpassing cross-border lending by global banks. This shift has enhanced risk sharing across borders and provided emerging markets with access to more diverse forms of financing. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that investment funds are inherently more vulnerable to liquidity and redemption risks during periods of global financial market stress, increasing the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. The procyclicality of investment fund flows to emerging markets during times of global stress poses financial stability concerns, with implications for the role of macroprudential policy. Benchmark-driven investments, namely passive funds, appear particularly sensitive to global risk shocks, such as tightening US dollar funding conditions, compared to their active fund counterparts. This is because passive funds tend to track market indices, which can amplify losses during periods of market stress. Research has shown that the sensitivity of investment fund flows to global risk shocks is exacerbated by the use of leverage in these funds. Leverage can amplify losses during periods of market stress, increasing the risk of fund liquidation and exacerbating the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Furthermore, the use of leverage can also increase the procyclicality of investment fund flows, as funds may be more likely to invest in assets that are correlated with the overall market during periods of stress. The impact of investment fund flows on emerging markets is also influenced by the characteristics of the fund itself. For example, research has shown that funds with a higher proportion of equity investments are more sensitive to global risk shocks than funds with a higher proportion of fixed-income investments. This is because equity investments are more correlated with the overall market, which can amplify losses during periods of market stress. In addition to the sensitivity of investment fund flows to global risk shocks, there are also concerns about the lack of transparency and disclosure in the investment fund industry. Research has shown that many investment funds do not provide adequate information about their holdings and investment strategies, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions. This lack of transparency can increase the risk of fund liquidation and exacerbate the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Overall, the rise of non-bank financial intermediation, particularly investment funds, has significant implications for the financial stability of emerging markets. The sensitivity of investment fund flows to global risk shocks, the use of leverage in these funds, and the lack of transparency and disclosure in the industry all pose financial stability concerns. As such, policymakers must carefully consider the role of macroprudential policy in regulating the investment fund industry and mitigating the risks associated with investment fund flows to emerging markets.", "References": [{"title": "Global Contagion and Financial Crises", "authors": "Kaminski, S.
