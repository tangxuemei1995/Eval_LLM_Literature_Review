{"Literature Review": "The United States and China have had a complex and dynamic trade relationship over the past 20 years, marked by periods of cooperation and conflict. This review aims to synthesize theoretical and empirical work on the economic effects of US-China trade relations, with a focus on the China shock and the recent US-China trade war. We begin by discussing the origins of the China shock, its measurement, and methods used to study its economic effects on different outcomes. We then examine the recent US-China trade war, reviewing methods used to evaluate its effects, describing its economic effects, and analyzing whether this increase in trade protectionism reverted the effects of the China shock. Our analysis reveals that the aggregate gains from US-China trade created winners and losers, China's trade expansion seems not to be the main cause of the decline in US manufacturing employment during the same period, and the recent trade war generated welfare losses, had small employment effects, and was ineffective in reversing the distributional effects due to the China shock. These findings have important implications for trade policy and suggest that policymakers should prioritize cooperation and negotiation over protectionism and conflict.", "References": [{"title": "The China Shock: Learning from China's Rise", "authors": "David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H.
