{"Literature Review": "The constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) aggregator has been a cornerstone of business cycles theory, macroeconomic growth and development, international trade, and general equilibrium fields for decades. Its widespread adoption can be attributed to its tractability in the presence of many goods and factors, thanks to its knife-edge properties. However, this also makes it challenging to identify which properties of CES are responsible for certain results. In recent years, researchers have sought to relax some of these properties to introduce flexibility while maintaining tractability. This article reviews several classes of non-CES aggregators, each of which removes some properties of CES and retains others to achieve this goal. By examining the relationships between these classes and their relative strengths and weaknesses, we can determine which classes are suited for specific applications.\n\nThe CES aggregator is defined by its demand system, which is characterized by the following properties: (1) homothetic preferences, (2) implicit additivity, (3) gross substitutes, and (4) gross complements. These properties are essential to the CES aggregator's tractability, but they also limit its flexibility. Non-CES aggregators aim to relax or remove some of these properties to introduce more flexibility while maintaining tractability.\n\nOne class of non-CES aggregators is based on nonhomothetic preferences. These aggregators remove the homothetic preferences property of CES, allowing for more flexible demand systems. For example, the Leontief aggregator (Leontief, 1936) is a non-CES aggregator that removes the homothetic preferences property of CES. This aggregator is often used in international trade models to capture the effects of trade on demand.\n\nAnother class of non-CES aggregators is based on production functions. The constant returns to scale (CRS) production function is a non-CES aggregator that removes the implicit additivity property of CES. This aggregator is often used in macroeconomic growth and development models to capture the effects of technological progress on output.\n\nA third class of non-CES aggregators is based on the concept of essentials and inessentials. The essential aggregator (Barten, 1959) is a non-CES aggregator that removes the gross substitutes property of CES. This aggregator is often used in business cycles theory to capture the effects of shocks on output.\n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of these non-CES aggregators depend on the specific application. For example, the Leontief aggregator is well-suited for international trade models, but it may not capture the effects of technological progress on output. The CRS production function is well-suited for macroeconomic growth and development models, but it may not capture the effects of shocks on output.\n\nIn conclusion, non-CES aggregators offer a more flexible alternative to the CES aggregator, allowing researchers to capture a wider range of phenomena in their models. By examining the relationships between these classes of non-CES aggregators and their relative strengths and weaknesses, we can determine which classes are suited for specific applications.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
