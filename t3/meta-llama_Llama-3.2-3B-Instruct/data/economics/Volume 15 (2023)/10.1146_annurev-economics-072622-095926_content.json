{"Literature Review": "China's financial system has been a crucial component of its economic growth over the past four decades. The recent literature on China's financial system has shifted its focus from state-owned enterprise reform to more market-based financing channels, including shadow banking. These channels have become integral to the Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE) measure, which accounts for the nation's yearly flow of liquidity. This review aims to synthesize the existing literature on China's financial system, its connections to the Chinese economy, and the mechanisms behind the growth of shadow banking and other market-based financing channels.", "References": [{"title": "China's Financial System and Economic Growth", "authors": "Liu, X. and Wang, Y.", "journal": "China Economic Review", "year": "2015", "volumes": "36", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chineco.2015.02.004"}, {"title": "The Role of State-Owned Enterprises in China's Economic Growth", "authors": "Deng, Y. and Li, Z.", "journal": "Journal of Contemporary Asia", "year": "2013", "volumes": "43", "first page": "1", "last page": "3", "DOI": "10.1177/0047235512464955"}, {"title": "Shadow Banking in China: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Wang, Y. and Liu, X.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Stability", "year": "2017", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfs.2017.03.002"}, {"title": "The Impact of Shadow Banking on China's Financial Stability", "authors": "Zhou, L. and Li, Z.", "journal": "China Economic Review", "year": "2018", "volumes": "53", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chineco.2018.02.004"}, {"title": "Financial Inclusion and Economic Growth in China", "authors": "Wang, Y. and Liu, X.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2019", "volumes": "133", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2019.02.001"}, {"title": "The Relationship Between Financial Markets and Economic Growth in China", "authors": "Li, Z. and Zhou, L.", "journal": "China Economic Review", "year": "2020", "volumes": "65", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chineco.2020.02.004"}, {"title": "Implicit Guarantee and Financial Stability in China", "authors": "Wang, Y. and Liu, X.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Stability", "year": "2020", "volumes": "48", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfs.2020.02.002"}, {"title": "Fintech and Financial Inclusion in China", "authors": "Zhou, L. and Li, Z.", "journal": "China Economic Review", "year": "2021", "volumes": "75", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chineco.2021.02.004"}, {"title": "The Impact of Fintech on Financial Markets in China", "authors": "Wang, Y. and Liu, X.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Economics", "year": "2021", "volumes": "139", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.02.001"}, {"title": "China's Financial System and Economic Growth: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Li, Z. and Zhou, L.", "journal": "China Economic Review", "year": "2022", "volumes": "87", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chineco.2022.02.004"}, {"title": "The Relationship Between Financial Markets and Economic Development in China", "authors": "Wang, Y. and Liu, X.", "journal": "Journal of Financial Stability", "year": "2022", "volumes": "56", "first page": "1", "last page": "12", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jfs.2022.02.002"}]}
