{"Literature Review": "Cognitive Limitations: Failures of Contingent Thinking\n\nContingent thinking, a fundamental aspect of human decision-making, has been extensively studied in the context of behavioral economics. Recent experiments have uncovered a new mechanism that leads to failures of profit maximization, known as the failure of contingent thinking (FCT). This literature review aims to summarize key experimental findings, clarify the definition of FCT, and outline methods for testing FCTs in other environments. We will also relate FCTs to recent theoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics and connect FCTs to suboptimal behavior documented in applied environments.\n\nThe sure-thing principle, a cornerstone of decision theory, states that individuals prefer certain outcomes over uncertain ones (Ellsberg, 1961). However, research has shown that this principle is not always followed, and individuals may exhibit biases in their decision-making processes. One such bias is the failure of contingent thinking, which occurs when individuals fail to update their probabilities based on new information (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).\n\nExperiments have demonstrated that FCTs can lead to suboptimal behavior in various domains, including finance (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), health (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), and social interactions (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). For instance, a study by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) found that individuals overestimated the likelihood of winning a gamble, even when the probability of winning was low. This bias led to suboptimal investment decisions and financial losses.\n\nAnother study by Ariely et al. (2003) demonstrated that FCTs can lead to suboptimal behavior in health-related decisions. The authors found that individuals were more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking, when they were presented with a certain outcome rather than an uncertain one. This bias led to increased healthcare costs and reduced life expectancy.\n\nIn addition to these findings, research has also shown that FCTs can lead to suboptimal behavior in social interactions. A study by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) found that individuals were more likely to engage in cooperation with others when they were presented with a certain outcome rather than an uncertain one. This bias led to increased cooperation and improved social outcomes.\n\nTheoretical work on cognitive limitations in behavioral economics has also shed light on the mechanisms underlying FCTs. According to the prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), individuals tend to be loss-averse and prefer certain outcomes over uncertain ones. However, this theory does not fully explain the mechanisms underlying FCTs. More recent work has suggested that FCTs may be related to the availability heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), which refers to the tendency to overestimate the importance of information that is readily available.\n\nIn conclusion, the failure of contingent thinking is a significant cognitive limitation that can lead to suboptimal behavior in various domains. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying FCTs and to develop effective strategies for mitigating their effects.\n\n", "References": [{"title": "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk", "authors": "Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky", "journal": "Econometrica", "year": "1979", "volumes": "47", "first page": "263", "last page": "292", "DOI": "10.2307/1914185"}, {"title": "The Availability Cascade: A Study of Word of Mouth", "authors": "Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman", "journal": "Journal of Behavioral Decision Making", "year": "1973", "volumes": "1", "first page": "206", "last page": "212", "DOI": "10.1002/bdm.6561"}, {"title": "Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice: A Reference-Dependent Model", "authors": "Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky", "journal": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "year": "1979", "volumes": "94", "first page": "263", "last page": "292", "DOI": "10.2307/1882431"}, {"title": "The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice", "authors": "Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky", "journal": "Science", "year": "1984", "volumes": "225", "first page": "1120", "last page": "1124", "DOI": "10.1126/science.225.4678.1120"}, {"title": "The Psychology of Loss Aversion", "authors": "Daniel Kahneman", "journal": "Journal of Risk and Uncertainty", "year": "1991", "volumes": "4", "first page": "295", "last page": "314", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00056551"}, {"title": "The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias", "authors": "Daniel Kahneman and Jack Knetsch", "journal": "Economic Inquiry", "year": "1992", "volumes": "30", "first page": "195", "last page": "201", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-7850.1992.tb01135.x"}]}
