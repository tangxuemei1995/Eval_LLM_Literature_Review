{"Literature Review": "The CYBATHLON competition has been instrumental in driving innovation in assistive technology, with its focus on user-centered design and the development of novel devices tailored to the needs of people with disabilities. Since its inception in 2016, the competition has provided a platform for researchers and companies to showcase their latest developments and to engage with end users more actively in the development process. This review aims to provide an overview of the competition disciplines, their contributions to assistive technology, and the remaining challenges in the user-centered development of this technology.", "References": [{"title": "CYBATHLON: A Platform for Innovation in Assistive Technology", "authors": "K.
