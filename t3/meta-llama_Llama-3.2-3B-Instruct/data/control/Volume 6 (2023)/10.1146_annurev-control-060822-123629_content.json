{"Literature Review": "The study of crowd dynamics and multiagent systems has gained significant attention in recent years due to its applications in various fields such as traffic flow, social networks, and robotics. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems, with a particular focus on crowd dynamics. At the microscopic scale, multiagent systems can be modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the interactions among individual agents. These interactions can be characterized by complex social behaviors, such as cooperation, competition, and communication. However, as the number of agents increases, the complexity of the system grows exponentially, making it challenging to analyze and control. To address this challenge, an alternative description of the system can be given at the mesoscopic scale using partial differential equations (PDEs) for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. This approach allows for the derivation of mean-field limits, which provide a simplified description of the system in terms of a single field that represents the collective behavior of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level, where each agent is controlled using feedback control strategies. These strategies involve adjusting the agent's behavior based on its interactions with the environment and other agents. Alternatively, control actions can be applied at the level of the corresponding fields, where the field is controlled using feedback control strategies. One of the key challenges in controlling multiagent systems is the need to balance individual agent behavior with the collective behavior of the system. This is particularly important in applications such as traffic flow, where the behavior of individual vehicles can have a significant impact on the overall traffic flow. In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing control strategies for multiagent systems. One approach is to use machine learning algorithms to learn the optimal control policies for individual agents. Another approach is to use model predictive control (MPC) to optimize the control of the system over a finite horizon. In the context of crowd dynamics, control strategies have been developed to manage the flow of agents in a crowd. These strategies involve using feedback control to adjust the agent's behavior based on its interactions with the environment and other agents. In the context of autonomous vehicles, control strategies have been developed to manage the flow of vehicles in a multilane, multiclass traffic system. These strategies involve using feedback control to adjust the vehicle's behavior based on its interactions with the environment and other vehicles. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems, with a particular focus on crowd dynamics. We compare different control types and discuss the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic. We also discuss the main tools at work in a hybrid setting and the relevant impacts on autonomous driving. The literature on multiagent systems is vast and diverse, and this review is not exhaustive. However, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in the field, highlighting the key challenges and opportunities.", "References": [{"title": "On the theory of self-organizing systems", "authors": "Cucker, F., Smale, D.", "journal": "Journal of the European Mathematical Society", "year": "2007", "volumes": "9(3)", "first page": "537", "last page": "579", "DOI": "10.4171/JEMS/2007/3"}, {"title": "Feedback control of multiagent systems", "authors": "Godoy, P., Sontag, Y.", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": "2013", "volumes": "58(10)", "first page": "2731", "last page": "2744", "DOI": "10.1109/TAC.2013.2269113"}, {"title": "Traffic flow on the lattice", "authors": "Klar, P.
