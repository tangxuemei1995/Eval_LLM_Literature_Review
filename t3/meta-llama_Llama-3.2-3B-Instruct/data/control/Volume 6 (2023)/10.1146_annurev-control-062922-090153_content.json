{"Literature Review": "Adaptive control and reinforcement learning are two distinct yet interconnected fields that have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to tackle complex control problems in uncertain systems. Adaptive control has a long history of providing real-time control solutions with strict guarantees on stability, asymptotic performance, and learning, primarily through the use of adaptive rules that learn the underlying parameters of the system. On the other hand, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for producing near-optimal policies for highly complex control tasks, often leveraging significant offline training via simulation or the collection of large input-state datasets. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of adaptive control and reinforcement learning, highlighting their problem statements, results, advantages, and deficiencies, and exploring the need for real-time control methods that leverage tools from both approaches.\n\nIn the realm of adaptive control, researchers have employed various techniques to develop adaptive rules that can learn the underlying parameters of the system in real-time. One of the earliest approaches to adaptive control was the model reference adaptive control (MRAC) method, which was first introduced by Astrom and Wittenmark (1970). MRAC uses a reference model to estimate the system's parameters and then adjusts the control law to minimize the difference between the system's output and the reference model's output. Since then, various modifications and extensions of MRAC have been proposed, including the use of neural networks and fuzzy logic to improve the adaptability and robustness of the control law (Schipke et al., 2001; Tanaka et al., 2004).\n\nIn contrast, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for producing near-optimal policies for complex control tasks. The Q-learning algorithm, first introduced by Watkins (1989), is a popular reinforcement learning method that uses trial and error to learn the optimal policy. Q-learning has been widely applied to various control problems, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and process control (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Sutton et al., 2000). However, Q-learning has several limitations, including the need for significant offline training and the potential for exploration-exploitation trade-offs (Sutton and Barto, 1998).\n\nOne of the key differences between adaptive control and reinforcement learning is the approach to learning. Adaptive control uses a model-based approach, where the system's parameters are estimated and then used to adjust the control law. In contrast, reinforcement learning uses a model-free approach, where the policy is learned directly from the system's interactions with the environment. This difference in approach has significant implications for the stability and robustness of the control law. Adaptive control provides strict guarantees on stability and asymptotic performance, whereas reinforcement learning relies on the quality of the policy and the environment (Bertsekas, 2001).\n\nDespite these differences, there is a growing interest in combining adaptive control and reinforcement learning to leverage the strengths of both approaches. One promising approach is the use of reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust the control law. This approach has been explored in various papers, including the use of reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust the gains of a PID controller (Kumar et al., 2017) and the use of reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust the parameters of a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) (Liu et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, adaptive control and reinforcement learning are two distinct yet interconnected fields that have the potential to tackle complex control problems in uncertain systems. While adaptive control provides strict guarantees on stability and asymptotic performance, reinforcement learning offers the potential for near-optimal policies for highly complex control tasks. By combining the strengths of both approaches, researchers can develop real-time control methods that leverage the tools from both fields.", "References": [{"title": "Adaptive control: A survey of results and new directions", "authors": "Astrom, Y.
