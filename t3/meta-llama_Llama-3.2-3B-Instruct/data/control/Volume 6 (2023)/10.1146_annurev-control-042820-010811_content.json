{"Literature Review": "Networked control systems have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including smart energy grids, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and industrial and robotic systems. These systems rely on the interaction between a cyber-system component, represented by information-based computing and communication technologies, and a physical-system component, represented by the environment that needs to be controlled. The two main layers of the system, control and communication, strongly affect each other's performance, and they also reveal the interaction between the cyber-system and physical-system components. In recent years, the information access and distribution constraints required to achieve reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems have been intensively studied.\n\nThe study of networked control systems has led to the development of various control strategies, including model predictive control (MPC), model-based predictive control (MBPC), and distributed model predictive control (DMPC). These strategies have been shown to be effective in achieving reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems (1, 2).\n\nDecentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems has also been a topic of significant interest. Researchers have proposed various decentralized estimation algorithms, including distributed Kalman filter (DKF) and distributed particle filter (DPF) (3, 4). These algorithms have been shown to be effective in achieving reliable state estimation in networked control systems with limited communication resources.\n\nIn addition to decentralized estimation, the information-theoretic value of event timing in networked control systems has also been studied. Researchers have shown that event timing can be used to improve the reliability of state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems (5, 6). For example, event timing can be used to detect and respond to changes in the system state, which can improve the accuracy of state estimation and stabilization.\n\nFurthermore, the study of networked control systems has also led to the development of various control strategies that take into account the communication constraints. For example, researchers have proposed various control strategies that use event triggering, which involves triggering control actions based on the occurrence of specific events (7, 8). These strategies have been shown to be effective in achieving reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems with limited communication resources.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of networked control systems with multiple communication networks. Researchers have proposed various control strategies that take into account the interaction between multiple communication networks (9, 10). These strategies have been shown to be effective in achieving reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems with multiple communication networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of networked control systems has led to the development of various control strategies that take into account the interaction between the cyber-system and physical-system components. Decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems, the information-theoretic value of event timing, and control strategies that take into account the communication constraints have all been significant areas of research in this field. As networked control systems continue to become increasingly prevalent in various domains, it is likely that these areas of research will continue to be important in the future.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
