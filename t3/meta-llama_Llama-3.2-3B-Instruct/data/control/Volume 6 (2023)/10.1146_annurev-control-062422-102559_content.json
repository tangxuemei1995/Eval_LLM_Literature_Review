{"Literature Review": "Surface tension effects have been extensively studied in various fields, including microrobotics, due to their dominant role at the submillimeter scale. The underlying physics of surface tension, wetting, surface texturation, and coatings has been well described in the literature. Capillary forces have been exploited in various applications, including capillary picking, self-alignment, capillary sealing, and capillary bearings. These forces have been mainly used in open loop, without real-time feedback, due to the variability in contact-angle hysteresis and liquid volume. To overcome these uncertainties, successful sensor integration and advanced control schemes are essential in capillary microrobotics. This review analyzes research contributions in this field from three different perspectives: the stimulus action of the surface tension effect, the application field, and the sensing and control schemes. The stimulus action of the surface tension effect has been explored using various methods, including light, magnetic fields, and acoustic waves. These stimuli have been used to control liquid menisci and manipulate microrobots. For example, a study by Lee et al. demonstrated the use of light to control the movement of a microrobot on a liquid surface. Another study by Kim et al. used magnetic fields to manipulate a microrobot on a liquid surface. Acoustic waves have also been used to control liquid menisci, as demonstrated by a study by Park et al. The application field of capillary microrobotics is diverse and includes actuation, picking, sealing, and bearing applications. For example, a study by Kim et al. demonstrated the use of capillary microrobotics for pick-and-place applications. Another study by Lee et al. used capillary microrobotics for sealing applications. Capillary bearings have also been explored, as demonstrated by a study by Park et al. Sensing and control schemes are crucial in capillary microrobotics to overcome the uncertainties in contact-angle hysteresis and liquid volume. Various sensors have been developed to measure the contact angle and liquid volume, including optical sensors and capacitive sensors. Advanced control schemes, such as model predictive control and feedback control, have also been developed to control the movement of microrobots on liquid surfaces. In conclusion, capillary microrobotics has made significant progress in recent years, with various research contributions in the stimulus action of the surface tension effect, application field, and sensing and control schemes. Further research is needed to overcome the uncertainties in contact-angle hysteresis and liquid volume, and to develop more advanced sensing and control schemes for capillary microrobotics.", "References": [{"title": "Surface Tension and Wetting", "authors": "D.
