{"Literature Review": "The transition to low-inertia power systems poses significant control challenges, necessitating a reevaluation of classical concepts and the development of novel control strategies. This review aims to bridge the gap between device-level and system-level research, highlighting the importance of a system-theoretic mindset in understanding the complex interactions within low-inertia power systems.\n\nLow-inertia systems, which rely predominantly on power electronics and renewable energy resources, exhibit distinct frequency dynamics compared to traditional fossil fuel-based power plants. The lack of inertia in these systems results in a more rapid response to changes in demand and generation, leading to increased frequency variability (1). This, in turn, requires the development of advanced control strategies that can effectively manage frequency dynamics and ensure grid stability.\n\nOne of the primary control challenges in low-inertia systems is the lack of inertia, which makes it difficult to maintain a stable frequency. To address this, researchers have proposed various control strategies, including grid-forming control (2). Grid-forming control involves the use of power converters to actively shape the grid's frequency response, thereby maintaining stability in the presence of low-inertia systems.\n\nAnother critical aspect of low-inertia systems is the need for advanced power electronics control. The use of power converters to manage grid frequency and stability requires sophisticated control strategies that can effectively manage the interactions between power converters, electric machines, and the grid (3). Researchers have proposed various control strategies, including model predictive control (MPC) and model-based control, to address these challenges.\n\nIn addition to device-level control strategies, system-level services are also critical in low-inertia power systems. System-level services, such as frequency regulation and voltage support, require the coordination of multiple devices and control strategies to ensure effective management of grid stability (4). Researchers have proposed various system-level control strategies, including dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs), to address these challenges.\n\nThe development of novel control strategies for low-inertia power systems requires a system-theoretic mindset, which involves understanding the complex interactions between power electronics, electric machines, and the grid. By adopting a system-theoretic approach, researchers can develop more effective control strategies that can effectively manage frequency dynamics and ensure grid stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition to low-inertia power systems poses significant control challenges, necessitating a reevaluation of classical concepts and the development of novel control strategies. A system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge different research communities and understand the complex interactions within low-inertia power systems.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Wang, X., et al.
