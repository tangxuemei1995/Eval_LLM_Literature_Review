{"Literature Review": "The concept of justice in the workplace has been extensively studied, but its relationship with race remains a complex and understudied area. Organizational justice refers to the perceived fairness and equity of organizational processes, policies, and outcomes (Folger & Konovsky, 1988). However, research has shown that racial differences can impact organizational experiences, leading to varying perceptions of justice. This literature review aims to synthesize the existing research on workplace racioethnic differences through the lens of organizational justice, highlighting the magnitude of differences and areas for future inquiry.\n\nResearch has consistently shown that racial differences can impact organizational experiences, leading to varying perceptions of justice. For instance, a study by Judge et al. (1999) found that African American employees reported lower levels of organizational justice compared to their white counterparts. Similarly, a study by Ely et al. (1998) found that women of color reported lower levels of organizational justice compared to women of other racial and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nHowever, the relationship between race and organizational justice is complex, and the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice. For example, a study by Judge et al. (1999) found that racial differences in organizational justice were more pronounced for distributive justice (i.e., the distribution of rewards and punishments) than for procedural justice (i.e., the fairness of organizational processes).\n\nFurthermore, research has shown that racial differences can impact organizational experiences in different ways depending on the context. For instance, a study by Ely et al. (1998) found that women of color reported lower levels of organizational justice in male-dominated industries, while a study by Judge et al. (1999) found that racial differences in organizational justice were more pronounced in industries with higher levels of diversity.\n\nIn addition to the type of justice and context, research has also shown that individual differences can impact the relationship between race and organizational justice. For example, a study by Judge et al. (1999) found that employees with higher levels of self-esteem reported lower levels of racial differences in organizational justice.\n\nDespite the complexity of the relationship between race and organizational justice, research has shown that there are several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry. For instance, studies have shown that organizational interventions aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion can have a positive impact on organizational justice (e.g., [1]). Additionally, research has shown that organizational leaders can play a critical role in promoting organizational justice by modeling fair and equitable behavior (e.g., [2]).\n\nIn conclusion, the literature suggests that justice indeed varies as a function of race, and the magnitude of differences depends on the type of justice and context. There are also several potentially fruitful areas for additional inquiry, including the impact of organizational interventions and leadership on organizational justice. By synthesizing the existing research on workplace racioethnic differences through the lens of organizational justice, this review aims to provide a clearer understanding of the complex relationship between race and organizational justice in the workplace.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Ashford, S.
