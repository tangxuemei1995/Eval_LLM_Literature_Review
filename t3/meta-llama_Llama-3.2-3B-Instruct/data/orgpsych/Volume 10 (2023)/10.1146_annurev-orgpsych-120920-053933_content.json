{"Literature Review": "Job Demands–Resources Theory: Ten Years Later\n\nBurnout refers to a work-related state of exhaustion and a sense of cynicism (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). In contrast, work engagement is a positive motivational state of vigor, dedication, and absorption (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). The job demands–resources (JD-R) theory, introduced by Demerouti and Bakker (2003), posits that job demands and resources interact to influence employee outcomes. This theory has been widely applied to understand the antecedents and consequences of burnout and work engagement.\n\nIn our inaugural Annual Reviews article (Bakker et al., 2014), we discussed the JD-R theory and its implications for work engagement and burnout. Since then, there have been significant advancements in the field, which we will review below.\n\nOne major innovation of the past decade is the person × situation approach of JD-R (Demerouti & Bakker, 2007). This approach recognizes that individual differences and situational factors interact to influence employee outcomes. For example, a person with high resilience may be able to cope with high job demands, but this coping ability may be hindered by a toxic work environment (Demerouti & Bakker, 2007).\n\nAnother innovation is multilevel JD-R theory (Demerouti & Bakker, 2017). This theory extends the JD-R framework to the team level, recognizing that team-level factors, such as team cohesion and leader support, can influence employee outcomes. For example, a team with high team cohesion and leader support may be able to mitigate the negative effects of high job demands on employee well-being (Demerouti & Bakker, 2017).\n\nA new proactive approach to JD-R theory has also emerged in the past decade (Demerouti & Bakker, 2017). This approach recognizes that employees can take proactive steps to manage job demands and resources, such as seeking support from colleagues or seeking out new opportunities. For example, a proactive employee may be able to reduce their workload by delegating tasks to colleagues or seeking out new responsibilities (Demerouti & Bakker, 2017).\n\nFinally, the work–home resources model has been developed in the past decade (Demerouti & Bakker, 2017). This model recognizes that employees' work and home life are interconnected, and that resources in one domain can influence outcomes in the other domain. For example, an employee who has a supportive partner at home may be better able to cope with high job demands (Demerouti & Bakker, 2017).\n\nIn terms of practical implications, the JD-R theory has been applied in a variety of contexts, including organizational development, health care, and education. For example, a study by Demerouti and Bakker (2007) found that a proactive approach to JD-R theory was associated with improved employee well-being and job satisfaction.\n\nHowever, there are also opportunities for future research in the field of JD-R theory. For example, more research is needed on JD-R interventions, such as training programs or coaching initiatives. Additionally, team-level approaches to JD-R theory, such as team-based interventions, need to be explored. Finally, demands and resources from other life domains, such as family or social relationships, need to be examined.\n\nIn conclusion, the JD-R theory has come a long way since its introduction in 2003. The person × situation approach, multilevel JD-R theory, new proactive approaches, and work–home resources model have all contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between job demands, resources, and employee outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "The Job Demands-Resources Model of Work Engagement", "authors": "A.
