{"Literature Review": "Improving Workplace Judgments by Reducing Noise: Lessons Learned from a Century of Selection Research\n\nThe concept of noise in judgment and decision making has been a topic of interest for researchers in the field of personnel selection for nearly a century. Noise, or unwanted variance, is often considered the most neglected yet most important source of error in judgment (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). This problem was first identified in the area of personnel selection, where researchers sought to understand how to improve the accuracy of judgments made by selectors.\n\nOne of the earliest studies on noise in personnel selection was conducted by Thorndike (1920), who demonstrated that noise could be reduced by structuring the selection process. Thorndike's work laid the foundation for future research on the topic, which has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by decomposing the component parts of the selection process, agreeing on standards, and applying those standards consistently (Hunter & Hunter, 1984).\n\nAggregating judgments independently has also been shown to be an effective way to reduce noise in judgment (Barrick & Mount, 1991). This approach involves having multiple selectors make independent judgments on the same candidates, which can help to reduce the impact of individual biases and errors.\n\nAlgorithms can also aid in reducing noise in judgment, particularly in the context of strategic decision making (Dunbar, 1997). However, algorithms are often confused with methods that, in their current form, can substantially increase noise in judgment, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). To effectively reduce noise, it is essential to understand the limitations of these methods and to design algorithms that are transparent, explainable, and fair.\n\nRecent research has also highlighted the importance of considering the context in which judgments are made (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). For example, research has shown that the availability heuristic, which involves judging the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind, can lead to noise in judgment (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). By considering the context in which judgments are made, selectors can reduce the impact of noise and make more accurate decisions.\n\nIn addition to these findings, research has also shown that noise can have significant consequences in the workplace (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). For example, noise can lead to poor forecasting, which can have significant consequences for organizations (Fisher & Otto, 2008). By reducing noise in judgment, organizations can improve their forecasting accuracy and make more informed decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, a century of selection research has shown that noise can be demonstrably reduced by structuring the selection process, aggregating judgments independently, and using algorithms that are transparent, explainable, and fair. By understanding the limitations of these methods and considering the context in which judgments are made, selectors can reduce the impact of noise and make more accurate decisions.", "References": [{"title": "The effects of noise on judgment and decision making", "authors": "D.
