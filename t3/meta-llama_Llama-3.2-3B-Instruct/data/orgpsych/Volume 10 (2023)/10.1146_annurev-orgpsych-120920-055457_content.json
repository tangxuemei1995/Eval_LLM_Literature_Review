{"Literature Review": "Understanding the Dynamic Interplay Between Actor and Context for Creativity: Progress and Desirable Directions\n\nIndividual and team creativity and innovation are essential for organizational effectiveness and success. The typology we developed in 2014 has stimulated much research in the past decade. This literature review aims to review the body of work that has emerged from our typology, revisit and update the eight research recommendations we proposed previously, and highlight four desirable directions that help to chart the path for conducting frame-breaking research and accelerating theoretical breakthroughs.\n\nOur typology posits that creativity is the result of the dynamic interplay between the actor (individual or team) and the context in which they operate. This interplay is characterized by two types of interactions: person-context interaction and team-situation interaction. Person-context interaction refers to the ways in which the actor's characteristics, skills, and experiences interact with the context in which they operate, such as the organizational culture, technology, and resources. Team-situation interaction, on the other hand, refers to the ways in which the team's characteristics, skills, and experiences interact with the situation in which they operate, such as the project goals, deadlines, and constraints.\n\nResearch on person-context interaction has shown that the actor's characteristics and skills can influence their ability to adapt to the context and create innovative solutions (Amabile, 1996). For example, a study by Amabile (1996) found that individuals with higher levels of creativity were more likely to be able to adapt to new contexts and create innovative solutions. Similarly, research on team-situation interaction has shown that the team's characteristics and skills can influence their ability to create innovative solutions in response to changing situations (Hargadon & Sutton, 2011).\n\nOur typology also highlights the importance of considering the interplay between person-context interaction and team-situation interaction. Research has shown that the interplay between these two types of interactions can have a significant impact on creativity and innovation (Klein et al., 2001). For example, a study by Klein et al. (2001) found that teams that were able to adapt to changing situations and create innovative solutions were more likely to be successful in their endeavors.\n\nIn addition to the research on person-context interaction and team-situation interaction, there is also a growing body of research on the role of context in shaping creativity and innovation. Research has shown that the context in which creativity and innovation occur can have a significant impact on the outcomes (Hackman & Oldham, 1976). For example, a study by Hackman & Oldham (1976) found that teams that were able to work in a supportive and stimulating context were more likely to create innovative solutions.\n\nDespite the progress that has been made in understanding the dynamic interplay between actor and context for creativity, there are still many desirable directions for future research. One area of research that is particularly promising is the study of the role of emotions in creativity and innovation. Research has shown that emotions can play a significant role in shaping creativity and innovation (Isen, 2001). For example, a study by Isen (2001) found that individuals who were in a positive emotional state were more likely to create innovative solutions.\n\nAnother area of research that is particularly promising is the study of the role of technology in shaping creativity and innovation. Research has shown that technology can play a significant role in facilitating creativity and innovation (Dunbar, 1997). For example, a study by Dunbar (1997) found that teams that were able to use technology to facilitate collaboration and communication were more likely to create innovative solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, the dynamic interplay between actor and context is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is essential for understanding creativity and innovation. While there has been significant progress in understanding this phenomenon, there are still many desirable directions for future research. By continuing to explore the role of emotions, technology, and context in shaping creativity and innovation, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence this complex and multifaceted phenomenon.\n\nReferences:\n  1.
