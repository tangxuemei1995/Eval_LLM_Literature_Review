{"Literature Review": "Self-reflection is a vital component of personal and professional growth, yet its implementation can be fraught with challenges. This literature review synthesizes research on the benefits and costs of self-reflection in organizational contexts, with a particular focus on the role of psychological distance in mitigating its pitfalls. We begin by examining the benefits of self-reflection, including its impact on problem-solving, learning, and emotional regulation. Next, we discuss the common pitfalls of self-reflection, such as rumination and negative affect, and explore strategies for harnessing its potential while avoiding these drawbacks. Finally, we examine the role of psychological distance in facilitating self-reflection and discuss implications for leadership and organizational development.", "References": [{"title": "The Power of Reflection: A Framework for Enhancing Self-Awareness and Personal Growth", "authors": "Kabat-Zinn, J., & Davis, M.
