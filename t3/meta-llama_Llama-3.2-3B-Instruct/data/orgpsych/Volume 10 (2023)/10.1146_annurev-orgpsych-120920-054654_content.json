{"Literature Review": "Employee voice and silence have been extensively studied over the past decade, with a growing body of research shedding light on the complex factors that influence employees' decisions to speak up or remain silent. This review aims to summarize the key findings, identify underexplored issues, and highlight the limitations of current conceptualizations and methodologies. By examining the individual and organizational implications of employee voice and silence, this review seeks to motivate and guide future research that will address the remaining questions and explore the broader implications of this construct.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of Employee Voice in Organizational Change", "authors": "Hart, P.
