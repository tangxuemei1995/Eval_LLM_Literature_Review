{"Literature Review": "Leader Thinking, Follower Thinking: Leader Impacts on Follower Creative Performance\n\nInnovation and creative thinking are essential for organizations to stay competitive in today's fast-paced business environment. Creative thinking is a complex, voluntary activity that involves performance on certain types of problems (Amabile, 1996). Leaders play a crucial role in influencing followers' willingness to engage in and ability to solve creative problems. This literature review aims to explore the impact of leader thinking on follower creative performance, highlighting the importance of leader thinking skills and development in fostering a creative work environment.\n\nResearch has consistently shown that leaders who possess strong creative thinking skills are more effective in motivating and guiding their followers to engage in creative problem-solving (Hargadon & Sutton, 2011). A study by Hargadon and Sutton (2011) found that leaders who were more open to new ideas and perspectives were more likely to encourage their followers to think creatively. Similarly, a study by Amabile (1996) found that leaders who valued and recognized creative contributions were more likely to foster a culture of innovation.\n\nLeader thinking skills, such as divergent thinking and convergent thinking, are critical in influencing follower creative performance (Runco, 2014). Divergent thinking, which involves generating a wide range of ideas, is essential for creative problem-solving, while convergent thinking, which involves evaluating and refining ideas, is critical for selecting the best solutions (Runco, 2014). Leaders who possess strong divergent thinking skills are more likely to encourage their followers to generate a wide range of ideas, while leaders who possess strong convergent thinking skills are more likely to evaluate and refine ideas effectively.\n\nIn addition to leader thinking skills, leader development is also critical in fostering a creative work environment. A study by Boyatzis (2001) found that leaders who underwent training and development programs were more likely to exhibit creative thinking skills and behaviors. Similarly, a study by Goleman (2000) found that leaders who were more emotionally intelligent were more effective in motivating and guiding their followers to engage in creative problem-solving.\n\nThe implications of these observations for leader assessment and leader development are significant. Leaders who possess strong creative thinking skills and development are more likely to foster a culture of innovation and creativity in their organizations. Leaders who are more open to new ideas and perspectives, value and recognize creative contributions, and possess strong divergent and convergent thinking skills are more effective in motivating and guiding their followers to engage in creative problem-solving.\n\nIn conclusion, leader thinking and follower thinking are closely intertwined. Leaders who possess strong creative thinking skills and development are more likely to foster a culture of innovation and creativity in their organizations. Leaders who are more open to new ideas and perspectives, value and recognize creative contributions, and possess strong divergent and convergent thinking skills are more effective in motivating and guiding their followers to engage in creative problem-solving.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
