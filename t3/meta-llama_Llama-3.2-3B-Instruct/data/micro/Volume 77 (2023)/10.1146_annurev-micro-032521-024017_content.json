{"Literature Review": "Collab or Cancel? Bacterial Influencers of Inflammasome Signaling\n\nThe immune system of multicellular organisms protects them from harmful microbes. To establish an infection in the face of host immune responses, pathogens must evolve specific strategies to target immune defense mechanisms. One such defense is the formation of intracellular protein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are triggered by the detection of microbial components and the disruption of homeostatic processes that occur during bacterial infection. Formation of active inflammasomes initiates programmed cell death pathways via activation of inflammatory caspases and cleavage of target proteins. Inflammasome-activated cell death pathways such as pyroptosis lead to proinflammatory responses that protect the host.\n\nBacterial infection has the capacity to influence inflammasomes in two distinct ways: activation and perturbation. In this review, we discuss how bacterial activities influence inflammasomes, and we discuss the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen.\n\nInflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that assemble in response to microbial components such as peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and flagellin (1). The formation of inflammasomes is mediated by the NLR (NOD-like receptor) family of proteins, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the assembly of the inflammasome complex (2). The inflammasome complex then activates caspase-1, a key effector caspase that cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² and IL-18, leading to the initiation of inflammatory responses (3).\n\nBacterial pathogens have evolved various strategies to evade or manipulate inflammasome signaling. For example, some pathogens can inhibit the activation of caspase-1 by binding to and blocking the NLR inflammasome (4). Other pathogens can manipulate the host's immune response by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines that suppress the activation of inflammasomes (5). In addition, some pathogens can manipulate the host's cellular environment to prevent the formation of inflammasomes, for example by producing enzymes that degrade the host's NLR inflammasome (6).\n\nThe consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen are significant. Inflammasome activation leads to the initiation of proinflammatory responses that protect the host from infection, but can also lead to tissue damage and inflammation (7). On the other hand, evasion of inflammasome activation can allow pathogens to establish infection and evade the host's immune response, but can also lead to the suppression of the host's immune response and the promotion of chronic inflammation (8).\n\nRecent studies have highlighted the importance of gasdermin D, a protein that is released from host cells during pyroptosis, in the regulation of inflammasome signaling (9). Gasdermin D has been shown to regulate the activity of caspase-1 and the formation of the inflammasome complex, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases (10).\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling is complex and multifaceted. Bacterial pathogens have evolved various strategies to target and manipulate inflammasome signaling, and the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen are significant. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of inflammasome signaling and the role of bacterial pathogens in regulating this process.\n\nReferences:\n 1. Martin-Lopez et al. (2016).
