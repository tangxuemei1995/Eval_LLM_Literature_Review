{"Literature Review": "Habitat transition in the evolution of bacteria and archaea refers to the process by which microbial populations adapt to new environments, leading to changes in their physicochemical conditions, protein inventories, and genomic characteristics. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding the dispersal and adaptation of microbial lineages across Earth's habitats. The evolution of bacteria and archaea has been shaped by numerous dispersal and adaptation events, which have led to the establishment of diverse microbial communities in various environments, including animal microbiomes. In this review, we will discuss the characteristics and mechanisms of habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal lineages, with a focus on populations that reside in animal microbiomes.The evolution of microbial communities in animal microbiomes is a complex process that involves the interaction of multiple factors, including the host's immune system, the availability of nutrients, and the presence of environmental stressors. The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, which are known for their ability to inhabit a wide range of environments, have undergone repeated habitat transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. These transitions are thought to have occurred through a process of horizontal gene transfer, where genes from the host's microbiome are acquired by the CPR bacteria, allowing them to adapt to new environments (1).Studies have shown that CPR bacteria have undergone significant changes in their protein inventories and genomic characteristics during their transitions from environmental sources to animal microbiomes (2). For example, a study on the CPR bacteria Melainabacteria found that they had acquired genes related to the metabolism of host-derived nutrients, such as amino acids and sugars (3). Similarly, a study on the CPR bacteria Elusimicrobia found that they had acquired genes related to the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are thought to play a role in their ability to colonize new environments (4).In addition to CPR bacteria, other microbial lineages, including free-living cells and cellular endosymbionts, have also undergone habitat transitions from environmental sources to animal microbiomes. For example, the methanogenic archaea, which are known for their ability to produce methane, have been found to inhabit the gut microbiomes of ruminant animals (5). Similarly, the bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, have been found to inhabit the microbiomes of various hosts, including humans (6).The mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions are thought to involve a range of factors, including the modification of protein inventories and the acquisition of new genes. For example, a study on the adaptation of CPR bacteria to the gut microbiome of a mouse found that they had acquired genes related to the metabolism of host-derived nutrients and the production of antimicrobial peptides (7). Similarly, a study on the adaptation of methanogenic archaea to the gut microbiome of a ruminant animal found that they had acquired genes related to the production of methane (8).Despite the significant advances that have been made in understanding the evolution of microbial communities in animal microbiomes, there is still much to be learned about the characteristics and mechanisms of habitat transitions. For example, the frequency of migration events and the potential environmental barriers that prevent the establishment of new microbial communities are not well understood. Furthermore, the role of the host's immune system in shaping the evolution of microbial communities is still a topic of debate.In conclusion, habitat transition in the evolution of bacteria and archaea is a complex process that involves the interaction of multiple factors, including the host's immune system, the availability of nutrients, and the presence of environmental stressors. The evolution of microbial communities in animal microbiomes is shaped by numerous dispersal and adaptation events, which have led to the establishment of diverse microbial communities in various environments. Further study is needed to fully understand the characteristics and mechanisms of habitat transitions, including the frequency of migration events, the potential environmental barriers, and the mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Horizontal gene transfer and the evolution of microbial communities", "authors": "Boucher, D.
