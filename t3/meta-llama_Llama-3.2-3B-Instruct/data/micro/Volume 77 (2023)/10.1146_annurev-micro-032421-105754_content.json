{"Literature Review": "The human gut phageome, a complex community of phages and bacteria, plays a crucial role in human health and disease. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to investigate the taxonomic structure and ecological functions of phages in the gut. However, the impact of various factors on phageome composition remains poorly understood. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the factors affecting the variation of the human gut phageome, with a focus on age, diet, and geography. We also discuss the potential role of phageome alterations in disease etiology and pathogenesis, and highlight the need for standardization in studying the gut phageome to ensure consistent results.", "References": [{"title": "Phage diversity and abundance in the human gut microbiome", "authors": "Liu, C., et al.
