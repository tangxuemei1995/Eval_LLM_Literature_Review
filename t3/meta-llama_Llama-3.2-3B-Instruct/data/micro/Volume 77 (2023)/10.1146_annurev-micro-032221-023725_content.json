{"Literature Review": "Electron Transfer Beyond the Outer Membrane: Putting Electrons to Rest\n\nExtracellular electron transfer (EET) is a physiological process that enables the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond the surface of a microbial cell. The first bacteria characterized with this capability were Shewanella and Geobacter, both reported to couple their growth to the reduction of iron or manganese oxide minerals located extracellularly. A key difference between EET and nearly every other respiratory activity on Earth is the need to transfer electrons beyond the cell membrane. The past decade has resolved how well-conserved strategies conduct electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. However, recent data suggest a much wider and less well understood collection of mechanisms enabling electron transfer to distant acceptors.\n\nShewanella and Geobacter have been extensively studied for their ability to transfer electrons beyond the outer membrane. These bacteria possess a unique set of cytochromes and electron shuttles that enable them to couple their growth to the reduction of extracellular minerals. The cytochrome c-type cytochrome, Cyt c552, is a key component of the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 electron transfer system. This cytochrome is capable of transferring electrons to a variety of acceptors, including iron oxide, manganese oxide, and even other bacteria.\n\nGeobacter, on the other hand, has been shown to possess a more complex electron transfer system, involving multiple cytochromes and electron shuttles. The Geobacter sulfurreducens electron transfer system has been characterized in detail, and has been shown to be capable of transferring electrons to a variety of acceptors, including iron oxide and manganese oxide.\n\nRecent studies have also highlighted the importance of electron shuttles in EET. Electron shuttles are molecules that can transfer electrons between different acceptors, and have been shown to play a key role in the EET process. The Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 electron transfer system, for example, involves a series of electron shuttles that enable the transfer of electrons from the cytochrome c-type cytochrome, Cyt c552, to the extracellular acceptor.\n\nIn addition to Shewanella and Geobacter, other bacteria have also been shown to possess EET capabilities. For example, the bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans has been shown to transfer electrons to iron oxide and manganese oxide. The bacterium Psychrobacter arcticus has also been shown to possess EET capabilities, and has been found to transfer electrons to a variety of acceptors, including iron oxide and manganese oxide.\n\nThe mechanisms underlying EET are complex and multifaceted. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the outer membrane in EET, and have shown that the outer membrane plays a key role in the transfer of electrons to distant acceptors. The outer membrane is composed of a variety of lipids and proteins, and is capable of facilitating the transfer of electrons through a process known as electron tunneling.\n\nIn conclusion, EET is a complex and multifaceted process that enables the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond the surface of a microbial cell. Shewanella and Geobacter have been extensively studied for their ability to transfer electrons beyond the outer membrane, and have been shown to possess unique sets of cytochromes and electron shuttles that enable this process. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of electron shuttles and the outer membrane in EET, and have shown that these mechanisms play a key role in the transfer of electrons to distant acceptors.", "References": [{"title": "Initial steps in the enrichment and characterization of microorganisms capable of extracellular electron transfer", "authors": "Bond, D.
