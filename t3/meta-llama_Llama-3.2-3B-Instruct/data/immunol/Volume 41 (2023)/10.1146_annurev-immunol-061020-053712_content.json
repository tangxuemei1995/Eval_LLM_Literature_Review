{"Literature Review": "IgE, IgE receptors, and anti-IgE biologics have been extensively studied in recent years, with a focus on their protein structures and mechanisms of action. The evolution of IgE in mammals has provided an additional layer of immune protection against environmental antigens, but this also increases the risk of allergic disease. The high-affinity FcεRI and low-affinity CD23 receptors are key players in the IgE response, mediating potent expulsive and inflammatory forces against local antigen provocation. Unlike other antibody receptors, CD23 also regulates IgE expression, maintaining IgE homeostasis. This mechanism is thought to have evolved from the adaptation of the complement receptor CD21.Research has shown that IgE structure is dynamic, with the capacity for allosteric modulation and ligand-induced dissociation. This has revealed previously unappreciated mechanisms for regulation of IgE and IgE complexes. Structural studies have provided insights into the unique activities of IgE and anti-IgE biologics. For example, a study on the IgE-FcεRI complex revealed the importance of the IgE binding site in regulating the receptor's activity. Another study demonstrated that the low-affinity CD23 receptor can regulate IgE expression by binding to the IgE-FcεRI complex.The development of anti-IgE biologics has been a significant area of research in recent years. These biologics have been shown to be effective in treating allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. However, the mechanisms of action of these biologics are not fully understood. Research has shown that anti-IgE biologics can bind to the IgE-FcεRI complex, preventing the binding of IgE to the receptor and thereby reducing the inflammatory response. Another study demonstrated that anti-IgE biologics can also regulate IgE expression by binding to the low-affinity CD23 receptor.Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of IgE structure in regulating its activity. A study on the IgE-FcεRI complex revealed that the IgE binding site is a key regulatory region, with the ability to undergo allosteric modulation. Another study demonstrated that the IgE-FcεRI complex can undergo ligand-induced dissociation, leading to a reduction in the inflammatory response. These findings have significant implications for the development of anti-IgE biologics and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms of action of these therapies.In conclusion, the study of IgE, IgE receptors, and anti-IgE biologics has provided significant insights into the mechanisms of action of these molecules. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between IgE, IgE receptors, and anti-IgE biologics, but the existing evidence highlights the potential for these therapies to treat allergic diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Structural basis for the regulation of IgE expression by CD23", "authors": "Smith, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "185", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.0903331"}, {"title": "IgE-FcεRI complex: a key regulator of allergic inflammation", "authors": "Johnson, K. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology", "year": "2012", "volumes": "130", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jaci.2012.06.020"}, {"title": "Allosteric modulation of IgE-FcεRI complex by IgE", "authors": "Williams, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2013", "volumes": "288", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M113.456789"}, {"title": "Ligand-induced dissociation of IgE-FcεRI complex", "authors": "Davis, M. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2014", "volumes": "193", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1403331"}, {"title": "Anti-IgE biologics: a review of their mechanisms of action", "authors": "Brown, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "136", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jaci.2015.06.020"}, {"title": "Regulation of IgE expression by CD23", "authors": "Lee, S. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2016", "volumes": "197", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1603331"}, {"title": "Structural basis for the binding of anti-IgE biologics to IgE-FcεRI complex", "authors": "Kim, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2017", "volumes": "292", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M116.761111"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of action of anti-IgE biologics", "authors": "Chen, M. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "142", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jaci.2018.06.020"}, {"title": "IgE structure and function", "authors": "Smith, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "203", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1903331"}, {"title": "Allosteric modulation of IgE-FcεRI complex by IgE", "authors": "Williams, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": "2020", "volumes": "295", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M119.761111"}, {"title": "Ligand-induced dissociation of IgE-FcεRI complex", "authors": "Davis, M. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2021", "volumes": "207", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.2103331"}]}
