{"Literature Review": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a complex and multifaceted strategy of pathogen sensing that involves the detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. Unlike pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are conserved and germline-encoded, effectors are often diverse and rapidly evolving, making them unsuitable targets for direct detection by germline-encoded receptors. Instead, ETI involves the detection of virulence activities associated with effectors, which can be sensed indirectly by the host immune system. This strategy is used across diverse phyla, including plants, and is a critical component of innate immunity. The molecular mechanisms of ETI are complex and involve the coordinated action of multiple immune receptors and signaling pathways. For example, in plants, ETI is mediated by the recognition of effectors by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which trigger a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of defense genes and the production of defense-related molecules. In animals, ETI has been shown to involve the recognition of effectors by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the activation of immune responses, including the production of cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. One of the key features of ETI is its ability to detect a wide range of effectors, including those produced by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This is in contrast to PAMP detection, which is limited to a specific set of conserved ligands. ETI has been shown to be effective against a range of pathogens, including those that are resistant to PAMP detection. For example, the recognition of the bacterial effector AvrPtoB by the plant PRR BAK1 has been shown to trigger a robust defense response against the bacterial pathogen Hpa1. Despite its importance, ETI remains a poorly understood field, and much remains to be discovered about its mechanisms and functions. Recent studies have highlighted the complexity of ETI and the need for further research to fully understand its role in innate immunity. For example, a recent study has shown that ETI can be triggered by a range of effectors, including those produced by bacteria and viruses, and that it can be modulated by the host immune system. This study highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms of ETI and its role in innate immunity. In addition to its role in innate immunity, ETI has also been shown to play a critical role in the development of adaptive immunity. For example, the recognition of effectors by immune cells has been shown to trigger the activation of immune responses, including the production of cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. This suggests that ETI may play a critical role in the development of adaptive immunity and that further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and functions. In conclusion, ETI is a complex and multifaceted strategy of pathogen sensing that involves the detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. ETI is used across diverse phyla, including plants, and is a critical component of innate immunity. Despite its importance, ETI remains a poorly understood field, and much remains to be discovered about its mechanisms and functions. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of ETI in innate immunity and its potential applications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Plant Immunity", "authors": "Bent, A.
