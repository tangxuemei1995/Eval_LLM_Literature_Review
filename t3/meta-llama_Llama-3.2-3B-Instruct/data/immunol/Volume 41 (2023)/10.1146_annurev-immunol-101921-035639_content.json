{"Literature Review": "The complement system, a key component of the innate immune response, has been extensively studied for its role in neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. Recent advances in understanding the complement system's functions in the central nervous system (CNS) have opened up new avenues for precision therapeutic targeting in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The complement system acts as a sensor of tissue distress, protecting the brain from microbial challenge and the accumulation of dead and/or damaged molecules and cells. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the complement system's contributions to neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation, with a focus on its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroprotection is one of the primary functions of the complement system in the CNS. The complement system's activation leads to the production of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic factors, which help to protect neurons from damage. For example, the C1q protein, a key component of the classical complement pathway, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Additionally, the complement system's ability to clear amyloid-β plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, has been implicated in its neuroprotective effects. Neuronal plasticity is another critical function of the complement system in the CNS. The complement system's activation has been shown to promote synaptic plasticity, a key mechanism underlying learning and memory. The C3a protein, a fragment of the complement component C3, has been shown to enhance synaptic transmission and promote neuronal survival. Furthermore, the complement system's ability to regulate the activity of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, has been implicated in its role in neuronal plasticity. However, the complement system's role in neuroinflammation is complex and context-dependent. While the complement system's activation can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory factors, it also has anti-inflammatory properties that help to regulate the immune response. For example, the C5a protein, a fragment of the complement component C5, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the complement system's ability to regulate the activity of microglia has been implicated in its role in neuroinflammation. Recent advances in understanding the complement system's functions in the CNS have led to the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting the complement system. For example, the C1 inhibitor, a protein that regulates the activity of the classical complement pathway, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in models of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the complement system's ability to clear amyloid-β plaques has been targeted by therapies such as bapineuzumab, which has shown promise in clinical trials. In conclusion, the complement system plays a critical role in neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation in the CNS. Recent advances in understanding the complement system's functions have opened up new avenues for precision therapeutic targeting in neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the complement system's role in the CNS and to develop effective therapeutic strategies targeting this system.", "References": [{"title": "Complement system and neurodegenerative diseases", "authors": "S.
