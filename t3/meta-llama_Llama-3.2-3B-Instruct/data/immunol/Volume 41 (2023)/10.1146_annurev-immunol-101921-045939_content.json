{"Literature Review": "Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of T cell development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death. The effects of TGF-β on T cells are complex and context-dependent, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various immune-related disorders, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and transplant rejection. In this review, we will discuss the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-β regulation of T cells, focusing on CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells, innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and γδ T cells. TGF-β is known to maintain the quiescence of naive CD4+ T cells by inhibiting their activation and proliferation. This is achieved through the induction of Foxp3, a transcription factor essential for the development and function of regulatory T cells. The induction of Foxp3 is a critical step in the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells, which play a key role in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune disease. In contrast, TGF-β inhibits the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, two subsets of CD4+ T cells involved in cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity, respectively. However, TGF-β promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells, two subsets of CD4+ T cells involved in inflammatory responses and tissue repair. Th17 cells produce IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Th9 cells produce IL-9, a cytokine that promotes the differentiation of Th2 cells and the production of IgE antibodies. TGF-β is also required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells involved in cell-mediated immunity. The development of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, which are essential for the control of viral infections and the prevention of cancer, is also dependent on TGF-β. TGF-β suppresses the effector function of CD8+ T cells, which is essential for the control of viral infections and the prevention of cancer. In addition to its effects on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, TGF-β also regulates the generation and function of innate lymphoid cells, which are essential for the initiation of immune responses. TGF-β also regulates the generation and function of intraepithelial lymphocytes, which are essential for the control of infections in the gut. Finally, TGF-β regulates the generation and function of γδ T cells, a subset of T cells involved in innate immunity. In conclusion, TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of T cell development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various immune-related disorders, and its effects on T cells are complex and context-dependent. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which TGF-β regulates T cells and to explore its therapeutic potential in the treatment of immune-related disorders.", "References": [{"title": "TGF-β and the regulation of T cell development and function", "authors": "L.
