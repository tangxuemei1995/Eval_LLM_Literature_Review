{"Literature Review": "Cancer immunotherapies have shown significant promise in treating various types of cancer, with T cells and natural killer (NK) cells playing crucial roles in tumor immunity. The complementary functions of T cells and NK cells offer opportunities to enhance the impact of immunotherapy by targeting immune evasion mechanisms and inhibitory receptor-ligand systems. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of IL-2 in activating NK cells and recruiting dendritic cells to tumors, which in turn enhances CD8 T cell responses. Targeting the activating NKG2D receptor and its ligands MICA and MICB on tumor cells has also been shown to be a promising therapeutic strategy. In addition, inhibitory receptor-ligand systems such as CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E can be targeted to enhance T cell- and NK cell-mediated immunity. Emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines have also been explored to profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of cancer immunotherapies that engage T cells and NK cells, highlighting the potential of these approaches in treating various types of cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Cancer Immunotherapy: A New Era in Cancer Treatment", "authors": "Brahmer, J.
