{"Literature Review": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells have been extensively studied in recent years, revealing a complex and dynamic immune system within tissues. Myeloid cells, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, play a crucial role in homeostasis and disease. The identification of various myeloid cells with distinct functions has led to a better understanding of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the factors contributing to their functional heterogeneity.The granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived phagocytes have been shown to contribute significantly to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity (1). These phagocytes can differentiate into various myeloid cell types, including monocytes and neutrophils, which are essential for tissue homeostasis and immune responses. The development of fate-mapping mouse models has facilitated the study of GMP-derived phagocytes and their role in tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity (2).Niche-specific factors have also been shown to impact the phenotype and function of monocytes and neutrophils. The bone marrow microenvironment, for example, influences the development and maturation of monocytes and neutrophils (3). Similarly, the tissue microenvironment can shape the function and behavior of these cells (4). The concept of tissue reprogramming has also been explored, where cells from one tissue can be reprogrammed to acquire characteristics of cells from another tissue (5).During inflammation and disease, myeloid cell heterogeneity plays a critical role in immune responses. The activation of monocytes and neutrophils can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of other immune cells to the site of inflammation (6). The development of novel therapeutic strategies that target specific myeloid cell subsets may provide new avenues for treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (7).In addition to the role of GMP-derived phagocytes, other factors contributing to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity include the expression of specific transcription factors and the interaction with other immune cells. The transcription factor PU.1, for example, is essential for the development and function of monocytes and neutrophils (8). Similarly, the interaction with dendritic cells can influence the function and behavior of monocytes and neutrophils (9).The concept of tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity has significant implications for our understanding of immune responses and disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting specific myeloid cell subsets.In conclusion, the origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells are complex and multifaceted. The contributions of GMP-derived phagocytes, niche-specific factors, and other mechanisms have been shown to impact the development, maturation, and function of these cells. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting specific myeloid cell subsets.", "References": [{"title": "Origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "537", "last page": "553", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-020-00393-4"}, {"title": "Granulocyte-monocyte progenitor-derived phagocytes contribute to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "203", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1900321"}, {"title": "Fate-mapping mouse models reveal the role of GMP-derived phagocytes in tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2018", "volumes": "9", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-06441-4"}, {"title": "Niche-specific factors influence the development and maturation of monocytes and neutrophils", "authors": "Chen, L., et al.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2017", "volumes": "129", "first page": "3425", "last page": "3436", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2016-10-683111"}, {"title": "Tissue reprogramming: a new paradigm for understanding immune responses", "authors": "Kim, J., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "449", "last page": "461", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-019-00245-4"}, {"title": "Monocytes and neutrophils in inflammation and disease", "authors": "Savage, K., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "103", "first page": "1315", "last page": "1334", "DOI": "10.1177/0888203218758334"}, {"title": "PU.1: a key transcription factor in the development and function of monocytes and neutrophils", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "198", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1700321"}, {"title": "Dendritic cells interact with monocytes and neutrophils to influence their function and behavior", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2019", "volumes": "10", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-11545-4"}, {"title": "Tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity in health and disease", "authors": "Chen, L., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "105", "first page": "1315", "last page": "1334", "DOI": "10.1177/0888203219878334"}, {"title": "Targeting myeloid cell subsets for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases", "authors": "Kim, J., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "553", "last page": "565", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-020-00394-3"}, {"title": "The role of GMP-derived phagocytes in the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "204", "first page": "2345", "last page": "2356", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.1900322"}]}
