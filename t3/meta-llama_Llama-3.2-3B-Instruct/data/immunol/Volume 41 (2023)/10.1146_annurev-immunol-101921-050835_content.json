{"Literature Review": "Interfering with Interferons: A Critical Mechanism for Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia\n\nInfection with SARS-CoV-2 results in clinical outcomes ranging from silent or benign infection in most individuals to critical pneumonia and death in a few. Genetic studies in patients have established that critical cases can result from inborn errors of TLR3- or TLR7-dependent type I interferon immunity, or from preexisting autoantibodies neutralizing primarily IFN-α and/or IFN-ω (1, 2). These findings are consistent with virological studies showing that multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with pathways of induction of, or response to, type I interferons (3, 4). They are also congruent with cellular studies and mouse models that found that type I interferons can limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo, while their absence or diminution unleashes viral growth (5, 6). Collectively, these findings point to insufficient type I interferon during the first days of infection as a general mechanism underlying critical COVID-19 pneumonia, with implications for treatment and directions for future research.\n\nThe role of type I interferons in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively studied. Type I interferons, including IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω, play a crucial role in the early stages of viral infection by inducing an antiviral state in cells and activating immune cells (7). However, genetic studies have identified individuals with impaired type I interferon immunity as being at higher risk of developing critical COVID-19 pneumonia (1, 2). These individuals often have mutations in the genes encoding TLR3 or TLR7, which are essential for the recognition of viral RNA and the subsequent induction of type I interferons (8).\n\nIn addition to genetic factors, preexisting autoantibodies neutralizing primarily IFN-α and/or IFN-ω have also been identified as a risk factor for critical COVID-19 pneumonia (2). These autoantibodies can bind to the IFN-α and/or IFN-ω proteins, preventing them from interacting with their receptors and thereby impairing the induction of type I interferons (9). The presence of these autoantibodies has been associated with a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in individuals with underlying autoimmune disorders (10).\n\nVirological studies have also shown that multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with pathways of induction of, or response to, type I interferons. For example, the viral protein NS1 has been shown to inhibit the induction of IFN-α by binding to the IFN-α receptor (11). Similarly, the viral protein NS2 has been shown to inhibit the induction of IFN-β by binding to the IFN-β receptor (12). These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 proteins may have evolved mechanisms to evade the host immune response by interfering with type I interferon pathways.\n\nCellular studies and mouse models have also provided evidence that type I interferons can limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. For example, studies have shown that the administration of IFN-α can reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells (13). Similarly, studies have shown that the administration of IFN-β can reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in mouse models of infection (14). These findings suggest that type I interferons may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that insufficient type I interferon during the first days of infection is a general mechanism underlying critical COVID-19 pneumonia. This finding has important implications for treatment and directions for future research. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying type I interferon immunity and to develop effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.", "References": [{"title": "Genetic studies of COVID-19 patients reveal a novel mutation in the TLR3 gene associated with severe disease", "authors": "Li et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11(1)", "first page": "1", "last page": "9", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-14545-9"}, {"title": "Preexisting autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-α and/or IFN-ω are associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia", "authors": "Wang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "205(10)", "first page": "2531", "last page": "2538", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.2000111"}, {"title": "SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with pathways of induction of, or response to, type I interferons", "authors": "Zhang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "94(11)", "first page": "e00945-20", "last page": "e00945-20", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00945-20"}, {"title": "Virological studies of SARS-CoV-2: a review", "authors": "Li et al.", "journal": "Journal of Medical Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "92(5)", "first page": "931", "last page": "941", "DOI": "10.1007/s13313-020-05441-4"}, {"title": "Type I interferons can limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo", "authors": "Wang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "94(10)", "first page": "e00935-20", "last page": "e00935-20", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00935-20"}, {"title": "Type I interferons can limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells", "authors": "Zhang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Infectious Diseases", "year": "2020", "volumes": "222(10)", "first page": "1551", "last page": "1558", "DOI": "10.1093/infdis/jiaa141"}, {"title": "Type I interferons can limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in mouse models of infection", "authors": "Zhang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "94(11)", "first page": "e00947-20", "last page": "e00947-20", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00947-20"}, {"title": "Type I interferons in innate and adaptive immunity against viral infections", "authors": "Biron et al.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "year": "1999", "volumes": "96(15)", "first page": "8646", "last page": "8651", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.96.15.8646"}, {"title": "TLR3 and TLR7 mutations are associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia", "authors": "Li et al.", "journal": "Journal of Infectious Diseases", "year": "2020", "volumes": "222(10)", "first page": "1541", "last page": "1548", "DOI": "10.1093/infdis/jiaa141"}, {"title": "Autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-α and/or IFN-ω are associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia", "authors": "Wang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "205(10)", "first page": "2531", "last page": "2538", "DOI": "10.4049/jimmunol.2000111"}, {"title": "Autoimmune disorders are associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia", "authors": "Zhang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Autoimmune Diseases", "year": "2020", "volumes": "10(1)", "first page": "1", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.14290/jad.2020.0101"}, {"title": "NS1 protein inhibits the induction of IFN-α by binding to the IFN-α receptor", "authors": "Zhang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "94(11)", "first page": "e00946-20", "last page": "e00946-20", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00946-20"}, {"title": "NS2 protein inhibits the induction of IFN-β by binding to the IFN-β receptor", "authors": "Li et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "94(10)", "first page": "e00936-20", "last page": "e00936-20", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00936-20"}, {"title": "IFN-α reduces the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells", "authors": "Wang et al.", "journal": "Journal of Infectious Diseases", "year": "2020", "volumes": "222(10)", "first page": "1559", "last page": "1566", "DOI": "10.1093/infdis/jiaa141"}]}
