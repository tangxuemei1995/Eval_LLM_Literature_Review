{"Literature Review": "The aging process is associated with significant changes in the T cell compartment, leading to immunosenescence. One of the hallmark changes is the reduction of the naive T cell pool, which is crucial for the maintenance of immune homeostasis (1). In contrast, the accumulation of memory-like T cells, particularly those with a terminally differentiated phenotype, is a notable feature of aging (2). These memory-like T cells exhibit a loss of costimulatory molecule expression and acquire properties of senescent cells, contributing to the development of inflammaging (3). Furthermore, the accumulation of these cells in nonlymphoid tissues, such as adipose tissue and muscle, is thought to contribute to tissue deterioration (4). In addition to these changes, the aging T cell compartment also exhibits a shift towards cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, which can contribute to tissue damage (5). Exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production are another subset of age-associated T cells, which can lead to chronic inflammation (6). Regulatory T cells, which are typically involved in maintaining immune tolerance, also undergo changes during aging, acquiring proinflammatory features that can contribute to tissue damage (7). The loss of lymph node homing capacity by these subsets is a critical factor in their accumulation in nonlymphoid tissues, where they can contribute to the development of chronic inflammation and tissue deterioration (8). The mechanisms underlying these changes are complex and multifactorial, involving thymic involution, changes in the cytokine environment, and the accumulation of senescent cells (9). Understanding the different subsets of age-associated T cells and their contributions to tissue deterioration is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of aging on the immune system. In this review, we focus on the different subsets of age-associated T cells that accumulate during aging, including extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production, and regulatory T cells with proinflammatory features. We also discuss the importance of lymph node homing capacity in the accumulation of these cells in nonlymphoid tissues and the potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of age-associated T cell dysfunction.", "References": [{"title": "Immunosenescence: The Age-Related Decline in Immune Function", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.", "journal": "Annual Review of Immunology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "38", "first page": "247", "last page": "275", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-immunol-020718-104531"}, {"title": "Thymic Involution and the Decline in T Cell Function with Aging", "authors": "Santos, R.
