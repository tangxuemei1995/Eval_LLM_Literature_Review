{"Literature Review": "Cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses have garnered significant attention in recent years due to the accumulation of evidence suggesting the occurrence of virus transmission between these two kingdoms. Despite the large genetic and structural divergences between plants and fungi, various studies have demonstrated that viruses can be transmitted between these organisms through different mechanisms. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge related to cross-kingdom virus infection in plants and fungi, with a focus on the relevance of this new virological topic in understanding virus spread and transmission in nature and developing control strategies for crop plant diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Cross-kingdom transmission of plant viruses in fungi", "authors": "Liu, X., et al.
