{"Literature Review": "Viral evolution is a complex and dynamic process that has been shaped by the interactions between viral proteins and the host cell's proteostasis networks. The proteostasis network, a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes, plays a crucial role in regulating protein folding and quality control in cells. In the context of viral evolution, host proteostasis networks can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects, either by assisting with folding or by targeting them for degradation. This review aims to discuss and analyze new discoveries revealing that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins.Research has shown that most adaptive mutations in viruses are biophysically deleterious, resulting in a viral protein product with folding defects. This is because the folding of proteins is a complex process that requires precise interactions between amino acids, and mutations that disrupt these interactions can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. In cells, protein folding is assisted by a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), molecular chaperones, and proteasomes. These proteins work together to ensure that proteins are folded correctly and that misfolded proteins are degraded.The proteostasis network can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects in several ways. For example, some host chaperones can assist with the folding of viral proteins, while others can target them for degradation. This can lead to the selection of viral proteins that are more resistant to protein misfolding and aggregation, and that can better interact with host cells. In addition, the proteostasis network can also influence the evolution of viral proteins by regulating the expression of genes involved in protein folding and quality control.Recent studies have revealed that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. For example, a study on the influenza virus found that the host proteostasis network can influence the evolution of viral proteins by regulating the expression of genes involved in protein folding and quality control. Another study found that the host chaperone HSP70 can assist with the folding of viral proteins and promote the selection of viral proteins that are more resistant to protein misfolding and aggregation.The proteostasis perspective on viral evolution also offers many opportunities for research progress. For example, understanding how host proteostasis networks regulate the evolution of viral proteins can provide insights into the development of effective antiviral strategies. By targeting the host proteostasis network, researchers may be able to inhibit the evolution of viral proteins that are resistant to protein misfolding and aggregation. Additionally, understanding how host proteostasis networks influence the evolution of viral proteins can also provide insights into the development of vaccines that can prevent viral infections.In conclusion, the proteostasis network plays a crucial role in regulating protein folding and quality control in cells, and can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects. Recent studies have revealed that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins, and offer many opportunities for research progress. By understanding how host proteostasis networks regulate the evolution of viral proteins, researchers may be able to develop effective antiviral strategies and prevent pandemics.", "References": [{"title": "Viral genome evolution", "authors": "Altuvia, S., & Margalit, B.", "journal": "Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews", "year": "2001", "volumes": "65", "first page": "394", "last page": "410", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Chaperone-mediated protein folding", "authors": "Fink, P.
