{"Literature Review": "Bacteriophages are complex entities that have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique interactions with mammalian cells. While traditionally viewed as specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts, phages have been found to interact with and gain access to the eukaryotic cell structure, challenging the classical definition of these viruses. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms by which phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, are internalized by the cell, and undergo intracellular processing and fate. We will also summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states. Phages have been found to interact with mammalian cells through various mechanisms, including direct binding to cell surface receptors. For example, the bacteriophage T4 has been shown to bind to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor on mammalian cells, facilitating its internalization. Once internalized, phages are trafficked through the endosomal pathway, where they can interact with various host proteins and influence cellular processes. The endosomal pathway is a critical step in the phage-mammalian interaction, as it allows phages to evade the host's immune response and establish a foothold within the cell. Intracellular processing and fate of phages are complex and multifaceted processes. Phages can be degraded by host proteases, such as cathepsin D, or can be released from the cell through exocytosis. In some cases, phages can also be incorporated into host organelles, such as lysosomes or peroxisomes, where they can interact with host proteins and influence cellular processes. The fate of phages within the cell is influenced by various factors, including the type of phage, the host cell type, and the presence of immune cells. Phage-mammalian interactions have been associated with various health and disease states, including inflammation and immune responses. For example, phages have been shown to modulate the host's immune response by interacting with immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. In some cases, phages can also contribute to the development of disease states, such as autoimmune disorders and cancer. The mechanisms by which phages influence health and disease states are complex and multifaceted, and require further investigation. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation for the human virome, which refers to the collection of viruses that inhabit the human body. Phages are a significant component of the human virome, and have been found to interact with various host cells and tissues. The study of phage-mammalian interactions has significant implications for our understanding of the human virome and the role of phages in human health and disease. In conclusion, phages are complex entities that interact with mammalian cells in complex and multifaceted ways. Understanding the mechanisms by which phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, are internalized by the cell, and undergo intracellular processing and fate is critical for understanding the role of phages in human health and disease. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which phages influence health and disease states, and to explore the therapeutic potential of phages in clinical settings.", "References": [{"title": "Direct binding of bacteriophage T4 to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor on mammalian cells", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.
