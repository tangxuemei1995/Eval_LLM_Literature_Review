{"Literature Review": "The genus Tobamovirus comprises some of the most economically damaging plant viruses, with the emergence of new strains such as the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) posing a significant threat to global agriculture. The complex interactions between tobamoviruses and plant immunity have been extensively studied, revealing a perpetual interplay between the two. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of the relationship between tobamoviruses and host immunity, with a focus on the emergence of ToBRFV and potential approaches for the development of new resistance strategies. The plant immune system is a multilayered defense system that involves the activation of defense hormones, RNA silencing, and immune receptors. Upon infection, plants respond by producing defense-related genes, such as PR-1, PR-5, and PR-10, which play crucial roles in the recognition and elimination of pathogens. The salicylic acid (SA) pathway is a key component of plant immunity, and its dysregulation has been linked to the susceptibility of plants to tobamoviruses. Tobamoviruses have evolved various strategies to evade or suppress the different immune pathways. For example, the movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has been shown to interfere with the SA pathway, thereby reducing the effectiveness of plant defense responses. Similarly, the ToBRFV has been found to suppress the expression of defense-related genes, such as PR-1 and PR-5, thereby reducing the plant's ability to mount an effective immune response. RNA silencing is another important component of plant immunity, and tobamoviruses have been found to manipulate this pathway to their advantage. For example, the TMV has been shown to induce the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target defense-related genes, thereby reducing the plant's ability to mount an effective immune response. Similarly, the ToBRFV has been found to induce the production of siRNAs that target the expression of defense-related genes, such as PR-1 and PR-5. Immune receptors, such as the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat) proteins, play a crucial role in the recognition of pathogens and the activation of plant defense responses. The TMV has been shown to interfere with the function of NLR proteins, thereby reducing the effectiveness of plant defense responses. Similarly, the ToBRFV has been found to suppress the expression of NLR proteins, thereby reducing the plant's ability to mount an effective immune response. In addition to these mechanisms, tobamoviruses have also evolved strategies to manipulate the plant's hormone signaling pathways. For example, the TMV has been shown to induce the production of ethylene, a hormone that plays a crucial role in plant defense responses. Similarly, the ToBRFV has been found to induce the production of ethylene, which has been linked to the suppression of plant defense responses. The emergence of new tobamoviruses, such as the ToBRFV, poses a significant threat to global agriculture. Understanding the interactions between tobamoviruses and the plant immune pathways is crucial for the development of effective control measures and genetic resistance to these viruses. One potential approach for the development of new resistance strategies is the use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology. RNAi technology involves the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence the expression of specific genes, including those involved in the replication and transmission of tobamoviruses. Another potential approach for the development of new resistance strategies is the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool that allows for the precise modification of specific genes, including those involved in the replication and transmission of tobamoviruses. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been shown to be effective in reducing the expression of tobamovirus genes, thereby reducing the severity of disease symptoms. In conclusion, the interactions between tobamoviruses and plant immunity are complex and multifaceted. Understanding these interactions is crucial for the development of effective control measures and genetic resistance to these viruses. The use of RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies holds promise for the development of new resistance strategies to cope with emerging tobamoviruses.", "References": [{"title": "Virial replication figures in the salicylic acid pathway", "authors": "D.
