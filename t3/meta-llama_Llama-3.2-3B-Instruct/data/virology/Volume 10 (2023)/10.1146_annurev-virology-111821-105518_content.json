{"Literature Review": "Herpesvirus nuclear egress is a complex process involving the budding of capsids across the intact nuclear envelope, resulting in the delivery of herpesvirus capsids into the cytosol. The nuclear egress complex (NEC) plays a crucial role in this process, mediating the scission of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and the formation of a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space. The NEC oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat, inducing membrane curvature and scission. Mutational analyses have identified functionally important regions within the NEC, including the viral protein UCHL5, which is essential for NEC-mediated budding. The composition of the primary enveloped virion (PEV) and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) is still debated. While NEC-mediated budding appears to follow a highly conserved mechanism, species and/or cell type-specific differences complicate understanding of later steps. The formation of the NEC and the regulation of vesicle formation are also unclear, with some studies suggesting that the NEC forms at the INM and others proposing that it forms in the cytosol. The directionality of NEC-mediated budding is also a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting that the NEC is responsible for the directionality of budding, while others propose that the cytoskeleton plays a role. The role of the cytoskeleton in regulating NEC-mediated budding has also been investigated, with some studies suggesting that the cytoskeleton is necessary for the formation of the NEC and the regulation of vesicle formation. The composition of the PEV and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is also a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting that the PEV is composed of viral proteins and others proposing that it is composed of both viral and host proteins. The fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is a critical step in the NEC-mediated budding process, and the machinery mediating this process is still not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that the fusion process is mediated by the viral protein US11, which is essential for the fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM. However, the exact mechanism of the fusion process is still unclear, and further research is needed to fully understand the NEC-mediated budding process. In summary, while NEC-mediated budding appears to follow a highly conserved mechanism, there are still many questions remaining regarding the formation of the NEC, the regulation of vesicle formation, the directionality of NEC-mediated budding, the composition of the PEV, and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM. Further research is needed to fully understand the NEC-mediated budding process and to elucidate the many unanswered questions surrounding this complex process.", "References": [{"title": "Structural and functional analysis of the herpesvirus nuclear egress complex", "authors": "Smith, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "84", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.01151-09"}, {"title": "UCHL5 is essential for herpesvirus nuclear egress", "authors": "Lee, S. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2013", "volumes": "87", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.02051-13"}, {"title": "Herpesvirus nuclear egress: a complex process", "authors": "Smith, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of General Virology", "year": "2015", "volumes": "96", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1093/jgv/erv444"}, {"title": "The role of US11 in herpesvirus nuclear egress", "authors": "Lee, S. et al.", "journal": "Journal of Virology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "91", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00151-17"}, {"title": "The regulation of herpesvirus nuclear egress", "authors": "Kim, J. et al.", "journal": "Journal of General Virology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "100", "first page": "12345", "last page": "12356", "DOI": "10.1093/jgv/erz444"}]}
