{"Literature Review": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order Mononegavirales, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. These viruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases in humans and animals, including influenza, rabies, and Ebola. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. The polymerase undergoes a series of coordinated conformational transitions to perform these processes. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. The polymerase is composed of two subunits, the large subunit (L) and the small subunit (S), which are responsible for the catalytic and accessory functions, respectively. The L subunit contains the active site, where the viral RNA is transcribed and replicated. The S subunit, on the other hand, is involved in the binding of the viral RNA and the regulation of the polymerase activity. The polymerase undergoes a series of conformational changes, including the 'closed' conformation, where the active site is closed, and the 'open' conformation, where the active site is open. The closed conformation is characterized by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, while the open conformation is characterized by the release of the viral RNA from the S subunit. The transition between these two conformations is thought to be driven by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, which induces a conformational change in the L subunit. This conformational change allows the active site to open, enabling the transcription and replication of the viral genome. The polymerase also undergoes a series of other conformational changes, including the 'pre-initiation' conformation, where the polymerase is in an inactive state, and the 'initiation' conformation, where the polymerase is in an active state. The pre-initiation conformation is characterized by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, while the initiation conformation is characterized by the release of the viral RNA from the S subunit. The transition between these two conformations is thought to be driven by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, which induces a conformational change in the L subunit. This conformational change allows the active site to open, enabling the transcription and replication of the viral genome. The polymerase also undergoes a series of other conformational changes, including the 'elongation' conformation, where the polymerase is in an active state, and the 'termination' conformation, where the polymerase is in an inactive state. The elongation conformation is characterized by the release of the viral RNA from the S subunit, while the termination conformation is characterized by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit. The transition between these two conformations is thought to be driven by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, which induces a conformational change in the L subunit. This conformational change allows the active site to close, enabling the termination of the transcription and replication of the viral genome. The polymerase also undergoes a series of other conformational changes, including the 'proofreading' conformation, where the polymerase is in an active state, and the 'editing' conformation, where the polymerase is in an inactive state. The proofreading conformation is characterized by the release of the viral RNA from the S subunit, while the editing conformation is characterized by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit. The transition between these two conformations is thought to be driven by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, which induces a conformational change in the L subunit. This conformational change allows the active site to open, enabling the transcription and replication of the viral genome. In conclusion, the polymerase undergoes a series of coordinated conformational transitions to perform the different steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication. These transitions are driven by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, which induces a conformational change in the L subunit. The polymerase also undergoes a series of other conformational changes, including the 'pre-initiation', 'initiation', 'elongation', 'termination', 'proofreading', and 'editing' conformations. These conformations are characterized by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, the release of the viral RNA from the S subunit, and the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, respectively. The transition between these conformations is thought to be driven by the binding of the viral RNA to the S subunit, which induces a conformational change in the L subunit.
