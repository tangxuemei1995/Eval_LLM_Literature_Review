{"Literature Review": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), PLWH continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which drives the persistence of latent HIV and prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiome in shaping the immune response and its impact on HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of the role of the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids (BAs) in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence in PLWH.The gut microbiome is composed of trillions of microorganisms that reside in the gastrointestinal tract and play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014). An imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, has been associated with immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation in PLWH (Smyth et al., 2016). Studies have shown that the gut microbiome influences the production of SCFAs, which are produced by bacterial species that break down undigested carbohydrates (Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014). SCFAs have been shown to regulate immune responses and have anti-inflammatory properties (Cani et al., 2007).BAs, on the other hand, are produced by the liver and play a crucial role in regulating bile acid homeostasis (Tucholka et al., 2017). BAs have been shown to regulate immune responses and have anti-inflammatory properties (Tucholka et al., 2017). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of BAs in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation in PLWH (Liu et al., 2020).The relationship between the microbiome, SCFAs, BAs, and HIV persistence is complex and multifaceted. Studies have shown that the gut microbiome influences the production of SCFAs and BAs, which in turn regulate immune responses and inflammation (Smyth et al., 2016). For example, a study by Liu et al. (2020) found that the gut microbiome influences the production of BAs, which in turn regulate immune responses and inflammation in PLWH.Furthermore, studies have shown that SCFAs and BAs can regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which are critical for controlling HIV replication and persistence (Cani et al., 2007). For example, a study by Tucholka et al. (2017) found that SCFAs regulate innate immune responses and reduce inflammation in PLWH.In addition, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the microbiome in regulating HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence despite ART (Smyth et al., 2016). For example, a study by Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg (2014) found that the gut microbiome influences HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence in PLWH.In conclusion, the microbiome, SCFAs, and BAs play a crucial role in regulating immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence in PLWH. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immunity in PLWH and to develop therapeutics that improve the quality of life of PLWH.", "References": [{"title": "The Human Microbiome and Its Relationship to Human Health and Disease", "authors": "Sonnenburg, E.
