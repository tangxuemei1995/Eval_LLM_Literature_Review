{"Literature Review": "The viral accessory protein Vpu is a small but highly versatile protein that plays a crucial role in the immune evasion and spread of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs and SIVs, respectively). Despite its small size, Vpu has been shown to counteract the restriction factor tetherin, mediate degradation of primary viral CD4 receptors, and inhibit activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). These functions are essential for the survival and proliferation of HIV-1 and SIVs in their respective hosts. In addition to its well-established roles, recent studies have identified additional activities of Vpu, including its ability to enhance and prolong the release of fully infectious viral particles, prevent superinfection, and modulate DNA repair mechanisms to promote degradation of nuclear viral complementary DNA in cells that are already productively infected. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the diverse functions of Vpu and its relevance to HIV and SIV pathogenesis.", "References": [{"title": "Vpu and Vif: The HIV-1 accessory proteins that counteract host restriction factors", "authors": "Zhuang, Y., et al.
