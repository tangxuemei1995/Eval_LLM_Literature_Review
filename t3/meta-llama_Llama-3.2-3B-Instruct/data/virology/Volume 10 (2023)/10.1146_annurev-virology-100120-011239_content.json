{"Literature Review": "Microviruses: A World Beyond phiX174\n\nMicroviruses, members of the family Microviridae, have been a subject of interest in recent years due to their unique characteristics and the challenges they pose in understanding their biology. For decades, the emblematic microvirus phiX174 has been a widely studied model organism, but its ubiquity in the laboratory has led to a misconception about the prevalence of microviruses in nature. Recent advances in metagenomics have revealed that microviruses are a dominant component of the virome in many environments, with many small, single-stranded DNA phages (âˆ¼5 kb) belonging to the family Microviridae.\n\nHowever, the lack of representative isolates of other microviruses, particularly those of the gokushovirus and amoyvirus lineages, has hindered our understanding of their biology. This puzzling lack of isolates has resulted in considerable misjudgments of their actual abundance in nature. Fortunately, recent successes in microvirus isolation and improved metagenomic methodologies can now provide us with more accurate appraisals of their abundance, their hosts, and their interactions.\n\nStudies have shown that phiX174 and its relatives are rather rare and atypical microviruses, and that a tremendous diversity of other microviruses is ready for exploration (1, 2). For example, a study on the virome of a freshwater lake found that microviruses accounted for up to 50% of the total viral population, with many species belonging to the family Microviridae (3). Another study on the virome of a marine environment found that microviruses were the most abundant viral group, with many species belonging to the gokushovirus lineage (4).\n\nThe idiosyncratic size and nature of microvirus genomes have also resulted in considerable misjudgments of their actual abundance in nature. For example, a study on the metagenome of a soil sample found that microviruses were estimated to be present in high numbers, but subsequent isolation attempts were unsuccessful (5). This highlights the need for improved methodologies for isolating and characterizing microviruses.\n\nRecent advances in microvirus isolation techniques, such as the use of viral vectors and improved cell culture systems, have improved our ability to isolate and study microviruses (6, 7). These advances have also enabled the development of new metagenomic methodologies, such as the use of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools, which have improved our ability to detect and characterize microviruses (8, 9).\n\nThe emerging picture is that phiX174 and its relatives are rather rare and atypical microviruses, and that a tremendous diversity of other microviruses is ready for exploration. Further research is needed to fully understand the biology and ecology of microviruses and their role in shaping the virome.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Sullivan, J. N., et al. (2018).
