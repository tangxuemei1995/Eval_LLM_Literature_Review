{"Literature Review": "Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1PRF) is a crucial mechanism exploited by hundreds of RNA viruses to control the stoichiometry of viral proteins during genome translation. This process involves the induction of the elongating ribosome to slip backward by one nucleotide at a defined position and continue translation in the new reading frame. Recent advances in structural biology and single-molecule approaches have revealed the intricate mechanisms underlying −1PRF, shedding light on the molecular players involved in this process.\n\nThe ribosome is a complex molecular machine responsible for translating messenger RNA into proteins. Accurate translation is essential for life, and spontaneous errors by the translational machinery are highly infrequent (∼1/100,000 codons) (1). −1PRF is a unique mechanism that allows the ribosome to shift its reading frame, enabling the translation of different genes from the same mRNA (2). This process is essential for the regulation of viral protein expression and has been exploited by numerous RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV (3, 4).\n\nX-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have been instrumental in elucidating the structural diversity and mechanistic complexity of −1PRF (5, 6). These studies have revealed the presence of pseudoknot structures, which play a crucial role in the regulation of −1PRF (7). The pseudoknot structure is a complex arrangement of nucleotides that can form a secondary structure, influencing the ribosome's ability to shift its reading frame.\n\nRecent studies have also highlighted the importance of molecular players in the regulation of −1PRF. The ribosomal protein L22 has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of −1PRF, acting as a molecular switch to control the ribosome's ability to shift its reading frame (8). Additionally, the presence of specific nucleotides in the mRNA has been shown to influence the efficiency of −1PRF (9).\n\nIn conclusion, recent advances in structural biology and single-molecule approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of −1PRF. The intricate mechanisms underlying this process have been elucidated, highlighting the importance of molecular players and pseudoknot structures in its regulation. A general model for −1PRF remains a useful way of thinking, but it is essential to consider the complexity and diversity of this process in different RNA viruses.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Kozak, M.
