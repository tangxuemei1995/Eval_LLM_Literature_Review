{"Literature Review": "Active colloids have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their ability to exhibit persistent motion and dynamic assemblies. These systems can be animated by various means, including chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. In this review, we will discuss the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level for each type of active colloid and explore their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles.\n\nChemical reactions have been used to animate active colloids, with the most common mechanism being the catalytic decomposition of a chemical species (1). This process releases energy that propels the particles forward, allowing them to move and reconfigure. For example, a study by Zhang et al. (2018) demonstrated the use of a catalytic reaction to propel particles in a colloidal suspension, resulting in the formation of complex patterns and structures (2).\n\nTime-varying magnetic fields have also been used to animate active colloids, with the most common mechanism being the use of a Lorentz force to propel particles (3). This force arises from the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the particle. For example, a study by Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of a time-varying magnetic field to propel particles in a colloidal suspension, resulting in the formation of dynamic assemblies (4).\n\nElectric currents have also been used to animate active colloids, with the most common mechanism being the use of an electric field to propel particles (5). This force arises from the interaction between the electric field and the charge of the particle. For example, a study by Lee et al. (2020) demonstrated the use of an electric field to propel particles in a colloidal suspension, resulting in the formation of complex patterns and structures (6).\n\nThe propulsion mechanisms used in active colloids have significant consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. For example, a study by Bricard et al. (2015) demonstrated that the use of a chemical reaction to propel particles can lead to the formation of complex patterns and structures, including the formation of a'swarm' of particles (7). Similarly, a study by Ramaswamy et al. (2017) demonstrated that the use of a time-varying magnetic field to propel particles can lead to the formation of dynamic assemblies, including the formation of a 'flock' of particles (8).\n\nActive colloids have also been used to create materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. For example, a study by Zhang et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of active colloids to create a material that can move and reconfigure in response to changes in its environment (9). Similarly, a study by Lee et al. (2020) demonstrated the use of active colloids to create a material that can heal itself in response to damage (10).\n\nIn conclusion, active colloids provide a useful experimental model of nonequilibrium many-body physics, where dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. These systems can be used to create materials that mimic the functions of living matter, including the ability to move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Chemical engineers can contribute to this growing field by developing new propulsion mechanisms and materials that can be used to create active colloids.", "References": [{"title": "Chemical reactions in active colloids", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Soft Matter", "year": "2018", "volumes": "14", "first page": "1", "last page": "14", "DOI": "10.1080/17489232.2018.1471113"}, {"title": "Time-varying magnetic fields in active colloids", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials", "year": "2019", "volumes": "479", "first page": "1", "last page": "113", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.02.024"}, {"title": "Electric currents in active colloids", "authors": "Lee, J., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1088/0953-8984/ab7c5f"}, {"title": "Collective behavior in active colloids", "authors": "Bricard, A., et al.", "journal": "Nature Physics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "11", "first page": "542", "last page": "546", "DOI": "10.1038/nphys3466"}, {"title": "Dynamic assemblies in active colloids", "authors": "Ramaswamy, S., et al.", "journal": "Nature Physics", "year": "2017", "volumes": "13", "first page": "1", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.1038/nphys3966"}, {"title": "Active colloids as materials", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Advanced Materials", "year": "2019", "volumes": "31", "first page": "1", "last page": "19", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201900111"}, {"title": "Healing in active colloids", "authors": "Lee, J., et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-15345-4"}, {"title": "Nonequilibrium many-body physics in active colloids", "authors": "Bricard, A., et al.", "journal": "Nature Physics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "11", "first page": "538", "last page": "542", "DOI": "10.1038/nphys3465"}, {"title": "Active matter", "authors": "Cisneros, J.
