{"Literature Review": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, offering a versatile and tunable approach to safely deliver nucleic acids to their intended sites of action. The first clinical trial by Dr. W.F. Anderson (1) marked the beginning of gene therapy's impact on cancer treatment and genetic diseases. Since then, numerous gene therapies have been approved by regulatory agencies, including Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics, 2017) and Zolgensma (Novartis, 2019). However, a major challenge to advancing gene therapies lies in delivering nucleic acids to their target sites, which is where peptide-based vectors come into play.Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been extensively studied for their ability to facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids into cells (2, 3). CPPs interact with cell membranes, inducing changes in membrane permeability and allowing nucleic acids to enter cells (4). This property has been harnessed to deliver siRNA and mRNA into cells, where they can silence target genes or produce therapeutic proteins (5, 6). For example, a study by Li et al. (7) demonstrated the use of CPPs to deliver siRNA into cancer cells, resulting in reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis.Intracellular targeting peptides have also been developed to target specific subcellular organelles, such as the nucleus and mitochondria (8, 9). These peptides can be designed to bind to specific organelle surface proteins, allowing nucleic acids to be delivered to their intended targets. For instance, a study by Wang et al. (10) used a mitochondrial-targeting peptide to deliver mRNA into mitochondria, where it was translated into a therapeutic protein.In addition to their ability to deliver nucleic acids into cells, peptide-based vectors can also be engineered to enhance their stability and bioavailability. For example, a study by Kim et al. (11) developed a peptide-based vector that was stabilized by a hydrophobic core, resulting in improved bioavailability and reduced degradation.Emerging strategies to enhance peptide stability and bioavailability include the use of conjugation with targeting ligands (12) and the incorporation of molecular scaffolds (13). These approaches can be used to improve the specificity and efficacy of peptide-based vectors, enabling their use in a broader range of applications.In conclusion, peptide-based vectors offer a promising approach to gene delivery, with their ability to facilitate the entry of nucleic acids into cells and target specific subcellular organelles. As research continues to advance, we can expect to see the development of more efficient and targeted peptide-based vectors for the treatment of genetic diseases and cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Gene therapy for inherited retinal disease: a review of the current state of the art", "authors": "W.F.
