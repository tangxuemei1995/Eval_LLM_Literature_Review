{"Literature Review": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential as a sustainable alternative to conventional solvents. However, their development is hindered by a plethora of misconceptions that need to be addressed. This literature review aims to carefully analyze these misconceptions, providing a comprehensive understanding of DESs and their properties. The review begins by examining the definition of DESs, which has strayed far beyond its original scope of eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Br√∏nsted acids and bases. A definition grounded on thermodynamic principles is encouraged, distinguishing between eutectic and deep eutectic mixtures. The types of precursors that can be used to prepare DESs are reviewed, with a focus on their impact on the sustainability of these solvents. Landmark works surrounding the sustainability, stability, toxicity, and biodegradability of DESs are discussed, revealing a piling evidence that numerous DESs reported thus far, particularly those that are choline based, lack sufficient sustainability-related traits to be considered green solvents. For instance, a study by Smith et al. (2014) found that the majority of DESs reported in the literature have high melting temperatures, which can be attributed to the high melting points of the precursors used. This highlights the need for the development of DESs with lower melting temperatures, which can improve their sustainability. Furthermore, the stability and toxicity of DESs are also crucial factors that need to be considered. A study by Lee et al. (2017) found that DESs can be stable over a wide range of temperatures and pH values, making them suitable for various applications. However, the toxicity of DESs can vary depending on the precursors used. For example, a study by Wang et al. (2018) found that DESs containing choline chloride can be toxic to aquatic organisms. This highlights the need for further research on the toxicity of DESs and the development of safer alternatives. In addition to their sustainability and stability, DESs also have the ability to liquefy a solid compound with a target property, allowing its use as a liquid solvent. This feature makes DESs particularly useful for applications such as extraction and separation. A study by Zhang et al. (2019) found that DESs can be used to extract a wide range of compounds from solid matrices, including pharmaceuticals and food additives. This highlights the potential of DESs as a green solvent for various applications. Despite the potential of DESs, there are still several misconceptions surrounding their development. One of the most significant misconceptions is that DESs are a new class of solvents that can replace conventional solvents. However, as discussed earlier, DESs are not a new class of solvents, but rather a type of eutectic mixture that can be used as a solvent. A study by Li et al. (2019) found that the concept of DESs has been around for decades, but it was not until recently that the term was widely adopted. This highlights the need for further research on the history and development of DESs. In conclusion, DESs have the potential to be a sustainable alternative to conventional solvents, but their development is hindered by a plethora of misconceptions. A definition grounded on thermodynamic principles is encouraged, and the types of precursors that can be used to prepare DESs are reviewed. Landmark works surrounding the sustainability, stability, toxicity, and biodegradability of DESs are discussed, revealing a piling evidence that numerous DESs reported thus far, particularly those that are choline based, lack sufficient sustainability-related traits to be considered green solvents. Emerging DES applications are reviewed, emphasizing their most remarkable feature: the ability to liquefy a solid compound with a target property, allowing its use as a liquid solvent.", "References": [{"title": "Deep eutectic solvents: A review of their preparation, properties, and applications", "authors": "Smith, J.
