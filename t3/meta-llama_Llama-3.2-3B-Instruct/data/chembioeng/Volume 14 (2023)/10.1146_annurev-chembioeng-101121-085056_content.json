{"Literature Review": "Drying drops of colloidal dispersions have been a subject of interest for researchers since the nineteenth century. The complexity of the problem arises from the multiscale nature of the phenomenon, involving physics at different scales, such as colloidal and interfacial phenomena, as well as heat, mass, and momentum transport processes. The seemingly simple yet nontrivial shape of the drops makes drying drop problems rich and interesting. As the physical and chemical nature of dispersed entities in the drop varies, the scope of such studies widens. This review aims to summarize past and contemporary developments in the field, emphasizing the physicochemical and hydrodynamical principles that govern the processes occurring within a drying drop and the resulting variety of patterns generated on the substrate.", "References": [{"title": "Evaporation of a Sessile Drop", "authors": "Young, T.; Wark, J.
