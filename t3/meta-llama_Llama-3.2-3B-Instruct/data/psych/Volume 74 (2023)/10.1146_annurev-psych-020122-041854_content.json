{"Literature Review": "Psychological resilience is a multifaceted construct that has garnered significant attention in recent years. Despite its importance, the field of psychology remains incomplete in its understanding of resilience due to two primary limitations: conceptual clarity and the lack of integration between two major approaches to resilience. This literature review aims to address these gaps by providing an overview of the current state of knowledge on resilience, highlighting the strengths and limitations of existing approaches, and introducing an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on the complementary strengths of both the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach.\n\nResilience is often defined as the ability to withstand and recover from adversity (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). However, this definition does not capture the full range of possible outcomes following adversity, as some individuals may experience minimal disruptions or even improvements (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). The latter outcomes are often referred to as psychological resilience, and understanding what processes explain resilience has critical theoretical and practical implications.\n\nOne of the primary limitations of the current understanding of resilience is the lack of conceptual clarity. Resilience is often used interchangeably with other constructs, such as coping and stress management (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). However, these constructs are distinct and have different underlying mechanisms (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). The stress and coping approach, for example, focuses on the individual's ability to manage stress and cope with adversity, while the emotion and emotion-regulation approach emphasizes the role of emotions in shaping resilience (Gross & Thompson, 2007).\n\nThe stress and coping approach has been widely used in the field of psychology to study resilience. This approach posits that individuals who are resilient are able to manage stress and cope with adversity through various strategies, such as problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). However, this approach has limitations, as it does not account for the role of emotions in shaping resilience (Gross & Thompson, 2007).\n\nThe emotion and emotion-regulation approach, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of emotions in shaping resilience. This approach posits that individuals who are resilient are able to regulate their emotions effectively, which enables them to better cope with adversity (Gross & Thompson, 2007). However, this approach has limitations, as it does not account for the role of stress and coping in shaping resilience (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004).\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose an integrative affect-regulation framework that capitalizes on the complementary strengths of both approaches. This framework posits that resilience is the result of the interplay between stress, coping, emotions, and emotion regulation. According to this framework, individuals who are resilient are able to manage stress and cope with adversity through various strategies, while also regulating their emotions effectively to minimize the negative impact of adversity (Gross & Thompson, 2007; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004).\n\nThe proposed framework is supported by existing findings in the field of psychology. For example, research has shown that individuals who are resilient are able to regulate their emotions effectively, which enables them to better cope with adversity (Gross & Thompson, 2007). Additionally, research has shown that stress management and coping strategies are effective in reducing the negative impact of adversity (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).\n\nHowever, there are also gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. For example, the proposed framework does not account for the role of individual differences in shaping resilience. Research has shown that individual differences, such as personality traits and coping styles, play a significant role in shaping resilience (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004).\n\nFurthermore, the proposed framework does not account for the role of contextual factors in shaping resilience. Research has shown that contextual factors, such as social support and community resources, play a significant role in shaping resilience (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed integrative affect-regulation framework offers a comprehensive understanding of resilience that capitalizes on the complementary strengths of both the stress and coping approach and the emotion and emotion-regulation approach. This framework highlights the interplay between stress, coping, emotions, and emotion regulation in shaping resilience and provides a foundation for future research.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Gross, J.
