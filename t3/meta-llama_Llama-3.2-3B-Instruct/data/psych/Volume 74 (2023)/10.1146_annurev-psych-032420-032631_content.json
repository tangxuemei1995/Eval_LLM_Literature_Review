{"Literature Review": "The relationship between culture and personality has been a long-standing topic in psychology, with various theories and frameworks attempting to explain the intricate interplay between these two constructs. This literature review aims to integrate the existing knowledge on culture and personality with recent advances in socioecology and genetics to formulate the Socioecological-Genetic Framework of Culture and Personality. Our framework posits that culture and personality are mutually constituted, with socioecological factors influencing cultural development and genetic predispositions shaping individual personality traits. This review will examine the roots of culture and personality, the impact of socioecological changes on cultural and personality trends, and the nature-nurture interactions between genes and culture/socioecology on personality development.", "References": [{"title": "The Cultural Construction of Personality", "authors": "Markus, H.
