{"Literature Review": "The underrepresentation of women in STEM fields has been a persistent issue, despite efforts to increase women's interest and involvement in science, technology, engineering, and math. Research has shown that women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM are not solely due to person-level factors, but also to systemic barriers created by gender stereotypes. These stereotypes erode women's ability to experience self-concept fit, goal fit, and/or social fit, leading to a lack of attraction to, integration in, and advancement in STEM. This literature review aims to examine the psychological literature relevant to understanding and mitigating women's lower fit and inclusion in STEM, with a focus on the role of gender stereotypes in constraining women's interest in male-dominated STEM careers. The findings of this review highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to changing organizational and educational cultures at the institutional, interpersonal, and individual level to dismantle these systemic barriers and promote greater diversity and inclusion in STEM.", "References": [{"title": "The Impact of Gender Stereotypes on Women's Career Choices", "authors": "Ladson-Billings, G., & Tate, W.
