{"Literature Review": "Pride is a complex and multifaceted emotion that plays a crucial role in human social behavior. As a self-conscious emotion, it is comprised of two distinct facets: authentic and hubristic pride. Authentic pride is characterized by feelings of accomplishment and confidence, promoting prosocial behaviors such as cooperation and altruism. On the other hand, hubristic pride is marked by feelings of arrogance and conceit, leading to antisocial behaviors like aggression and competition. These two facets of pride are not only distinct but also contribute to different means of attaining social rank. Research has shown that authentic pride is associated with prestige, a social rank based on earned respect. Prestige is a valuable asset in human societies, as it confers respect, admiration, and social status. Individuals who possess prestige are more likely to be perceived as trustworthy, competent, and likable, which can lead to improved social relationships and cooperation. In contrast, hubristic pride is linked to dominance, a social rank based on aggression and coercion. Dominance is a powerful means of achieving power and influence in human groups, as it allows individuals to exert control over others and shape social outcomes. The relationship between pride and social rank is not limited to individual-level outcomes. Research has also shown that pride can influence group-level dynamics, with authentic pride promoting cooperation and hubristic pride fostering competition. For instance, a study on team sports found that players who experienced authentic pride after winning a game were more likely to cooperate with their teammates and work together to achieve a common goal. In contrast, players who experienced hubristic pride after winning were more likely to engage in aggressive behavior and dominate their opponents. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that pride can be a universal human emotion, critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies. Studies have found that pride is a common emotion across cultures, with similar expressions and experiences reported in diverse societies. This universality of pride suggests that it may be an evolutionary adaptation that has been shaped by natural selection to promote cooperation, social bonding, and group cohesion. In conclusion, the reviewed research suggests that pride is a complex and multifaceted emotion that plays a crucial role in human social behavior. Authentic pride promotes prestige, a social rank based on earned respect, while hubristic pride fosters dominance, a social rank based on aggression and coercion. Both facets of pride are likely to be functional adaptations that have been shaped by natural selection to promote cooperation, social bonding, and group cohesion. As a universal human emotion, pride is critical for social relationships and rank attainment across human societies.", "References": [{"title": "Self-esteem, self-concept, and self-esteem regulation", "authors": ["Baumeister, R.
