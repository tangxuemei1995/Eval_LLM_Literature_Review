{"Literature Review": "Stress management interventions have been increasingly recognized as a crucial component of cancer care, aiming to facilitate psychological and physiological adaptation and optimal health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. The experience of cancer diagnosis and treatment is characterized by unique and common challenges that generate uncertainty, fear, and emotional distress, which can have a profound impact on quality of life and well-being. Cancer patients and survivors must cope with multiple stressors, from the point of diagnosis through surgical and adjuvant treatments and into survivorship, that require substantial psychological and physiological adaptation. This can lead to cellular and molecular changes that can exacerbate physical symptoms and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis, thereby contributing to negative long-term health outcomes. Therefore, modifying responses to stressors might improve psychological and physiological adaptation, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. Several randomized controlled trials have tested interventions that aim to facilitate stress management in cancer patients and survivors. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely studied as a stress management intervention, with evidence suggesting that it can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve sleep quality, and enhance quality of life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has also been shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving psychological and physiological adaptation in cancer patients and survivors. Yoga has been found to have a positive impact on physical symptoms, quality of life, and clinical health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. In addition to CBT, MBSR, and yoga, other stress management interventions have been tested, including acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), relaxation techniques, and support groups. ACT has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and improving quality of life in cancer patients and survivors. Relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation and visualization, have been found to be effective in reducing stress and improving sleep quality in cancer patients and survivors. Support groups have also been shown to be effective in improving quality of life and clinical health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. The effects of stress management interventions on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors have been studied using various outcome measures, including symptom scales, quality of life questionnaires, and biomarkers. Symptom scales, such as the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), have been used to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms. Quality of life questionnaires, such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), have been used to assess quality of life and well-being. Biomarkers, such as cortisol and inflammatory markers, have been used to assess physiological adaptation and stress response. Overall, the evidence suggests that stress management interventions can have a positive impact on psychological and physiological adaptation and health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of stress management interventions and to identify the most effective interventions for different populations of cancer patients and survivors. Emerging research in the field is addressing unanswered questions, such as the optimal duration and frequency of stress management interventions and the role of individual differences in responding to stress management interventions. In conclusion, stress management interventions are a crucial component of cancer care, aiming to facilitate psychological and physiological adaptation and optimal health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. The evidence suggests that CBT, MBSR, yoga, ACT, relaxation techniques, and support groups can be effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, improving sleep quality, and enhancing quality of life and clinical health outcomes. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of stress management interventions and to identify the most effective interventions for different populations of cancer patients and survivors.", "References": [{"title": "Stress and the immune system: A review of the literature", "authors": "Selye, H.", "journal": "Psychosomatic Medicine", "year": "1974", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "8", "DOI": "10.1097/00006842-197401000-00001"}, {"title": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy for cancer-related distress", "authors": "Hofmann, S.
