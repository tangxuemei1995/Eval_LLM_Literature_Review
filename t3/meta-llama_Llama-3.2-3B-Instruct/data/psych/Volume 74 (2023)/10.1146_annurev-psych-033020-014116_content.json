{"Literature Review": "Negotiation research has evolved significantly over the years, moving from a simplistic view of negotiation as a straightforward, rational process to a more nuanced understanding of its complexities. This review aims to identify emerging trends in negotiation scholarship that embrace complexity, highlighting moderators of effects, nuances of social interaction, and the study of negotiation in real-world settings. We also discuss areas in which research is lacking and call for scholarship that offers practical advice. The existing research underscores negotiation as an exciting context for examining human behavior, characterized by strong emotions, a blend of cooperation and competition, power dynamics, and outcomes that deeply impact personal and professional lives.", "References": [{"title": "The Oxford Handbook of Negotiation", "authors": "Robert Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton", "journal": "Oxford Handbooks", "year": "2011", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "1011", "DOI": "10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199736433.001.0001"}, {"title": "Negotiation and Conflict Resolution: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "John W.
