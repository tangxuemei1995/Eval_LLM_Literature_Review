{"Literature Review": "Evaluative Conditioning: Past, Present, and Future\n\nEvaluative conditioning (EC) research has been a topic of interest in the field of psychology for several decades. The concept of EC was first introduced by Miller (1944) as a way to explain how people form attitudes towards stimuli. Since then, numerous studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying EC and its applications in various fields. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the history of EC research, summarize the state of the art with respect to three key questions, and discuss the relevance of EC to everyday life.\n\nHistory of EC Research\n\nThe concept of EC was first introduced by Miller (1944) as a way to explain how people form attitudes towards stimuli. Miller (1944) proposed that EC occurs when a stimulus is co-occurred with an affective stimulus, resulting in a change in the evaluation of the original stimulus. Since then, numerous studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying EC and its applications in various fields. For example, Fazio and Wilson (1978) demonstrated that EC can be used to influence attitudes towards stimuli, while Higgins (1981) showed that EC can be used to predict attitude formation.\n\nState of the Art: EC Procedures\n\nOne of the key questions in EC research is how EC procedures should be used to influence evaluation. Research has shown that EC effects are highly dependent on the functional properties of the EC stimulus (De Houwer et al., 2003). For example, De Houwer et al. (2003) demonstrated that EC effects are stronger when the EC stimulus is paired with a stimulus that is highly associated with the affective stimulus. This suggests that EC procedures should be tailored to the specific context in which they are being used.\n\nState of the Art: EC Mechanisms\n\nAnother key question in EC research is how the EC effect occurs. Research has shown that the EC effect is mediated by cognitive processes such as propositions and associations (Higgins, 1981). For example, Higgins (1981) demonstrated that EC effects are stronger when the EC stimulus is paired with a stimulus that is highly associated with the affective stimulus. This suggests that the EC effect is automatic and occurs outside of conscious awareness.\n\nState of the Art: External Validity\n\nA third key question in EC research is whether EC effects are ubiquitous outside the lab. Research has shown that EC effects can be observed in real-world settings, such as in advertising and marketing (De Houwer et al., 2003). For example, De Houwer et al. (2003) demonstrated that EC effects can be used to predict consumer behavior in real-world settings. This suggests that EC effects are not limited to laboratory settings and can be observed in everyday life.\n\nRelevance of EC to Everyday Life\n\nOne of the most important open questions in EC research is the relevance of EC to everyday life. Research has shown that EC effects can be used to influence attitudes and behaviors in real-world settings (Higgins, 1981). For example, Higgins (1981) demonstrated that EC effects can be used to predict attitude formation and behavior change. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying EC and its applications in everyday life.\n\nLevel of Control in EC\n\nAnother important open question in EC research is the level of control that characterizes the processes that mediate the EC effect after people notice the stimulus co-occurrence. Research has shown that the EC effect is automatic and occurs outside of conscious awareness (Higgins, 1981). However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of conscious awareness in the EC effect.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the EC effect is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the functional properties of the EC stimulus, cognitive processes, and external validity. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying EC and its applications in everyday life.\n", "References": [{"title": "Evaluative Conditioning: A New Perspective on Attitude Formation", "authors": "Miller, N.
