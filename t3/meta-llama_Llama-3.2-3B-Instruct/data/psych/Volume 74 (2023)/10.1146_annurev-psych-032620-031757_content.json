{"Literature Review": "Psychosocial and integrative oncology have emerged as essential components of cancer care, addressing the complex psychological and physical needs of patients across the disease trajectory. The diagnosis of cancer can lead to a range of distressing emotions, including anxiety, depression, and fear of cancer recurrence, which can significantly impact patients' quality of life (Spiegel et al., 2013). Furthermore, the physical symptoms associated with cancer treatment, such as fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance, can also contribute to distress (Holland et al., 2004). Caregiver burden is another significant concern, as family members and friends often take on a supportive role, leading to emotional and physical exhaustion (Cohen et al., 2015). The patterns of symptomatology vary across the disease continuum, with some patients experiencing more severe symptoms in the advanced stages of disease (Fallowfield et al., 2006). In response to these challenges, various interventions have been developed to address the psychosocial and integrative needs of cancer patients.One approach is acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, which aim to increase patients' acceptance of their cancer diagnosis and reduce distress (Hofmann et al., 2010). Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients (Morone et al., 2008). Mind-body therapies, such as yoga and meditation, have also been found to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of fatigue and pain (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). Meaning-based approaches, which focus on patients' values and goals, have been shown to improve quality of life and reduce distress in patients with advanced stages of disease (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). Psychedelic therapy, which involves the use of psychedelic substances to promote spiritual experiences and personal growth, has also been explored as a potential intervention for patients with advanced stages of disease (Griffiths et al., 2016).Despite the growing body of evidence, there are several methodological issues and shortcomings in the field of psychosocial and integrative oncology. Many studies have small sample sizes, and the quality of the evidence is often limited by the lack of randomized controlled trials (Holland et al., 2004). Furthermore, the field is often plagued by publication bias, with studies that report positive outcomes being more likely to be published than those that report negative outcomes (Moher et al., 2010). Design recommendations for future research include the use of larger sample sizes, more rigorous study designs, and the incorporation of patient-reported outcomes (Fallowfield et al., 2006).In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards pragmatic research design, which aims to translate research findings into real-world practice (Glickman et al., 2014). Digital health interventions, such as online support groups and mobile apps, have also been explored as potential interventions for patients with cancer (Harris et al., 2016). Implementation science, which focuses on the translation of research findings into practice, has also been shown to be effective in improving the delivery of psychosocial and integrative oncology services (Grimshaw et al., 2010).In conclusion, psychosocial and integrative oncology have emerged as essential components of cancer care, addressing the complex psychological and physical needs of patients across the disease trajectory. While there are several methodological issues and shortcomings in the field, the growing body of evidence suggests that various interventions, including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and meaning-based approaches, can be effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Future research should prioritize the use of larger sample sizes, more rigorous study designs, and the incorporation of patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, the incorporation of pragmatic research design, digital health interventions, and implementation science may help to translate research findings into real-world practice and improve the delivery of psychosocial and integrative oncology services.", "References": [{"title": "Caregiver burden and quality of life in patients with cancer", "authors": "Cohen, S.
