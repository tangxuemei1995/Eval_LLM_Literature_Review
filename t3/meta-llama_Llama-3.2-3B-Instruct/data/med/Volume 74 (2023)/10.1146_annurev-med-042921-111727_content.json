{"Literature Review": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) is a complex and heterogeneous condition that has garnered significant attention in recent years. The prevalence of MINOCA is estimated to be between 6-8% in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) who undergo coronary angiography (1). Notably, MINOCA disproportionately affects women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1 (2). The pathogenesis of MINOCA is more variable than in myocardial infarction with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD), with dominant mechanisms including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and coronary artery spasm (3, 4). Atherosclerosis is thought to contribute to the development of MINOCA through the formation of atherosclerotic plaques that can lead to coronary artery narrowing and subsequent ischemia (5). Thrombosis, on the other hand, is a more acute process that can occur in the setting of atherosclerosis or other underlying conditions (6). Coronary artery spasm is a less common but potentially life-threatening mechanism of MINOCA, which can be triggered by various factors including stress, cold temperatures, and certain medications (7). Takotsubo syndrome, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is another condition that has been linked to MINOCA, characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction in response to emotional or physical stress (8). The management of MINOCA varies based on the underlying mechanism of infarction, with a combination of invasive coronary angiography, multivessel intracoronary imaging, provocative testing for coronary spasm, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging providing the greatest diagnostic yield (9). However, current clinical practice guidelines for the secondary prevention of MI are largely based on data from patients with MI-CAD, leaving a knowledge gap regarding optimal medications for patients with MINOCA (10). Clinical trials focused on the treatment of patients with MINOCA are urgently needed to define optimal care and improve patient outcomes. In conclusion, MINOCA is a complex and heterogeneous condition that requires a systematic approach to diagnosis and management. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MINOCA and to develop evidence-based guidelines for its treatment and prevention.", "References": [{"title": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries: A Systematic Review", "authors": "Ko, J.
