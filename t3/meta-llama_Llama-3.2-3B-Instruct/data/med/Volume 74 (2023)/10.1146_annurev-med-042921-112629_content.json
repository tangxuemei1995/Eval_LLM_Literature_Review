{"Literature Review": "Polygenic scores have revolutionized the field of coronary artery disease (CAD) research by providing a quantifiable measure of inherited risk. The integration of information from multiple genetic variants into a single number has enabled the identification of individuals at increased risk of developing CAD, even before clinical symptoms appear. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of polygenic scores for CAD, their applications, and the ongoing research into their clinical utility.", "References": [{"title": "Polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Kang, S.
