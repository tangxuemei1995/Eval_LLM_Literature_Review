{"Literature Review": "SGLT2 inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of kidney diseases, offering a new paradigm for kidney protection beyond traditional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have been consistently demonstrated across various patient populations, including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and nondiabetic kidney disease (NDD). This review aims to summarize the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in diverse patient populations, highlighting the underlying mechanisms and potential benefits for kidney disease management.\n\nThe development of SGLT2 inhibitors as antidiabetic agents was initially driven by the observation that these compounds could reduce glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby lowering blood glucose levels (1). However, the cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials that followed demonstrated improved CV outcomes in patients with T2D, independent of blood glucose control (2, 3). These findings led to the exploration of SGLT2 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for kidney disease, with the first dedicated kidney outcome trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression in patients with T2D (4).\n\nSubsequent analyses of CV outcome trials and kidney outcome trials have consistently reported improved kidney-related outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors, independent of T2D status and across a range of kidney function and albuminuria (5, 6). The kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have been observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those with stage 3-4 CKD and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (7, 8). Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with T2D and nondiabetic kidney disease (9, 10).\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are multifaceted and may involve hemodynamic, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic pathways. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve kidney function by decreasing intraglomerular pressure and increasing sodium excretion (11, 12). Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys, which are key drivers of kidney disease progression (13, 14).\n\nIn conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors have emerged as a valuable therapeutic option for kidney disease management, offering a range of benefits for patients with T2D and nondiabetic kidney disease. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and to explore their potential as a monotherapy or combination therapy for kidney disease treatment.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
