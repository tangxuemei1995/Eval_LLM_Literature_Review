{"Literature Review": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of cognitive function and memory. The disease has been extensively studied, and several key proteins have been identified as playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Among these, tau protein and amyloid β are the most well-known, with tau being the predominant protein in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid β being the predominant protein in senile plaques. However, recent studies have suggested that smaller, oligomeric species of amyloid may also be bioactive, contributing to the disease's progression. This review aims to examine the possibility that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau—the 'tau we cannot see'—comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD. Research has shown that tau protein is highly phosphorylated in AD brains, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles are composed of tau protein that has been hyperphosphorylated, resulting in a highly stable and insoluble structure. However, recent studies have suggested that not all tau protein is aggregated into tangles, and that some forms of tau may remain soluble and bioactive. This has led to the proposal that soluble, nonfibrillar forms of tau may play a key role in the disease's progression. Studies have shown that soluble tau protein can induce neurotoxicity in vitro, leading to the activation of various signaling pathways that contribute to neuronal death. This has led to the proposal that soluble tau protein may be a key driver of neurodegeneration in AD. Furthermore, research has shown that soluble tau protein can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, suggesting that it may be a potential biomarker for the disease. However, the exact mechanisms by which soluble tau protein contributes to neurodegeneration in AD are not yet fully understood. Research has shown that soluble tau protein can interact with various receptors and proteins, leading to the activation of signaling pathways that contribute to neuronal death. However, the specific mechanisms by which soluble tau protein contributes to neurodegeneration in AD require further investigation. In addition to its role in neurodegeneration, soluble tau protein has also been implicated in the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity. Research has shown that soluble tau protein can modulate the activity of various neurotransmitters and receptors, leading to changes in synaptic function and plasticity. However, the specific mechanisms by which soluble tau protein regulates synaptic function and plasticity in AD require further investigation. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that soluble, nonfibrillar, bioactive forms of tau—the 'tau we cannot see'—comprise a dominant driver of neurodegeneration in AD. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which soluble tau protein contributes to neurodegeneration in AD, and to explore its potential as a biomarker for the disease.", "References": [{"title": "Affective pathology in Alzheimer's disease", "authors": "H.
