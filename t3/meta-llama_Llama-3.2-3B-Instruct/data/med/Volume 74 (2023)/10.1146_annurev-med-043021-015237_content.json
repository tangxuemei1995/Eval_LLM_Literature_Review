{"Literature Review": "SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious immunologic complication associated with the adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. The first reported cases of VITT occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States, with the majority of cases linked to the AstraZeneca-Oxford and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The estimated incidence of VITT is approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 recipients of these vaccines, although this number may be underreported due to the rarity of the condition. The pathophysiology of VITT is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve an immune-mediated response to the vaccine, leading to the formation of blood clots and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of VITT typically involves a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment of VITT typically involves anticoagulation therapy, with heparin being the preferred choice due to its effectiveness and safety profile. However, the use of heparin in VITT has been associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications, which can be severe. In some cases, thrombectomy may be necessary to remove the blood clot, although this is typically reserved for patients with severe symptoms or those who do not respond to anticoagulation therapy. The outcomes of VITT are generally poor, with a mortality rate of approximately 10%. Despite the rarity of VITT, it is essential to recognize the condition and provide prompt treatment to minimize morbidity and mortality. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge on VITT, including its incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment options.", "References": [{"title": "Vaccination-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination", "authors": "Boussiotis, V.
