{"Literature Review": "Transgender people often face significant barriers in accessing healthcare, which can lead to inadequate care and poor health outcomes. The lack of knowledgeable healthcare professionals and discrimination are major concerns, with many transgender individuals reporting feeling uncomfortable or unwelcome in healthcare settings. Furthermore, the existing research on transgender health has focused primarily on mental health, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and substance abuse, leaving a significant knowledge gap in other areas. However, gender-affirming hormone therapy and/or surgery can provide some alignment of biology and gender identity, and may offer quality-of-life benefits that outweigh modest concerns related to exogenous hormone therapy. The Endocrine Society treatment guidelines were revised in 2017, and recent data suggests that these guidelines may need to be revised again to reflect the latest research and best practices. This article reviews recent data on gender-affirming hormone treatment and/or surgery, and discusses the implications for future guideline revision. Research has shown that gender-affirming hormone therapy can have a positive impact on the mental health and well-being of transgender individuals. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that transgender women who received hormone therapy experienced significant improvements in depression and anxiety. Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Sex Research found that transgender men who received testosterone therapy experienced significant improvements in self-esteem and body satisfaction. However, there are also concerns about the potential risks associated with exogenous hormone therapy, including cardiovascular disease and blood clots. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that transgender women who received hormone therapy were at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly if they had a history of cardiovascular disease. In addition to hormone therapy, surgery can also provide significant benefits for transgender individuals, including improved physical health and well-being. A study published in the Journal of Surgical Research found that transgender women who underwent vaginoplasty experienced significant improvements in quality of life and physical health. Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Urology found that transgender men who underwent top surgery experienced significant improvements in physical health and well-being. However, surgery is not without risks, and there are concerns about the potential long-term effects of surgery on transgender individuals. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that transgender women who underwent vaginoplasty were at increased risk of complications, including infection and bleeding. The Endocrine Society treatment guidelines for transgender individuals were revised in 2017, and provide a framework for healthcare providers to follow when providing care to transgender individuals. The guidelines recommend that healthcare providers use the patient's preferred name and pronouns, and provide hormone therapy and/or surgery as needed. However, the guidelines also acknowledge that there is a significant knowledge gap in the field of transgender medicine, and that more research is needed to inform best practices. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that healthcare providers who received training on transgender medicine were more likely to provide high-quality care to transgender individuals. In conclusion, recent data suggests that gender-affirming hormone treatment and/or surgery can provide significant benefits for transgender individuals, including improved mental health and well-being, physical health, and quality of life. However, there are also concerns about the potential risks associated with exogenous hormone therapy and surgery, and more research is needed to inform best practices. The Endocrine Society treatment guidelines provide a framework for healthcare providers to follow, but there is a significant knowledge gap in the field of transgender medicine that needs to be addressed.", "References": [{"title": "Transgender people and healthcare: A review of the literature", "authors": "Coleman, J.
