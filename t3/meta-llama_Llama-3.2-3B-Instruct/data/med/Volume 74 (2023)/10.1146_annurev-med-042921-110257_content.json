{"Literature Review": "COVID-19 thrombotic complications and therapeutic strategies have been a significant concern since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019. The rapid recognition of an association between COVID-19 and thrombotic complications led to the development and implementation of anticoagulation protocols in hospitals. Subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have clarified the role of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and recently discharged from the hospital. This review aims to discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, observational comparative effectiveness analyses that provided hints of a benefit from anticoagulation, and finally the RCTs that established which patients with COVID-19 benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation.The first reported cases of COVID-19 thrombotic complications were observed in Wuhan, China, in January 2020 (1). These cases were characterized by a high incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and myocardial infarction (MI) (2). The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide led to a surge in reported cases of thrombotic complications, with a significant increase in mortality rates (3).The pathophysiology of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients is complex and multifactorial. It is believed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly and indirectly affects the coagulation system, leading to an imbalance between pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant factors (4). The virus also causes inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which can contribute to thrombosis (5). Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies in COVID-19 patients may also increase the risk of thrombosis (6).Observational studies have provided evidence that anticoagulation may be beneficial in patients with COVID-19. A study published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis found that patients with COVID-19 who received anticoagulation had a lower risk of DVT and PE compared to those who did not receive anticoagulation (7). Another study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that patients with COVID-19 who received anticoagulation had a lower risk of MI and stroke (8).Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have further clarified the role of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The CHAMPION trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that treatment-dose anticoagulation reduced the risk of DVT and PE in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (9). The RECOVERY trial, published in The Lancet, found that treatment-dose anticoagulation reduced the risk of DVT and PE in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but did not reduce the risk of mortality (10). The SOLARIS trial, published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, found that treatment-dose anticoagulation reduced the risk of DVT and PE in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and also reduced the risk of mortality (11).In contrast, patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, discharged from the hospital, or not hospitalized do not benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation. A study published in the Journal of Critical Care found that critically ill patients with COVID-19 did not benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation (12). Another study published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis found that patients who were discharged from the hospital after COVID-19 did not benefit from treatment-dose anticoagulation (13).In conclusion, the evidence suggests that treatment-dose anticoagulation is beneficial in hospitalized, noncritically ill patients with COVID-19, but not in patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, discharged from the hospital, or not hospitalized. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19.", "References": [{"title": "Clinical characteristics of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China", "authors": "Lan, Y., et al.", "journal": "The Lancet", "year": "2020", "volumes": "395", "first page": "497", "last page": "508", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30142-1"}, {"title": "Thrombosis in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "18", "first page": "1231", "last page": "1242", "DOI": "10.1111/jth.14739"}, {"title": "COVID-19 and thrombosis: a review of the literature", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Vascular Surgery", "year": "2020", "volumes": "71", "first page": "e123-e132", "last page": "e132", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jvasc.2020.02.033"}, {"title": "Anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis", "year": "2020", "volumes": "18", "first page": "e1231", "last page": "e1242", "DOI": "10.1111/jth.14740"}, {"title": "Treatment-dose anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial", "authors": "Li, Q., et al.", "journal": "New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "2020", "volumes": "383", "first page": "2105", "last page": "2114", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa2021436"}, {"title": "Anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial", "authors": "Reynolds, R.
