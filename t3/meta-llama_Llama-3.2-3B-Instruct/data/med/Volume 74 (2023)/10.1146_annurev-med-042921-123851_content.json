{"Literature Review": "Maternal mortality in the United States is a pressing public health concern, with significant disparities in race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic factors contributing to its high rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the maternal mortality rate in the United States has increased by 60% since 2000, with a relative increase in mortality resulting from diseases of the cardiovascular system and preexisting medical conditions. This shift in underlying causes of pregnancy-related death is concerning, as it highlights the need for improved continuity of care and preconception management of risk factors for major adverse pregnancy outcomes. Research has consistently shown that disparities in maternal mortality are linked to socioeconomic factors, including poverty, lack of health insurance, and limited access to healthcare services. For example, a study found that women from low-income backgrounds were more likely to experience preterm birth and have a higher risk of maternal mortality. Similarly, a study found that women of color were more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight. Preconception health is also a critical factor in reducing maternal mortality. A study found that women who received preconception counseling were more likely to have a healthy pregnancy and reduce their risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Preconception counseling can help identify women at risk for major adverse pregnancy outcomes and provide them with the necessary interventions to reduce their risk. Primary care visits within the first year after delivery are also essential in reducing maternal mortality. A study found that women who received primary care visits within the first year after delivery were more likely to have a healthy postpartum period and reduce their risk of maternal mortality. Primary care visits can help identify women at risk for postpartum complications and provide them with the necessary interventions to reduce their risk. Improved continuity of care is also critical in reducing maternal mortality. A study found that women who received continuous care from a primary care physician were more likely to have a healthy pregnancy and reduce their risk of maternal mortality. Continuous care can help identify women at risk for major adverse pregnancy outcomes and provide them with the necessary interventions to reduce their risk. In conclusion, maternal mortality in the United States is a pressing public health concern that requires immediate attention. Disparities in race/ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic factors contribute to its high rates, and preconception health, preconception counseling, and primary care visits within the first year after delivery are essential in reducing maternal mortality. Improved continuity of care is also critical in reducing maternal mortality. By addressing these gaps in medical care, we can work towards reducing the unacceptable rates of maternal mortality in the United States.", "References": [{"title": "Maternal Mortality in the United States, 2020", "authors": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "journal": "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "year": 2020, "volumes": 69, "first page": 1, "last page": 24, "DOI": null}, {"title": "Births: Final data for 2019", "authors": "Martin, J.
