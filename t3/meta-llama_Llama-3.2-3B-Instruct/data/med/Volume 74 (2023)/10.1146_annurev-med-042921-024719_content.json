{"Literature Review": "The development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. Despite the high overall response rates, relapse post CAR T treatment remains a significant clinical challenge. One well-defined mechanism of disease relapse is the loss of target antigen, specifically CD19. The mechanism of CD19 loss and which patients are at higher risk of CD19 loss remain poorly understood. To overcome CD19 loss, researchers have been exploring CARs targeting multiple antigens, including CD19/20 and CD19/22 bispecific CARs. These multispecific CARs have shown cytotoxicity against CD19-negative cells in preclinical studies and have demonstrated efficacy, safety, and a relatively low rate of CD19-negative relapse in phase I trials. However, the selection of an ideal target, the right CAR construct, and whether these multispecific CARs can induce long-term remissions are still under investigation. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of CD19 loss, the development of multispecific CARs, and the results of clinical trials testing these therapies in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma.", "References": [{"title": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells for B Cell Malignancies", "authors": "R.
