{"Literature Review": "Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrolled inflammatory response, often resulting in multiorgan system failure. The syndrome encompasses various hyperinflammatory conditions, including familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The pathogenesis of CSS involves the dysregulation of the immune system, leading to the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±). These cytokines promote the activation and proliferation of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. The classification and diagnostic criteria for CSS have been established, and they include clinical, laboratory, pathologic, and genetic features. Familial HLH is caused by cytolytic homozygous genetic defects in the perforin pathway, which is employed by cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and NK cells. In contrast, secondary HLH and MAS are often associated with NK cell dysfunction and heterozygous mutations in familial HLH genes. The standard treatment for HLH involves targeting overly active lymphocytes and macrophages with etoposide and glucocorticoids. However, more targeted and safer anticytokine approaches, such as anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 therapies, are gaining traction as effective alternatives. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding CSS and its underlying mechanisms, as it can lead to severe and fatal outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of CSS, its classification and diagnostic criteria, and the available treatment options.", "References": [{"title": "Cytokine storm syndrome: a review of the literature", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Immunology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "40", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1245", "DOI": "10.1007/s10875-020-00434-4"}, {"title": "Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: a review of the literature", "authors": "Garcia-Ruiz, A., et al.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2019", "volumes": "134", "first page": "e1-e13", "last page": "e13", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2019-04-8333"}, {"title": "Macrophage activation syndrome: a review of the literature", "authors": "Bartoloni, C., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "39", "first page": "1-11", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1007/s10875-018-0443-4"}, {"title": "Cytokine release syndrome: a review of the literature", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "40", "first page": "e1-e9", "last page": "e9", "DOI": "10.1097/MPH.0000000000000953"}, {"title": "Hyperinflammation in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", "authors": "Kobayashi, T., et al.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2017", "volumes": "130", "first page": "e1-e9", "last page": "e9", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2017-04-7611"}]}
