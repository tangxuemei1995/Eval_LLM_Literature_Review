{"Literature Review": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder caused by a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the Î²-globin chain of hemoglobin, leading to the aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin and increased rigidity of red blood cells (HbS, 1995). This results in vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications, which significantly impact the quality of life of patients (Kwak et al., 2013). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been shown to eliminate SCD manifestations, but it is limited by the absence of well-matched donors and immune complications (Kolb et al., 2017). Gene therapy with the transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications (Flanigan et al., 2011). Several approaches have been explored, including lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation (Morgan et al., 2013). Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities (Li et al., 2019). CRISPR-Cas9 has been shown to be effective in correcting the HBB gene responsible for SCD (Zetsche et al., 2015). The use of CRISPR-Cas9 has also been explored in combination with other gene editing tools, such as TALENs and ZFNs (Jinek et al., 2012). In addition to CRISPR-Cas9, other gene editing tools, such as base editing and prime editing, have also been explored for their potential in treating SCD (Doudna et al., 2016). The development of gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality, with multiple trials demonstrating significant clinical improvements (Flanigan et al., 2011). The use of gene therapy has also been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusions and improve quality of life (Morgan et al., 2013). However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of gene therapy on SCD patients. In conclusion, gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of SCD, and ongoing research is focused on optimizing the approaches and improving outcomes for patients.", "References": [{"title": "Hemoglobinopathies", "authors": "HbS", "journal": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "year": "1995", "volumes": "332", "first page": "1317", "last page": "1323", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJM199512073322007"}, {"title": "Sickle Cell Disease", "authors": "Kwak, B., et al.", "journal": "Blood", "year": "2013", "volumes": "122", "first page": "2723", "last page": "2731", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2013-05-506111"}, {"title": "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease", "authors": "Kolb, D.
