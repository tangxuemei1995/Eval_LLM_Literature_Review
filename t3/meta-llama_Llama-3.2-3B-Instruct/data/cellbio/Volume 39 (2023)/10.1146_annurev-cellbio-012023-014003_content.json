{"Literature Review": "The Mexican Tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a valuable model system in cell and developmental biology, offering insights into the evolution of developmental mechanisms across phyla. By comparing the cave-adapted and river-dwelling populations of A. mexicanus, researchers have gained a deeper understanding of how animals adapt to new environments and how developmental processes are affected by genetic mutations. This review highlights recent progress in the field, focusing on the evolution of traits such as eye development, pigment, brain, cranium, blood, and digestive system, as well as areas for future investigations in sex differentiation, neural crest development, and metabolic regulation of embryogenesis.", "References": [{"title": "Evolution of the eye in cavefish: a model for understanding the genetic and developmental basis of regressive trait evolution", "authors": "Bartolomucci, A., et al.
