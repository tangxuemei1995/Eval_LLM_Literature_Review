{"Literature Review": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a crucial role in the decoding of messenger RNA codons to peptides at the ribosome. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of tRNA regulation in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This literature review aims to summarize the current understanding of tRNA dysregulation in these diseases and discuss the underlying mechanisms.tRNA expression in neurons is regulated, and they are not functionally redundant (1). When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this results in an imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of toxic amino acids, which can cause oxidative stress and damage to neurons (2). Furthermore, tRNAs are spliced, processed, and posttranscriptionally modified, which are essential for their proper function (3).Defects in these processes lead to neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (4, 5). Mutations in the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) also lead to disease. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs cause syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs lead to peripheral neuropathy (6, 7). Peripheral neuropathy is characterized by damage to the peripheral nerves, which can lead to muscle weakness and atrophy.Angiogenin, a protein involved in angiogenesis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (8). Angiogenin is a tRNA-derived protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Mutations in the angiogenin gene have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and FTD (9).The integrated stress response (ISR) is also involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (10). The ISR is a cellular response to stress, which involves the activation of various signaling pathways. Mutations in the ISR pathway have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and FTD (11).In addition to these mechanisms, tRNA modification and splicing also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (12, 13). tRNA modification involves the addition of various modifications to the tRNA molecule, which is essential for its proper function. Mutations in the tRNA modification pathway have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and FTD (14).In conclusion, tRNA dysregulation is a common feature of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. The underlying mechanisms involve the imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability, defects in tRNA splicing and modification, and mutations in the aaRSs and ISR pathway. Further research is needed to understand the sensitivity of neurons to these changes and to develop effective treatments for these diseases.", "References": [{"title": "tRNA expression in neurons is regulated", "authors": "K.
