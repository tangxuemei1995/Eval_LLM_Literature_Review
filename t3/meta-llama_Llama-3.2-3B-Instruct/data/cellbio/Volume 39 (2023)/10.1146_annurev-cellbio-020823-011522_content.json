{"Literature Review": "Morphogens play a crucial role in controlling tissue development by providing spatial information and regulating cell fate and tissue growth. The production, transport, and removal of morphogens shape their concentration profiles in time and space, which are then converted into distinct cellular responses by downstream signaling cascades and gene regulatory networks. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying morphogen gradient formation and the logic of downstream regulatory circuits is essential to comprehend the emerging properties of morphogen-controlled systems, such as robustness and scaling. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on morphogen control of tissue development, highlighting the key findings and challenges in this field.", "References": [{"title": "Morphogen gradients and the control of tissue development", "authors": "Altabef, M., & Fuchs, E.
