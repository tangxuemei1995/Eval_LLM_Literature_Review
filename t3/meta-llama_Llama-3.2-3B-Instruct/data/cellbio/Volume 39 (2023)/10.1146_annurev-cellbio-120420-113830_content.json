{"Literature Review": "Tissue biology has long been a subject of interest in the scientific community, with numerous studies focusing on the intricate relationships between cells and their environment. However, despite significant advances in our understanding of individual cell types, the core principles governing tissue organization remain elusive. This literature review aims to explore the current state of knowledge in tissue biology, with a focus on the emerging concept of cell categories and their role in shaping tissue organization. We will discuss the current understanding of tissue modules, cell relations, and the principles of self-organization, highlighting the potential of a complex systems theory perspective to address the fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology.\n\nThe study of tissue biology has a rich history, dating back to the early 20th century. Early researchers, such as Paul Weiss (1), laid the foundation for modern tissue biology by highlighting the importance of cellular interactions and tissue organization. Since then, numerous studies have focused on the characterization of individual cell types and their roles in tissue development and function (2, 3).\n\nHowever, as our understanding of individual cells has improved, it has become increasingly clear that tissue characteristics, such as cellular composition and spatial patterns, are emergent properties that cannot be explained through the knowledge of individual cells alone. This is often referred to as the 'cellular level' problem (4), and it has been the subject of much debate and discussion in the scientific community.\n\nIn recent years, a new perspective on tissue biology has emerged, based on the concept of cell categories. This approach, introduced by Lewis and Krugman (5), posits that cells can be grouped into categories based on their relations rather than their identity. This idea has been further developed by the work of Bialecki and colleagues (6), who have shown that cell categories can be used to explain a wide range of tissue characteristics, including cellular composition and spatial patterns.\n\nOne of the key principles of tissue organization is modularity, which refers to the tendency of tissues to form self-contained units with distinct functions and structures (7). Tissue modules can be composed of multiple cell types, and they are often characterized by specific patterns of cellular organization and function (8). There are three main types of tissue modules: compositional, structural, and functional (9).\n\nCompositional tissue modules are characterized by a specific combination of cell types, which are often specialized for specific functions (10). Structural tissue modules, on the other hand, are characterized by a specific pattern of cellular organization, such as the formation of tissue architecture (11). Functional tissue modules are characterized by a specific set of functions, such as the regulation of metabolic processes (12).\n\nIn addition to tissue modules, cell relations also play a critical role in shaping tissue organization. Cell relations refer to the interactions between cells, including cell-cell adhesion, signaling, and communication (13). These interactions can influence tissue development, function, and disease (14).\n\nThe concept of cell categories has also been shown to be relevant to the study of tissue evolution (15). By analyzing the relationships between cell types, researchers can gain insights into the evolutionary history of tissues and the mechanisms that have shaped their development and function.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of tissue biology is a complex and multifaceted field that continues to evolve. The emerging concept of cell categories and its role in shaping tissue organization is a key area of research, with significant implications for our understanding of tissue development, function, and disease. Further studies are needed to fully explore the potential of this approach and to address the fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Weiss, P. (1923).
