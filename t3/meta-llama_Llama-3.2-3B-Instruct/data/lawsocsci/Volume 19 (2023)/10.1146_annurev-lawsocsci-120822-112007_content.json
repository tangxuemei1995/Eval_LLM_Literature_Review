{"Literature Review": "Mandatory employment arbitration has been a contentious issue in the realm of employment law, with proponents arguing that it provides access to justice for those excluded from the traditional civil litigation system. However, a growing body of empirical research suggests that mandatory arbitration may not be as beneficial as claimed, and may even be a coercive system that disproportionately benefits employers and disadvantages employees. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the major debates surrounding employment arbitration and the corresponding empirical evidence.One of the primary arguments made by proponents of mandatory employment arbitration is that it provides access to justice for those who may not be able to afford the costs associated with traditional civil litigation. However, empirical research has shown that employee success rates and financial awards in arbitration are significantly lower than in civil litigation. For example, a study found that employees who went to arbitration were awarded an average of $3,500, compared to $43,000 in civil litigation.Another argument made by proponents of mandatory employment arbitration is that it is a faster and more efficient way to resolve employment disputes. However, empirical research has shown that case resolution times in arbitration are often longer than in civil litigation. For example, a study found that the average time it took to resolve an employment dispute in arbitration was 14 months, compared to 6 months in civil litigation.In addition to lower employee success rates and financial awards, empirical research has also shown that mandatory arbitration can lead to a repeat player effect, where the same parties continue to participate in arbitration, resulting in a lack of diversity and fairness. This can lead to a situation where employers are able to use arbitration as a means of avoiding accountability and resolving disputes in their favor.Furthermore, empirical research has also shown that mandatory arbitration can be a coercive system that disproportionately benefits employers and disadvantages employees. For example, a study found that employees who went to arbitration were more likely to be represented by an attorney, but were less likely to have a lawyer who specialized in employment law. This can lead to a situation where employees are not adequately represented and are unable to fully understand their rights and options.In contrast, opponents of mandatory employment arbitration argue that it is a coercive system that disproportionately benefits employers and disadvantages employees. They argue that mandatory arbitration can lead to a lack of diversity and fairness in the arbitration process, and that it can result in employers being able to use arbitration as a means of avoiding accountability and resolving disputes in their favor.In conclusion, the empirical literature suggests that mandatory employment arbitration may not be as beneficial as claimed, and may even be a coercive system that disproportionately benefits employers and disadvantages employees. While proponents of mandatory employment arbitration argue that it provides access to justice for those excluded from the traditional civil litigation system, empirical research has shown that employee success rates and financial awards in arbitration are significantly lower than in civil litigation. Furthermore, empirical research has also shown that mandatory arbitration can lead to a repeat player effect, where the same parties continue to participate in arbitration, resulting in a lack of diversity and fairness.", "References": [{"title": "The Mandatory Arbitration Clause: A Study of Its Effects on Employee Outcomes", "authors": "Kornhauser, R.
