{"Literature Review": "Bankruptcy law has undergone significant changes since its inception in 1978, with a growing body of research examining the complex relationships between companies, creditors, and investors. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on bankruptcy law, with a focus on the strategic moves made by companies and investors to navigate the bankruptcy system. We begin by examining the role of Chapter 11 filings in corporate reorganization, followed by an analysis of the negotiations between distressed firms and creditors outside of bankruptcy. We also discuss the planning and preparation that companies undertake before filing for bankruptcy, as well as the tactics employed by activist investors to improve their bargaining power and earn higher returns. Finally, we survey the evolving nature of the American bankruptcy system and the need for ongoing empirical research to inform policy making.", "References": [{"title": "The Economics of Bankruptcy", "authors": "Becker, G.
