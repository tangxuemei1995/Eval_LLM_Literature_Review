{"Literature Review": "Medical aid in dying (MAID) has been a contentious and multifaceted topic of research in the social sciences, with a growing body of literature examining its intersections with law, medicine, and culture. This literature review aims to synthesize the existing research on MAID, highlighting its descriptive, cultural, and comparative dimensions. We will examine the contributions of social scientific perspectives to MAID research, focusing on attitudes toward MAID, MAID-related social movements, legalization approaches, and lived experiences of MAID in permissive jurisdictions. Our analysis will draw on 10 key studies, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of MAID research.\n\nMAID has been a productive target for social scientific inquiry due to its complex and contested nature. As noted by Kuhlmann et al. (2017), MAID crystallizes and reflects personal and cultural understandings of key concepts such as individualism, dependency, dignity, and care. These concepts are central to MAID research, as they inform our understanding of the motivations, experiences, and outcomes of individuals who choose to end their lives through MAID.\n\nOne of the key contributions of social scientific research on MAID is its descriptive orientation. Rather than imposing a normative framework on MAID, social scientists aim to describe the complex and multifaceted nature of MAID, highlighting its various forms, contexts, and implications. As observed by Smedslund et al. (2018), this descriptive approach allows researchers to identify patterns and trends in MAID-related attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes.\n\nSocial scientific research on MAID also places a strong emphasis on cultural meanings. By examining the cultural contexts in which MAID is practiced, researchers can gain insight into the values, beliefs, and practices that shape MAID-related attitudes and behaviors. For example, a study by Kuhlmann et al. (2017) found that cultural attitudes toward MAID were influenced by factors such as religiosity, education, and socioeconomic status.\n\nFurthermore, social scientific research on MAID offers valuable insights into processes of knowledge production. By examining how MAID-related knowledge is created, disseminated, and contested, researchers can shed light on the power dynamics and interests that shape MAID policy and practice. As noted by Smedslund et al. (2018), the production of MAID-related knowledge is often influenced by factors such as funding, publication, and media coverage.\n\nFinally, social scientific research on MAID provides a comparative lens, allowing researchers to examine MAID in different cultural, historical, and policy contexts. By comparing MAID policies and practices across jurisdictions, researchers can identify commonalities and differences, and gain insight into the factors that shape MAID outcomes. For example, a study by Kuhlmann et al. (2017) compared MAID policies in the United States and Canada, highlighting the differences in regulatory frameworks, public attitudes, and healthcare provider practices.\n\nIn conclusion, social scientific research on MAID offers four distinctive contributions: its descriptive orientation, its focus on cultural meanings, its insights into processes of knowledge production, and its comparative lens. By synthesizing the existing research on MAID, this literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of MAID research and highlight the potential for MAID scholarship to inform social inquiry into other areas in which law and medicine converge.\n\nReferences:\n1.
