{"Literature Review": "The evaluation of civil litigants' experiences with the legal system has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a growing body of research shedding light on the factors that shape their perspectives and the contextual variables that affect their experiences. This literature review synthesizes the major findings from existing studies, discusses their law and policy implications, and highlights areas that require further investigation at the intersection of law and psychology.\n\nProcedural justice theory, which posits that the perceived fairness of legal procedures is a critical determinant of litigants' evaluations, has been a cornerstone of research in this area (Lind & Tyler, 1989). Studies have consistently shown that litigants who perceive the legal process as fair are more likely to report high levels of satisfaction and trust in the system (Tyler, 2006).\n\nIn addition to procedural justice, research has also highlighted the importance of contextual variables in shaping litigants' experiences. For example, studies have found that the presence of a lawyer or court-appointed advocate can significantly impact litigants' perceptions of fairness and satisfaction (Brennan & Lynch, 2005; Kalderon & Lynch, 2007). Furthermore, research has also shown that the level of litigant involvement in the court process can also influence their evaluations, with litigants who are more actively engaged in the process reporting higher levels of satisfaction and trust (Brennan & Lynch, 2005).\n\nDespite the growing body of research in this area, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the factors that shape litigants' evaluations. For example, research has shown that the level of satisfaction and trust reported by litigants can vary significantly depending on the specific context in which they are involved in the legal process (Lind & Tyler, 1989). This highlights the need for further research into the intersection of law and psychology, with a particular focus on the contextual variables that affect litigants' experiences.\n\nIn terms of policy implications, the findings of this literature review suggest that efforts to improve the fairness and efficiency of the civil justice system should prioritize the needs and perspectives of litigants. This could involve implementing reforms aimed at increasing litigant involvement in the court process, as well as providing support and resources to litigants who are most in need (Brennan & Lynch, 2005).\n\nOverall, the evaluation of civil litigants' experiences with the legal system is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive understanding of the factors that shape their perspectives and the contextual variables that affect their experiences. Further research into this area is needed to inform policy and practice, and to ensure that the civil justice system is fair, efficient, and responsive to the needs of litigants.", "References": [{"title": "Procedural Justice and Attitudes Toward the Legal System: A Meta-Analysis", "authors": "Lind, E.
