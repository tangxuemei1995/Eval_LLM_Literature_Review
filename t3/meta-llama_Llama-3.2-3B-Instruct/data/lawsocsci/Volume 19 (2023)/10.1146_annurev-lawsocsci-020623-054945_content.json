{"Literature Review": "The Guantánamo Bay naval base has been a focal point of controversy and debate since the first detainees arrived in 2002. The facility's legacy is inextricably linked to the US 'war on terror' and has been instrumental in shaping the country's approach to torture, war crimes, and human rights. This literature review examines the complex and multifaceted nature of Guantánamo's legacy, tracing its evolution across four administrations and exploring the underlying factors that have contributed to its enduring impact. The establishment of Guantánamo in 2002 marked a significant shift in the US approach to counterterrorism, as it represented a departure from traditional methods of interrogation and detention. The facility's design and operations were shaped by the Bush administration's 'war on terror' doctrine, which emphasized the use of military commissions and the suspension of habeas corpus. This approach was met with widespread criticism, both domestically and internationally, with many arguing that it constituted a form of torture and a breach of international human rights law. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006) marked a significant turning point in the Guantánamo saga, as it established the framework for the military commissions that would govern the detention and trial of Guantánamo detainees. However, the decision was widely criticized for its narrow focus on the military commissions and its failure to address the broader issues of detention and interrogation. The Obama administration's efforts to close Guantánamo were ultimately unsuccessful, and the facility remains open to this day. The legacy of Guantánamo continues to be felt, with many arguing that it has contributed to a broader erosion of the rule of law and the undermining of human rights in the US. One of the key factors that has contributed to the enduring legacy of Guantánamo is the lack of a national consensus about the role of laws and courts as guarantors of basic rights. This lack of consensus has been fueled by entrenched partisanship, which has characterized contemporary US politics. The Guantánamo debate has become a proxy for broader ideological and partisan differences, with many arguing that it represents a fundamental clash between liberal and conservative values. The CIA's use of black sites and secret prisons has also been linked to Guantánamo, with many arguing that these facilities were instrumental in the development of the US approach to counterterrorism. The use of black sites has been widely condemned, both domestically and internationally, with many arguing that it constitutes a form of torture and a breach of international human rights law. In conclusion, the legacy of Guantánamo is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the broader challenges facing the US approach to counterterrorism and human rights. The lack of a national consensus about the role of laws and courts as guarantors of basic rights has contributed to the enduring impact of Guantánamo, and the facility's legacy will likely continue to be felt for years to come.", "References": [{"title": "Human Rights Watch.
