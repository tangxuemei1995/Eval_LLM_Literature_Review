{"Literature Review": "The global governance of artificial intelligence (AI) is a complex and multifaceted issue, with various actors and modalities emerging to address its challenges. This review aims to provide a critical analysis of the different modalities of global governance of AI, their rationales, and tensions, with a focus on the interests and ideas driving these different approaches.\n\nAI has been recognized as a critical technology with significant implications for global governance (Bostrom, 2014). The increasing use of AI in various sectors, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, has raised concerns about its potential risks and benefits (Floridi, 2019). In response, governments, industries, and civil society organizations have been working together to develop a governance regime around AI.\n\nOne of the key modalities of global governance of AI is ethical councils (Kroll et al., 2017). These councils bring together experts from various fields to develop guidelines and principles for the development and deployment of AI systems. For example, the Partnership on AI, a consortium of tech companies, has established an ethics council to develop guidelines for AI development and deployment (Partnership on AI, 2020).\n\nIndustry governance is another key modality of global governance of AI (Buchanan, 2018). This approach involves the development of industry-wide standards and guidelines for AI development and deployment. For example, the IEEE has developed a set of standards for AI development and deployment (IEEE, 2020).\n\nContracts and licensing are also an important aspect of global governance of AI (Katz, 2019). Companies are increasingly using contracts and licensing agreements to govern the use of AI systems. For example, Google has developed a set of contracts and licensing agreements for the use of its AI systems (Google, 2020).\n\nStandards are another key modality of global governance of AI (Buchanan, 2018). Standards provide a common framework for the development and deployment of AI systems. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a set of standards for AI development and deployment (ISO, 2020).\n\nInternational agreements are also an important aspect of global governance of AI (Bostrom, 2014). International agreements, such as the OECD's AI Principles, provide a framework for the development and deployment of AI systems (OECD, 2020).\n\nDomestic legislation with extraterritorial impact is another key modality of global governance of AI (Katz, 2019). This approach involves the development of domestic laws that have extraterritorial impact, such as the EU's AI Regulation (European Union, 2020).\n\nDespite the emergence of these different modalities of global governance of AI, there are tensions and conflicts between them. For example, there are tensions between industry governance and ethical councils, with some arguing that industry governance is too focused on profit and neglects the need for ethical considerations (Kroll et al., 2017).\n\nAnother tension is between international agreements and domestic legislation with extraterritorial impact. Some argue that international agreements are too vague and do not provide sufficient guidance for the development and deployment of AI systems (Bostrom, 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the global governance of AI is a complex and multifaceted issue, with various actors and modalities emerging to address its challenges. Understanding the rationales and tensions driving these different modalities is crucial for developing effective governance regimes for AI.\n\nThe benefits of global governance of AI are numerous. For example, it can help to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a way that is transparent, accountable, and fair (Floridi, 2019). It can also help to mitigate the risks associated with AI, such as bias and job displacement (Bostrom, 2014).\n\nHowever, there are also challenges to global governance of AI. For example, there are tensions between different actors and modalities, and there is a need for more effective coordination and cooperation between them (Kroll et al., 2017).\n\nIn order to address these challenges, it is essential to develop a more nuanced understanding of the different modalities of global governance of AI and their rationales. This requires a critical analysis of the interests and ideas driving these different approaches, as well as a consideration of the tensions and conflicts between them.\n\nUltimately, the goal of global governance of AI should be to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a way that is beneficial to all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, and society as a whole.\n\nReferences:\n\nBostrom, N.
