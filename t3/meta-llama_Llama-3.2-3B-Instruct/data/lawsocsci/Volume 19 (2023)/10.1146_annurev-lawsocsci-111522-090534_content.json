{"Literature Review": "The study of vaccines in the context of public health has been dominated by an instrumentalist approach, focusing on the promotion of vaccine acceptance and overcoming hesitancy. However, this approach has limitations, as it neglects the complex social and cultural factors that influence vaccine uptake. Recent research has employed constructivist approaches from feminist sociology and anthropology to uncover the ethnographic richness of vaccine debates, revealing how they illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches have also been employed to examine the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics. Despite the potential of these approaches, methodological challenges remain. This review aims to chart the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, exploring why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health and what theoretical tools enable this shift.", "References": [{"title": "The Politics of Vaccine Hesitancy: A Critical Analysis of the Role of Law in Promoting Vaccine Acceptance", "authors": "K.
