{"Literature Review": "The integration of technology in law firms has been a topic of discussion among scholars and practitioners in recent years. While some argue that technology will lead to the demise of law firms, others believe that it will transform the profession in various ways. This literature review aims to explore the impact of technology on US and UK law firms, with a focus on the recent machine learning wave of artificial intelligence. We examine the current state of technology adoption in law firms, its effects on lawyers' core tasks, and the emerging business models that create value from nonhuman capital and nonlegal human capital.", "References": [{"title": "The Future of Law: Can Technology Replace Human Lawyers?", "authors": "D.
