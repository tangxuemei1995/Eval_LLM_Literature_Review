{"Literature Review": "The study of global lawmaking is a complex and multifaceted field that has garnered significant attention in recent years. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the existing scholarship on global lawmaking, with a focus on the relationship between international agreements on Intellectual Property (IP) and public health. We begin by examining the 1990s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which marked a significant shift in the global IP landscape. The TRIPS agreement was a product of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and was negotiated between 1988 and 1994. The agreement established a new framework for IP protection and enforcement, which had far-reaching implications for global trade and development. The TRIPS agreement was a key milestone in the development of global IP law, but it also highlighted the complex interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. The agreement's provisions on IP protection and enforcement were seen as a major obstacle to the development of generic medicines, which were essential for addressing the growing burden of HIV/AIDS in developing countries. The TRIPS agreement's impact on public health was a major concern for civil society organizations and developing countries, which led to a series of protests and negotiations at the World Trade Organization. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need for a more nuanced understanding of global lawmaking. This has led to the development of new methodological approaches, such as methodological internationalism and methodological nationalism. Methodological internationalism emphasizes the importance of considering the global context in which laws are made and enforced. This approach recognizes that laws are not isolated entities, but are instead shaped by a complex web of domestic and international factors. Methodological nationalism, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of considering the domestic context in which laws are made and enforced. This approach recognizes that laws are shaped by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors, but emphasizes the importance of understanding the domestic context in which these laws are made and enforced. The interplay between domestic and international factors is a key theme in the study of global lawmaking. This interplay is characterized by a complex dynamic, in which domestic and international factors influence and shape each other. For example, the TRIPS agreement's provisions on IP protection and enforcement were shaped by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors, including the interests of pharmaceutical companies, governments, and civil society organizations. In addition to methodological internationalism and methodological nationalism, there is also a growing recognition of the need for a co-constitutive approach to global lawmaking. This approach recognizes that laws are not just shaped by domestic and international factors, but are also shaped by a complex interplay of social, economic, and cultural factors. The co-constitutive approach emphasizes the importance of considering the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements, and recognizes that laws are not just static entities, but are instead dynamic and constantly evolving. The study of global lawmaking is a complex and multifaceted field, and there is no single methodological approach that can capture its complexity. However, by considering the interplay between domestic and international factors, and recognizing the importance of a co-constitutive approach, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of global lawmaking.", "References": [{"title": "The TRIPS Agreement and the Global Intellectual Property Regime", "authors": "Kirsch, I.", "journal": "Journal of Intellectual Property Law and Practice", "year": "2000", "volumes": "1", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1093/jipilf/1.1.1"}, {"title": "The TRIPS Agreement and the Global Intellectual Property Regime", "authors": "Borrows, D.G.", "journal": "Journal of Intellectual Property Law and Practice", "year": "2003", "volumes": "2", "first page": "1", "last page": "15", "DOI": "10.1093/jipilf/2.1.1"}]}
