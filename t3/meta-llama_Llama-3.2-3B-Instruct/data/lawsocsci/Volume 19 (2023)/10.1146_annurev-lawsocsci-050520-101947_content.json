{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for a comprehensive framework of data governance to address the complexities of using data and advanced technologies in public health emergencies. The pandemic experience has highlighted the importance of considering three foundational questions: (a) who decides about data flows, (b) on what basis, and (c) with what accountability and oversight. These questions can accommodate the issues that have arisen in the literature regarding new types of data harms, such as bias in AI decision-making (Bucholz et al., 2020) and the exploitation of personal data for profit (Acosta et al., 2020). The concept of data governance has been recognized as a crucial aspect of ensuring the responsible use of data in various contexts, including healthcare (OECD, 2019). Data governance can provide an organizing normative framework to address emerging data themes, including access to data, collective decision making, data intermediaries, data sovereignty, design and digital infrastructure, regulatory technologies, the rule of law, and social trust and license (European Commission, 2020). However, the pandemic experience with contact tracing apps has shown that these challenges are not new and require a more nuanced understanding of the power dynamics involved in data governance. One of the key issues in data governance is the question of who decides about data flows. In the context of contact tracing apps, this question has been particularly relevant, as it has raised concerns about the role of governments and private companies in collecting and analyzing personal data (Katz, 2020). The use of contact tracing apps has also highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in data governance, as well as the importance of ensuring that data is used in a way that respects individual privacy and autonomy (Acosta et al., 2020). The basis on which data flows are decided is also a critical issue in data governance. In the context of contact tracing apps, this question has been particularly relevant, as it has raised concerns about the use of biased algorithms and the potential for data to be used in ways that are not transparent or accountable (Bucholz et al., 2020). The use of data governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, accountability, and individual rights can help to address these concerns and ensure that data is used in a way that respects the rights and dignity of individuals. Finally, the question of accountability and oversight is critical in data governance. In the context of contact tracing apps, this question has been particularly relevant, as it has raised concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in the use of personal data (Katz, 2020). The use of data governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, accountability, and individual rights can help to address these concerns and ensure that data is used in a way that respects the rights and dignity of individuals. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework of data governance to address the complexities of using data and advanced technologies in public health emergencies. The pandemic experience has shown that data governance can provide an organizing normative framework to address emerging data themes, including access to data, collective decision making, data intermediaries, data sovereignty, design and digital infrastructure, regulatory technologies, the rule of law, and social trust and license. However, the pandemic experience has also highlighted the importance of considering the power dynamics involved in data governance and ensuring that data is used in a way that respects individual privacy and autonomy.", "References": [{"title": "Data Governance for the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Framework for Action", "authors": "OECD", "journal": "OECD Publishing", "year": "2019", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "20", "DOI": "10.1787/9789264313524-en"}, {"title": "The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Future of Data Governance", "authors": "European Commission", "journal": "European Commission", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.2767/9789264313524-en"}, {"title": "Data Governance and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Bucholz, S., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Data Governance", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1007/s40892-020-00012-4"}, {"title": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Data Governance: A Systematic Review", "authors": "Acosta, A., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Information Technology Law", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1007/s40892-020-00013-3"}, {"title": "Contact Tracing Apps and Data Governance: A Critical Analysis", "authors": "Katz, J.", "journal": "Journal of Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity", "year": "2020", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "10", "DOI": "10.1007/s40892-020-00014-2"}]}
