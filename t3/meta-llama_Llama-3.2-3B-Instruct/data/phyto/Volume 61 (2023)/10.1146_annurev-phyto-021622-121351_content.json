{"Literature Review": "Kitaviruses are a family of plant-infecting viruses that have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique characteristics and the diseases they cause. These viruses belong to the family Kitaviridae and are assigned into the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, primarily based on the diversity of their genomic organization. The cell-to-cell movement of most kitaviruses is facilitated by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, which is considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses. However, kitaviruses stand out for producing conspicuously unusual locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement, likely resulting from incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the case of citrus leprosy, a disease caused by the Cilevirus genus, which has significant economic implications for citrus crops (1). The transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites of many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids, highlighting the complex relationships between these viruses and their arthropod vectors (2). Furthermore, the genomes of kitaviruses encode numerous orphan open reading frames, which may play a role in their pathogenicity and transmission (3). The phylogenetic link between kitaviruses and arthropod viruses, as typified by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, SP24, is also noteworthy (4). This link suggests that kitaviruses may have evolved from a common ancestor with arthropod viruses, highlighting the need for further research into the evolutionary history of these viruses. In addition, the diversity of kitaviruses and their hosts has led to the identification of several new species, including the Negevirus, which is transmitted by the mite Brevipalpus californicus (5). The impact of kitaviruses on agriculture is significant, with diseases caused by these viruses affecting crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry (6). The study of kitaviruses has also shed light on the mechanisms of plant-virus interactions and the role of arthropod vectors in the transmission of plant viruses (7). Overall, the study of kitaviruses has significant implications for our understanding of plant-virus interactions and the development of strategies for disease management and control. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge on kitaviruses, including their classification, transmission, and pathogenicity, as well as the economic and environmental impacts of these viruses on agriculture.", "References": [{"title": "Kitaviruses: A Review of the Current State of Knowledge", "authors": "L.
