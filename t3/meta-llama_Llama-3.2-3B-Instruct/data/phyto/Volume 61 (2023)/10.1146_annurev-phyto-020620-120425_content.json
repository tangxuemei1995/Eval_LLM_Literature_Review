{"Literature Review": "The reemergence of phycopathology has significant implications for our understanding of algal biology, ecology, and biosecurity. Algal diseases, caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic symbionts, can have profound effects on marine and freshwater ecosystems. These disease complexes can shape the structure and function of algal communities, influencing the overall health and productivity of ecosystems. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of phycopathology in understanding algal ecology and biosecurity. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on algal pathogen biodiversity and the ecological interactions between algal hosts and their pathogens. Algal diseases have been a long-standing concern in the field of phycology, with early studies focusing on the impact of pathogens on algal growth and productivity. However, it was not until the advent of phyconomy (seaweed agronomy) that the need for a greater understanding of algal disease interactions became apparent. Phyconomy represents a significant shift in the way we approach algal cultivation, with the goal of producing high-quality algal biomass for various applications, including aquaculture and biofuel production. However, this shift also highlights the need for a greater understanding of the complex interactions between algal hosts and their pathogens, which can have significant implications for algal domestication and aquaculture practice. Recent studies have highlighted the underestimated cryptic diversity of algal pathogens, which can have significant implications for our understanding of algal ecology and biosecurity. For example, a study on the pathogen diversity of the alga Ulva lactuca found that a significant proportion of isolates were previously unknown. This highlights the need for further research into the diversity of algal pathogens and their ecological interactions with their hosts. The ecological interactions between algal hosts and their pathogens can have significant implications for algal ecology and biosecurity. For example, a study on the impact of the algal pathogen Peronospora muscorum on the growth and productivity of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii found that the pathogen can have significant effects on algal growth and productivity. This highlights the need for further research into the ecological interactions between algal hosts and their pathogens, which can inform strategies for improving algal health and productivity. In addition to the ecological interactions between algal hosts and their pathogens, the cultivation experience of algae can also contribute to and reinforce aquaculture practice. For example, a study on the cultivation of the alga Spirulina platensis found that the cultivation experience can influence the development of algal pathogens and the impact of these pathogens on algal growth and productivity. This highlights the need for further research into the relationship between algal cultivation experience and algal pathogen diversity. Finally, the potential for algal disease interactions to reshape biosecurity policies of seaweed cultivation worldwide is significant. For example, a study on the impact of algal pathogens on the growth and productivity of the alga Eucheuma cottonii found that the pathogen can have significant effects on algal growth and productivity, highlighting the need for strategies to prevent the spread of algal pathogens. This highlights the need for further research into the impact of algal disease interactions on biosecurity policies and the development of strategies to prevent the spread of algal pathogens. In conclusion, the reemergence of phycopathology has significant implications for our understanding of algal biology, ecology, and biosecurity. Further research into the diversity of algal pathogens and their ecological interactions with their hosts is needed to inform strategies for improving algal health and productivity. The cultivation experience of algae can also contribute to and reinforce aquaculture practice, and the potential for algal disease interactions to reshape biosecurity policies of seaweed cultivation worldwide is significant. By understanding the complex interactions between algal hosts and their pathogens, we can develop strategies to prevent the spread of algal pathogens and improve the overall health and productivity of algal communities.", "References": [{"title": "Phytoplankton diseases", "authors": "Anderson, D.
