{"Literature Review": "Functional peptides have emerged as a promising approach for plant disease control, offering novel mechanisms of action against a wide range of plant pathogens. The increasing need for sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional pesticides has driven research into the development of functional peptides as biopesticides. These peptides can be derived from natural sources, such as plants and microorganisms, or synthesized through chemical methods. The vast array of activities exhibited by functional peptides against plant pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and nematodes, has significant implications for the management of plant diseases.", "References": [{"title": "Functional peptides as biopesticides against plant pathogens", "authors": "Lee, S.
