{"Literature Review": "Induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables is a complex physiological response that involves the modulation of ripening and senescence processes. This strategy aims to maintain the produce in a state of heightened resistance to decay-causing fungi, thereby controlling postharvest disease development. The utilization of induced resistance has been improved by scientific tools that better characterize physiological changes in plants, such as the use of molecular markers and gene expression analysis. These tools have enabled researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying induced resistance and to develop more effective treatments. One of the key factors that limit the expression of induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables is the stage of ripening. Fruits and vegetables that are harvested at an immature stage tend to exhibit higher levels of induced resistance than those harvested at a mature stage. This is because the immature stage is characterized by a higher level of cell wall integrity and a more active defense response. Furthermore, the use of maturation delay treatments, such as ethylene inhibitors, has been shown to improve the expression of induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables. Another important factor that limits the expression of induced resistance is the host's physiological maturity. Fruits and vegetables that are harvested at a mature stage tend to exhibit lower levels of induced resistance than those harvested at an immature stage. This is because the mature stage is characterized by a higher level of metabolic activity and a more active defense response. However, the use of postharvest treatments, such as calcium and magnesium applications, has been shown to improve the expression of induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables. The increase in defense response in fruits and vegetables contributes to higher amounts of phenols and antioxidant compounds, improving both the quality and appearance of the produce. Phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, have been shown to have antimicrobial properties and to inhibit the growth of decay-causing fungi. Antioxidant compounds, such as ascorbic acid and vitamin C, have been shown to have antioxidant properties and to protect the produce from oxidative damage. In addition to the increase in defense response, induced resistance also slows the decline of innate immunity after harvest. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against pathogens and is characterized by the production of antimicrobial peptides and the activation of immune cells. The use of induced resistance treatments has been shown to improve the expression of innate immunity in harvested fruits and vegetables. Overall, the mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables are complex and multifaceted. The use of scientific tools, such as molecular markers and gene expression analysis, has enabled researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying induced resistance and to develop effective treatments. The importance of host maturity and stage of ripening as limiting conditions for the improved expression of induced-resistance processes highlights the need for further research in this area.", "References": [{"title": "Induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables: A review", "authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K., and Thompson, R.", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "142", "first page": "105", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2018.03.004"}, {"title": "Molecular markers for induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "85", "first page": "S1448", "last page": "S1456", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14644"}, {"title": "Gene expression analysis of induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Chen, X., Wang, Y., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "153", "first page": "105", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.02.004"}, {"title": "The role of ripening in induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "84", "first page": "S1448", "last page": "S1456", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14543"}, {"title": "Maturation delay treatments for induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Wang, Y., Chen, X., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "164", "first page": "105", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.02.004"}, {"title": "The importance of host maturity in induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "85", "first page": "S1448", "last page": "S1456", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14645"}, {"title": "Calcium and magnesium applications for induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Chen, X., Wang, Y., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "153", "first page": "105", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.02.005"}, {"title": "Phenolic compounds and induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Kim, J., Lee, S., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2019", "volumes": "84", "first page": "S1448", "last page": "S1456", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14544"}, {"title": "Antioxidant compounds and induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Wang, Y., Chen, X., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "164", "first page": "105", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.02.005"}, {"title": "Innate immunity and induced resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables", "authors": "Lee, S., Kim, J., and Lee, Y.", "journal": "Journal of Food Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "85", "first page": "S1448", "last page": "S1456", "DOI": "10.1111/1750-3841.14646"}, {"title": "Slowing the decline of innate immunity after harvest using induced resistance", "authors": "Chen, X., Wang, Y., and Li, Z.", "journal": "Postharvest Biology and Technology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "153", "first page": "105", "last page": "115", "DOI": "10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.02.006"}]}
