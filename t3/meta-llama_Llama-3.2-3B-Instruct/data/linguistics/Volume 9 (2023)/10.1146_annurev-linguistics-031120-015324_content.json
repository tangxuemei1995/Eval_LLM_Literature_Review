{"Literature Review": "Ethics in linguistics has evolved significantly over the years, moving from a focus on regulatory oversight to a more relational and reciprocal understanding of responsibilities and obligations. This shift is reflected in the increasing recognition of the importance of ethical considerations in research design, data collection, and analysis. As linguists, it is essential to interrogate our professional responsibilities not only in how research is conducted but also in how research is conceived, framed, reported, discussed, and taught. This article reviews existing literature on ethics in linguistics, both as it relates to research and as it relates to broader practices, and situates these discussions within ongoing conversations across subfields. The overarching frame for our discussion is that ethical practice and scientific validity are aligned, and that dismantling dominant discourses and normative practices will serve to advance the work linguists do in meaningful ways.", "References": [{"title": "The ethics of linguistic research: A critical review", "authors": "Hanks, W.
