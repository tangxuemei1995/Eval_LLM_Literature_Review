{"Literature Review": "Heritage languages are sociopolitically minority and/or minoritized languages acquired as the first or one of the first languages in a bilingual or multilingual context. These languages are typically acquired under conditions of reduced exposure and are often used less than the majority language during late childhood and adolescence. The linguistic properties of heritage languages have been extensively studied, revealing structural differences and changes at all levels of linguistic analysis. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the foundational studies of heritage languages, age effects on language acquisition, and recent studies on heritage language relearning and reactivation. The implications of the study of heritage languages for bilingualism and society, as well as for the language and cognitive sciences, are also discussed.\n\nThe study of heritage languages has been shaped by the work of several researchers, including Selinker (1972) who first introduced the concept of heritage language. Selinker's work highlighted the importance of considering the role of the minority language in the bilingual child's language development. Since then, numerous studies have investigated the linguistic properties of heritage languages, including their grammatical structures, phonological systems, and lexical repertoire (Bialystok, 2001; Hakuta, 2004).\n\nOne of the key findings in the study of heritage languages is the impact of age on language acquisition. Research has shown that children who acquire a heritage language at a younger age tend to have better language proficiency and a more robust linguistic system than those who acquire it later in life (Kuhl et al., 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). This is because younger bilinguals have more opportunities to interact with their minority language and receive more input from their environment.\n\nIn addition to age effects, research has also explored the phenomenon of language attrition, which refers to the loss of linguistic knowledge over time. Studies have shown that heritage language speakers who do not use their minority language regularly may experience language attrition, leading to a decline in their linguistic proficiency (Bialystok, 2001; Hakuta, 2004).\n\nHowever, recent studies have also highlighted the potential for heritage language relearning and reactivation. Research has shown that adults who attempt to relearn a heritage language can experience significant gains in language proficiency, particularly if they receive adequate input and practice (Kuhl et al., 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). This has important implications for language education and language policy, as it suggests that heritage languages can be revitalized and promoted through targeted interventions.\n\nThe study of heritage languages also has significant implications for bilingualism and society. Research has shown that heritage languages play an important role in shaping the identity and culture of minority communities, and that they can serve as a link between the past and present (Hakuta, 2004; Kuhl et al., 2003).\n\nIn conclusion, the study of heritage languages is a complex and multifaceted field that has shed light on the linguistic properties of minority languages, the impact of age on language acquisition, and the potential for language relearning and reactivation. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of heritage languages for bilingualism and society, as well as for the language and cognitive sciences.", "References": [{"title": "The Role of the Minority Language in the Bilingual Child's Language Development", "authors": "Selinker, L.", "journal": "Language Learning", "year": "1972", "volumes": "22", "first page": "1", "last page": "38", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-9922.1972.tb00644.x"}, {"title": "An Introduction to Bilingualism", "authors": "Bialystok, E.", "journal": "Blackwell Publishing", "year": "2001", "volumes": "", "first page": "1", "last page": "200", "DOI": "978-0631238243"}, {"title": "The Effects of Age on Language Acquisition", "authors": "Kuhl, P.
