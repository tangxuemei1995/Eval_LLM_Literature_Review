{"Literature Review": "The modern nation-state has long been regarded as the primary framework for understanding language policy and planning (LPP) in postcolonial contexts. However, this perspective has been criticized for its limitations in addressing the complex historical and social dynamics of language use in Africa. This review argues that a postcolonial approach to LPP is necessary to challenge the dominant modern nation-state framework and to recognize the importance of Southern epistemologies in language studies. By examining the colonial history of LPP and its contribution to framing African multilingualisms as problems to be solved, this review aims to problematize the construct of the 'developing nation' and to advocate for a more historically and locally embedded perspective on language policy and planning.", "References": [{"title": "Language and Colonialism", "authors": "P.
