{"Literature Review": "The Altaic language family is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been the subject of extensive research in linguistics. While it is often assumed to be a single language family or phylum, recent studies have revealed that Altaic comprises five separate language families of different origins: Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, and Japonic. These language families share a common historical and areal context, with the historical homelands of the Altaic language families located in continental Northeast Asia. However, secondary expansions have brought these languages to most parts of northern and central Eurasia, including Anatolia and eastern Europe. The similarities between the individual Altaic language families are due to prolonged contacts that have resulted in both lexical borrowing and structural interaction in a number of binary patterns. For example, the Turkic and Mongolic languages have been shown to have a significant amount of lexical borrowing, with many words borrowed from each other. Similarly, the Tungusic and Koreanic languages have been found to have a number of structural similarities, including similar grammatical structures and phonological patterns. The Altaic language families have also been found to have a number of typological similarities, including similar sound systems and grammatical structures. For example, the Turkic and Mongolic languages have been found to have similar sound systems, including similar consonant and vowel phonologies. Similarly, the Tungusic and Koreanic languages have been found to have similar grammatical structures, including similar verb and noun systems. In addition to their typological similarities, the Altaic language families have also been found to have a number of historical and prehistorical similarities. For example, the Turkic and Mongolic languages have been found to have a number of loanwords from each other, indicating a significant amount of contact between the two languages. Similarly, the Tungusic and Koreanic languages have been found to have a number of similar cultural and linguistic features, indicating a significant amount of contact between the two languages. The Altaic language families have also been the subject of extensive areal linguistic analysis. For example, the work of Soviet linguist V. I. Prokofiev has shown that the Altaic language families are part of a larger areal linguistic complex, including the Uralic and Indo-European language families. Similarly, the work of American linguist Joseph Greenberg has shown that the Altaic language families are part of a larger typological complex, including the Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo language families. In conclusion, the Altaic language family is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been the subject of extensive research in linguistics. While it is often assumed to be a single language family or phylum, recent studies have revealed that Altaic comprises five separate language families of different origins. The similarities between the individual Altaic language families are due to prolonged contacts that have resulted in both lexical borrowing and structural interaction in a number of binary patterns. The Altaic language families have also been found to have a number of typological similarities, historical and prehistorical similarities, and areal linguistic similarities.", "References": [{"title": "The Altaic languages", "authors": "R.
