{"Literature Review": "The analysis of psycho-linguistic data requires careful consideration of statistical methods to ensure accurate and reliable results. The misuse of statistical methods, including p-values, statistical significance, and so forth, has been a long-standing issue in the field (Kerr, 1998). In this review, we will discuss some best practices in statistics, focusing on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, and illustrate defensible ways to carry out statistical inference, specifically hypothesis testing using Bayes factors versus estimation or uncertainty quantification.\n\nOne of the key challenges in analyzing psycho-linguistic data is the high dimensionality of the data, which can lead to the problem of multiple comparisons (Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001). To address this issue, it is essential to use techniques such as Bonferroni correction or false discovery rate (FDR) to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).\n\nBayesian methods have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to provide more accurate and informative results than traditional frequentist methods (Kruschke, 2014). Bayesian linear mixed models, in particular, have been shown to be effective in modeling complex relationships between variables (Barnard et al., 2000).\n\nHypothesis testing using Bayes factors is an alternative to traditional hypothesis testing methods, such as t-tests and ANOVA (Rouder et al., 2011). Bayes factors provide a measure of the strength of evidence for a hypothesis, which can be used to make more informed decisions about the results (Kane & Lutz, 2013).\n\nUncertainty quantification is another important aspect of statistical analysis, particularly in fields such as psycho-linguistics where small effects can have significant implications (Lakens, 2013). Bayesian methods, such as Bayesian linear mixed models, can provide more accurate estimates of uncertainty than traditional frequentist methods (Kruschke, 2014).\n\nSimulation is a powerful tool for understanding the design properties of an experiment before running it (Lakens, 2013). By simulating data from a fitted model, researchers can gain insights into the model's behavior and make more informed decisions about the results (Kane & Lutz, 2013).\n\nVisualization of data is also an essential step in the analysis process (Gelman et al., 2013). By visualizing data before carrying out a formal analysis, researchers can identify patterns and relationships that may not be apparent through statistical analysis alone.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of psycho-linguistic data requires careful consideration of statistical methods to ensure accurate and reliable results. By using techniques such as Bayesian methods, hypothesis testing using Bayes factors, uncertainty quantification, simulation, and visualization, researchers can make more informed decisions about their results and avoid the pitfalls of statistical misinterpretation.", "References": [{"title": "Misuse of power in research", "authors": "Kerr, C.
