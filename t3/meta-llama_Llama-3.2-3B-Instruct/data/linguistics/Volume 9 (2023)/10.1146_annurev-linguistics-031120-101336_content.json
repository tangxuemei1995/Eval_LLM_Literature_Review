{"Literature Review": "The actuation problem is a complex phenomenon that has been studied extensively in linguistics. It refers to the process by which a linguistic change occurs in a particular language at a particular time and space. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of actuation, focusing on the individual and population perspectives. The actuation problem is multifaceted, and responses to it have been proposed from various angles, including sound change, cognitive processing style, and agent-based modeling.", "References": [{"title": "The Actuation Problem", "authors": "Kiparisi, A.
