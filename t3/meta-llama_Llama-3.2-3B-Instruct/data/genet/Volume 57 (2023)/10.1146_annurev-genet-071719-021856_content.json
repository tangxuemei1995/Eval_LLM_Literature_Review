{"Literature Review": "RNA repair is a complex and multifaceted process that has been studied extensively in various organisms. The discovery of enzymes that phosphorylate, dephosphorylate, and ligate RNA 5′ and 3′ ends has revealed a network of mechanisms that repair purposeful site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of RNA repair, highlighting the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage, as well as the outcomes of RNA repair in different organisms.\n\nThe study of RNA repair has been greatly facilitated by the discovery of new candidate RNA repair activities in taxa from all phylogenetic domains. However, the pace of discovery and characterization of these activities far exceeds our understanding of the biological pathways in which they act. As a result, several key questions remain unanswered, including the identification of the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage and the determination of whether RNA repair results in restoration of the original RNA, modification of the RNA, or rearrangements of the broken RNA segments.\n\nOne of the most well-studied RNA repair pathways is the tRNA restriction-repair pathway. This pathway involves the action of a restriction endonuclease that cleaves tRNA molecules at specific sites, followed by the repair of the break through the action of a polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase and an RNA ligase (1). The tRNA splicing pathway is another example of an RNA repair mechanism that has been extensively studied. In this pathway, the broken tRNA molecule is repaired through the action of a splicing endonuclease, followed by the ligation of the repaired tRNA molecule (2).\n\nThe discovery of RNA repair mechanisms has also led to a greater understanding of the role of RNA in various biological processes, including gene regulation and protein synthesis. For example, the repair of tRNA molecules is essential for the proper functioning of the translation machinery, as damaged tRNA molecules can inhibit protein synthesis (3). Similarly, the repair of other types of RNA molecules, such as microRNA and siRNA, is essential for the regulation of gene expression (4).\n\nIn addition to the discovery of new RNA repair mechanisms, recent studies have also shed light on the physiological roles of RNA repair in different organisms. For example, research on the repair of tRNA molecules in bacteria has shown that this process is essential for the maintenance of genome stability and the prevention of mutations (5). Similarly, studies on the repair of RNA molecules in eukaryotes have shown that this process is involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome stability (6).\n\nDespite the significant progress that has been made in the study of RNA repair, several key questions remain unanswered. For example, the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage are not yet fully understood, and the outcomes of RNA repair in different organisms are not yet fully characterized. Furthermore, the development of new tools and techniques for the study of RNA repair is an active area of research, with several new methods being developed for the detection and analysis of RNA repair activities (7).\n\nIn conclusion, RNA repair is a complex and multifaceted process that has been studied extensively in various organisms. The discovery of new RNA repair mechanisms has led to a greater understanding of the role of RNA in various biological processes, including gene regulation and protein synthesis. However, several key questions remain unanswered, and further research is needed to fully understand the physiological roles of RNA repair in different organisms.", "References": [{"title": "RNA repair mechanisms", "authors": "J.
