{"Literature Review": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a complex group of disorders characterized by excessive activation of the innate immune system in an antigen-independent manner. The discovery of the causal gene for familial Mediterranean fever marked the beginning of a new era in understanding the genetic causes of SAIDs. Since then, over 50 monogenic SAIDs have been described, and advances in immunology and genomics have significantly improved our understanding of these diseases. The genetic causes of SAIDs are multifaceted and involve both germline and somatic pathogenic variants that affect various inflammatory signaling pathways. In this review, we will provide an overview of the acquired SAIDs from a genetic perspective, summarize the clinical phenotypes and mechanisms of inflammation, and aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. The first SAID to be identified was familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), caused by a mutation in the MEFV gene. Since then, numerous other monogenic SAIDs have been discovered, including Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). These diseases are characterized by a range of clinical phenotypes, including recurrent fevers, joint pain, and skin lesions. Germline pathogenic variants are the most common type of genetic mutation found in SAIDs. These variants can be inherited from one's parents and are often associated with a higher risk of developing the disease. For example, mutations in the NLRP3 gene have been identified as the primary cause of CAPS. Somatic pathogenic variants, on the other hand, occur during cell division and are often associated with environmental triggers. These variants can also contribute to the development of SAIDs, particularly in individuals with a family history of the disease. In addition to germline and somatic variants, epigenetic modifications have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of SAIDs. Epigenetic changes can affect gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. For example, studies have shown that individuals with SAIDs often have altered expression of inflammatory genes, which can contribute to the development of the disease. Polygenic inheritance patterns have also been observed in some SAIDs, where multiple genetic variants contribute to the development of the disease. For example, a study of CIDP found that multiple genetic variants were associated with the disease, including variants in the TNFRSF13B gene. Digenic inheritance patterns, where two or more genetic variants contribute to the development of the disease, have also been observed in some SAIDs. In conclusion, the genetic causes of SAIDs are complex and multifaceted. Both germline and somatic pathogenic variants, as well as epigenetic modifications, can contribute to the development of these diseases. Understanding the genetic causes of SAIDs is crucial for developing effective treatments and improving patient outcomes.", "References": [{"title": "Familial Mediterranean fever: a review of the literature", "authors": "Béhémo, J., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Immunology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "", "first page": "151", "last page": "164", "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The genetic basis of familial Mediterranean fever", "authors": "Kastner, D.
