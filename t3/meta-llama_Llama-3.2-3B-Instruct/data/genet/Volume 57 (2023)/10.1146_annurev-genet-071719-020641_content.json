{"Literature Review": "Comparative developmental biology has long sought to understand the mechanistic differences in embryonic development between different taxa, with a focus on how these evolutionary changes have led to morphological and organizational differences in adult body plans. However, the majority of animal lineages are defined by indirect development, where the embryo gives rise to a larval body plan and the adult forms by transformation of the larva. This review aims to discuss the importance of establishing developmental rather than morphological or ecological criteria for defining developmental mode and explicitly considering the evolutionary implications of incorporating complex life cycles into broad developmental comparisons of embryos across metazoans. By doing so, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development of complex life cycles in different animal groups.The concept of developmental mode has been a central theme in comparative developmental biology, with researchers traditionally focusing on direct-developing species where the adult form emerges directly from the embryo (e.g., [1]). However, these studies often overlook the complexities of indirect development, where the embryo gives rise to a larval body plan that is distinct from the adult form. This is particularly true for species with complex life cycles, where the larval stage can exhibit significant morphological and behavioral differences from the adult (e.g., [2]).One of the key challenges in studying complex life cycles is the difficulty in defining developmental mode. Traditional approaches have relied on morphological criteria, such as the presence or absence of specific body parts, to distinguish between direct and indirect development (e.g., [3]). However, these criteria can be misleading, as they do not account for the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that shape development (e.g., [4]). In contrast, a developmental approach considers the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive development, providing a more nuanced understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped complex life cycles.Recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering the evolutionary implications of incorporating complex life cycles into broad developmental comparisons. For example, a study on the development of sea urchins found that the larval stage plays a critical role in shaping the adult body plan, with the larva exhibiting significant morphological differences from the adult (e.g., [5]). Similarly, a study on the development of insects found that the larval stage is characterized by a distinct body plan that is distinct from the adult (e.g., [6]).In addition to the evolutionary implications, incorporating complex life cycles into broad developmental comparisons can also provide insights into the developmental biology of different animal groups. For example, a study on the development of vertebrates found that the larval stage is characterized by a distinct body plan that is distinct from the adult, with the larva exhibiting significant morphological differences from the adult (e.g., [7]). Similarly, a study on the development of invertebrates found that the larval stage plays a critical role in shaping the adult body plan, with the larva exhibiting significant morphological differences from the adult (e.g., [8]).In conclusion, the importance of establishing developmental rather than morphological or ecological criteria for defining developmental mode cannot be overstated. By considering the evolutionary implications of incorporating complex life cycles into broad developmental comparisons, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development of complex life cycles in different animal groups. This review has highlighted the need for a more nuanced approach to studying complex life cycles, one that considers the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive development.References:[1] Nieuwkoop, P.
