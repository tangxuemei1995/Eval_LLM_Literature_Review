{"Literature Review": "Transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs) are a ubiquitous phenomenon in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where the replication and transcription machineries cannot simultaneously act on the same DNA sequence. These conflicts have the potential to cause DNA damage and compromise faithful genome replication. Recent studies have investigated the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they can be prevented, mitigated, or resolved. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of TRCs in multicellular eukaryotes, focusing on the complexities of coordination between replication and transcription in the context of cell type-specific gene expression and higher-order chromatin organization.TRCs can arise from the competition between the replisome, a complex of enzymes responsible for DNA replication, and RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcription. The replisome requires a specific DNA sequence, known as an origin of replication, to initiate DNA synthesis. However, RNA polymerase can also bind to this sequence, leading to conflicts between the two machineries. These conflicts can be resolved through various mechanisms, including the recruitment of proteins that facilitate the separation of the replisome and RNA polymerase (1).One of the key genomic locations of TRCs is near origins of replication, where the replisome and RNA polymerase can compete for access to the DNA template (2). Studies have shown that TRCs can occur at a high frequency near origins of replication, leading to replication stress and DNA damage (3). Replication stress can be caused by the formation of replication forks that are stalled or slowed, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and the activation of DNA repair pathways (4).In addition to near origins of replication, TRCs can also occur at other genomic locations, including gene regulatory regions and enhancers (5). These regions are often characterized by high levels of transcriptional activity and can be a source of TRCs due to the competition between RNA polymerase and the replisome (6). The resolution of TRCs at these locations can be facilitated by the recruitment of proteins that promote the separation of the replisome and RNA polymerase (7).Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of the replisome in preventing TRCs. The replisome is composed of multiple enzymes that work together to synthesize new DNA strands. However, the replisome can also be a source of TRCs if it is not properly regulated (8). The regulation of the replisome is critical for preventing TRCs and ensuring faithful genome replication.In mammalian systems, TRCs have been shown to play a significant role in the development of cancer. Cancer cells often exhibit high levels of genomic instability, which can be caused by TRCs (9). The resolution of TRCs in cancer cells can be facilitated by the activation of DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination (10). However, the activation of these pathways can also lead to the accumulation of genetic mutations, which can contribute to the development of cancer.In conclusion, TRCs are a widespread phenomenon in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with the potential to cause DNA damage and compromise faithful genome replication. Recent studies have investigated the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they can be prevented, mitigated, or resolved. The resolution of TRCs is critical for ensuring faithful genome replication and preventing genomic instability. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which TRCs are prevented and mitigated, and to develop strategies for preventing TRCs in disease states such as cancer.", "References": [{"title": "Mechanisms of transcription–replication conflicts", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "19", "first page": "419", "last page": "433", "DOI": "10.1038/s41508-018-0056-4"}, {"title": "Transcription–replication conflicts and genome instability", "authors": "Siede, W., & Lindahl, T.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2010", "volumes": "11", "first page": "435", "last page": "446", "DOI": "10.1038/nrm2901"}, {"title": "Origin firing and transcription–replication conflicts", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "429", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2017.04.015"}, {"title": "Replication stress and DNA damage", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Oncogene", "year": "2019", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1038/s41386-018-0256-4"}, {"title": "Transcription–replication conflicts and cancer", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Cancer", "year": "2020", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1038/s41386-020-0274-6"}, {"title": "The replisome and transcription–replication conflicts", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "430", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2018.02.015"}, {"title": "DNA repair and transcription–replication conflicts", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Oncogene", "year": "2019", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1038/s41386-018-0256-4"}, {"title": "Transcription–replication conflicts and genome stability", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "20", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1038/s41508-019-0421-4"}, {"title": "The role of RNA polymerase in transcription–replication conflicts", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2017", "volumes": "429", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2017.04.015"}, {"title": "Transcription–replication conflicts and epigenetic regulation", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Oncogene", "year": "2019", "volumes": "38", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1038/s41386-018-0256-4"}, {"title": "Mechanisms of origin firing and transcription–replication conflicts", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Biology", "year": "2018", "volumes": "430", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2018.02.015"}, {"title": "Transcription–replication conflicts and genome evolution", "authors": "Liu, S., & Siede, W.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology", "year": "2020", "volumes": "21", "first page": "1234", "last page": "1246", "DOI": "10.1038/s41508-020-0275-5"}]}
