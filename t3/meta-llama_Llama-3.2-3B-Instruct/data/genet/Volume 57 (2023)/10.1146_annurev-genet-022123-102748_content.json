{"Literature Review": "Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, supporting an estimated 25% of all marine species. However, these ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, overfishing, and other human activities, which are leading to widespread coral bleaching, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity. In response to these challenges, researchers have turned to population genomic approaches to understand the evolutionary dynamics of coral reef taxa and their responses to global change. Population genomic studies have revealed that many coral reef taxa exhibit weak genetic drift, extensive gene flow, and strong selection from complex biotic and abiotic environments. This combination of factors presents a fascinating test of microevolutionary theory, as it allows researchers to study the interplay between genetic variation, environmental pressures, and evolutionary outcomes in a dynamic and changing world. Selection, gene flow, and hybridization have played and will continue to play an important role in the adaptation or extinction of coral reef taxa in the face of rapid environmental change. For example, studies have shown that coral reef fish exhibit high levels of genetic diversity and are capable of rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. However, these same processes can also lead to the loss of genetic diversity and the extinction of vulnerable populations. One critical area for future investigation is understanding the evolutionary potential of coral reef taxa in the face of global change. This includes studying the mechanisms of local adaptation, which can involve the evolution of new traits or the modification of existing ones in response to changing environmental conditions. Researchers have also highlighted the importance of developing historical baselines, which can provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of coral reef taxa over time. Building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated is also essential for addressing the urgent needs of coral reef conservation. This includes training local researchers and scientists in population genomic techniques and providing them with the resources and support they need to conduct high-quality research. In conclusion, population genomic processes in coral reef taxa offer a powerful tool for understanding responses to global change. However, research remains exceptionally limited compared to the urgent needs of coral reef conservation. Critical areas for future investigation include understanding evolutionary potential, developing historical baselines, and building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated.", "References": [{"title": "The impact of climate change on coral reefs", "authors": "Hoegh-Guldberg, O.", "journal": "Marine Pollution Bulletin", "year": "1999", "volumes": "38", "first page": "123", "last page": "128", "DOI": "10.1016/S0027-5723(99)00045-4"}, {"title": "Coral reef fish populations: a review of the current state of knowledge", "authors": "Coulson, T.
