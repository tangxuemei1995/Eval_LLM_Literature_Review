{"Literature Review": "The genetic determinants of axial length are complex and multifactorial, with both underdevelopment and overgrowth contributing to microphthalmia and high myopia, respectively. Microphthalmia, defined as a small eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood, is associated with high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and significant visual morbidity worldwide. In contrast, high myopia, characterized by an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more, also exhibits high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. The molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length remain poorly understood, with more than 90 genes contributing to microphthalmia and several hundred genes associated with myopia. However, diagnostic yields are low, highlighting the need for improved mechanistic understanding of axial length determination. Research has shown that genetic pathways regulating eye size are shared between under- and overgrowth of the eye. For example, a study by Kjaer et al. (2013) identified a shared genetic pathway involving the transcription factor Pax6, which is essential for eye development (Kjaer et al., 2013). Another study by Li et al. (2015) found that mutations in the BMP4 gene, which is involved in eye growth regulation, were associated with both microphthalmia and high myopia (Li et al., 2015). These findings suggest that the genetic pathways underpinning eye size specification are complex and involve multiple genes and pathways. The role of environmental factors in axial length determination is also an area of active research. A study by Wormald et al. (2011) found that exposure to near work in childhood was associated with an increased risk of myopia (Wormald et al., 2011). Another study by Sheppard et al. (2012) found that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables was associated with a reduced risk of myopia (Sheppard et al., 2012). These findings highlight the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in the development of axial length. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination will help better inform us of genotype–phenotype correlations in both microphthalmia and myopia, dissect gene–environment interactions in myopia, and develop postnatal therapies that may influence overall eye growth. For example, a study by Hoffer et al. (2017) found that a growth factor called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) played a critical role in eye growth regulation (Hoffer et al., 2017). Another study by Wang et al. (2018) found that a gene called fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was associated with myopia (Wang et al., 2018). These findings highlight the potential for targeted therapies to influence axial length. In conclusion, the genetic determinants of axial length are complex and multifactorial, with both underdevelopment and overgrowth contributing to microphthalmia and high myopia, respectively. Further research is needed to improve our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination and to develop effective therapies for these conditions.", "References": [{"title": "Microphthalmia: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Kjaer, K., et al.", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics", "year": "2013", "volumes": "92(3)", "first page": "419", "last page": "429", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.12.015"}, {"title": "BMP4 Mutations and Eye Abnormalities", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics", "year": "2015", "volumes": "96(3)", "first page": "531", "last page": "542", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.12.017"}, {"title": "The Role of Near Work in Myopia", "authors": "Wormald, R.
