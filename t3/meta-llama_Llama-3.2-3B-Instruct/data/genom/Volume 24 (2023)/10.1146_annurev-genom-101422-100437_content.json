{"Literature Review": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) analysis has revolutionized the field of gene regulation by enabling the examination of the relationship between gene expression and genetic variants at the single-cell level. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have made it possible to analyze sc-eQTLs across many individuals, providing unprecedented insights into the transcriptional states of individual cells. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of sc-eQTL research, including experimental designs, methodologies, modeling approaches, and technical challenges. We will also discuss the potential applications of sc-eQTL analysis in understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease and identifying new therapeutic targets.", "References": [{"title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals cell-type-specific gene expression programs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells", "authors": "Parker, N.
