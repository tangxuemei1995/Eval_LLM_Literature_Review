{"Literature Review": "RNA Crossing Membranes: Systems and Mechanisms Contextualizing Extracellular RNA and Cell Surface GlycoRNAs\n\nThe subcellular localization of a biopolymer often informs its function. RNA is traditionally confined to the cytosolic and nuclear spaces, where it plays critical and conserved roles across nearly all biochemical processes. Our recent observation of cell surface glycoRNAs may further explain the extracellular role of RNA. While cellular membranes are efficient gatekeepers of charged polymers such as RNAs, a large body of research has demonstrated the accumulation of specific RNA species outside of the cell, termed extracellular RNAs (exRNAs).\n\nAcross various species and forms of life, protein pores have evolved to transport RNA across membranes, thus providing a mechanistic path for exRNAs to achieve their extracellular topology. Here, we review types of exRNAs and the pores capable of RNA transport to provide a logical and testable path toward understanding the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.\n\nExtracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are a diverse group of RNA molecules that are released from cells and can be found in various bodily fluids, including blood, saliva, and urine. They have been implicated in intercellular communication, immune responses, and the regulation of various physiological processes (1, 2). The main types of exRNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small RNAs (sRNAs), which are released through different mechanisms, such as exocytosis, apoptosis, and cell lysis (3, 4).\n\nCell surface glycoRNAs, on the other hand, are a specific type of exRNA that is attached to the cell surface via glycosylation. They have been shown to play a crucial role in cell signaling, immune responses, and the regulation of various cellular processes (5, 6). The biogenesis of cell surface glycoRNAs involves the attachment of glycan moieties to the RNA molecule, which is mediated by glycosyltransferases (7).\n\nThe transport of exRNAs across cellular membranes is a complex process that involves the action of protein pores. These pores are composed of transmembrane proteins that form channels in the cell membrane, allowing charged molecules, such as RNAs, to pass through (8). The most well-studied protein pores involved in RNA transport are the connexin channels, which are gap junctions that allow for direct cell-to-cell communication (9).\n\nIn addition to connexin channels, other protein pores have been implicated in RNA transport, including the aquaporin channels, which are involved in the transport of water and small molecules across the cell membrane (10). The RNA-binding protein, AON1, has also been shown to facilitate RNA transport across the cell membrane by binding to specific RNA sequences (11).\n\nThe regulation of exRNA transport is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple factors, including protein pores, RNA-binding proteins, and post-translational modifications. The biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs are likely to involve similar mechanisms, with the attachment of glycan moieties and the transport of the RNA molecule across the cell membrane being critical steps in their formation (12).\n\nIn conclusion, the transport of exRNAs across cellular membranes is a complex process that involves the action of protein pores. The biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs are likely to involve similar mechanisms, with the attachment of glycan moieties and the transport of the RNA molecule across the cell membrane being critical steps in their formation. Further research is needed to fully understand the systems and mechanisms involved in the transport of exRNAs and the regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Valente et al. (2018).
