{"Literature Review": "Long-read DNA sequencing has revolutionized the field of genomics, enabling the analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA in human genomes. Recent advances in long-read sequencing (LRS) have overcome the limitations of short-read technology, which has been the primary tool for DNA sequencing for decades. Short-read technology, with read lengths of 100–300 bp, has been unable to sequence large DNA fragments, making it challenging to analyze large structural variation and repetitive DNA. In contrast, LRS permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. This has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions, which are a hallmark of human genomes. Furthermore, LRS has recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. The addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling has further expanded the capabilities of LRS, promising to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations. In this literature review, we will discuss the recent advances and remaining challenges of LRS, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field of genomics and our understanding of human genetics.", "References": [{"title": "Long-read sequencing enables the discovery of rare pathogenic structural variants in human genomes", "authors": "Li, Q., et al.
