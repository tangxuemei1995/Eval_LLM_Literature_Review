{"Literature Review": "Padlock probe–based targeted in situ sequencing has revolutionized the field of spatially resolved transcriptomics by enabling the acquisition of gene expression profiles at cellular resolution while maintaining tissue architecture. This technique has been instrumental in the development of spatial cell atlases, studies of cell–cell interactions, and in situ cell typing. In this review, we provide an overview of the methods and applications of padlock probe–based in situ sequencing, highlighting recent developments in methodological and computational tools, as well as its compatibility with other methods and integration with multiomic platforms.", "References": [{"title": "Padlock probe–based in situ sequencing for spatially resolved transcriptomics", "authors": "Liu, Y., et al.
