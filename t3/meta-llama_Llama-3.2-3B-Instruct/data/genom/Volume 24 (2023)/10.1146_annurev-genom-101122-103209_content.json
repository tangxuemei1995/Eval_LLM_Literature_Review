{"Literature Review": "The return of genomic results in research has become a pressing issue in the field of genomics, with various guidelines and regulations emphasizing the importance of respecting participants' autonomy, reciprocity, and interests in health and privacy. The increasing use of large-scale and whole genome sequencing has led to the identification of numerous variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. However, despite these guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article aims to analyze the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.The concept of return of results in genomics has been extensively discussed in the literature. A study by Khoury et al. (2013) highlights the importance of return of results in genomics, emphasizing the need for researchers to provide participants with their interpreted results and raw data. The authors argue that return of results is essential for respecting participants' autonomy and promoting reciprocity in research (Khoury et al., 2013). Another study by National Academy of Medicine (2017) emphasizes the importance of return of results in genomics, highlighting the need for researchers to provide participants with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner.The guidelines for return of results in genomics have been developed by various organizations, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG). The NIH guidelines emphasize the importance of return of results in genomics, highlighting the need for researchers to provide participants with their interpreted results and raw data (NIH, 2018). The ASHG guidelines also emphasize the importance of return of results in genomics, highlighting the need for researchers to provide participants with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner (ASHG, 2019).In addition to the guidelines, various laws and regulations also govern the return of results in genomics. The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires entities covered by the law to provide participants' raw genomic data on request (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2013). The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also requires entities to provide participants with their raw genomic data on request (European Union, 2016).Despite these guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. A study by Burke et al. (2017) highlights the challenges faced by researchers in implementing return of results in genomics, including the need for adequate resources and infrastructure. The authors argue that researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner (Burke et al., 2017).Another study by Khoury et al. (2018) emphasizes the importance of return of results in genomics, highlighting the need for researchers to provide participants with their interpreted results and raw data in a way that is accessible and understandable. The authors argue that researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner (Khoury et al., 2018).The concept of secondary findings in genomics has also been extensively discussed in the literature. A study by Khoury et al. (2013) highlights the importance of secondary findings in genomics, emphasizing the need for researchers to identify and report incidental findings (Khoury et al., 2013). The authors argue that researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner.In conclusion, the return of genomic results in research has become a pressing issue in the field of genomics. The guidelines and regulations governing return of results in genomics emphasize the importance of respecting participants' autonomy, reciprocity, and interests in health and privacy. However, despite these guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. Researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner.The return of genomic results in research is not only an ethical issue but also a legal one. The laws and regulations governing return of results in genomics, such as HIPAA and GDPR, require entities to provide participants' raw genomic data on request. Researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner.In order to ensure that researchers provide participants with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner, it is essential to develop and implement effective policies and procedures. A study by Burke et al. (2017) highlights the importance of developing and implementing effective policies and procedures for return of results in genomics (Burke et al., 2017). The authors argue that researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner.In addition to developing and implementing effective policies and procedures, researchers must also prioritize the needs of participants. A study by Khoury et al. (2018) emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the needs of participants in return of results in genomics (Khoury et al., 2018). The authors argue that researchers must prioritize the needs of participants and provide them with their interpreted results and raw data in a timely and transparent manner.The concept of incidental findings in genomics has also been extensively discussed in the literature.
