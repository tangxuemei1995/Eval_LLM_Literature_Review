{"Literature Review": "The unfunded public pension obligations of state and local governments in the United States pose a significant challenge to their financial sustainability. As of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of these plans are $1.076 trillion, with a market value of approximately $6.501 trillion (1). This represents a funding ratio of 82.5% under a traditional valuation method, which falls to 43.8% under a market-based valuation (2). The discrepancy between the reported and market values of the unfunded liability is largely due to the elevated assumed discount rates used in the valuation, which are based on expected returns and remain above risk-free rates despite a decline since 2014 (3). Furthermore, the yearly pension cost for newly accruing liabilities is also understated due to the same discount rate assumptions (4). To mitigate these issues, pension funds have increasingly accumulated large exposure to risky assets, particularly alternative investments, in an effort to achieve high returns (5). However, this approach results in highly uncertain investment returns, which can exacerbate the unfunded liability problem (6). In order to address these challenges, policymakers and actuaries have proposed various solutions, including increasing the contribution rates of current employees, reducing benefit formulas, and implementing more aggressive investment strategies (7). Additionally, some states have opted to adopt hybrid pension plans, which combine elements of defined benefit and defined contribution plans (8). Despite these efforts, the trend of increasing unfunded liabilities remains a pressing concern for state and local governments, with significant implications for their long-term financial sustainability (9). In this review, we will examine the current trends and challenges facing state and local pension funds, with a focus on the implications of market-based valuations and the role of alternative investments in exacerbating the unfunded liability problem.", "References": [{"title": "Public Pension Funding in the United States", "authors": "Harrison, A.
