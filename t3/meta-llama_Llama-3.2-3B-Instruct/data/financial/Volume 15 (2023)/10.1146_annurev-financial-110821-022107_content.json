{"Literature Review": "The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique challenge to the global financial system, with many countries experiencing a sharp decline in economic activity and financial market upheaval. Despite these challenges, the resilience of the financial system has been remarkable, and this article seeks to understand the factors that contributed to this resilience. A key factor has been the swift and decisive policy actions of major central banks in response to the pandemic-induced crisis. This literature review examines the role of monetary and financial policies in maintaining financial stability during the pandemic, and highlights the unintended consequences of prolonged monetary policy support and targeted regulation.", "References": [{"title": "Monetary policy and financial stability: A review of the literature", "authors": "Gertler, M.
