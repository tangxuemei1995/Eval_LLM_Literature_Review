{"Literature Review": "Fiscal capacity has long been a topic of interest in the field of macroeconomics, with various studies exploring its implications for fiscal policy. The concept of fiscal capacity refers to the ability of governments to implement fiscal policies without incurring excessive costs or risks. In recent years, researchers have employed modern tools from asset pricing to re-examine the relationship between fiscal capacity and aggregate risk. This literature review aims to synthesize the existing knowledge on fiscal capacity from an asset pricing perspective, highlighting the importance of accounting for aggregate risk in estimating fiscal capacity.", "References": [{"title": "The Term Structure of Interest Rates and Fiscal Policy", "authors": "Kurz, C.
