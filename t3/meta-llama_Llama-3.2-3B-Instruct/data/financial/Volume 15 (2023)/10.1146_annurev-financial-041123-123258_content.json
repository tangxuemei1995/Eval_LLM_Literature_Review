{"Literature Review": "The principles of financial economics provide valuable insights into the optimal choice of discount rates for both public and private sector decision-makers. However, most governments largely ignore these principles, adopting a cost of capital that is often not reflective of the true borrowing rate. This article reviews the arguments in support of status quo discounting practices, as well as the counterarguments to them. A key aspect of this debate is the choice between several methodologies for risk adjustment, and the practical and conceptual reasons that favor a fair value approach are discussed. The limitations of a financial economics approach become apparent for decisions involving very long time horizons, such as for climate policies. For policies with long-term impacts, intergenerational concerns become paramount, and projections of cash flows and discount rates become highly uncertain. Present value calculations are an intrinsically unreliable measure of value, and no approach to discount rate selection can overcome these problems. Alternative decision criteria need to be established to address these challenges. However, most government investments involve much shorter horizons, and the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare. In this context, the fair value approach emerges as a promising alternative to traditional budgetary accounting methods. By adopting a fair value approach, governments can better reflect the true value of their investments and make more informed decisions about resource allocation. The social discount rate is a critical component of this approach, and its selection is influenced by a range of factors, including the time horizon of the investment, the level of risk, and the discount rate used. In this review, we examine the arguments in support of the social discount rate, as well as the counterarguments to them. We also discuss the limitations of a financial economics approach and the need for alternative decision criteria. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering the social discount rate in government decision-making, particularly for investments with long-term impacts. By adopting a fair value approach and considering the social discount rate, governments can make more informed decisions about resource allocation and improve social welfare.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Discount Rate: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "B.
