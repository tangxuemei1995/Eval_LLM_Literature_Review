{"Literature Review": "The selection of a social discount rate is a critical component of project and policy evaluation, as it has a first-order effect on social welfare. Governments allocate a significant share of real and financial capital globally, and their choices of discount rates have far-reaching implications for public investment and policy decision-making. The importance of adopting a principles-based approach to selecting discount rates has new urgency in light of the very long horizons over which the benefits and costs of policies to address climate change are being evaluated. This literature review provides an overview of the theoretical, practical, legal, and philosophical considerations for discount rate selection by governments, highlighting the common threads that emerge across the four articles in this theme.", "References": [{"title": "The Social Discount Rate: A Review of the Literature", "authors": "Bartlett, C.
