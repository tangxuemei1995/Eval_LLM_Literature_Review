{"Literature Review": "Rhodopsin, the photoreceptor in human rod cells responsible for dim-light vision, is a member of the large superfamily of G proteinâ€“coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate signal transduction in response to diverse diffusible ligands. The high level of sequence conservation within the transmembrane helices of the visual receptors and the family A GPCRs has long been considered evidence for a common pathway for signal transduction. This review aims to summarize recent studies that reveal a comprehensive mechanism for how light absorption by the retinylidene chromophore drives rhodopsin activation and highlight those features of the mechanism that are conserved across the ligand-activated GPCRs. The structure of rhodopsin has been extensively studied, and it is known that the protein consists of seven transmembrane helices (TMHs) that form a pore through which the retinylidene chromophore is embedded. The chromophore is formed by the covalent attachment of a 11-cis retinal molecule to the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr) at position 186 of the rhodopsin protein. Upon light absorption, the 11-cis retinal molecule isomerizes to the 11-trans configuration, which triggers a conformational change in the rhodopsin protein. This conformational change activates the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, which involves the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein. The activated G protein then activates downstream signaling molecules, such as adenylyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increase in cAMP levels triggers a series of downstream signaling events that ultimately lead to the transmission of visual signals to the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the transmembrane helices in rhodopsin activation. The TMHs are thought to play a crucial role in the conformational change that occurs upon light absorption. The TMHs are also involved in the binding of the G protein to the rhodopsin protein. The binding of the G protein to the rhodopsin protein triggers the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein, which activates the GPCR signaling pathway. In addition to the conserved features of the rhodopsin mechanism, recent studies have also highlighted the importance of non-conserved features. The non-conserved features of the rhodopsin mechanism include the specific amino acid residues that are involved in the binding of the G protein to the rhodopsin protein. These residues are thought to play a crucial role in the specificity of the G protein binding. In conclusion, the mechanism of rhodopsin activation is a complex process that involves the conformational change of the rhodopsin protein upon light absorption. The high level of sequence conservation within the transmembrane helices of the visual receptors and the family A GPCRs suggests that the rhodopsin mechanism is conserved across ligand-activated GPCRs. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of both conserved and non-conserved features of the rhodopsin mechanism, and have provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying visual signal transduction.", "References": [{"title": "Structure and function of rhodopsin", "authors": "Nakanishi, K., Shichida, H., & Yoshida, T.", "journal": "Annual Review of Biochemistry", "year": "2003", "volumes": "72", "first page": "357", "last page": "381", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.1202.000434"}, {"title": "The rhodopsin gene", "authors": "Khorana, H.
