{"Literature Review": "The Expanded Central Dogma: Genome Resynthesis, Orthogonal Biosystems, Synthetic Genetics\n\nSynthetic biology has revolutionized the way we approach the study of biological systems, shifting the focus from deconstruction to construction. This paradigm shift has opened up new avenues for understanding the fundamental aspects of biological form and function, and has enabled the development of novel approaches to answering long-standing biological questions. In this review, we will explore the various aspects of this synthesis paradigm, with a focus on genome resynthesis, synthetic genetics, and the elaboration of orthogonal biosystems and components.\n\nGenome resynthesis, also known as genome reconstruction, is the process of reassembling a genome from its constituent parts. This can be achieved through the use of synthetic nucleotides, such as XNA (Xenon Nucleic Acid), which are designed to mimic the structure and function of natural nucleotides (1). The use of XNA has enabled the creation of novel genomes that can be used to study the fundamental principles of life (2).\n\nSynthetic genetics, on the other hand, refers to the expansion of the genetic alphabet, the genetic code, and the chemical make-up of genetic systems. This can be achieved through the introduction of unnatural base pairs, such as 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylthymine, which can be used to modify the genetic code (3). The use of unnatural base pairs has enabled the creation of novel genetic systems that can be used to study the fundamental principles of life (4).\n\nOrthogonal biosystems, also known as orthogonal genetic systems, are genetic systems that are designed to be independent of each other. This can be achieved through the use of novel nucleotides, such as 2'-fluorouridine, which can be used to create novel genetic systems (5). The use of orthogonal genetic systems has enabled the creation of novel biological pathways that can be used to study the fundamental principles of life (6).\n\nThe elaboration of orthogonal biosystems and components is a key aspect of synthetic biology. This involves the design and construction of novel genetic systems that can be used to study the fundamental principles of life. The use of orthogonal genetic systems has enabled the creation of novel biological pathways that can be used to study the fundamental principles of life (7).\n\nIn conclusion, the synthesis paradigm has revolutionized the way we approach the study of biological systems. The use of genome resynthesis, synthetic genetics, and orthogonal biosystems has enabled the creation of novel biological pathways that can be used to study the fundamental principles of life. These approaches have vast opportunities for the exploitation of biological processes to provide solutions for global problems.\n\nReferences:\n", "References": [{"title": "Synthetic Biology: An Introduction", "authors": "R.
