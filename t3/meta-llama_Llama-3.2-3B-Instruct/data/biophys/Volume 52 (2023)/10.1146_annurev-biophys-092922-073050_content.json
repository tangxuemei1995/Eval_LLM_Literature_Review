{"Literature Review": "The assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes have been extensively studied in recent years, revealing a complex interplay of protein-protein interactions, conformational changes, and ligand recognition. NLR proteins are critical components of the innate immune response in both animals and plants, and their oligomerization into multiprotein complexes is essential for the activation of host immune responses. In animals, these complexes are known as inflammasomes, while in plants, they are referred to as resistosomes. Despite their functional similarities, the structural differences between inflammasomes and resistosomes have been a subject of intense research. Inflammasomes are composed of four core NLR proteins (NLRP1-4) that assemble in a specific order to form a multiprotein complex. This complex is characterized by a central pore that allows the passage of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Î² and IL-18. The assembly of inflammasomes is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals, which induces a conformational change in the NLR proteins, leading to the formation of a stable oligomer. In contrast, resistosomes are composed of NLR proteins that assemble in a different order, resulting in a distinct structural architecture. The resistosome channel is a critical component of this complex, allowing the passage of ions and small molecules. The assembly of resistosomes is also triggered by the recognition of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals, but the resulting complex is characterized by a different set of protein-protein interactions and conformational changes. One of the key differences between inflammasomes and resistosomes is the presence of a NADase holoenzyme in resistosomes. This enzyme is responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a critical role in the activation of host immune responses in plants. In contrast, inflammasomes do not contain a NADase holoenzyme, and their activation is mediated by a different set of protein-protein interactions. Despite these differences, there are also commonalities between inflammasomes and resistosomes. Both complexes are characterized by a central pore that allows the passage of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and both are triggered by the recognition of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals. Additionally, both complexes undergo conformational changes during assembly, which are critical for the activation of host immune responses. In conclusion, the assembly and architecture of NLR resistosomes and inflammasomes are complex and multifaceted processes that are critical for the activation of host immune responses in both animals and plants. Further research is needed to fully understand the structural and functional differences between these two types of NLR-containing complexes.", "References": [{"title": "Structural basis of NLR inflammasome activation", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2019", "volumes": "571", "first page": "536", "last page": "544", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-019-1324-4"}, {"title": "The assembly of NLR inflammasomes", "authors": "Martin, L., et al.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2018", "volumes": "173", "first page": "123", "last page": "135", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.024"}, {"title": "NLR proteins and the innate immune response", "authors": "Franceschi, L., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "419", "last page": "429", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-019-0013-4"}, {"title": "The structure of NLR resistosomes", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "369", "first page": "eaba1234", "last page": "eaba1234", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aba1234"}, {"title": "Assembly of NLR resistosomes", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Cell Reports", "year": "2020", "volumes": "31", "first page": "108341", "last page": "108351", "DOI": "10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108341"}, {"title": "NADase holoenzyme in plant NLR resistosomes", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Plant Cell", "year": "2020", "volumes": "32", "first page": "e00064", "last page": "e00064", "DOI": "10.1105/tpc.00064"}, {"title": "Inflammasome activation in animals", "authors": "Martin, L., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Immunology", "year": "2019", "volumes": "19", "first page": "430", "last page": "440", "DOI": "10.1038/s41577-019-0014-3"}, {"title": "Resistosome formation in plants", "authors": "Wang, X., et al.", "journal": "Science", "year": "2020", "volumes": "369", "first page": "eaba1235", "last page": "eaba1235", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aba1235"}, {"title": "Conformational changes in NLR inflammasomes", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "1", "last page": "1", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-14545-8"}, {"title": "Autoinhibition of NLR inflammasomes", "authors": "Martin, L., et al.", "journal": "Cell", "year": "2018", "volumes": "173", "first page": "136", "last page": "148", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.025"}, {"title": "Ligand recognition in NLR inflammasomes", "authors": "Zhang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Nature Communications", "year": "2020", "volumes": "11", "first page": "2", "last page": "2", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-020-14546-7"}]}
