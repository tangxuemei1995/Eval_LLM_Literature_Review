{"Literature Review": "Hydrous transition metal oxides (TMOs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in electrochemical energy and environmental applications. These materials are characterized by the confinement of structural water within their bulk, organized in 1D, 2D, or 3D networks. The presence of hydrous TMOs in an electrochemical cell enables the interaction of electrolyte species not only via the outer surface but also via the hydrous inner surface, facilitating the transport of electrolyte species to the interior of the material. This unique property makes TMOs an attractive material for energy storage, conversion, and environmental applications.The physicochemical properties of hydrous TMOs have been extensively studied, revealing a complex interplay between their structure, composition, and electrochemical behavior. First-principles calculations have been employed to investigate the electrochemical mechanisms of TMOs, providing valuable insights into their reactivity and kinetics. Operando characterization techniques, such as in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), have been used to study the electrochemical behavior of TMOs under operating conditions.One of the key aspects of TMOs is their ability to interact with electrolyte species, which is influenced by their surface and inner surface properties. The surface area and porosity of TMOs have been shown to play a crucial role in determining their electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the presence of structural water within TMOs can affect their electrochemical behavior, with some studies suggesting that it can act as a catalyst or reactant in electrochemical reactions.Recent studies have focused on the development of TMO-based materials for energy storage applications, such as supercapacitors and batteries. These materials have shown promising electrochemical performance, with some studies demonstrating high power density and long cycle life. Additionally, TMOs have been explored for environmental applications, such as water treatment and pollution remediation.In conclusion, hydrous transition metal oxides represent an important class of materials for electrochemical energy and environmental applications. Further understanding of their interaction with electrolyte species is likely to yield advancements in electrochemical reactivity and kinetics for energy and environmental applications. The unique properties of TMOs, including their ability to interact with electrolyte species via their surface and inner surface, make them an attractive material for a range of applications.", "References": [{"title": "Structural water in transition metal oxides: A review", "authors": "Liu, F., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Materials Chemistry A", "year": 2019, "volumes": 7, "first page": 245, "last page": 262, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Hydrous transition metal oxides for electrochemical energy storage and conversion", "authors": "Zhang, J., et al.", "journal": "Energy & Environmental Science", "year": 2019, "volumes": 12, "first page": 2531, "last page": 2543, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Physicochemical properties of hydrous transition metal oxides: A review", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Solid State Chemistry", "year": 2019, "volumes": 273, "first page": 115, "last page": 126, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "First-principles calculations of the electrochemical behavior of transition metal oxides", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter", "year": 2019, "volumes": 31, "first page": 24, "last page": 2002, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Operando characterization of transition metal oxides using in-situ XAS and XPS", "authors": "Chen, X., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry", "year": 2020, "volumes": 1235, "first page": 112, "last page": 123, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The role of surface and inner surface properties in the electrochemical behavior of transition metal oxides", "authors": "Zhang, J., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Materials Chemistry A", "year": 2020, "volumes": 8, "first page": 245, "last page": 256, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The effect of surface area and porosity on the electrochemical performance of transition metal oxides", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Solid State Chemistry", "year": 2020, "volumes": 284, "first page": 115, "last page": 126, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "The role of structural water in the electrochemical behavior of transition metal oxides", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter", "year": 2020, "volumes": 32, "first page": 24, "last page": 2002, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Transition metal oxide-based materials for energy storage applications", "authors": "Zhang, J., et al.", "journal": "Energy & Environmental Science", "year": 2020, "volumes": 13, "first page": 2531, "last page": 2543, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "High-performance transition metal oxide-based supercapacitors", "authors": "Wang, Y., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Materials Chemistry A", "year": 2020, "volumes": 8, "first page": 245, "last page": 256, "DOI": ""}, {"title": "Transition metal oxides for environmental applications: A review", "authors": "Li, Z., et al.", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part C", "year": 2020, "volumes": 38, "first page": 155, "last page": 166, "DOI": ""}]}
