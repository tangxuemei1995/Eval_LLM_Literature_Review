{"Literature Review": "Piezoelectric composites have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their versatility and potential to overcome the limitations of traditional piezoelectric materials. The ability to combine different piezoelectric materials into a composite allows for the creation of well-rounded properties, such as improved flexibility, high electromechanical coupling, and piezoelectric coefficients. This review aims to provide an overview of the different types of connectivity classes, important design considerations, and theoretical models used in piezoelectric composites. A focus will be placed on ferroelectric ceramics and polymer-based composites, highlighting their contributions to the development of piezoelectric composites.The concept of piezoelectric composites dates back to the 1960s, when researchers began exploring the potential of combining piezoelectric materials with other materials to enhance their properties. Since then, significant progress has been made in the development of piezoelectric composites, with a growing number of applications in various fields, including medical ultrasound imaging and therapy, underwater acoustic sensing, industrial structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.One of the key advantages of piezoelectric composites is their ability to combine the flexibility of polymers with the high electromechanical coupling and piezoelectric coefficients of ferroelectric ceramics or single crystals. This is achieved through the use of different connectivity classes, which determine the distribution of piezoelectric materials within the composite. The three main connectivity classes are serial, parallel, and perpendicularly aligned.Design considerations play a crucial role in the development of piezoelectric composites. Factors such as the type and amount of piezoelectric materials, the type of matrix material, and the connectivity class must be carefully considered to achieve optimal properties. Theoretical models, such as the Hill-Mandelbrot model, have been developed to predict the properties of piezoelectric composites.Ferroelectric ceramics have been widely used in the development of piezoelectric composites due to their high electromechanical coupling and piezoelectric coefficients. However, their high cost and brittleness have limited their use in some applications. Polymer-based composites, on the other hand, offer a more flexible and cost-effective alternative. Researchers have explored the use of various polymer matrices, including polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyurethane (PU), to develop piezoelectric composites.In conclusion, piezoelectric composites have emerged as a promising class of materials with a wide range of applications. Their ability to combine the flexibility of polymers with the high electromechanical coupling and piezoelectric coefficients of ferroelectric ceramics or single crystals makes them an attractive alternative to traditional piezoelectric materials. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of piezoelectric composites and to develop new materials with improved properties.", "References": [{"title": "Piezoelectric composite materials", "authors": "S.
