{"Literature Review": "Grain boundary migration in polycrystals is a complex phenomenon that has garnered significant attention in recent years. The migration of grain boundaries is driven by the reduction of excess energy in the material, and it plays a crucial role in determining the microstructure and properties of polycrystalline materials. However, the factors governing boundary migration in bicrystals have been found to be insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of grain boundary migration in polycrystals, based on simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations, as well as continuum scale simulations and high-energy diffraction microscopy observations. The atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration have been extensively studied using simulations. These studies have shown that grain boundary migration is driven by the movement of atoms across the boundary, which reduces the excess energy in the material. The migration process is influenced by factors such as the composition of the boundary, the temperature, and the strain rate. However, the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals is not solely determined by the curvature of the boundary, as has been previously suggested. Instead, it is likely that other factors, such as the interaction between the boundary and the surrounding grains, play a crucial role. At the continuum scale, grain boundary migration has been studied using simulations and observations using high-energy diffraction microscopy. These studies have shown that grain boundary migration is influenced by factors such as the grain size, the grain shape, and the crystal orientation. However, the current simulations of grain growth are insufficient for reproducing experimental observations, possibly because of an inadequate representation of the driving force. This highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms of grain boundary migration in polycrystals. Experimental observations of grain boundary migration in polycrystals have been limited, but they have provided valuable insights into the phenomenon. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations have shown that grain boundary migration is accompanied by the formation of new grain boundaries and the coarsening of existing ones. These observations have been supported by simulations, which have shown that grain boundary migration is driven by the movement of atoms across the boundary. Despite the progress made in understanding grain boundary migration in polycrystals, there is still much to be learned. Further research is needed to determine the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals and to develop simulations that can accurately reproduce experimental observations. This review highlights the need for detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations of migration in polycrystals, rather than bicrystals. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of grain boundary migration and develop new materials with improved properties. In conclusion, grain boundary migration in polycrystals is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a range of factors. While the factors governing boundary migration in bicrystals are insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals, further research is needed to determine the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals. The development of simulations that can accurately reproduce experimental observations is also crucial for understanding the mechanisms of grain boundary migration.", "References": [{"title": "Atomic and molecular mechanisms of grain boundary migration", "authors": "Mishin, Y.
