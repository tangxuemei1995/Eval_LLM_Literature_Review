{"Literature Review": "The quest for sustainable materials has led to a surge in research on polymers derived from biological matter. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, as well as the emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter. We discuss the applications of sustainable polymers in bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials, and highlight the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing life-cycle impacts and socioeconomic challenges.", "References": [{"title": "Microbial production of polyhydroxyalkanoates: A review", "authors": "Liu, Y., Zhang, Y., & Zhang, X.
