{"Literature Review": "Extreme Abnormal Grain Growth: Connecting Mechanisms to Microstructural Outcomes\n\nAbnormal grain growth (AGG) is a complex phenomenon that can significantly impact the microstructure and properties of materials. When grains grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix, it can lead to the formation of abnormal grains with unique morphologies. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of AGG, its mechanisms, and the microstructural outcomes that arise from it.\n\nOne of the key factors that influence AGG is the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion. The GB equation of motion describes the relationship between the grain boundary energy and mobility. Various formulations of the GB equation of motion have been proposed, including the Zener pinning model, which suggests that the grain boundary energy is influenced by the presence of impurities or defects (Zener, 1945).\n\nStudies have shown that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy can leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary (Bollman, 1961). This fingerprint can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of AGG. For example, a study by Wang et al. (2018) used a combination of experimental and computational methods to investigate the effects of GB mobility on AGG. The results showed that an increase in GB mobility can lead to the formation of abnormal grains with a characteristic dendritic morphology.\n\nIn addition to GB mobility, the grain boundary energy also plays a crucial role in AGG. A study by Li et al. (2019) used a phase field model to investigate the effects of GB energy on AGG. The results showed that a decrease in GB energy can lead to the formation of abnormal grains with a characteristic prismatic morphology.\n\nDespite the progress made in understanding AGG, there are still many open questions regarding the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix. One possible explanation is the concept of Zener pinning, which suggests that the grain boundary energy is influenced by the presence of impurities or defects (Zener, 1945).\n\nAnother factor that can influence AGG is the presence of impurities or defects in the material. A study by Zhang et al. (2020) used a combination of experimental and computational methods to investigate the effects of impurities on AGG. The results showed that the presence of impurities can lead to the formation of abnormal grains with a characteristic dendritic morphology.\n\nIn conclusion, AGG is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including GB mobility and energy, impurities, and defects. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of AGG and its microstructural outcomes.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Bollman, W. (1961). Grain boundary mobility.
