{"Literature Review": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have been extensively studied for their potential to influence crystal morphology and control during crystal growth from solutions. However, their utility in melt-grown molecular crystals has been largely underexplored. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the role of TMAs in melt crystallization, highlighting the importance of thermodynamic parameters such as undercooling and the impact of diffusion on growth kinetics. This review aims to illustrate the current state of knowledge on the use of TMAs in melt-grown molecular crystals, with a focus on their influence on crystal morphology, nucleation, and enantioselective surface recognition. We will discuss the key differences between solution and melt crystallization, and explore the implications of these differences for the design and application of TMAs in melt-grown molecular crystals. In solution, the crystal growth driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium. This driving force is responsible for the formation of well-faceted single crystals with stereochemical richness, as observed in solution growth. In contrast, growth from melts is governed by undercooling, which is the thermodynamic parameter responsible for crystallization outcomes. Undercooling is a key difference between solution and melt crystallization, and it can influence the manner in which TMAs affect growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. Studies have shown that TMAs can exert their influence on well-faceted single crystals with stereochemical richness observed in solution growth, particularly when the crystallization driving force in a melt is small and diffusion is comparatively high. In these conditions, TMAs can bind to crystal surfaces through stereo-chemical recognition, influencing the growth kinetics and morphology of the crystal. However, under high supercooling, where the driving force is large, ensembles of crystals can grow radially, masking stereochemical information and requiring new optical tools for understanding the influence of TMAs on emerging crystals. The use of TMAs in melt-grown molecular crystals has also been shown to influence the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals, which are characteristic of certain polymers and pharmaceuticals. Spherulites are spherical aggregates of crystals that can form through the growth of radially oriented crystals, while twisted crystals are characterized by a helical arrangement of crystal axes. The formation of these crystal morphologies can have significant implications for the properties and performance of materials. In addition to their influence on crystal morphology, TMAs have also been shown to affect the enantioselective surface recognition of crystals, which is critical for the formation of chiral materials. Enantioselective surface recognition refers to the ability of a crystal surface to recognize and bind to specific enantiomers of a molecule. This recognition can influence the formation of chiral crystals, which are essential for the production of pharmaceuticals and other chiral materials. In conclusion, the use of tailor-made additives in melt-grown molecular crystals is a rapidly evolving field that holds significant promise for the control of crystal morphology and the formation of chiral materials. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of TMAs in melt crystallization, but the current state of knowledge suggests that TMAs can exert a significant influence on crystal growth kinetics, morphology, nucleation, and enantioselective surface recognition.", "References": [{"title": "Crystal growth and morphology", "authors": "Müller, U., & Meier, M.", "journal": "In Crystal Growth and Morphology (pp. 1-20).
