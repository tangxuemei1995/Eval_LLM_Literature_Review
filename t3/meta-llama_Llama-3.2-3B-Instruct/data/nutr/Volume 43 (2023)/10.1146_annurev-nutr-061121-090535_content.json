{"Literature Review": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in deciphering diet-disease relationships has revolutionized the field of dietary sciences. The increasing prevalence of cardiometabolic and noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders, has led to a pressing need for personalized nutrition approaches. Recent advances in AI analytics have enabled the development of precision nutrition concepts that can bridge the gaps between experimental results and clinical practice. This review highlights selected case studies at the intersection of diet-disease research and AI, discussing their potential and challenges, and offering an outlook toward the transformation of dietary sciences into individualized clinical translation.\n\nThe role of AI in deciphering diet-disease relationships can be attributed to its ability to analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Neural networks, a type of machine learning algorithm, have been widely used in dietary sciences to analyze complex data sets and identify relationships between diet and disease (1). For instance, a study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that a neural network-based approach was able to identify specific dietary patterns associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (2).\n\nAnother area of application of AI in dietary sciences is in the analysis of dietary reporting data. Traditional methods of dietary assessment, such as food diaries and 24-hour recalls, have been shown to be prone to errors and biases (3). AI-powered tools, on the other hand, can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be apparent through traditional methods. For example, a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that an AI-powered tool was able to accurately assess dietary intake and identify areas for improvement (4).\n\nIn addition to analyzing data, AI can also be used to develop personalized nutrition recommendations. By analyzing an individual's genetic profile, dietary habits, and lifestyle factors, AI can provide tailored recommendations for improving health outcomes (5). For instance, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that an AI-powered tool was able to provide personalized nutrition recommendations that improved cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes (6).\n\nDespite the potential of AI in deciphering diet-disease relationships, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the need for high-quality data, which can be difficult to obtain, especially in resource-poor settings (7). Additionally, there is a need for more research on the validity and reliability of AI-powered tools in dietary sciences (8). Furthermore, there is a need for more transparency and explainability in AI decision-making processes, as well as more robust testing and validation of AI-powered tools (9).\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of AI in deciphering diet-disease relationships has the potential to revolutionize the field of dietary sciences. However, more research is needed to address the challenges and limitations of AI-powered tools. By working together, researchers, clinicians, and policymakers can develop more effective and personalized nutrition approaches that improve health outcomes and reduce the burden of diet-related diseases.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
