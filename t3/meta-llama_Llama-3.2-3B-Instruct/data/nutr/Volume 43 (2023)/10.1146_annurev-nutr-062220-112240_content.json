{"Literature Review": "Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a multifunctional family of proteins that play a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism, lipid transport, and systemic metabolism. The ten mammalian FABPs, including AIBP (also known as FABP1), FABP2, FABP3, FABP4, FABP5, FABP6, FABP7, FABP8, FABP9, and FABP12, have been extensively studied for their tissue-specific expression patterns and highly conserved tertiary structures. Initially, FABPs were thought to be primarily involved in intracellular fatty acid transport, but subsequent research has revealed their participation in lipid metabolism, both directly and via regulation of gene expression, and in signaling within their cells of expression (1, 2). Furthermore, evidence suggests that FABPs may be secreted and have functional impacts via the circulation (3, 4). The ligand binding repertoire of FABPs extends beyond long-chain fatty acids, and their functional properties also involve participation in systemic metabolism (5, 6). This review aims to summarize the current understanding of FABP functions and their apparent roles in metabolic and inflammation-related disorders and cancers.", "References": [{"title": "Fatty acid-binding proteins: a multifunctional family of proteins involved in lipid metabolism and disease", "authors": "L.
