{"Literature Review": "Precision nutrition has emerged as a promising approach to reduce chronic disease risk through dietary guidance. However, the hype surrounding precision nutrition has led to concerns about the adequacy of evidentiary standards for population-based guidance. As dietary guidance shifts from preventing deficiency disorders to chronic disease risk reduction, the biology supporting such guidance becomes increasingly complex due to the multifactorial risk profile of disease and inherent population heterogeneity in the dietâ€“disease relationship. This review aims to examine the current state of precision nutrition, its limitations, and the evidentiary standards needed to inform public health recommendations for prevention of chronic disease.\n\nA key challenge in precision nutrition is establishing essential nutrient needs throughout the life cycle in both health and disease. Research has shown that individual responses to nutrients and other food substances can vary significantly due to genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors (1, 2). For example, a study by Johnson et al. (3) found that genetic variations in the FADS1 gene were associated with differences in fatty acid metabolism and risk of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, a study by Wang et al. (4) found that dietary patterns were associated with changes in gut microbiota and metabolic health in older adults.\n\nConsidering the effects of nutrients and other food substances on metabolic, immunological, inflammatory, and other physiological responses supporting healthy aging is crucial for precision nutrition. Research has shown that certain nutrients and food substances can have beneficial effects on aging-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline (5, 6). For example, a study by Krikorian et al. (7) found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with improved cognitive function in older adults. However, the optimal levels and forms of these nutrients are not yet well established.\n\nAnother critical aspect of precision nutrition is considering healthy eating behaviors. Research has shown that dietary patterns and eating habits can have a significant impact on chronic disease risk (8, 9). For example, a study by Pan et al. (10) found that a Mediterranean-style diet was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.\n\nIn conclusion, precision nutrition holds great promise for reducing chronic disease risk through dietary guidance. However, the hype surrounding precision nutrition has led to concerns about the adequacy of evidentiary standards for population-based guidance. Further research is needed to establish the optimal levels and forms of nutrients and food substances, as well as to consider the effects of nutrients and other food substances on metabolic, immunological, inflammatory, and other physiological responses supporting healthy aging. Additionally, healthy eating behaviors should be considered in population-based guidance to reduce chronic disease risk.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Johnson et al. (2019).
