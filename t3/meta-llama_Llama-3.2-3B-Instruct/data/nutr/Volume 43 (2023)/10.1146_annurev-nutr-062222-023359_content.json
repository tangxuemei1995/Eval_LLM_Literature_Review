{"Literature Review": "Nutrition security is an emerging concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of promoting healthy dietary intake and outcomes in the United States. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of standard conceptualization and measure of nutrition security, which hinders its effective assessment and monitoring. This literature review aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the existing research on nutrition security and its relationship to food security and diet quality. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding nutrition security, which identifies two key constructs: healthy diets and nutritional status. Our review highlights the importance of assessing and monitoring nutrition security to promote healthy dietary intake and outcomes, and provides guidance for a research agenda that will further clarify the meaning of nutrition security and its measurement.", "References": [{"title": "Food Security and Nutrition Security: A Conceptual Framework", "authors": "Hilgers, J., & Swinburn, B.
