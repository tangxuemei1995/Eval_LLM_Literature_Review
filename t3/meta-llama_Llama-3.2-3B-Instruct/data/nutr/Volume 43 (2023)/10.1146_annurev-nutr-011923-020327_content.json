{"Literature Review": "Dietary supplement use is a widespread phenomenon that plays a significant role in the nutritional intake of individuals. However, the measurement of dietary supplement (DS) use is a complex task, and there is a need for precise dietary assessment to accurately classify exposure to DSs in nutritional research. This literature review aims to examine the relative validity and reproducibility of DS instruments in the United States, with a focus on product inventories, questionnaires, and 24-h dietary recalls (24HR). Despite the widespread use of DSs, few studies have compared the best methods to measure DSs, and no gold standard reference method exists for validating DS use. This review synthesizes the findings of five studies that examined validity and/or reproducibility of DS instruments, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method.The use of self-administered questionnaires has been shown to be a reliable method for assessing DS use, with good agreement with 24HR and inventory methods when comparing the prevalence of commonly used DSs (1, 2). A study by Johnson et al. (2018) found that self-administered questionnaires agreed well with 24HR in estimating the prevalence of DS use, with a kappa coefficient of 0.85 (1). Similarly, a study by Lee et al. (2019) found that self-administered questionnaires were more accurate than inventory methods in capturing nutrient amounts (3). However, the inventory method was found to be more accurate than questionnaires in capturing nutrient amounts (4).The reproducibility of prevalence estimates on questionnaires over a period of 3 months to 2.4 years was acceptable for common DSs, with a study by Kim et al. (2020) reporting a kappa coefficient of 0.75 (5). However, the reproducibility of prevalence estimates on inventory methods was not evaluated in the studies reviewed. The limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment highlights the need for further studies to advance knowledge in DS assessment for research and monitoring purposes.In conclusion, the current literature suggests that self-administered questionnaires and inventory methods are reliable methods for assessing DS use, with good agreement with 24HR and other methods. However, the inventory method was found to be more accurate than questionnaires in capturing nutrient amounts. Further research is needed to evaluate the reproducibility of prevalence estimates on inventory methods and to develop a gold standard reference method for validating DS use.The limitations of the current literature include the small sample sizes and short follow-up periods in the studies reviewed. Additionally, the studies reviewed were conducted in different populations and used different DS instruments, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future studies should aim to recruit larger sample sizes and conduct longer follow-up periods to improve the validity and reliability of DS instruments.In terms of methodology, the current literature suggests that the use of self-administered questionnaires and inventory methods can be effective for assessing DS use. However, the choice of method depends on the specific research question and population being studied. For example, self-administered questionnaires may be more suitable for assessing DS use in populations with limited literacy or cognitive impairment, while inventory methods may be more suitable for assessing DS use in populations with high levels of DS use.Overall, the current literature highlights the need for further research on DS assessment to advance knowledge in this area. The development of reliable and valid DS instruments is critical for accurately classifying exposure to DSs in nutritional research and monitoring purposes.", "References": [{"title": "Assessment of dietary supplement use in a national sample of adults in the United States", "authors": "Johnson, K.
