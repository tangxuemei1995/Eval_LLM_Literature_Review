{"Literature Review": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a complex process that involves the coordinated regulation of iron metabolism in the mother, placenta, and fetus. During pregnancy, the demand for iron increases significantly to support the expansion of maternal red blood cells, the development of the placenta, and fetal growth. However, excessive iron supplementation has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of iron homeostasis during pregnancy.Iron deficiency is a significant public health concern during pregnancy, with an estimated 30% of pregnant women worldwide suffering from iron deficiency anemia (1). The consequences of iron deficiency can be severe, including increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal anemia (2). Therefore, iron supplementation is a common practice before and during pregnancy, particularly in high-risk populations.The regulation of iron homeostasis is mediated by the hormone hepcidin, which plays a crucial role in iron metabolism (3). Hepcidin regulates iron absorption from the gut, iron recycling from macrophages, and iron export from enterocytes (4). During pregnancy, hepcidin levels decrease, leading to increased iron absorption and mobilization from storage sites (5). However, excessive hepcidin has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth restriction and maternal anemia (6).The placenta is a critical site of iron homeostasis during pregnancy, with the placental transferrin receptor playing a key role in iron transfer from the mother to the fetus (7). The placenta also regulates iron metabolism through the expression of hepcidin and other iron-regulatory proteins (8). Dysregulation of placental iron homeostasis has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth restriction and preterm birth (9).Fetal iron homeostasis is also critical during pregnancy, with the fetus requiring significant amounts of iron for growth and development (10). The fetus acquires iron from the mother through the placenta, and dysregulation of fetal iron homeostasis has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight and maternal anemia (11).Inflammation is a significant regulator of iron homeostasis during pregnancy, with inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 modulating hepcidin expression and iron metabolism (12). Chronic inflammation during pregnancy has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight (13).In conclusion, iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a complex process that involves the coordinated regulation of iron metabolism in the mother, placenta, and fetus. Dysregulation of iron homeostasis can have significant consequences for maternal and fetal health, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of iron homeostasis during pregnancy.", "References": [{"title": "Iron deficiency anaemia", "authors": "World Health Organization", "journal": "", "year": 2018, "volumes": "", "first page": "", "last page": "", "DOI": "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/iron-deficiency-anaemia"}, {"title": "Iron deficiency anaemia", "authors": "Allen, L.
