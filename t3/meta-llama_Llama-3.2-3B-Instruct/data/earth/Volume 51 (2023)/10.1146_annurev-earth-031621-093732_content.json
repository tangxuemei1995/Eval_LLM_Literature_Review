{"Literature Review": "River deltas and sea-level rise pose a significant threat to coastal ecosystems and human settlements. The impact of sea-level changes on these landforms is complex and influenced by various factors, including sediment supply, subsidence rates, and vertical land motion. This review aims to summarize the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE. We will discuss improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, as well as significant advancements in morphodynamic delta models. However, substantial uncertainties remain, particularly on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also pose major challenges to model validation. In this review, we will examine the current understanding of river delta response to sea-level change, including the effects of different sea-level and sediment supply histories, the impact of modern sea-level rise, and the role of regional sea-level projections and uncertainty sources. We will also discuss the implications of these findings for river delta management and adaptation strategies.", "References": [{"title": "Holocene sea-level change and its impact on river deltas", "authors": "Hanson, S., & Dupont, A.
