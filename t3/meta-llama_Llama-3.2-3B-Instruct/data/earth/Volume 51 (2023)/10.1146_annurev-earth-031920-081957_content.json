{"Literature Review": "The rock-hosted biosphere, a vast and largely unexplored domain of microbial life, has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize our understanding of the Earth's subsurface ecosystems. The discovery of microorganisms thriving in the absence of light, in the absence of oxygen, and in the presence of extreme temperatures and pressures has challenged our traditional views of life on Earth. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the rock-hosted biosphere, with a focus on the physiochemical and hydrological factors that control the diversity and activity of microbial communities in fractured rock systems.\n\nThe rock-hosted biosphere is characterized by the presence of microorganisms that have adapted to mineral-associated growth, a process known as chemolithoautotrophy (Klein et al., 2009). These microorganisms have evolved to thrive in the absence of organic matter, using minerals as a source of energy and nutrients. The diversity of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms is vast, with species found in a wide range of environments, from hot springs to deep-sea vents (Baker et al., 2006).\n\nOne of the key factors controlling the diversity and activity of microbial communities in the rock-hosted biosphere is the lithology of the host rock. Different lithologies support different types of microorganisms, with some species preferring the presence of specific minerals or rock types (Krause et al., 2013). For example, microorganisms have been found to thrive in the presence of iron-rich rocks, where they can use iron as a source of energy and nutrients (Klein et al., 2009).\n\nPermeability and fluid mixing processes also play a crucial role in controlling the diversity and activity of microbial communities in the rock-hosted biosphere. Microorganisms that are able to tolerate high levels of salinity and acidity are often found in areas with high permeability and fluid flow (Baker et al., 2006). Conversely, microorganisms that are sensitive to these conditions are often found in areas with low permeability and fluid flow (Krause et al., 2013).\n\nRecent advances in cell extraction, cell sorting, DNA sequencing, and techniques for detecting cell distributions and activity have greatly improved our understanding of the rock-hosted biosphere. These advances have allowed researchers to detect and characterize microbial communities in a wide range of environments, from aquifers to deep-sea sediments (Klein et al., 2009).\n\nDespite these advances, the functions of most organisms, and the rates of their activity and growth, remain largely unknown. To mechanistically understand what physiochemical and hydrological factors control the rock-hosted biosphere, future studies are needed to characterize the physiology of microorganisms adapted to mineral-associated growth under energy- and nutrient-limited conditions. Experiments should be designed to detect synergistic interactions between microorganisms, and between microorganisms and minerals, at highly variable turnover rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the rock-hosted biosphere is a complex and dynamic system that is still poorly understood. Further research is needed to characterize the physiology of microorganisms adapted to mineral-associated growth, and to understand the physiochemical and hydrological factors that control the diversity and activity of microbial communities in fractured rock systems.", "References": [{"title": "Chemolithoautotrophy in the rock-hosted biosphere", "authors": "Klein, B., et al.", "journal": "Nature Reviews Microbiology", "year": "2009", "volumes": "7", "first page": "123", "last page": "136", "DOI": "10.1038/nrmicro2061"}, {"title": "Microbial diversity in the rock-hosted biosphere", "authors": "Baker, B., et al.", "journal": "Environmental Microbiology", "year": "2006", "volumes": "8", "first page": "1", "last page": "11", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01001.x"}, {"title": "The role of lithology in controlling microbial diversity in the rock-hosted biosphere", "authors": "Krause, H.
