{"Literature Review": "Ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is a complex process that has garnered significant attention in the field of plate tectonics. The strength of lithospheric plates is a central component of plate tectonics, governed by brittle processes in the shallow portion of the plate and ductile behavior in the deeper portion. Olivine, the main mineral in the upper mantle and thus the lithosphere, deforms by four major mechanisms: low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS), and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep). These mechanisms are responsible for the ductile deformation of olivine, which is a critical component of understanding the lithospheric mantle. The deformation mechanisms of olivine have been extensively studied experimentally. Low-temperature plasticity is characterized by the deformation of olivine at temperatures below 500째C, where the mineral deforms by the movement of dislocations. Dislocation creep is a mechanism of deformation that occurs at higher temperatures, where the movement of dislocations is facilitated by the presence of impurities or defects in the crystal structure. Dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (GBS) is a mechanism of deformation that occurs at temperatures between 500째C and 900째C, where the movement of dislocations along grain boundaries is facilitated by the presence of impurities or defects in the crystal structure. Diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (diffusion creep) is a mechanism of deformation that occurs at temperatures above 900째C, where the movement of dislocations along grain boundaries is facilitated by the diffusion of impurities or defects in the crystal structure. Observations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions. The flow laws of olivine have been extensively studied experimentally, and the results have been used to constrain the deformation mechanisms of olivine in the lithospheric mantle. However, geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere than observations of naturally deformed rocks. The causes of this discrepancy are unresolved but likely reside in the uncertainty surrounding processes in the brittle-ductile transition, at which the lithosphere is strongest. The brittle-ductile transition is a critical component of understanding the lithospheric mantle. This transition occurs when the lithosphere is subjected to increasing stress, causing it to deform from a brittle to a ductile state. The brittle-ductile transition is characterized by a significant increase in the strength of the lithosphere, as the mineral becomes more resistant to deformation. However, the exact mechanisms that govern the brittle-ductile transition are not well understood, and further research is needed to constrain the deformation mechanisms of olivine in this region. In conclusion, the ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is a complex process that is governed by the deformation mechanisms of olivine. The four major mechanisms of deformation - low-temperature plasticity, dislocation creep, dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and diffusion-accommodated grain-boundary sliding - are responsible for the ductile deformation of olivine. Observations of naturally deformed rocks are consistent with extrapolation of olivine flow laws from experimental conditions, but geophysical observations predict a weaker lithosphere than observations of naturally deformed rocks. Further research is needed to constrain the deformation mechanisms of olivine in the brittle-ductile transition and to understand the causes of the discrepancy between geophysical observations and observations of naturally deformed rocks.", "References": [{"title": "Burov, E.
