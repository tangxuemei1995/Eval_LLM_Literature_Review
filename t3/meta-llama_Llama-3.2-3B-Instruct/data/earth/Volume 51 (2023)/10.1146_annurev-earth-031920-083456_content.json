{"Literature Review": "The concept of solar geoengineering has gained significant attention in recent years as a potential means to mitigate the effects of climate change. One of the primary concerns with solar geoengineering is its potential impact on the hydrological cycle. The expected hydrological effects of reducing insolation are among the most uncertain and consequential impacts of solar geoengineering (SG) (Lenton et al., 2019). This uncertainty is largely due to the complexity of the Earth's hydrological system and the non-linear nature of the relationships between solar radiation, atmospheric circulation, and precipitation patterns (Hartmann et al., 2013). Theoretical frameworks from broader climate science can help explain SG's effects on global precipitation, relative humidity, and other aspects of hydroclimate (Boucher et al., 2018). However, the state of the knowledge on hydrological impacts of SG is unevenly concentrated among regions, with some studies focusing on the effects of SG on precipitation patterns in specific regions (Calvo et al., 2019) while others examine the global implications of SG on the hydrological cycle (Lenton et al., 2019). Projected hydrological impacts from SG are scenario dependent and difficult to characterize as either harmful or beneficial (Boucher et al., 2018). For instance, a study by Calvo et al. (2019) found that SG could lead to increased precipitation in some regions, while reducing it in others. This variability in projected hydrological impacts highlights the need for further research into the effects of SG on regional hydrological patterns. In addition, the social and economic implications of SG must be taken into account, as the distribution of benefits and costs will depend on assumptions about underlying social conditions and objectives of intervention (Lenton et al., 2019). Ultimately, the literature on the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of geoengineering demonstrates that its implications for human welfare will depend on a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between solar radiation, atmospheric circulation, and precipitation patterns. To reduce decision-relevant uncertainties in this novel field of Earth science inquiry, further research is needed to better understand the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering.", "References": [{"title": "A new Earth Engineering Science: Designing a Safe and Sustainable Future", "authors": "T.
