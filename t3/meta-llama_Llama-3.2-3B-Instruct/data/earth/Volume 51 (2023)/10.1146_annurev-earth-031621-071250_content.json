{"Literature Review": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) is a pivotal event in Earth's history, with significant implications for our understanding of the carbon cycle and atmospheric oxygenation. The excursion, spanning approximately 130-250 million years, is characterized by a large magnitude (+5 to +30‰) positive carbon isotope excursion in carbonate rocks. This event has been attributed to various mechanisms, including large nutrient fluxes, an increase in the size of the biosphere, and a reorganization of the global carbon cycle. However, the debate surrounding the genesis, synchroneity, and global extent of the LJE remains unresolved. Research has shown that the LJE may not have been globally synchronous, with some evidence suggesting local rather than global changes in δ13CDIC. This raises the possibility of asynchronous, local excursions, which would have significant implications for our understanding of the carbon cycle and atmospheric oxygenation. For example, a study found that local δ13C-enrichment in the LJE was facies-dependent, suggesting that the excursion may have been driven by local factors rather than global changes. The LJE has also been linked to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a period of significant oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, the relationship between the LJE and the GOE is still not fully understood, with some studies suggesting that the LJE may have occurred before the GOE. Furthermore, the timing and duration of the LJE are still a subject of debate, with some studies suggesting that the excursion may have been shorter-lived than previously thought. In addition to the mechanisms driving the LJE, research has also focused on the geochemical and paleoenvironmental context of the excursion. A study found that the LJE was associated with a significant increase in the size of the biosphere, which would have had significant implications for the carbon cycle and atmospheric oxygenation. However, other studies have suggested that the LJE may have been driven by local factors, such as changes in ocean chemistry or the formation of new oceanic crust. Despite the significant progress made in understanding the LJE, there is still much to be learned about this pivotal event in Earth's history. Further research is needed to resolve the debate surrounding the genesis, synchroneity, and global extent of the LJE, as well as to better understand the mechanisms driving this excursion. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of the LJE is critical for reconstructing biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric oxygenation through Earth history.", "References": [{"title": "Local δ13C-enrichment in the Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion: A facies-dependent phenomenon", "authors": "Holland, H.
