{"grounding": "Space-mounted robotics is becoming increasingly mainstream for many space missions. The aim of this article is threefold: first, to give a broad and quick overview of the importance of spacecraft-mounted robotics for future in-orbit servicing missions; second, to review the basic current approaches for modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic systems; and third, to introduce some new developments in terms of modeling and control of spacecraft-mounted robotic manipulators using the language of hypercomplex numbers (dual quaternions). Some outstanding research questions and potential future directions in the field are also discussed.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the advancements in spacecraft-mounted robotics, focusing on manipulators for in-orbit servicing. It discusses the control and trajectory tracking of robotic arms using dual quaternions, which offer a compact and efficient representation of rigid body motion. The dynamics and kinematics of these systems are analyzed to enhance precision and reliability in space operations, ensuring effective maintenance and assembly tasks. Simulation results and experimental validations are presented to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed methods.", "label": 0}
