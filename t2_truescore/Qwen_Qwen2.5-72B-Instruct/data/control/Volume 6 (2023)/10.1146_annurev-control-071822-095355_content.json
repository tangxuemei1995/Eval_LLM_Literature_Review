{"grounding": "Approximately 1.1. billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, and assistive technology has the potential to increase their overall quality of life. However, the end users\u2019 perspective and needs are often not sufficiently considered during the development of this technology, leading to frustration and nonuse of existing devices. Since its first competition in 2016, CYBATHLON has aimed to drive innovation in the field of assistive technology by motivating teams to involve end users more actively in the development process and to tailor novel devices to their actual daily-life needs. Competition tasks therefore represent unsolved daily-life challenges for people with disabilities and serve the purpose of benchmarking the latest developments from research laboratories and companies from around the world. This review describes each of the competition disciplines, their contributions to assistive technology, and remaining challenges in the user-centered development of this technology.", "generated_text": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a pivotal platform for advancing assistive technologies, fostering innovation through user-centered design. This paper examines how the competition has catalyzed the development of technologies that address the daily-life challenges faced by people with disabilities. By bringing together engineers, scientists, and users, CYBATHLON promotes a collaborative approach that ensures the practicality and usability of assistive devices. The competition's focus on real-world tasks has led to significant improvements in prosthetics, exoskeletons, and brain-computer interfaces, enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Moreover, CYBATHLON has raised public awareness and advocated for greater inclusion, highlighting the potential of technology to empower and support diverse user needs. This review underscores the competition's role in driving technological advancements and its broader impact on society.", "label": 1}
