{"grounding": "Gradient-based methods have been widely used for system design and optimization in diverse application domains. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in studying theoretical properties of these methods in the context of control and reinforcement learning. This article surveys some of the recent developments on policy optimization, a gradient-based iterative approach for feedback control synthesis that has been popularized by successes of reinforcement learning. We take an interdisciplinary perspective in our exposition that connects control theory, reinforcement learning, and large-scale optimization. We review a number of recently developed theoretical results on the optimization landscape, global convergence, and sample complexityof gradient-based methods for various continuous control problems, such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), \n\n control, risk-sensitive control, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, and output feedback synthesis. In conjunction with these optimization results, we also discuss how direct policy optimization handles stability and robustness concerns in learning-based control, two main desiderata in control engineering. We conclude the survey by pointing out several challenges and opportunities at the intersection of learning and control.", "generated_text": "This paper aims to establish a theoretical foundation for policy optimization methods in the context of learning control policies, a critical aspect of reinforcement learning (RL). Policy optimization algorithms, which iteratively improve policies by adjusting parameters based on performance feedback, have shown significant success in complex control tasks. However, the theoretical underpinnings that explain their effectiveness and convergence properties remain underdeveloped. We address this gap by integrating concepts from feedback control synthesis, a well-established field in control theory, to provide a rigorous analysis of policy optimization. Specifically, we derive conditions under which policy optimization algorithms can guarantee convergence to optimal policies, and we explore the implications of these conditions for the design of more robust and efficient RL algorithms. Our theoretical framework not only enhances the understanding of existing methods but also paves the way for the development of novel algorithms that can better handle the challenges of real-world control problems.", "label": 0}
