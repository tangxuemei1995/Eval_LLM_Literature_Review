{"grounding": "Early research on physical human\u2013robot interaction (pHRI) has necessarily focused on device design\u2014the creation of compliant and sensorized hardware, such as exoskeletons, prostheses, and robot arms, that enables people to safely come in contact with robotic systems and to communicate about their collaborative intent. As hardware capabilities have become sufficient for many applications, and as computing has become more powerful, algorithms that support fluent and expressive use of pHRI systems have begun to play a prominent role in determining the systems\u2019 usefulness. In this review, we describe a selection of representative algorithmic approaches that regulate and interpret pHRI, describing the progression from algorithms based on physical analogies, such as admittance control, to computational methods based on higher-level reasoning, which take advantage of multimodal communication channels. Existing algorithmic approaches largely enable task-specific pHRI, but they do not generalize to versatile human\u2013robot collaboration. Throughout the review and in our discussion of next steps, we therefore argue that emergent embodied dialogue\u2014bidirectional, multimodal communication that can be learned through continuous interaction\u2014is one of the next frontiers of pHRI.", "generated_text": "This study explores the mechanisms and effectiveness of embodied communication in human\u2013robot collaboration, focusing on how physical interaction enhances communication and cooperation between humans and robots. Through a series of experiments involving assistive robots in various assistive tasks, we investigated how different forms of physical interaction, such as guiding, pushing, and pulling, influence the efficiency and quality of communication. Results indicate that embodied communication significantly improves task performance and user satisfaction, as it allows for more intuitive and natural interaction. The study also highlights the importance of designing robots with the capability to interpret and respond to physical cues, which can lead to more seamless and effective human\u2013robot collaboration. These findings have implications for the development of assistive robots in healthcare, manufacturing, and domestic settings, where physical interaction is a critical component of the human\u2013robot relationship.", "label": 0}
