{"grounding": "Electric power systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from fossil fuel\u2013based power plants to low-inertia systems that rely predominantly on power electronics and renewable energy resources. This article reviews the resulting control challenges and modeling fallacies, at both the device and system level, and focuses on novel aspects or classical concepts that need to be revised in light of the transition to low-inertia systems. To this end, we survey the literature on modeling of low-inertia systems, review research on the control of grid-connected power converters, and discuss the frequency dynamics of low-inertia systems. Moreover, we discuss system-level services from a control perspective. Overall, we conclude that the system-theoretic mindset is essential to bridge different research communities and understand the complex interactions of power electronics, electric machines, and their controls in large-scale low-inertia power systems.", "generated_text": "This paper addresses the challenges and solutions for controlling low-inertia power systems, which are increasingly prevalent due to the high penetration of renewable energy sources and power electronics-based devices. The study explores advanced control strategies, including grid-forming control and dynamic virtual power plant (VPP) approaches, to enhance system stability and reliability. Grid-forming control is evaluated for its ability to emulate synchronous generator behavior, while dynamic VPPs are investigated for their potential to aggregate and manage distributed energy resources effectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these control methods in maintaining frequency and voltage stability, even under significant disturbances. The findings contribute to the development of robust control frameworks essential for the transition to more sustainable and resilient power systems.", "label": 1}
