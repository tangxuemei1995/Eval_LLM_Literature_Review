{"grounding": "This review aims to present recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems. A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the modeling and control of crowd dynamics in multiagent systems, focusing on the interaction and coordination of autonomous vehicles. By employing the mean-field limit approach, we analyze the behavior of large-scale interacting agent systems, where each agent follows predefined rules and interacts with its neighbors. The study introduces a feedback control mechanism to manage the collective behavior, ensuring stability and efficiency in the system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in mitigating congestion and improving flow in various scenarios, including urban traffic and pedestrian movements. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent transportation systems and crowd management solutions, highlighting the potential of mean-field theory in optimizing multiagent systems.", "label": 0}
