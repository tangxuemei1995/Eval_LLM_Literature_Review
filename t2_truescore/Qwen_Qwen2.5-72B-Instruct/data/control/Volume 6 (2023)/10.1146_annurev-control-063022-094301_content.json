{"grounding": "Embodiment is a crucial concept for the autonomy and adaptivity of systems working in the physical world with high degrees of uncertainty and complexity. The physical bodies of autonomous adaptive systems heavily influence the information flow from the environment to the central processing (and vice versa), requiring us to consider the full triad of brain, body, and environment to investigate intelligent behavior. This article provides a structured review of embodied intelligence with a special emphasis on the concept of timescales and their role in self-organization and the emergence of complex behavior. We classify embodied interactions into three types\u2014cross-timescale matching, separation, and nontemporal sequences\u2014and discuss how these interactions were studied in the past as well as how they can contribute to the systematic investigation of complex autonomous and adaptive systems in both biological and artificial entities.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of embodiment in the development of autonomous adaptive systems, focusing on the intricate cross-timescale interactions that underpin embodied intelligence. By integrating principles from bioinspired robotics, we investigate how physical morphology and sensorimotor capabilities influence the adaptive behaviors of these systems. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-scale temporal dynamics, from fast sensory-motor loops to slower learning and evolutionary processes, in achieving robust and flexible autonomy. Through a series of simulations and robotic experiments, we demonstrate that carefully designed embodied systems can effectively navigate complex, dynamic environments, showcasing the potential of bioinspired approaches in advancing the field of autonomous adaptive systems.", "label": 0}
