{"grounding": "Deleterious mutations decrease reproductive fitness and are ubiquitous in genomes. Given that many organisms face ongoing threats of extinction, there is interest in elucidating the impact of deleterious variation on extinction risk and optimizing management strategies accounting for such mutations. Quantifying deleterious variation and understanding the effects of population history on deleterious variation are complex endeavors because we do not know the strength of selection acting on each mutation. Further, the effect of demographic history on deleterious mutations depends on the strength of selection against the mutation and the degree of dominance. Here we clarify how deleterious variation can be quantified and studied in natural populations. We then discuss how different demographic factors, such as small population size, nonequilibrium population size changes, inbreeding, and gene flow, affect deleterious variation. Lastly, we provide guidance on studying deleterious variation in nonmodel populations of conservation concern.", "generated_text": "Deleterious mutations pose significant challenges to the genetic health and long-term viability of natural populations, particularly in the context of conservation biology. This study employs simulations to explore the accumulation and purging of deleterious variants in various population structures, emphasizing the role of genetic load and inbreeding depression. Results indicate that small, isolated populations are particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, leading to reduced fitness and increased extinction risk. However, moderate levels of gene flow can mitigate these effects by facilitating the purging of deleterious alleles. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in conservation efforts to enhance the resilience of endangered species. Implications for management strategies, such as genetic rescue and habitat restoration, are discussed.", "label": 1}
