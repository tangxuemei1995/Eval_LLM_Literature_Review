{"grounding": "Over the past three decades, coronavirus (CoV) diseases have impacted humans more than any other emerging infectious disease. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has resulted in huge economic disruptions and loss of human lives. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was found to mutate more rapidly due to sustained transmission in humans and potentially animals, resulting in variants of concern (VOCs) that threaten global human health. However, the primary difficulties are filling in the current knowledge gaps in terms of the origin and modalities of emergence for these viruses. Because many CoVs threatening human health are suspected to have a zoonotic origin, identifying the animal hosts implicated in the spillover or spillback events would be beneficial for current pandemic management and to prevent future outbreaks. In this review, wesummarize the animal models, zoonotic reservoirs, and cross-species transmission of the emerging human CoVs. Finally, we comment on potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOCs and the new SARS-CoV-2 recombinants currently under investigation.", "generated_text": "Emerging human-infecting coronaviruses (CoVs) pose significant public health threats, often originating from zoonotic reservoirs and crossing species barriers through complex mechanisms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of animal models in understanding the biology and transmission dynamics of these viruses. We highlight the importance of bats, rodents, and various domestic and wild animals as potential reservoirs, emphasizing the role of recombination events in generating novel viral strains. The use of animal models, including mice, ferrets, and non-human primates, has been crucial in elucidating viral pathogenesis, immune responses, and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Surveillance strategies are discussed, focusing on the identification of high-risk interfaces where cross-species transmission is most likely to occur. Understanding these processes is essential for developing effective prevention and control measures to mitigate the impact of future zoonotic outbreaks.", "label": 1}
