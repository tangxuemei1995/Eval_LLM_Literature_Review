{"grounding": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-lived rodents with a maximum life span exceeding 37 years. They exhibit a delayed aging phenotype and resistance to age-related functional decline/diseases. Specifically, they do not display increased mortality with age, maintain several physiological functions until nearly the end of their lifetime, and rarely develop cancer and Alzheimer's disease. NMRs live in a hypoxic environment in underground colonies in East Africa and are highly tolerant of hypoxia. These unique characteristics of NMRs have attracted considerable interest from zoological and biomedical researchers. This review summarizes previous studies of the ecology, hypoxia tolerance, longevity/delayed aging, and cancer resistance of NMRs and discusses possible mechanisms contributing to their healthy aging. In addition, we discuss current issues and future perspectives to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed aging and resistance to age-related diseases in NMRs.", "generated_text": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a unique rodent species that exhibits exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases, including cancer. This review highlights the key biological mechanisms that contribute to the naked mole-rat's healthy aging, such as enhanced DNA repair, protein stability, and antioxidant defenses. The social structure of naked mole-rats, characterized by a eusocial organization, also plays a crucial role in their longevity and health. Additionally, their ability to tolerate hypoxic conditions provides insights into metabolic adaptations that may be harnessed to improve human healthspan. By elucidating these mechanisms, the naked mole-rat serves as a valuable model for understanding the genetic and environmental factors that promote healthy aging and could inform the development of therapeutic strategies to extend human longevity.", "label": 1}
