{"grounding": "Talpid moles and spotted hyenas have become the paradigms of anatomical and behavioral female masculinization. Females of many mole species develop ovotestes that produce testosterone, show external genitalia that resemble that of males, and close their vaginal orifice after every estrus, and female spotted hyenas lack an external vaginal orifice and develop a pseudoscrotum and a large pseudopenis through which they urinate, mate, and give birth. We review current knowledge about several significant aspects of the biology and evolution of these females, including (a) their specific study methods; (b) their unique anatomical features, and how these peculiarities influence certain physiological functions; and (c) the role that steroid hormones as well as genetic and environmental factors may have in urogenital system development, aggressive behavior, and social dominance. Nevertheless, both mole and hyena females are exceptionally efficient mothers, so their peculiar genitalia should not call into question their femininity.", "generated_text": "This study explores the unique biological and evolutionary traits of fierce females, specifically focusing on the talpid mole and the spotted hyena. Both species exhibit remarkable examples of female masculinization, a phenomenon characterized by the development of male-like traits in females. In moles, this is evident through the presence of an ovotestis, a gonad that contains both ovarian and testicular tissue, which may influence aggressive behavior. Similarly, female spotted hyenas possess a pseudopenis, a masculinized clitoris that closely resembles a penis, and exhibit dominant and aggressive behaviors typically associated with males. These traits are hypothesized to confer evolutionary advantages, such as increased social dominance and reproductive success. This research integrates morphological, hormonal, and behavioral data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying female masculinization and its ecological implications.", "label": 1}
