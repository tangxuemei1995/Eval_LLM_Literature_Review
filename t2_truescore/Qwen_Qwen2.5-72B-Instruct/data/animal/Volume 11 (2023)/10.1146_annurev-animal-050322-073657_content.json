{"grounding": "Addressing important questions in animal ecology, physiology, and environmental science often requires in situ information from wild animals. This difficulty is being overcome by biologging and biotelemetry, or the use of miniaturized animal-borne sensors. Although early studies recorded only simple parameters of animal movement, advanced devices and analytical methods can now provide rich information on individual and group behavior, internal states, and the surrounding environment of free-ranging animals, especially those in marine systems. We summarize the history of technologies used to track marine animals. We then identify seven major research categories of marine biologging and biotelemetry and explain significant achievements, as well as future opportunities. Big data approaches via international collaborations will be key to tackling global environmental issues (e.g., climate change impacts), and curiosity about the secret lives of marine animals will also remain a major driver of biologging and biotelemetry studies.", "generated_text": "Biologging and biotelemetry technologies have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. These tools enable the continuous monitoring of movement patterns, diving behavior, and physiological responses in natural environments, providing critical insights into movement ecology, field physiology, predator\u2013prey interactions, and social dynamics. Recent advancements in miniaturization and data transmission have expanded the scope of studies to include a broader range of species, from small fish to large marine mammals. This review highlights key findings from biologging and biotelemetry studies, emphasizing the role of these technologies in elucidating the impacts of anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, pollution, and human disturbance on marine ecosystems. By integrating data from multiple sources, researchers can develop more comprehensive models of marine animal behavior and inform conservation strategies to protect vulnerable species and their habitats.", "label": 1}
