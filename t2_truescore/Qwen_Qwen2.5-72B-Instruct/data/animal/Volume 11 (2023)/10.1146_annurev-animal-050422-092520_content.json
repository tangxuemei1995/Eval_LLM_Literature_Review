{"grounding": "For nearly a century, evolutionary biologists have observed chromosomes that cause lethality when made homozygous persisting at surprisingly high frequencies (>25%) in natural populations of many species. The evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of such detrimental mutations have been heavily debated\u2014are some lethal mutations under balancing selection? We suggest that mutation\u2013selection balance alone cannot explain lethal variation in nature and the possibility that other forces play a role. We review the potential that linked selection in particular may drive maintenance of lethal alleles through associative overdominance or linkage to beneficial mutations or by reducing effective population size. Over the past five decades, investigation into this mystery has tapered. During this time, key scientific advances have provided the ability to collect more accurate data and analyze them in new ways, making the underlying genetic bases and evolutionary forces of lethal alleles timely for study once more.", "generated_text": "This study explores the mechanisms that maintain recessive lethal alleles in natural populations, focusing on mutation\u2013selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection. Using a combination of population genetic models and empirical data, we investigate how these processes interact to preserve genetic variation despite the fitness costs associated with lethal mutations. Our findings suggest that while mutation\u2013selection balance plays a fundamental role, heterozygote advantage and associative overdominance due to linked selection can significantly contribute to the persistence of recessive lethals. These results highlight the importance of considering the broader genetic architecture, including the presence of supergenes, in understanding the maintenance of deleterious alleles. The implications of these findings extend to conservation genetics and the management of genetic disorders in both wild and managed populations.", "label": 0}
