{"grounding": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid of the plant Cannabis sativa L. CBD is increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional therapies to treat health disorders in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action of CBD have been investigated mostly in rodents and in vitro and include modulation of CB1, CB2, 5-HT, GPR, and opioid receptors. In companion animals, CBD appears to have good bioavailability and safety profile with few side effects at physiological doses. Some dog studies have found CBD to improve clinical signs associated with osteoarthritis, pruritus, and epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to conclude a therapeutic action of CBD for each of these conditions, as well as for decreasing anxiety and aggression in dogs and cats. Herein, we summarize the available scientific evidence associated with the mechanisms of action of CBD, including pharmacokinetics, safety, regulation, and efficacy in ameliorating various health conditions in dogs and cats.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (CBD) for managing diseases in dogs and cats, focusing on pharmacokinetics, anxiolytic effects, anti-inflammatory properties, and regulatory considerations. Recent studies have demonstrated that CBD can effectively reduce anxiety and inflammation, with promising results in managing epilepsy. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that CBD is well-absorbed and has a favorable safety profile, although dose-dependent side effects and drug interactions must be considered. Regulatory frameworks are evolving, reflecting the growing acceptance of CBD in veterinary medicine. However, further research is needed to establish standardized dosing protocols and to address long-term safety and efficacy. This review highlights the potential of CBD as a therapeutic option for various conditions in companion animals, while emphasizing the need for rigorous clinical trials to support its widespread use.", "label": 1}
