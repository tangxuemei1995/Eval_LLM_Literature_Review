{"grounding": "Zoonoses are diseases and infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Effective response and control of zoonotic diseases call for multiple-sector involvement and collaboration according to the One Health concept.", "generated_text": "This review examines the role of domestic animals as reservoir hosts for zoonotic viral diseases, highlighting their significance in the emergence and maintenance of both endemic and novel viral pathogens. Domestic animals, including livestock and pets, can serve as intermediate hosts, facilitating the spillover of viruses from wildlife to humans. The study synthesizes data from recent outbreaks, such as influenza, coronaviruses, and henipaviruses, to illustrate the complex interplay between animal husbandry practices, environmental factors, and human behavior. The One Health approach is emphasized as a critical framework for integrated surveillance, prevention, and control strategies to mitigate the risk of future pandemics. The findings underscore the need for enhanced monitoring and collaborative efforts across veterinary, public health, and ecological disciplines to address the growing threat of zoonotic diseases.", "label": 0}
