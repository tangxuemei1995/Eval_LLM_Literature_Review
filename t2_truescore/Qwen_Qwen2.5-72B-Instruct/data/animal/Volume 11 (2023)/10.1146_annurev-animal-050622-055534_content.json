{"grounding": "Advances in DNA sequencing and other technologies have greatly facilitated the identification of genetic risk factors for inherited diseases in dogs. We review recent technological developments based on selected examples from canine disease genetics. The identification of disease-causing variants in dogs with monogenic diseases may become a widely employed diagnostic approach in clinical veterinary medicine in the not-too-distant future. Diseases with complex modes of inheritance continue to pose challenges to researchers but have also become much more tangible than in the past. In addition to strategies for identifying genetic risk factors, we provide some thoughts on the interpretation of sequence variants that are largely inspired by developments in human clinical genetics.", "generated_text": "This study aimed to identify genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex diseases in Canis lupus familiaris, utilizing a comprehensive genomic approach. By leveraging the dog as an animal model, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to pinpoint specific genetic variants associated with diseases such as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, and cancer. Our findings highlight the potential of precision medicine in veterinary practice, aligning with the One Health initiative to improve health outcomes for both animals and humans. The identified genetic markers provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and targeted therapeutic interventions, contributing to the advancement of veterinary medicine and the broader field of genetic research.", "label": 0}
