{"grounding": "Zoos and aquariums have evolved significantly. From their origins as enclosures for the mere entertainment of the public, these institutions have undertaken new functions responding to the biodiversity crisis and social demands. Modern zoos and aquariums have the opportunity to educate people, contribute to species conservation, and produce animal-related research. However, there is increasing criticism toward the outcomes of their actions and the holding of species in their facilities. This review offers an integrated analysis of the state of knowledge about the role that zoos and aquariums play today. It describes their performance regarding their conservation, education, and research functions, highlighting general patterns and offering future perspectives. It identifies some challenges common to all these institutions, concluding that the way they keep up with the ever-growing social and environmental expectations will be decisive hereafter.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolving role of zoos and aquariums in the context of global biodiversity conservation, environmental education, and scientific research. As natural habitats face increasing threats, these institutions have become crucial for captive breeding programs and species reintroduction efforts, contributing to the preservation of endangered species. Additionally, they serve as vital educational platforms, raising public awareness about environmental issues and fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world. However, the paper also addresses the ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare in captivity, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in living conditions and enrichment programs. Through a review of recent literature, this study highlights the multifaceted contributions of zoos and aquariums and suggests strategies for enhancing their impact in a rapidly changing world.", "label": 1}
