{"grounding": "This article addresses the underrepresentation of Indigenous perspectives in animal sciences by challenging the exclusive use of Western scientific paradigms in research and education. Because of the systematic exclusion of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous perspectives have rarely been represented through empirical study, leading us to believe this is a key reason for the underrepresentation of Native people in these fields. We conducted a literature review, searching for Indigenous contributions in animal sciences and finding a handful of articles in three areas: human\u2013animal bonds, genetic testing and breeding programs, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Given the interconnected paradigm of Indigenous worldviews, we suggest that the ongoing siloes of scientific disciplines and the hierarchy of methodology contribute to the dearth of Indigenous perspectives. We suggest increased support for proper tribal consultation, contextualization of the history of research in Native communities, and the creation of scholarly spaces to support these conversations.", "generated_text": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives within the field of animal biosciences, emphasizing the contributions of American Indian and Native American communities. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) offers a holistic approach to animal health and management, aligning with the One Health framework that recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. The review highlights case studies where TEK has been successfully applied, such as in wildlife conservation, livestock management, and disease surveillance. It also addresses the challenges and barriers to incorporating Indigenous knowledge into mainstream animal biosciences, including issues of cultural appropriation, intellectual property rights, and the need for respectful, collaborative research practices. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering greater collaboration between Indigenous communities and the scientific community to enhance the sustainability and ethical standards of animal biosciences.", "label": 0}
