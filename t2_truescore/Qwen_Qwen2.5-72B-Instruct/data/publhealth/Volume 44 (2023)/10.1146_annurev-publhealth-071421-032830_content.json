{"grounding": "Between the 2009 Great Recession and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US state and local governmental public health workforce lost 40,000 jobs. Tens of thousands of workers also left during the pandemic and continue to leave. As governmental health departments are now receiving multimillion-dollar, temporary federal investments to replenish their workforce, this review synthesizes the evidence regarding major challenges that preceded the pandemic and remain now. These include the lack of the field's ability to readily enumerate and define the governmental public health workforce as well as challenges with the recruitment and retention of public health workers. This review finds that many workforce-related challenges identified more than 20 years ago persist in the field today. Thus, it is critical that we look back to be able to then move forward to successfully rebuild the workforce and assure adequate capacity to protect the public's health and respond to public health emergencies.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the US public health workforce, highlighting ongoing challenges and proposing future directions. Despite the critical role of public health professionals in addressing public health emergencies and promoting community health, the workforce faces significant issues related to recruitment, retention, and training. The study synthesizes data from multiple sources, including national surveys and state-level reports, to enumerate the workforce and assess its composition, distribution, and competencies. Key findings indicate a shortage of qualified professionals, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and a need for enhanced training programs to address emerging public health threats. Recommendations include the development of targeted recruitment strategies, the implementation of supportive retention policies, and the expansion of workforce development initiatives to ensure a robust and resilient public health workforce for the future.", "label": 1}
