{"grounding": "Heat is a dangerous hazard that causes acute heat illness, chronic disease exacerbations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a range of injuries. Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE;and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard.", "generated_text": "Extreme heat events, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant public health risks, necessitating robust preparedness strategies. This review synthesizes current literature on public health preparedness for extreme heat, focusing on the development and implementation of heat action plans (HAPs) as a key disaster risk reduction measure. HAPs integrate early warning systems, community education, and targeted interventions to protect vulnerable populations. The analysis highlights the importance of multi-sector collaboration, including meteorological services, healthcare providers, and local governments, to enhance the effectiveness of these plans. Case studies from urban and rural settings demonstrate the adaptability of HAPs to diverse contexts, emphasizing the need for context-specific strategies. The findings underscore the critical role of continuous evaluation and community engagement in improving public health outcomes during extreme heat events.", "label": 1}
