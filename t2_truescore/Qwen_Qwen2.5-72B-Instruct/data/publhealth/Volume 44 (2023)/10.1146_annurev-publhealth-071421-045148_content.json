{"grounding": "The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events, are expected to increase and alter human migration and mobility. Climate-related mobility is not inherently a crisis; it can provide a pathway for adaptation to climate change. However, a growing body of research identifies health risks and some opportunities associated with climate-related mobility. This review examines recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change\u2013mobility\u2013health nexus; this research focuses largely on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. It considers the links between human mobility and anthropogenic climate change and documents the findings of empirical research that addresses the health consequences of displacement, planned relocation, migration, and migration into sites of climate risk. The findings highlight the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care in a heating world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex interplay between climatic and environmental changes, migration, and health outcomes. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we analyze how climate-induced environmental degradation and extreme weather events drive human mobility, including both short-term displacement and long-term relocation. The research highlights the health vulnerabilities of migrant populations, particularly in terms of mental health, infectious diseases, and access to healthcare services. Case studies from various regions, including low-lying coastal areas and arid regions, illustrate the diverse impacts of climate change on migration patterns and health. The findings underscore the need for integrated policies that address both the environmental and social determinants of health in the context of climate-induced migration.", "label": 1}
