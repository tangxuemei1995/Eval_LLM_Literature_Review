{"grounding": "Several peer-reviewed papers and reviews have examined the relationship between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 spread and severity. However, many of the existing reviews on this topic do not extensively present the statistical challenges associated with this field, do not provide comprehensive guidelines for future researchers, and review only the results of a relatively small number of papers. We reviewed 139 papers, 127 of which reported a statistically significant positive association between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. Here, we summarize the evidence, describe the statistical challenges, and make recommendations for future research. To summarize the 139 papers with data from geographical locations around the world, we also present anopen-source data visualization tool that summarizes these studies and allows the research community to contribute evidence as new research papers are published.", "generated_text": "This literature review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes, highlighting statistical challenges and the role of data visualization in enhancing understanding. Studies from various regions indicate that exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, methodological inconsistencies, confounding factors, and temporal lags complicate the interpretation of these findings. Advanced data visualization techniques, such as geographic heat maps and interactive dashboards, are crucial for communicating complex relationships and trends. This review underscores the need for standardized methodologies and integrated data platforms to support robust evidence synthesis and inform public health policies.", "label": 1}
