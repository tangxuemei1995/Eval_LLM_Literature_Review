{"grounding": "Rapid randomized controlled trials have been surprisingly rare in health care quality improvement (QI) and systems interventions. Applying clinical trials methodology QI work brings two distinct fields together, applying the robustness of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to the practical, operational learnings of the well-established QI field. Rapid trials also add a third element\u2014speed\u2014that enables health care systems to rapidly test multiple variations of an intervention in much the same way that A/B testing is done in the technology sector. When performed well, these rapid trials free researchers and health care systems from the requirement to be correct the first time (because it is low cost and quick to try something else) while offering a standard of evidence often absent in QI. Here we outline the historical underpinnings of this approach, provide guidance about how best to implement it, and describe lessons learned from running more than 20 randomized projects in the NYU Langone Health system.", "generated_text": "Rapid Randomized Trials (RRTs) represent a novel approach to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives in health care systems. This study explores the application of RRTs to address critical safety and quality issues, leveraging their ability to provide quick, actionable insights. By integrating RRTs into routine clinical practice, we aimed to evaluate the impact of specific interventions on patient outcomes and system performance. The results demonstrate that RRTs can significantly reduce the time required to identify effective interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of improvement. Moreover, the use of RRTs facilitated a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, enhancing both patient safety and the overall quality of care. This approach holds promise for transforming health care systems by providing a robust, evidence-based method for rapid quality improvement.", "label": 1}
