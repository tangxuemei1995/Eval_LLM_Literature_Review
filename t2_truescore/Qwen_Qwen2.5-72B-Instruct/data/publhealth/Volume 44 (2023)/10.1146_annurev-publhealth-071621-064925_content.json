{"grounding": "Taking stock of environmental justice (EJ) is daunting. It is at once a scholarly field, an ongoing social movement, and an administrative imperative adopted by government agencies and incorporated into legislation. Moreover, within academia, it is multidisciplinary and multimethodological, comprising scholars who do not always speak to one another. Any review of EJ is thus necessarily restrictive.\nThis article explores several facets of EJ activism. One is its coalitional and \u201cinside-outside\u201d orientation. EJ activists are constantly forming alliances with other stakeholders, but these coalitions do not flout the importance of engaging with formal institutions. The review next turns to one set of such institutions\u2014the courts and regulatory agencies\u2014to see how well EJ claims have fared there. I then survey scientific findings that have been influenced by EJ. The review concludes with future directions for activists and scholars to consider: the changing nature of EJ coalitions, fragmentation within EJ and with other fields, the historical roots of environmental injustice, and opportunities for stronger infusion of the EJ lens.", "generated_text": "This review examines the evolution of environmental justice (EJ) as a field, focusing on its historical roots, key milestones, and current challenges. Environmental justice emerged in response to the disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, to environmental hazards. The paper highlights the role of environmental racism and structural inequalities in perpetuating racial health disparities. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies and policy interventions, the review identifies critical areas for future research and action, including the need for more inclusive health advocacy and activism. The discussion underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and community engagement in addressing the complex intersections of race, environment, and health. As EJ continues to evolve, the paper calls for a renewed commitment to dismantling systemic barriers and advancing equitable environmental policies.", "label": 1}
