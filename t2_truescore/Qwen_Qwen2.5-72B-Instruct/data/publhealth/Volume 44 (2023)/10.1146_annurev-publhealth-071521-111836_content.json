{"grounding": "Housing quality is essential for population health and broader well-being. The World Health Organization Housing and health guidelines highlight interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of ventilation standards. Housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing. These can be partially ameliorated by community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses. There is renewed interest among policy makers and researchers in the health and well-being of people in public and subsidized housing, who are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries. Improving the overall quality of new and existing housing and neighborhoods has multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of housing quality on health and well-being inequalities. A comprehensive analysis of studies reveals that substandard housing conditions, including poor indoor air quality, dampness, and inadequate thermal comfort, disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating health disparities. The review highlights the importance of healthy housing guidelines and policies that address these issues, emphasizing the cobenefits of improved housing quality, such as reduced healthcare costs and enhanced social cohesion. Key findings indicate that interventions aimed at upgrading housing infrastructure can lead to significant improvements in physical and mental health outcomes, particularly among low-income and marginalized communities. The evidence supports the need for multidisciplinary approaches that integrate public health, urban planning, and social policy to create healthier living environments and reduce health inequalities.", "label": 0}
