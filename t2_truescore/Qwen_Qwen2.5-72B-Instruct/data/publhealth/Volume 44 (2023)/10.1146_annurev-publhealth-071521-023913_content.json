{"grounding": "Current digital health approaches have not engaged diverse end users or reduced health or health care inequities, despite their promise to deliver more tailored and personalized support to individuals at the right time and the right place. To achieve digital health equity, we must refocus our attention on the current state of digital health uptake and use across the policy, system, community, individual, and intervention levels. We focus here on (a) outlining a multilevel framework underlying digital health equity; (b) summarizingfive types of interventions/programs (with example studies) that hold promise for advancing digital health equity; and (c) recommending future steps for improving policy, practice, and research in this space.", "generated_text": "This literature synthesis explores the multilevel determinants of digital health equity, integrating insights from social determinants of health and health technology. The review identifies key factors at individual, community, and systemic levels that influence access to and effectiveness of digital health interventions. Findings highlight disparities in digital literacy, internet access, and socioeconomic status as critical barriers to equitable digital health outcomes. The synthesis also underscores the need for tailored interventions and policy frameworks to address these disparities, ensuring that digital health innovations benefit all populations. Recommendations for future research and practice are provided to advance the field and promote health equity.", "label": 1}
