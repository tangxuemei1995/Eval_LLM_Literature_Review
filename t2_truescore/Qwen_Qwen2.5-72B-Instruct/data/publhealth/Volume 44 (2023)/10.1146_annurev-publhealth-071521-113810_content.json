{"grounding": "Public health researchers are increasingly questioning the consequences of gentrification for population health and health equity, as witnessed in the rapid increase in public health publications on the health (equity) effects of gentrification. Despite methodological challenges, and mixed results from existing quantitative research, qualitative evidence to date points to the role of gentrification processes in exacerbating health inequities. Here we discuss past methodological and theoretical challenges in integrating the study of gentrification with public health research. We suggest taking an interdisciplinary approach, considering the conceptualization of gentrification in measurement techniques and conceiving this process as a direct exposure or as a part of broader neighborhood changes. Finally, we discuss existingpolicy approaches to mitigating and preventing gentrification and how these could be evaluated for effectiveness and as public health promotion and specifically as interventions to promote health equity.", "generated_text": "Gentrification, a complex urban phenomenon, often leads to displacement and exacerbates health inequities in affected communities. This paper presents a theoretical and methodological guide to understanding and mitigating the adverse health effects of gentrification. By integrating concepts from urban sociology, public health, and urban planning, we propose a framework that identifies key mechanisms through which gentrification impacts health, including changes in housing stability, social networks, and access to resources. We also outline methodological approaches for assessing these impacts, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and longitudinal studies. The guide aims to equip researchers, policymakers, and community organizations with the tools necessary to promote health equity in the context of urban regeneration, ensuring that the benefits of neighborhood improvements are shared equitably among all residents.", "label": 1}
