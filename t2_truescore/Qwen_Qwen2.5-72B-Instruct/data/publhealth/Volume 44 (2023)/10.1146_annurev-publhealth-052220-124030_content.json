{"grounding": "The implementation of primary and secondary preventive strategies is based on the evidence generated by cancer epidemiology, where the identification of risk factors and the description of their prevalence are fundamental to derive estimates on the burden of cancer from different etiologies, typically expressed as the population attributable fraction, which corresponds to the proportion of a cancer that may be prevented by controlling a given risk factor. However, even when cancer finds its etiology in modifiable factors, its prevention through the control of those factors is not always feasible, or it remains suboptimal despite the possibility of reducing the burden. We reviewed selected associations between modifiable risk factors and cancer, including tobacco smoking, occupational exposures, infections, air pollution, alcohol, and diet and obesity, and illustrated examples of both successes and failures in cancer control, underlying how current understanding of the avoidable causes of cancer is incomplete.", "generated_text": "This study provides a comprehensive analysis of cancers attributable to modifiable risk factors, emphasizing the potential for prevention. Utilizing data from multiple global health databases, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for various modifiable risk factors, including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and dietary factors. Our findings indicate that a substantial proportion of cancer cases\u2014approximately 40%\u2014can be attributed to these modifiable factors. The highest PAFs were observed for lung cancer (attributable to smoking) and liver cancer (attributable to alcohol and obesity). We also highlight the disparities in cancer burden across different regions and socioeconomic groups, underscoring the need for tailored prevention strategies. This road map for cancer control outlines key interventions, such as policy changes, public health campaigns, and community-based programs, aimed at reducing exposure to these risk factors and ultimately lowering the incidence of avoidable cancers.", "label": 0}
