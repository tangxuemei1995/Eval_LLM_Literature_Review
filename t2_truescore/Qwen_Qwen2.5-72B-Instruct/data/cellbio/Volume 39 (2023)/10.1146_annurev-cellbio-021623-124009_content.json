{"grounding": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decode messenger RNA codons to peptides at the ribosome. The nuclear genome contains many tRNA genes for each amino acid and even each anticodon. Recent evidence indicates that expression of these tRNAs in neurons is regulated, and they are not functionally redundant. When specific tRNA genes are nonfunctional, this results in an imbalance between codon demand and tRNA availability. Furthermore, tRNAs are spliced, processed, and posttranscriptionally modified. Defects in these processes lead to neurological disorders. Finally, mutations in the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) also lead to disease. Recessive mutations in several aaRSs cause syndromic disorders, while dominant mutations in a subset of aaRSs lead to peripheral neuropathy, again due to an imbalance between tRNA supply and codon demand. While it is clear that disrupting tRNA biology often leads to neurological disease, additional research is needed to understand the sensitivity of neurons to these changes.", "generated_text": "tRNA dysregulation has emerged as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the roles of tRNA processing, modification, and splicing in maintaining neuronal function and the consequences of their disruption. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, which charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids, and enzymes like angiogenin, which are involved in tRNA splicing, are key players in this process. Dysfunctions in these enzymes can lead to the accumulation of aberrant tRNAs, triggering the integrated stress response and contributing to cellular dysfunction. Recent studies have linked specific tRNA modifications to altered protein synthesis and neuronal viability, underscoring the importance of tRNA homeostasis in neural health. This review synthesizes current knowledge on tRNA dysregulation and its implications for understanding and potentially treating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.", "label": 1}
