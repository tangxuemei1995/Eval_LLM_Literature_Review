{"grounding": "Animal tissues are made up of multiple cell types that are increasingly well-characterized, yet our understanding of the core principles that govern tissue organization is still incomplete. This is in part because many observable tissue characteristics, such as cellular composition and spatial patterns, are emergent properties, and as such, they cannot be explained through the knowledge of individual cells alone. Here we propose a complex systems theory perspective to address this fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology. We introduce the concept of cell categories, which is based on cell relations rather than cell identity. Based on these notions we then discuss common principles of tissue modularity, introducing compositional, structural, and functional tissue modules. Cell diversity and cell relations provide a basis for a new perspective on the underlying principles of tissue organization in health and disease.", "generated_text": "The field of tissue biology is on the cusp of a paradigm shift, driven by the need to understand the complex interplay between cell types and their organizational structures. Recent advances in single-cell genomics and imaging technologies have revealed that tissues are composed of dynamic, self-organizing modules rather than static, homogeneous units. These modules, characterized by distinct cell categories and relations, exhibit emergent properties that are not predictable from the properties of individual cells. This review explores the evolving concept of tissue organization, emphasizing the role of evolutionary processes in shaping cell interactions and the potential for self-organization in maintaining tissue homeostasis. By integrating these insights, we propose a new framework for understanding tissue biology that could lead to novel therapeutic strategies and a deeper appreciation of the fundamental principles governing multicellular life.", "label": 1}
