{"grounding": "Myriad mechanisms have evolved to adapt to changing environments. Environmental stimuli alter organisms\u2019 physiology to create memories of previous environments. Whether these environmental memories can cross the generational barrier has interested scientists for centuries. The logic of passing on information from generation to generation is not well understood. When is it useful to remember ancestral conditions, and when might it be deleterious to continue to respond to a context that may no longer exist? The key might be found in understanding the environmental conditions that trigger long-lasting adaptive responses. We discuss the logic that biological systems may use to remember environmental conditions. Responses spanning different generational timescales employ different molecular machineries and may result from differences in the duration or intensity of the exposure. Understanding the molecular components of multigenerational inheritance and the logic underlying beneficial and maladaptive adaptations is fundamental to understanding how organisms acquire and transmit environmental memories across generations.", "generated_text": "Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) plays a crucial role in the rapid adaptation of organisms to environmental changes, bridging the gap between immediate phenotypic responses and long-term genetic evolution. This study explores the timescales of TEI, focusing on how epigenetic marks are transmitted across generations and influence adaptive traits. By integrating data from diverse model organisms, we demonstrate that TEI can operate over multiple timescales, from immediate responses to environmental stressors to more stable, heritable changes that persist for several generations. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of TEI and its significance in shaping the adaptive potential of populations. This research underscores the importance of considering both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in understanding the processes of adaptation and evolutionary change.", "label": 0}
