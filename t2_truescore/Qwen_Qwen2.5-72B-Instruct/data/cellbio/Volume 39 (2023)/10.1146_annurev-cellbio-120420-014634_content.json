{"grounding": "The life of eukaryotic cells requires the transport of lipids between membranes, which are separated by the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Vesicle-mediated traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) cooperate in this transport. Until recently, known LTPs were shown to carry one or a few lipids at a time and were thought to mediate transport by shuttle-like mechanisms. Over the last few years, a new family of LTPs has been discovered that is defined by a repeating \u03b2-groove (RBG) rod-like structure with a hydrophobic channel running along their entire length. This structure and the localization of these proteins at membrane contact sites suggest a bridge-like mechanism of lipid transport. Mutations in some of these proteins result in neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. Here we review the known properties and well-established or putative physiological roles of these proteins, and we highlight the many questions that remain open about their functions.", "generated_text": "The RBG Motif Bridge-Like Lipid Transport Proteins (BLTPs), including VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164, represent a unique class of proteins involved in lipid transport across non-contiguous membranes. These proteins share a conserved RBG motif and a bridge-like structure, facilitating the transfer of lipids between organelles without direct membrane fusion. VPS13 and ATG2 are crucial for autophagy and endosomal trafficking, while tweek and hobbit play roles in lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways. SHIP164, a recently identified member, has been implicated in phosphoinositide metabolism. Despite their structural and functional similarities, the specific mechanisms by which these proteins mediate lipid transport and their regulatory interactions remain poorly understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the structure and functions of BLTPs, highlighting key findings and addressing open questions that warrant further investigation.", "label": 1}
