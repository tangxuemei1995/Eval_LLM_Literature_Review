{"grounding": "Intercellular signaling molecules, known as morphogens, act at a long range in developing tissues to provide spatial information and control properties such as cell fate and tissue growth. The production, transport, and removal of morphogens shape their concentration profiles in time and space. Downstream signaling cascades and gene regulatory networks within cells then convert the spatiotemporal morphogen profiles into distinct cellular responses. Current challenges are to understand the diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying morphogen gradient formation, as well as the logic of downstream regulatory circuits involved in morphogen interpretation. This knowledge, combining experimental and theoretical results, is essential to understand emerging properties of morphogen-controlled systems, such as robustness and scaling.", "generated_text": "Morphogens play a crucial role in the control of tissue development by establishing concentration gradients that guide cell differentiation and patterning within the embryo. This review examines the mechanisms by which morphogens, through their diffusion and interaction with gene regulatory networks, orchestrate the precise spatial and temporal organization of tissues. Recent studies highlight the importance of feedback loops and the integration of multiple signaling pathways in maintaining robust morphogen gradients. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the fundamental principles of embryonic development and has implications for regenerative medicine and the treatment of developmental disorders.", "label": 1}
