{"grounding": "Toll signaling plays a crucial role in pathogen defense throughout the animal kingdom. It was discovered, however, for its function in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in Drosophila. In all other insects studied so far, but not outside the insects, Toll is also required for DV patterning. However, in insects more distantly related to Drosophila, Toll's patterning role is frequently reduced and substituted by an expanded influence of BMP signaling, the pathway implicated in DV axis formation in all major metazoan lineages. This suggests that Toll was integrated into an ancestral BMP-based patterning system at the base of the insects or during insect evolution. The observation that Toll signaling has an immune function in the extraembryonic serosa, an early differentiating tissue of most insect embryos, suggests a scenario of how Toll was co-opted from an ancestral immune function for its new role in axis formation.", "generated_text": "The Toll signaling pathway, originally identified for its role in dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila, has undergone neofunctionalization in various insect lineages, expanding its role from immunity to embryonic patterning. This study investigates the evolution of Toll signaling in Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, as well as in non-insect hexapods. We find that while the core components of the pathway are conserved, the specific functions of Toll signaling in germ layer formation, particularly in mesoderm specification and serosa development, have diverged. Comparative analysis reveals that the pathway's role in serosal cuticle and blastodermal cuticle formation is more pronounced in these species compared to Drosophila. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary plasticity of signaling pathways and their impact on the diversification of embryonic patterning mechanisms in insects.", "label": 1}
