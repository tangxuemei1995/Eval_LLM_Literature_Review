{"grounding": "Microtubules are essential dynamic polymers composed of \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers. They support intracellular trafficking, cell division, cellular motility, and other essential cellular processes. In many species, both \u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-tubulin are encoded by multiple genes with distinct expression profiles and functionality. Microtubules are further diversified through abundant posttranslational modifications, which are added and removed by a suite of enzymes to form complex, stereotyped cellular arrays. The genetic and chemical diversity of tubulin constitute a tubulin code that regulates intrinsic microtubule properties and is read by cellular effectors, such as molecular motors and microtubule-associated proteins, to provide spatial and temporal specificity to microtubules in cells. In this review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding tubulin code literature and highlight limitations and opportunities for the field. As complex microtubule arrays underlie essential physiological processes, a better understanding of how cells employ the tubulin code has important implications for human disease ranging from cancer to neurological disorders.", "generated_text": "Microtubules, dynamic polymers of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin, play essential roles in cellular functions such as cell division, intracellular transport, and cell shape maintenance. The tubulin code, a concept that encompasses the diversity of tubulin isoforms and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs), adds a layer of complexity to microtubule function. PTMs such as detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation modulate microtubule stability, dynamics, and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the tubulin code, highlighting the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of these modifications. We discuss the implications of the tubulin code in health and disease, including its role in neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and developmental abnormalities. By elucidating the tubulin code, we aim to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for modulating microtubule function in various pathological conditions.", "label": 1}
