{"grounding": "Our understanding of cell and developmental biology has been greatly aided by a focus on a small number of model organisms. However, we are now in an era where techniques to investigate gene function can be applied across phyla, allowing scientists to explore the diversity and flexibility of developmental mechanisms and gain a deeper understanding of life. Researchers comparing the eyeless cave-adapted Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, with its river-dwelling counterpart are revealing how the development of the eyes, pigment, brain, cranium, blood, and digestive system evolves as animals adapt to new environments. Breakthroughs in our understanding of the genetic and developmental basis of regressive and constructive trait evolution have come from A. mexicanus research. They include understanding the types of mutations that alter traits, which cellular and developmental processes they affect, and how they lead to pleiotropy. We review recent progress in the field and highlight areas for future investigations that include evolution of sex differentiation, neural crest development, and metabolic regulation of embryogenesis.", "generated_text": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a powerful model system in cell and developmental biology, particularly in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). This species comprises both surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling morphs, providing a unique opportunity to study the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution. The cave-dwelling morphs exhibit a range of regressive traits, such as the loss of eyes and pigmentation, alongside constructive traits like enhanced sensory systems. Recent advances in genomic and molecular techniques have facilitated the identification of key genes and pathways involved in these evolutionary changes. This review highlights the use of Astyanax as a model to investigate the genetic basis of trait divergence, the role of developmental plasticity in adaptation, and the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping phenotypic diversity. The insights gained from studying Astyanax not only contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes but also have broader implications for fields such as regenerative medicine and sensory biology.", "label": 0}
