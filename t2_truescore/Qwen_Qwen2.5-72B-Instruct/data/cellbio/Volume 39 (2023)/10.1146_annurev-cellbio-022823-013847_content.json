{"grounding": "Cells must tightly regulate their gene expression programs and yet rapidly respond to acute biochemical and biophysical cues within their environment. This information is transmitted to the nucleus through various signaling cascades, culminating in the activation or repression of target genes. Transcription factors (TFs) are key mediators of these signals, binding to specific regulatory elements within chromatin. While live-cell imaging has conclusively proven that TF\u2013chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, how such transient interactions can have long-term impacts on developmental trajectories and disease progression is still largely unclear. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the dynamic nature of TF functions, starting with a historical overview of early live-cell experiments. We highlight key factors that govern TF dynamics and how TF dynamics, in turn, affect downstream transcriptional bursting. Finally, we conclude with open challenges and emerging technologies that will further our understanding of transcriptional regulation.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in single-molecule tracking (SMT) have revolutionized our understanding of transcription factor (TF) dynamics within living cells. This study employs SMT to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of TFs at the single-molecule level, revealing intricate patterns of transcriptional bursting and gene regulation. By integrating SMT data with high-resolution imaging of chromatin dynamics, we uncover the role of genome organization in modulating TF activity. Our findings demonstrate that TFs exhibit heterogeneous binding kinetics, with transient interactions facilitating the search for target sites and stable binding promoting transcriptional activation. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how TFs navigate the complex chromatin landscape to regulate gene expression, highlighting the importance of dynamic interactions in the context of genome organization and chromatin structure.", "label": 1}
