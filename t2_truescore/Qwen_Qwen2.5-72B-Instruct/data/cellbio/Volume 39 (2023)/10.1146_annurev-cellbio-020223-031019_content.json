{"grounding": "Multicellular organisms generate tissues of diverse shapes and functions from cells and extracellular matrices. Their adhesion molecules mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which not only play crucial roles in maintaining tissue integrity but also serve as key regulators of tissue morphogenesis. Cells constantly probe their environment to make decisions: They integrate chemical and mechanical information from the environment via diffusible ligand- or adhesion-based signaling to decide whether to release specific signaling molecules or enzymes, to divide or differentiate, to move away or stay, or even whether to live or die. These decisions in turn modify their environment, including the chemical nature and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Tissue morphology is the physical manifestation of the remodeling of cells and matrices by their historical biochemical and biophysical landscapes. We review our understanding of matrix and adhesion molecules in tissue morphogenesis, with an emphasis on key physical interactions that drive morphogenesis.", "generated_text": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process that involves the dynamic interplay between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM). This study explores the role of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins and cadherins, in mediating the mechanical and biochemical interactions that drive tissue formation. We investigate how interfacial tension at cell-ECM interfaces influences cell shape, migration, and the assembly of the basement membrane. Using a combination of in vitro assays and computational modeling, we demonstrate that the balance between cell adhesion and interfacial tension is critical for the proper organization of tissues. Our findings highlight the importance of these interactions in developmental processes and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by disrupted tissue architecture.", "label": 1}
