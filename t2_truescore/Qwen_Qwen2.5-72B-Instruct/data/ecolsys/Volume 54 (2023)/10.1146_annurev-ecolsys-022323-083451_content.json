{"grounding": "Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon of one gene or one mutation affecting multiple phenotypic traits. While the concept of pleiotropy is as old as Mendelian genetics, functional genomics has finally allowed the first glimpses of the extent of pleiotropy for a large fraction of genes in a genome. After describing conceptual and operational difficulties in quantifying pleiotropy and the pros and cons of various methods for measuring pleiotropy, I review empirical data on pleiotropy, which generally show an L-shaped distribution of the degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits affected), with most genes having low pleiotropy. I then review the current understanding of the molecular basis of pleiotropy. In the rest of the review, I discuss evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on advances in topics including the cost of complexity, regulatory versus coding evolution, environmental pleiotropy and adaptation, evolution of ageing and other seemingly harmful traits, and evolutionary resolution of pleiotropy.", "generated_text": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits, plays a crucial role in evolutionary biology. This study explores the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on its impact on adaptation and the cost of complexity. Through a comprehensive review of empirical and theoretical studies, we highlight how antagonistic pleiotropy, where a gene has beneficial effects on one trait but detrimental effects on another, can constrain evolutionary trajectories and contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation. We also examine the role of pleiotropy in the evolution of complex diseases, illustrating how mutations with pleiotropic effects can lead to trade-offs that influence disease susceptibility and fitness. Our findings underscore the importance of considering pleiotropic effects in understanding the genetic basis of adaptation and the evolution of complex traits.", "label": 1}
