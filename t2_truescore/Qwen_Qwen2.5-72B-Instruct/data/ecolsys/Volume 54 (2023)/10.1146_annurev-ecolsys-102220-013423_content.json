{"grounding": "Functional trait\u2013based mediation of animal invasions is only now developing, yet it is already showing as much promise as the approach has for plant invasion biology. Here, we provide a theory-founded examination of functional trait\u2013based ecology with respect to animal invasions, together with a review of the empirical research. Recent developments in the scaling of traits to ecosystems, along with the frameworks for invasion ecology, provide a powerful foundation for investigations. Despite growing empirical research in this field, interspecific comparisons incorporating comparative phylogenetic approaches remain uncommon, and those examining assemblages are even more so. Despite the importance of time since introduction, it is rarely included in studies. Broad environmental tolerances, life history traits associated with fast growth or greater reproduction, and in some cases, greater phenotypic plasticity of traits, mediate the success of animal alien species at various stages of invasion, although introduction effort remains one of the most important factors affecting success.", "generated_text": "This study explores the functional trait variation of invasive animal species along their invasion pathways, integrating insights from community ecology, physiology, and phenotypic plasticity. We analyzed a comprehensive dataset of invasive species, focusing on traits that confer competitive advantages, such as rapid reproduction, broad dietary flexibility, and high dispersal capability. Our findings reveal that invasive species exhibit significant phenotypic plasticity, allowing them to adapt to new environments and outcompete native species. We also identified key physiological traits, such as metabolic rate and stress tolerance, that are crucial for successful invasion. These traits are often more pronounced in invasive populations compared to their native counterparts, suggesting a selection for invasive phenotypes during the colonization process. Our results highlight the importance of considering functional traits in predicting and managing biological invasions, and provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the success of invasive species.", "label": 0}
