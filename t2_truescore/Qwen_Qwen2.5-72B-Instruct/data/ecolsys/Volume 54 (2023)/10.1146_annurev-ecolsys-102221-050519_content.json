{"grounding": "Parenting is considered a key evolutionary innovation that contributed to the diversification and expansion of vertebrates. However, we know little about how such diversity evolved. Amphibians are an ideal group in which to identify the ecological factors that have facilitated or constrained the evolution of different forms of parental care. Among, but also within, the three amphibian orders\u2014Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona\u2014there is a high level of variation in habitat use, fertilization mode, mating systems, and parental sex roles. Recent work using broad phylogenetic, experimental, and physiological approaches has helped to uncover the factors that have selected for the evolution of care and transitions between different forms of parenting. Here, we highlight the exceptional diversity of amphibian parental care, emphasize the unique opportunities this group offers for addressing key questions about the evolution of parenting, and give insights into promising novel directions of research.", "generated_text": "Amphibians exhibit a wide array of parental care behaviors, offering valuable insights into the evolution of these strategies. This review synthesizes current literature on amphibian parental care, focusing on the influence of fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental sex roles. We find that external fertilization and terrestrial environments often correlate with more complex forms of care, such as egg protection, transport, and provisioning. Male and female amphibians exhibit distinct but complementary roles, with males often providing protection and females contributing to nutrition. These behaviors are crucial for offspring survival and can influence the evolutionary trajectory of species. Understanding these dynamics not only enhances our knowledge of amphibian biology but also provides broader implications for the study of parental care across taxa.", "label": 1}
