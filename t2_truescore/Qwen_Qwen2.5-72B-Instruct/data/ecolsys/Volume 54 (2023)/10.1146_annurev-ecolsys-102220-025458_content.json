{"grounding": "Whales are an extraordinary study group for questions about ecology and evolution because their combinations of extreme body sizes and unique foraging strategies are unparalleled among animals. From a terrestrial ancestry, whales evolved specialized oceanic foraging mechanisms that characterize the two main groups of living cetaceans: echolocation by toothed whales and bulk filter feeding by baleen whales. In toothed whales, lineage-specific increases in body size, enhanced diving capacity, and echolocation enable them to hunt the most abundant prey on the planet: deep-sea fish and cephalopods. Even greater body size increases, along with filter feeding and fasting capacity, permit large baleen whales to migrate long distances and exploit epipelagic patches of schooling prey, such as krill or fish, which are highly abundant but ephemeral. For both groups, prey abundance and distribution limit foraging performance, yielding divergent energetic niches that have shaped their convergent evolution to gigantism.", "generated_text": "This study explores the ecophysiological mechanisms that have driven the evolution of diving, foraging, and fasting behaviors in cetaceans, with a particular focus on the role of body size and scaling. By integrating data from biomechanics, energetics, and predator\u2013prey interactions, we elucidate how gigantism in whales has influenced their ability to exploit deep-water resources and endure prolonged periods without feeding. Our findings reveal that larger body size enhances diving capacity and foraging efficiency, but also imposes constraints on metabolic rates and energy storage. These trade-offs have shaped the foraging strategies of cetaceans, enabling them to thrive in diverse marine environments. The results provide insights into the evolutionary adaptations that have allowed whales to become the largest animals on Earth, while highlighting the ecological and physiological limits that govern their survival.", "label": 0}
