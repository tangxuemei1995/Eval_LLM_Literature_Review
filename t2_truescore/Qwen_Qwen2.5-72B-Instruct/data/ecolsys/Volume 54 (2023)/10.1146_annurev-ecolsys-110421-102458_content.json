{"grounding": "Phosphorus (P) limits productivity in many ecosystems and has the potential to constrain the global carbon sink. The magnitude of these effects depends on how climate change and rising CO2 affect P cycling. Some effects are well established. First, P limitation often constrains CO2 fertilization, and rising CO2 often exacerbates P limitation. Second, P limitation and P constraints to CO2 fertilization are more common in warmer and wetter sites. Models that couple P cycling to vegetation generally capture these outcomes. However, due largely to differences between short-term and long-term dynamics, the patterns observed across climatic gradients do not necessarily indicate how climate change over years to decades will modify P limitation. These annual-to-decadal effects are not well understood. Furthermore, even for the well-understood patterns, much remains to be learned about the quantitative details, mechanisms, and drivers of variability. The interface between empirical and modeling work is particularly ripe for development.", "generated_text": "Terrestrial phosphorus (P) cycling is a critical component of ecosystem function, influencing productivity and nutrient dynamics in forests, grasslands, and tundra. This study synthesizes recent experimental and modeling efforts to elucidate how climatic change, including warming and altered precipitation patterns, affects P availability and cycling in these ecosystems. Results from field experiments indicate that warming can enhance P mineralization in soils, particularly in P-limited systems, while increased precipitation can lead to greater P leaching, reducing its availability. Modeling studies support these findings, suggesting that the interactive effects of temperature and moisture will play a pivotal role in shaping future P dynamics. The implications of these changes are significant, as they can alter plant community composition and ecosystem productivity, with potential feedbacks to the global carbon cycle. This review highlights the need for integrated approaches that combine experimental data with predictive models to better understand and manage the impacts of climatic change on terrestrial P cycling.", "label": 1}
