{"grounding": "Large Old World fruit bats (LOWFBs), species of Pteropus, Acerodon, and related genera of large bats in the pteropodid subfamily Pteropodinae, play important roles as agents of dispersal and pollination across the Paleotropics. LOWFBs are also collectively the most threatened group of bats in the world, with 71% of extant species assessed as threatened by International Union for Conservation of Nature. As highlighted here, contrary to other bats, the vast majority of LOWFBs face multiple simultaneous threats. Most importantly, biological and ecological traits, in particular life history characteristics, diet, movement, social ecology, and physiology, intensify threats and accelerate species declines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LOWFBs are to be considered keystone species and express concern about the erosion of this role and the cascading effects expected on native ecosystems. In response to this alarming situation, we advance general recommendations and identify overarching research and conservation actions.", "generated_text": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly species of the genus Pteropus, are facing unprecedented threats that are pushing them to the brink of extinction. These keystone species, often referred to as flying foxes, play crucial roles in seed dispersal and pollination, which are vital for maintaining the ecological balance of tropical and subtropical forests. However, their populations are declining due to a combination of factors, including overhunting, habitat loss, and the impacts of climate change. Hunting for bushmeat and traditional medicine, along with deforestation and the destruction of roosting sites, have significantly reduced their numbers. Climate change exacerbates these issues by altering fruiting and flowering patterns, leading to food scarcity. The loss of these bats could have far-reaching consequences for island ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and human livelihoods. Conservation efforts, including legal protection, habitat restoration, and community engagement, are urgently needed to safeguard these vital species and the ecosystems they support.", "label": 0}
