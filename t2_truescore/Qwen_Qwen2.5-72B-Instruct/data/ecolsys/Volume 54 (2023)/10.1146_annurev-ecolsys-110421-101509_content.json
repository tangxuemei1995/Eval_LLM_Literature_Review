{"grounding": "The origin of life entails a continuum from simple prebiotic chemistry to cells with genes and molecular machines. Using life as a guide to this continuum, we consider how selection could promote increased complexity before the emergence of genes. Structured, far-from-equilibrium environments such as hydrothermal systems drive the reaction between CO2 and H2 to form organics that self-organize into protocells. CO2 fixation within protocells generates a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism. Positive feedback loops amplify flux through this network, giving a metabolic heredity that promotes growth. Patterns in the genetic code show that genes and proteins arose through direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network. Random genetic sequences template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells. This context-dependent emergence of information gives rise seamlessly to an autotrophic last universal common ancestor.", "generated_text": "The origin of life remains one of the most intriguing puzzles in science. This review explores how life's fundamental processes, such as CO2 fixation and the emergence of protocells, may have guided its own origins. We discuss the role of FeS clusters in early metabolism and the establishment of a proton-motive force, which likely provided the energy necessary for the first protocells. The transition from an RNA world to the genetic code is examined, highlighting the co-evolution of metabolic pathways and genetic information. This integrated perspective suggests that the earliest forms of life were not isolated chemical reactions but complex, self-organizing systems that harnessed environmental energy to sustain and evolve.", "label": 1}
