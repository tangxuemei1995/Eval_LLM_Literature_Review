{"grounding": "Over 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored at a depth greater than 20 cm belowground. A portion of this deep SOC actively cycles on annual to decadal timescales and is sensitive to global change. However, deep SOC responses to global change likely differ from surface SOC responses because biotic controls on SOC cycling become weaker as mineral controls predominate with depth. Here, we synthesize the current information on deep SOC responses to the global change drivers of warming, shifting precipitation, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. Most deep SOC responses can only be hypothesized because few global change studies measure deep soils, and even fewer global change experiments manipulate deep soils. We call on scientists to incorporate deep soils into their manipulations, measurements, and models so that the response of deep SOC can be accounted for in projections of nature-based climate solutions and terrestrial feedbacks to climate change.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change, including climate change, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover changes. Utilizing a meta-analysis of 120 studies, we found that deep SOC stocks are more resilient to climate change than surface SOC, but are significantly affected by land use changes, particularly deforestation and agricultural intensification. Elevated CO2 levels were shown to increase deep SOC sequestration by enhancing root biomass and microbial activity. However, the magnitude of this effect varies across different soil types and climatic regions. Our findings highlight the importance of deep SOC in the global carbon cycle and suggest that land management practices that promote deep root growth and soil conservation can enhance carbon sequestration and mitigate the impacts of global change.", "label": 1}
