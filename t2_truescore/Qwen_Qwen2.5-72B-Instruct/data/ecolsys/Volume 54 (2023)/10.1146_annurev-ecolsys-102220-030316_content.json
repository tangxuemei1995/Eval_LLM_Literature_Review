{"grounding": "The way in which terrestrial organisms use the acoustic realm is fundamentally important and shapes behavior, populations, and communities, but how background acoustics, or noise, influence the patterns and processes in ecology is still relatively understudied. In this review, we summarize how background acoustics have traditionally been studied from the signaling perspective, discuss what is known from a receiver's perspective, and explore what is known about population- and community-level responses to noise. We suggest that there are major gaps linking animal physiology and behavior in noise to fitness; that there is a limited understanding of variation in hearing within and across species, especially in the context of real-world acoustic conditions; and that many puzzling responses to noise could be clarified with a community-level lens that considers indirect effects. Failing to consider variation in acoustic conditions, and the many ways organisms use and interact via this environmental dimension, risks a limited understanding of natural systems.", "generated_text": "Background acoustics play a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems, influencing the behavior and interactions of various species. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of ambient sounds on community ecology, focusing on how natural and anthropogenic noise impacts hearing and communication. By analyzing soundscapes across different habitats, we identify patterns in species distribution and behavior, revealing that masking effects can alter predator-prey dynamics and mating signals. Our findings highlight the importance of considering acoustic environments in conservation efforts and ecological research, suggesting that preserving natural soundscapes is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "label": 1}
