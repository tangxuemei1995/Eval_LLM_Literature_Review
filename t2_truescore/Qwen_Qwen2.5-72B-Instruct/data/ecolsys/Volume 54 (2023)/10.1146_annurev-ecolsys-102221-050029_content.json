{"grounding": "Sky islands are unique geologic formations, home to populations of organisms that have weathered climate change since the Pleistocene. Long-term isolation and climatic differences between sky islands and adjacent mountain chains result in natural laboratories well suited for examining the direct effects of climate change. Here, we review the global sky island literature to examine how taxa have responded to climate change. Results show lineage formation, reduced genetic variation, and trait evolution across taxa driven by genetic drift and natural selection. These effects continue today due to ongoing habitat reduction and steep selective gradients on sky islands relative to mountain chains. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations are needed to build broad inference into how past climate change has shaped the structure and function of whole ecosystems. The next era of sky island research is poised to create a model for climate change responses and eco-evolutionary dynamics, with profound conservation implications.", "generated_text": "Sky islands, isolated mountainous regions surrounded by dissimilar lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the ecological and evolutionary impacts of climate change. These unique ecosystems harbor relict populations and high levels of genetic variation, making them ideal for observing convergent evolution and adaptive responses. This study synthesizes global data from sky islands to predict how species will respond to changing climates. By analyzing genetic diversity, species distribution, and environmental variables, we identify key patterns of adaptation and vulnerability. Our findings suggest that sky islands can act as early warning systems for broader ecological shifts, providing critical insights into the mechanisms that drive biodiversity under climate stress. This research underscores the importance of conserving these unique habitats to maintain genetic reservoirs and promote resilience in the face of global environmental change.", "label": 1}
