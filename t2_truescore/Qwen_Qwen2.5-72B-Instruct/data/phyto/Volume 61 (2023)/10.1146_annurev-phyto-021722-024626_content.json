{"grounding": "Society is confronted by interconnected threats to ecological sustainability. Among these is the devastation of forests by destructive non-native pathogens and insects introduced through global trade, leading to the loss of critical ecosystem services and a global forest health crisis. We argue that the forest health crisis is a public-good social dilemma and propose a response framework that incorporates principles of collective action. This framework enables scientists to better engage policymakers and empowers the public to advocate for proactive biosecurity and forest health management. Collective action in forest health features broadly inclusive stakeholder engagement to build trust and set goals; accountability for destructive pest introductions; pooled support for weakest-link partners; and inclusion of intrinsic and nonmarket values of forest ecosystems in risk assessment. We provide short-term and longer-term measures that incorporate the above principles to shift the societal and ecological forest health paradigm to a more resilient state.", "generated_text": "The global forest health crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions, climate change, and other anthropogenic pressures, represents a critical public-good social dilemma that demands urgent international collective action. This study synthesizes recent findings on the impacts of global change on forest ecosystems, highlighting the role of invasive species and climate-induced stressors in accelerating forest decline. We argue that the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources are essential for mitigating these threats. Through a review of existing natural resource policies and international agreements, we identify key gaps and propose a framework for enhanced collaboration among nations. This framework emphasizes the need for integrated strategies that address both the drivers and the symptoms of forest degradation, fostering a resilient and sustainable future for global forest ecosystems.", "label": 1}
