{"grounding": "\nKitaviridae is a family of plant-infecting viruses that have multiple positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomic segments. Kitaviruses are assigned into the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, mainly on the basis of the diversity of their genomic organization. Cell-to-cell movement of most kitaviruses is provided by the 30K family of proteins or the binary movement block, considered an alternative movement module among plant viruses. Kitaviruses stand out for producing conspicuously unusual locally restricted infections and showing deficient or nonsystemic movement likely resulting from incompatible or suboptimal interactions with their hosts. Transmission of kitaviruses is mediated by mites of many species of the genus Brevipalpus and at least one species of eriophyids. Kitavirus genomes encode numerous orphan open reading frames but RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the transmembrane helix-containing protein, generically called SP24, typify a close phylogenetic link with arthropod viruses. Kitaviruses infect a large range of host plants and cause diseases of economic concern in crops such as citrus, tomato, passion fruit, tea, and blueberry.", "generated_text": "Kitaviruses, including members of the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, represent a unique group of plant viruses that cause nonsystemic diseases, primarily transmitted by the polyphagous mite Brevipalpus. These viruses are characterized by their atypical genomic organization and replication strategies, which differ significantly from those of systemic plant viruses. Notably, citrus leprosis, a devastating disease affecting citrus crops, is caused by a cilevirus and has been extensively studied due to its economic impact. Recent advances in molecular biology and next-generation sequencing have provided insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of kitaviruses, revealing their complex interactions with host plants and vectors. This review highlights the current understanding of kitavirus biology, emphasizing the role of Brevipalpus mites in disease transmission and the potential for developing novel control strategies. Understanding these atypical viruses is crucial for managing plant diseases and enhancing crop resilience in the face of emerging viral threats.", "label": 1}
