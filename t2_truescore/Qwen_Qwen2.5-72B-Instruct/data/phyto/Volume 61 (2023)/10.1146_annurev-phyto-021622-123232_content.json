{"grounding": "Membrane trafficking pathways play a prominent role in plant immunity. The endomembrane transport system coordinates membrane-bound cellular organelles to ensure that immunological components are utilized effectively during pathogen resistance. Adapted pathogens and pests have evolved to interfere with aspects of membrane transport systems to subvert plant immunity. To do this, they secrete virulence factors known as effectors, many of which converge on host membrane trafficking routes. The emerging paradigm is that effectors redundantly target every step of membrane trafficking from vesicle budding to trafficking and membrane fusion. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms adopted by plant pathogens to reprogram host plant vesicle trafficking, providing examples of effector-targeted transport pathways and highlighting key questions for the field to answer moving forward.", "generated_text": "Plant pathogens, including fungi and oomycetes, employ sophisticated strategies to subvert host cellular processes, particularly membrane trafficking, to facilitate infection. This review highlights recent advances in understanding how pathogen effectors manipulate endomembrane trafficking, autophagy, and protein secretion pathways to suppress plant immunity and promote pathogen colonization. Specifically, effectors target key components of the plant's endomembrane system, such as SNARE proteins and Rab GTPases, to disrupt vesicle trafficking and autophagosome formation. Additionally, some effectors hijack the host's secretory pathway to deliver virulence factors directly into plant cells. The formation of specialized infection structures, such as haustoria, further underscores the importance of membrane trafficking in pathogen-host interactions. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing novel strategies to enhance plant resistance against pathogens.", "label": 1}
