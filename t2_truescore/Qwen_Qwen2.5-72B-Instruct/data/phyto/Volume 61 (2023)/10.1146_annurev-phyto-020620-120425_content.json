{"grounding": "Viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic symbionts interact with algae in a variety of ways to cause disease complexes, often shaping marine and freshwater ecosystems. The advent of phyconomy (a.k.a. seaweed agronomy) represents a need for a greater understanding of algal disease interactions, where underestimated cryptic diversity and lack of phycopathological basis are prospective constraints for algal domestication. Here, we highlight the limited yet increasing knowledge of algal pathogen biodiversity and the ecological interaction with their algal hosts. Finally, we discuss how ecology and cultivation experience contribute to and reinforce aquaculture practice, with the potential to reshape biosecurity policies of seaweed cultivation worldwide.", "generated_text": "The reemergence of phycopathology highlights the critical intersection of algal biology, ecology, and biosecurity. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding algal diseases, emphasizing their impact on algal aquaculture and natural ecosystems. Emerging pathogens and parasitic interactions are explored, revealing complex ecological dynamics and potential biosecurity threats. The integration of molecular tools and ecological modeling enhances our ability to predict and manage algal disease outbreaks, underscoring the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in phycopathology.", "label": 1}
