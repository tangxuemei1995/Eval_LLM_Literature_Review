{"grounding": "Plant bacterial pathogens rely on host-derived signals to coordinate the deployment of virulence factors required for infection. In this review, I describe how diverse plant-pathogenic bacteria detect and respond to plant-derived metabolic signals for the purpose of virulence gene regulation. I highlight examples of how pathogens perceive host metabolites through membrane-localized receptors as well as intracellular response mechanisms. Furthermore, I describe how individual strains may coordinate their virulence using multiple distinct host metabolic signals, and how plant signals may positively or negatively regulate virulence responses. I also describe how plant defenses may interfere with the perception of host metabolites as a means to dampen pathogen virulence. The emerging picture is that recognition of host metabolic signals for the purpose of virulence gene regulation represents an important primary layer of interaction between pathogenic bacteria and host plants that shapes infection outcomes.", "generated_text": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria employ sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate host metabolism, facilitating infection and promoting virulence. This study explores the role of host metabolites as signaling molecules that regulate bacterial virulence, particularly through inter-kingdom signaling pathways. We demonstrate that specific plant metabolites can activate the type III secretion system (T3SS) and the expression of effector proteins, which are crucial for bacterial pathogenicity. These metabolites act as cues that trigger the bacteria to adapt their virulence strategies in response to the host's metabolic state. Our findings highlight the importance of metabolic signaling in the plant-bacteria interaction and provide insights into potential targets for enhancing plant immunity against pathogenic bacteria.", "label": 1}
