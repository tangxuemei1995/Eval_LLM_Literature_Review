{"grounding": "Harvested fruit and vegetables are perishable, subject to desiccation, show increased respiration during ripening, and are colonized by postharvest fungal pathogens. Induced resistance is a strategy to control diseases by eliciting biochemical processes in fruits and vegetables. This is accomplished by modulating the progress of ripening and senescence, which maintains the produce in a state of heightened resistance to decay-causing fungi. Utilization of induced resistance to protect produce has been improved by scientific tools that better characterize physiological changes in plants. Induced resistance slows the decline of innate immunity after harvest and increases the production of defensive responses that directly inhibit plant pathogens. This increase in defense response in fruits and vegetables contributes to higher amounts of phenols and antioxidant compounds, improving both the quality and appearance of the produce. This review summarizes mechanisms and treatments that induce resistance in harvested fruits and vegetables to suppress fungal colonization. Moreover, it highlights the importance of host maturity and stage of ripening as limiting conditions for the improved expression of induced-resistance processes.", "generated_text": "Induced resistance (IR) represents a promising strategy to enhance the postharvest quality and shelf life of fruits and vegetables by activating their innate defense mechanisms. This review explores the physiological factors that contribute to IR, focusing on how these mechanisms can be harnessed to limit postharvest disease development. Key physiological processes, such as the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, the reinforcement of cell walls, and the modulation of phytohormone signaling, are discussed in the context of their roles in delaying maturation and ripening. The application of elicitors, such as chitosan, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, has been shown to effectively induce resistance, reducing the incidence of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Additionally, the integration of IR with other postharvest management practices, such as controlled atmosphere storage and modified packaging, can further enhance the effectiveness of disease control. This comprehensive approach not only extends the shelf life of produce but also reduces the reliance on chemical fungicides, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.", "label": 1}
