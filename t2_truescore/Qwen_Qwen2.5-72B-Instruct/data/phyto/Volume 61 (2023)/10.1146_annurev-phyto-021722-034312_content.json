{"grounding": "Plant disease control requires novel approaches to mitigate the spread of and losses caused by current, emerging, and re-emerging diseases and to adapt plant protection to global climate change and the restrictions on the use of conventional pesticides. Currently, disease management relies mainly on biopesticides, which are required for the sustainable use of plant-protection products. Functional peptides are candidate biopesticides because they originate from living organisms or are synthetic analogs and provide novel mechanisms of action against plant pathogens. Hundreds of compounds exist that cover an extensive range of activities against viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas, fungi and oomycetes, and nematodes. Natural sources, chemical synthesis, and biotechnological platforms may provide peptides at large scale for the industry and growers. The main challenges for their use in plant disease protection are (a) the requirement of stability in the plant environment and counteracting resistance in pathogen populations, (b) the need to develop suitable formulations to increase their shelf life and methods of application, (c) the selection of compounds with acceptable toxicological profiles, and (d) the high cost of production for agricultural purposes. In the near future, it is expected that several functional peptides will be commercially available for plant disease control, but more effort is needed to validate their efficacy at the field level and fulfill the requirements of the regulatory framework.", "generated_text": "Functional peptides have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides for the control of plant diseases. These peptides, derived from natural sources such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, exhibit a broad spectrum of antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activities. The mechanisms of action of these peptides are diverse, including membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition, and interference with cellular processes of plant pathogens. Recent advances in biotechnology have facilitated the production of functional peptides through recombinant DNA technology and peptide synthesis, making them more accessible and cost-effective. This review highlights the natural sources of functional peptides, their mechanisms of action against plant pathogens, and the current methods for their production. Additionally, the potential of these peptides as novel biopesticides is discussed, emphasizing their role in sustainable agriculture and the challenges associated with their commercialization. The integration of functional peptides into integrated pest management strategies could provide a robust and environmentally friendly approach to plant disease control.", "label": 1}
