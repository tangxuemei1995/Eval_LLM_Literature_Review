{"grounding": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an emerging tobamovirus. It was first reported in 2015 in Jordan in greenhouse tomatoes and now threatens tomato and pepper crops around the world. ToBRFV is a stable and highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted by mechanical means and via seeds, which enables it to spread locally and over long distances. The ability of ToBRFV to infect tomato plants harboring the commonly deployed Tm resistance genes, as well as pepper plants harboring the L resistance alleles under certain conditions, limits the ability to prevent damage from the virus. The fruit production and quality of ToBRFV-infected tomato and pepper plants can be drastically affected, thus significantly impacting their market value. Herein, we review the current information and discuss the latest areas of research on this virus, which include its discovery and distribution, epidemiology, detection, and prevention and control measures, that could help mitigate the ToBRFV disease pandemic.", "generated_text": "Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a member of the Tobamovirus genus, has emerged as a significant threat to global tomato and pepper production. This study reviews the current state of knowledge regarding ToBRFV, including its transmission via seeds and mechanical means, and the critical role of seed hygiene in preventing its spread. We also examine the development of resistant cultivars and the implementation of integrated management strategies to control the virus. Findings indicate that while seed testing and sanitation practices are essential, the development of resistant varieties remains a priority for long-term management. This review underscores the need for collaborative efforts among researchers, breeders, and growers to mitigate the impact of ToBRFV on crop yields and economic stability.", "label": 1}
