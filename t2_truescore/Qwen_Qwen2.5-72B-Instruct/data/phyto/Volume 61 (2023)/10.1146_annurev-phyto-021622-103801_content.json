{"grounding": "\nPhytophthora capsici is a destructive oomycete pathogen of vegetable, ornamental, and tropical crops. First described by L.H. Leonian in 1922 as a pathogen of pepper in New Mexico, USA, P. capsici is now widespread in temperate and tropical countries alike. Phytophthora capsici is notorious for its capability to evade disease management strategies. High genetic diversity allows P. capsici populations to overcome fungicides and host resistance, the formation of oospores results in long-term persistence in soils, zoospore differentiation in the presence of water increases epidemic potential, and a broad host range maximizes economic losses and limits the effectiveness of crop rotation. The severity of disease caused by P. capsici and management challenges have led to numerous research efforts in the past 100 years. Here, we discuss recent findings regarding the biology, genetic diversity, disease management, fungicide resistance, host resistance, genomics, and effector biology of P. capsici.", "generated_text": "Phytophthora capsici, a destructive oomycete pathogen, has been a significant threat to vegetable crops worldwide since its initial description a century ago. Recent advancements in understanding its fundamental biology have shed light on its genetic diversity, host range, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Studies have revealed the importance of effector proteins in host manipulation and the role of environmental factors in disease development. Despite these insights, the management of P. capsici remains challenging due to its rapid adaptation and the emergence of fungicide resistance. Integrated disease management strategies, including resistant cultivars, cultural practices, and the judicious use of fungicides, are crucial for sustainable control. This review summarizes the latest findings on the biology of P. capsici and highlights the current approaches and future directions for managing this economically important plant pathogen.", "label": 1}
