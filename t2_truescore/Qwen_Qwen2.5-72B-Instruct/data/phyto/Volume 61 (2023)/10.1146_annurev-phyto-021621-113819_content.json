{"grounding": "Understanding the coevolutionary history of plants, pathogens, and disease resistance is vital for plant pathology. Here, I review Francis O. Holmes's work with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) framed by the foundational work of Nikolai Vavilov on the geographic centers of origin of plants and crop wild relatives (CWRs) and T. Harper Goodspeed's taxonomy of the genus Nicotiana. Holmes developed a hypothesis that the origin of host resistance to viruses was due to coevolution of both at a geographic center. In the 1950s, Holmes proved that genetic resistance to TMV, especially dominant R-genes, was centered in South America for Nicotiana and other solanaceous plants, including Capsicum, potato, and tomato. One seeming exception was eggplant (Solanum melongena). Not until the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s and recent advances in evolutionary taxonomy did it become evident that northeast Africa was the home of eggplant CWRs, far from Holmes's geographic center for TMV\u2013R-gene coevolution. Unbeknownst to most plant pathologists, Holmes's ideas predated those of H.H. Flor, including experimental proof of the gene-for-gene interaction, identification of R-genes, and deployment of dominant host genes to protect crop plants from virus-associated yield losses.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate coevolutionary dynamics between viruses and their plant hosts within geographic centers of diversity, focusing on the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) as a model system. By integrating data from molecular phylogenetics, historical biogeography, and plate tectonics, we elucidate the long-term evolutionary arms race between host resistance and viral adaptation. Our findings reveal that centers of crop diversity, such as those in the Andes and Mesoamerica, have served as hotspots for the coevolution of plant resistance genes and viral countermeasures. The analysis of viral genome sequences and host resistance loci indicates a pattern of recurrent selection and diversification, driven by the dynamic interplay between host and pathogen. Additionally, the role of plate tectonics in shaping the distribution of these interactions is highlighted, suggesting that geological events have influenced the spatial and temporal patterns of host\u2013pathogen coevolution. This research underscores the importance of understanding these coevolutionary processes for the development of sustainable strategies to manage plant diseases in agricultural systems.", "label": 0}
