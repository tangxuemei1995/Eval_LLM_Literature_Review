{"grounding": "The plant immune system perceives pathogens to trigger defense responses. In turn, pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert these defense responses. The initiation and maintenance of defense responses involve not only de novo synthesis of regulatory proteins and enzymes but also their regulated degradation. The latter is achieved through protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). The UPS regulates all stages of immunity, from the perception of the pathogen to the execution of the response, and, therefore, constitutes an ideal candidate for microbial manipulation of the host. Pathogen effector molecules interfere with the plant UPS through several mechanisms. This includes hijacking general UPS functions or perturbing its ability to degrade specific targets. In this review, we describe how the UPS regulates different immunity-related processes and how pathogens subvert this to promote disease.", "generated_text": "The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS) is a critical regulatory mechanism in plants, governing protein degradation and maintaining proteostasis. Pathogens have evolved sophisticated effector proteins to manipulate the UPS, thereby subverting plant immunity and promoting infection. These effectors can interfere with ubiquitination processes, target key immune regulators for degradation, or mimic host proteins to evade detection. Understanding how pathogens exploit the UPS provides insights into plant defense mechanisms and offers potential targets for developing resistance strategies. This review highlights recent advances in elucidating the molecular interactions between plant UPS components and microbial effectors, emphasizing the dynamic interplay that shapes plant\u2013pathogen coevolution.", "label": 1}
