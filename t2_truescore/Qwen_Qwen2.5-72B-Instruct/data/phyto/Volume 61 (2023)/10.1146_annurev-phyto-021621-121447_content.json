{"grounding": "The microbiota populating the plant\u2013soil continuum defines an untapped resource for sustainable crop production. The host plant is a driver for the taxonomic composition and function of these microbial communities. In this review, we illustrate how the host genetic determinants of the microbiota have been shaped by plant domestication and crop diversification. We discuss how the heritable component of microbiota recruitment may represent, at least partially, a selection for microbial functions underpinning the growth, development, and health of their host plants and how the magnitude of this heritability is influenced by the environment. We illustrate how host\u2013microbiota interactions can be treated as an external quantitative trait and review recent studies associating crop genetics with microbiota-based quantitative traits. We also explore the results of reductionist approaches, including synthetic microbial communities, to establish causal relationships between microbiota and plant phenotypes. Lastly, we propose strategies to integrate microbiota manipulation into crop selection programs. Although a detailed understanding of when and how heritability for microbiota composition can be deployed for breeding purposes is still lacking, we argue that advances in crop genomics are likely to accelerate wider applications of plant\u2013microbiota interactions in agriculture.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between plants and their associated microbiota has been a focal point of agricultural research, particularly in the context of crop improvement. This study explores the potential of engineering the crop microbiota through host genetics, leveraging the natural co-evolutionary processes that have occurred during domestication. By analyzing the root and rhizosphere microbiomes of diverse crop species, we identify key genetic loci that influence microbial community composition. Our findings suggest that specific plant traits, such as root architecture and exudate profiles, can be selectively bred to enhance beneficial microbial associations. This approach not only optimizes plant health and productivity but also reduces the reliance on chemical inputs. Through a combination of genomic and metagenomic analyses, we demonstrate that targeted plant breeding can significantly alter the microbiota, leading to improved nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. This research paves the way for a new era of sustainable agriculture, where the manipulation of plant-microbe interactions through host genetics plays a central role in crop improvement.", "label": 0}
