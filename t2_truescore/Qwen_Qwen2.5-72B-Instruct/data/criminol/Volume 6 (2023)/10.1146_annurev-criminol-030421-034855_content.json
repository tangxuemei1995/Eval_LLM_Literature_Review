{"grounding": "This autobiographical review is about a research life unusually oriented to the long-term study of organizational crime, peace, and crisis prevention. Most ambitions proved half-baked. Hopes for a more sweeping macrocriminology of freedom will doubtless remain half-baked when cooking ceases. None of the author's mentors bear responsibility for the mess left in the kitchen from attempts to understand how to grow freedom and prevent crime and war. Messy kitchens must sometimes become even messier before they create the best kind of challenge for the tidier minds that clean them up.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the concept of 'Predatory Peace,' where periods of ostensible calm are marred by underlying criminal activities, cybercrime, and environmental degradation. It argues for a broader understanding of peace that encompasses not only the absence of war but also the active protection of the environment and the rule of law. Through an interdisciplinary approach, including insights from criminology, environmental science, and conflict studies, the paper highlights the need for a more holistic and sustainable model of peace. An autobiographical reflection provides a personal perspective on the complexities of achieving true peace in a world fraught with hidden threats.", "label": 0}
