{"grounding": "This review situates the recent, radical challenges to American criminal justice\u2014calls to end mass incarceration, defund the police, and dismantle systemic racism\u2014within the broader social and economic arrangements that make the US system so distinctive and so problematic. It describes the social structures, institutions, and processes that give rise to America's extraordinary penal state\u2014as well as to its extraordinarily high rates of homicide and social disorder\u2014and considers what these portend for the prospect of radical change. It does so by locating American crime and punishment in the structural context of America's (always-already racialized) political economy\u2014a distinctive set of social structures and institutional legacies that render the United States more violent, more disorderly, and more reliant on penal control than any other developed nation. Drawing on a broad range of social science research findings, it argues that this peculiar political economy\u2014a form of capitalism and democratic governance forged on the anvils of slavery and racial segregation and rendered increasingly insecure and exclusionary in the decades following deindustrialization\u2014generates high levels of social disorganization and criminal violence and predisposes state authorities to adopt penal control as the preferred policy response.", "generated_text": "This paper provides a comprehensive structural analysis of the current crisis in the American criminal justice system, focusing on the interrelated issues of mass incarceration, police killings, and criminal violence. By examining the political economy and the role of the welfare state, the study reveals how these factors contribute to the perpetuation of social control mechanisms that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The analysis highlights the historical and contemporary policies that have led to the overcriminalization of poverty and the racialization of justice. The paper argues that a fundamental restructuring of the criminal justice system is necessary to address these systemic issues, including the reallocation of resources from punitive measures to social welfare programs. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on incarceration and policing as primary methods of social control, thereby fostering a more equitable and just society.", "label": 0}
