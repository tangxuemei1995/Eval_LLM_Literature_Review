{"grounding": "The victims of volume crime in England and Wales are aided by a major institution, Victim Support, but their voices are rarely heard when policy matters are discussed. Many victims of traumatic crimes are organized and purposeful, but they have not come together into a united front. It is the English and Welsh groups supporting abused women, groups amounting to a social movement, that have made the most visible impression on the politics of criminal justice reform at a time when there were widely publicized killings of women and a bill on domestic violence was passing through Parliament at the end of 2021.", "generated_text": "This study examines the pivotal role of victim advocacy in shaping criminal justice reform in England and Wales, highlighting the contributions of the women's movement. Through a comprehensive review of legislative changes and policy developments, the research underscores how victim support services have evolved to address the needs of marginalized groups, particularly women. The findings reveal that victim advocacy has not only improved the treatment of victims within the justice system but has also influenced broader societal attitudes towards victimization. The study concludes with recommendations for enhancing victim support frameworks to further empower victims and promote systemic change.", "label": 0}
