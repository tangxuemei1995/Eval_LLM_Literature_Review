{"grounding": "Use of probation and parole has declined since its peak in 2007 but still intrudes into the lives of 3.9 million Americans at a scale deemed mass supervision. Originally intended as an alternative to incarceration and a means of rehabilitation for those who have committed crimes, supervision often functions as a trip wire for further criminal legal system contact. This review questions the utility of supervision, as research shows that, in toto, it currently provides neither diversion from incarceration nor rehabilitation. Analysis of national supervision, crime, and carceral data since 1980 reveals that supervision has little effect on future crime and is not a replacement for incarceration. Case studies from California and New York City indicate that concerted efforts to reduce the scope of mass supervision can effectively be achieved through sentencing reform, case diversion, and supervisory/legal system department policy change, among other factors, without increasing crime. Therefore, we suggest extensive downsizing of supervision or experimentation with its abolition and offer actionable steps to enact each possibility.", "generated_text": "This study explores the minimum level of supervision required for effective community supervision programs, including probation and parole, in the context of mass supervision. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis of data from various jurisdictions, the research identifies key factors that influence the success of minimally supervised individuals. The findings suggest that a tailored, risk-based approach can significantly reduce the need for intensive supervision without compromising public safety or recidivism rates. The study also highlights the importance of leveraging technology and community resources to support individuals under supervision. Policy recommendations are provided to guide the implementation of more efficient and effective community supervision practices, emphasizing the potential for reducing the overall burden of mass supervision while maintaining or improving outcomes.", "label": 0}
