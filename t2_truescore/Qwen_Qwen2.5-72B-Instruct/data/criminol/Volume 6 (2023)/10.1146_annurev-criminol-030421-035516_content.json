{"grounding": "Recent years have seen increasing interest in, and scholarly discussion of, historical criminology. Yet there remains at present no clear, settled view as to what historical criminology entails, how it is best pursued, and what its future might hold. This article explores the several conceptions of historical criminology found in the present literature, which associate it variously with archival research, practical inquiry, a concern with temporality, and a certain approach to interdisciplinary scholarship. Adopting the view that historical criminology entails a special regard for historical time, the review goes on to assess its significance to the wider field, examining its connection with some of the core impulses of criminology at large. Finally, it suggests some major opportunities for historical criminology to contribute to the future development of criminology, including through an inclusive global criminology, a criminology of events, and research on crime and justice futures.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the scope, significance, and future directions of historical criminology, a field that bridges the gap between criminology and history. By examining criminal justice systems, legal practices, and societal responses to crime over historical time, historical criminology offers unique insights into the evolution of crime and punishment. The interdisciplinary nature of this field, integrating methodologies from sociology, law, and history, enhances our understanding of the complex dynamics that shape criminal behavior and its regulation. This review highlights key contributions, including the analysis of archival data, the study of penal institutions, and the examination of social control mechanisms. Future research should focus on expanding the temporal and geographical scope of studies, incorporating digital humanities tools, and fostering collaboration across disciplines to address contemporary criminological issues through a historical lens.", "label": 1}
