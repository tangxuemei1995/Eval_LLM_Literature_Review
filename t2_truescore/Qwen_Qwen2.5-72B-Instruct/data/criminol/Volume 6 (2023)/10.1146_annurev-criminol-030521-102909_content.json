{"grounding": "The number of cross-national homicide studies is increasing rapidly. Many scholars, however, do not consider the details of how individual nations and the four main centralized homicide data sources\u2014raw estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, adjusted estimates from the WHO Global Health Observatory, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and World Bank World Development Indicators\u2014generate national homicide rates and the impact this may have on results and the scientific record. We tested whether homicide trends, levels, and structural covariates are dependent on data source. We used 1990\u20132018 data in 5-year groupings and pooled them over time and nation. We utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to look for differences in homicide rates and trends. Then we employed seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to determine whether associations with homicide of typical structural covariates were dependent on homicide data source. Finally, we examined Wald Tests to determine whether differences in the sizes of the SUR coefficients from each data source were significantly different from zero. We found differences in homicide trends and rates by data source and that associations with homicide rates of structural covariates varied in significance, magnitude, and even direction depending on homicide data source. Cross-national homicideresearch has a promising future for understanding short- and long-term global and regional trends and population-level covariates and constructing theoretical explanations for geographical and temporal variation. However, researchers must better understand how national homicide data are generated by nations and these four data sources. All four systems possess limitations, but homicide data from the WHO Mortality Database present the most attractive option.", "generated_text": "This review and analysis explores the complexities and challenges associated with the measurement of homicide in cross-national research. Homicide, a critical indicator of societal health and safety, is often subject to varying definitions, reporting practices, and data collection methods across different countries. These discrepancies can significantly impact the comparability and reliability of cross-national studies, leading to potential misinterpretations of trends and patterns. The paper begins by outlining the diverse legal and cultural contexts that influence how homicide is defined and recorded, highlighting the importance of standardization in research methodologies. It then examines the role of official statistics, such as those from police and judicial systems, and the limitations these sources may have, including underreporting and biases. The review also discusses alternative data sources, such as victimization surveys and media reports, and evaluates their strengths and weaknesses in providing a more comprehensive picture of homicide rates. Finally, the paper proposes a set of best practices for researchers, emphasizing the need for transparent and consistent measurement techniques, the integration of multiple data sources, and the consideration of contextual factors. By addressing these issues, the study aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of cross-national homicide research, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the global landscape of violent crime.", "label": 0}
