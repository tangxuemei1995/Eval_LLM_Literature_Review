{"grounding": "This review collects and critiques the academic literature on criminal defense lawyering, with an emphasis on empirical work. Research on criminal defense attorneys in the United States has traditionally emphasized scarcity of resources: too many people facing criminal charges who are \u201ctoo poor to pay\u201d for counsel and not enough funding to pay for the constitutionally mandated lawyers. Scholars have focused on the capacity of different delivery systems, such as public defender offices, to change the ultimate outcomes in criminal cases within their tight budgetary constraints. Over the decades, however, theoretical understandings of the defense attorney's work have expanded to include client interests outside the criminal courtroom, reaching the broader social conditions connected to the alleged criminal act. Researchers have responded by asking a broader range of questions about the effectiveness of defense counsel outside the courtroom and by using improved data to study the effectiveness of lawyers at discrete procedural stages.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering, a holistic approach that goes beyond traditional legal representation to address the multifaceted needs of defendants, particularly those from indigent backgrounds. By integrating social work, mental health services, and community resources, this model aims to provide more effective assistance of counsel, thereby enhancing the right to counsel and reducing the likelihood of mass incarceration. The study reviews existing literature on holistic defense strategies, examines case studies of successful implementation, and identifies key challenges and opportunities for reform. Findings suggest that expanded criminal defense lawyering not only improves client outcomes but also contributes to a more just and equitable criminal justice system. Implications for policy and practice are discussed, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and systemic changes to support this comprehensive approach to indigent defense.", "label": 0}
