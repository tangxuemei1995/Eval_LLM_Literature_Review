{"grounding": "Ethnographic studies of immigration and crime were prominent in the early decades of the twentieth century, yet contemporary scholarship has been dominated by quantitative approaches. In this review, we heed the call of those who have lamented the \u201ccollective amnesia\u201d and \u201cnewness fetish\u201d that characterize much of contemporary criminology and revisit classic ethnographies of immigration and crime, with an emphasis on the unique methodological contributions of this early work. Next, we synthesize the small but growing body of contemporary ethnographic research on immigration and crime, which includes the policing of immigrant communities in the age of \u201ccrimmigration;\u201d the lived experiences inside contemporary deportation/detention regimes; the integration experiences of Muslims, a highly marginalized but understudied population; and immigrants\u2019 unique vulnerabilities to and experiences of victimization, to illustrate the value of qualitative approaches for capturing the nuances of immigrants\u2019 experiences in the new age of immigration.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the resurgence of ethnographic studies in the field of immigration and crime, drawing on the foundational work of the Chicago School. By employing qualitative methods, contemporary researchers are delving into the complex social dynamics that shape the experiences of new immigrants and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The study highlights how modern ethnographies of migration offer nuanced insights into the structural and cultural factors that influence immigrant involvement in crime, challenging simplistic narratives of immigrant criminality. Through in-depth fieldwork and participant observation, this research not only enriches our understanding of the immigrant experience but also provides critical policy recommendations for more inclusive and effective crime prevention strategies.", "label": 0}
