{"grounding": "As with past pandemics of influenza, COVID-19 tore through US prisons and jails; however, the COVID-19 pandemic, uniquely, has led to more health research on carceral systems than has been seen to date. Herein, we review the data on its impact on incarcerated people, correctional officers, health systems, and surrounding communities. We searched medical, sociological, and criminology databases from March 2020 through February 2022 for studies examining the intersection of COVID-19, prisons and jails, and health outcomes, including COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, hospitalizations, and vaccination. Our scoping review identified 77 studies\u2014the bulk of which focus on disease epidemiology in carceral systems, with a small minority that focuses on the efficacy or effectiveness of prevention and mitigation efforts, including testing, vaccination, and efforts to depopulate correctional facilities. We highlight areas for future research, including the experiences of incarcerated people and correctional staff, unanticipated health effects of prolonged quarantine, excess deaths due to delays in healthcare, and experimental studies on vaccine uptake and testing in correctional staff. These studies will enable a fuller understanding of COVID-19 and help stem future pandemics.", "generated_text": "This review examines the impact of COVID-19 within carceral systems, focusing on the incidence of the virus, mitigation strategies, and vaccination efforts. Prisons and jails have emerged as hotspots for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 due to overcrowding, limited access to healthcare, and inadequate infection control measures. Studies from various countries highlight the disproportionate burden of the pandemic on incarcerated populations, with infection rates often exceeding those in the general community. Mitigation strategies, including enhanced sanitation, social distancing, and the reduction of inmate populations through early release, have shown mixed results. Vaccination campaigns have been implemented in many facilities, but challenges such as vaccine hesitancy, logistical issues, and the transient nature of jail populations have hindered efforts. This review synthesizes current evidence to inform policy and practice, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, evidence-based approaches to protect the health of incarcerated individuals and the broader community.", "label": 1}
