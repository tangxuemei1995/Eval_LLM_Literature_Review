{"grounding": "Genetic manipulation is necessary to interrogate the functions of microbes in their environments, such as the human gut microbiome. Yet, the vast majority of human gut microbiome species are not genetically tractable. Here, we review the hurdles to seizing genetic control of more species. We address the barriers preventing the application of genetic techniques to gut microbes and report on genetic systems currently under development. While methods aimed at genetically transforming many species simultaneously in situ show promise, they are unable to overcome many of the same challenges that exist for individual microbes. Unless a major conceptual breakthrough emerges, the genetic tractability of the microbiome will remain an arduous task. Increasing the list of genetically tractable organisms from the human gut remains one of the highest priorities for microbiome research and will provide the foundation for microbiome engineering.", "generated_text": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet the genetic manipulation of its members remains a significant challenge. This study aims to expand the repertoire of genetically tractable gut bacteria by developing novel genetic tools and methods. We successfully engineered a diverse set of gut commensals, including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Akkermansia species, to express foreign genes and to introduce precise genetic modifications. These advancements facilitate the study of microbial functions and interactions within the gut ecosystem, paving the way for microbiome engineering applications in therapeutics and diagnostics. Our findings represent a significant step toward harnessing the full potential of the gut microbiome for human health.", "label": 0}
