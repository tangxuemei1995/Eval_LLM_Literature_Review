{"grounding": "Related groups of microbes are widely distributed across Earth's habitats, implying numerous dispersal and adaptation events over evolutionary time. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics and mechanisms of these habitat transitions, particularly for populations that reside in animal microbiomes. Here, we review the literature concerning habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal lineages, considering the frequency of migration events, potential environmental barriers, and mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical conditions, including the modification of protein inventories and other genomic characteristics. Cells dependent on microbial hosts, particularly bacteria from the Candidate Phyla Radiation, have undergone repeated habitat transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. We compare their trajectories to those of both free-living cells\u2014including the Melainabacteria, Elusimicrobia, and methanogenic archaea\u2014and cellular endosymbionts and bacteriophages, which have made similar transitions. We conclude by highlighting major related topics that may be worthy of future study.", "generated_text": "The evolution of bacteria and archaea has been profoundly influenced by habitat transitions, which have driven diversification and adaptation. This study explores the mechanisms of dispersal and adaptation in microbial lineages, particularly focusing on the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria and their role in the human microbiome. By integrating environmental microbiology with genomic analyses, we reveal how these microorganisms have adapted to diverse environments, from extreme thermal vents to the human gut. Our findings highlight the importance of horizontal gene transfer and metabolic flexibility in facilitating habitat transitions. The implications of these transitions for microbial ecology and human health are discussed, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of microbial evolution across different ecological niches.", "label": 0}
