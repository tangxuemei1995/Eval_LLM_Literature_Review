{"grounding": "The immune system of multicellular organisms protects them from harmful microbes. To establish an infection in the face of host immune responses, pathogens must evolve specific strategies to target immune defense mechanisms. One such defense is the formation of intracellular protein complexes, termed inflammasomes, that are triggered by the detection of microbial components and the disruption of homeostatic processes that occur during bacterial infection. Formation of active inflammasomes initiates programmed cell death pathways via activation of inflammatory caspases and cleavage of target proteins. Inflammasome-activated cell death pathways such as pyroptosis lead to proinflammatory responses that protect the host. Bacterial infection has the capacity to influence inflammasomes in two distinct ways: activation and perturbation. In this review, we discuss how bacterial activities influence inflammasomes, and we discuss the consequences of inflammasome activation or evasion for both the host and pathogen.", "generated_text": "Inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1 and caspase-8, play a pivotal role in innate immunity and inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted the intricate interplay between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling, revealing both collaborative and antagonistic interactions. Bacterial components, such as lipopolysaccharides and flagellin, can trigger NLR family proteins, leading to the assembly of inflammasomes and subsequent activation of caspase-1. This activation results in the cleavage of gasdermin D, promoting pyroptosis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to inhibit inflammasome activation, thereby evading host immune responses. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which bacteria influence inflammasome signaling, emphasizing the dual roles of bacterial factors in either promoting or suppressing inflammasome-mediated immune responses.", "label": 0}
