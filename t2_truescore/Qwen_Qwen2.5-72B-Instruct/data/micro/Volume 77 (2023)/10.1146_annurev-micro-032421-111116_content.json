{"grounding": "TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) are present in all gram-negative bacteria and mediate energy-dependent uptake of molecules that are too scarce or large to be taken up efficiently by outer membrane (OM) diffusion channels. This process requires energy that is derived from the proton motive force and delivered to TBDTs by the TonB-ExbBD motor complex in the inner membrane. Together with the need to preserve the OM permeability barrier, this has led to an extremely complex and fascinating transport mechanism for which the fundamentals, despite decades of research, are still unclear. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the transport mechanism of TBDTs, their potential role in the delivery of novel antibiotics, and the important contributions made by TBDT-associated (lipo)proteins.", "generated_text": "TonB-dependent transport systems are essential for the active transport of various substrates across the bacterial outer membrane, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. These systems, composed of outer membrane receptors, the TonB complex, and periplasmic proteins, facilitate the uptake of nutrients and iron siderophores. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of these systems as targets for Trojan horse antibiotics, which can exploit the transport mechanism to gain entry into the bacterial cell. This review focuses on the structural and functional aspects of TonB-dependent transporters, with a particular emphasis on the \u03b2-barrel proteins that form the outer membrane channels. The implications for developing novel antimicrobial strategies against Bacteroidetes and other Gram-negative pathogens are discussed.", "label": 1}
