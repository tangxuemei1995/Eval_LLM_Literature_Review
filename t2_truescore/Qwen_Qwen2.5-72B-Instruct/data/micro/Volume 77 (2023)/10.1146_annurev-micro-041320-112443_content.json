{"grounding": "Fungal species have dynamic genomes and often exhibit genomic plasticity in response to stress. This genome plasticity often comes with phenotypic consequences that affect fitness and resistance to stress. Fungal pathogens exhibit genome plasticity in both clinical and agricultural settings and often during adaptation to antifungal drugs, posing significant challenges to human health. Therefore, it is important to understand the rates, mechanisms, and impact of large genomic changes. This review addresses the prevalence of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation across diverse fungal species, with special attention to prominent fungal pathogens and model species. We also explore the relationship between environmental stress and rates of genomic changes and highlight the mechanisms underlying genotypic and phenotypic changes. A comprehensive understanding of these dynamic fungal genomes is needed to identify novel solutions for the increase in antifungal drug resistance.", "generated_text": "Fungi exhibit remarkable genome plasticity, enabling rapid adaptation to diverse and stressful environments. This study explores the roles of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation (CNV) in fungal genome dynamics under stress conditions. Through comprehensive genomic analyses of multiple fungal species, we demonstrate that polyploidy and aneuploidy are frequent responses to environmental stressors, such as nutrient limitation and exposure to antifungal agents. CNV, particularly in genes related to metabolism and stress response, further contributes to adaptive phenotypic variation. These genomic changes enhance survival and fitness, highlighting the importance of genome plasticity in fungal evolution and adaptation. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying fungal resilience and have implications for understanding the evolution of pathogenicity and drug resistance.", "label": 1}
