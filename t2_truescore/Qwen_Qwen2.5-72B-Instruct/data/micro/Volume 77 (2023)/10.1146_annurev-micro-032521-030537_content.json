{"grounding": "\nRalstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) strains are devastating plant pathogens distributed worldwide. The primary cell density\u2013dependent gene expression system in RSSC strains is phc quorum sensing (QS). It regulates the expression of about 30% of all genes, including those related to cellular activity, primary and secondary metabolism, pathogenicity, and more. The phc regulatory elements encoded by the phcBSRQ operon and phcA gene play vital roles. RSSC strains use methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) or methyl 3-hydroxypalmitate (3-OH PAME) as the QS signal. Each type of RSSC strain has specificity in generating and receiving its QS signal, but their signaling pathways might not differ significantly. In this review, I describe the genetic and biochemical factors involved in QS signal input and the regulatory network and summarize control of the phc QS system, new cell\u2013cell communications, and QS-dependent interactions with soil fungi.", "generated_text": "The phc quorum-sensing (QS) system in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex, including R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum, plays a crucial role in regulating cell\u2013cell communication, pathogenicity, and virulence. This system, primarily mediated by the PhcA transcriptional regulator and the PhcB, PhcC, and PhcR signaling molecules, coordinates the expression of genes involved in bacterial motility, biofilm formation, and the production of extracellular enzymes and toxins. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate signaling pathways and regulatory networks that underpin the phc QS system, highlighting its importance in the adaptation and survival of these pathogens in diverse environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms of the phc QS system is essential for developing novel strategies to control the spread and impact of R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum, which are significant threats to global agriculture.", "label": 1}
