{"grounding": "Among endosymbiotic bacteria living within eukaryotic cells, Wolbachia is exceptionally widespread, particularly in arthropods. Inherited through the female germline, it has evolved ways to increase the fraction of bacterially infected offspring by inducing parthenogenesis, feminization, male killing, or, most commonly, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, Wolbachia infection of males causes embryonic lethality unless they mate with similarly infected females, creating a relative reproductive advantage for infected females. A set of related Wolbachia bicistronic operons encodes the CI-inducing factors. The downstream gene encodes a deubiquitylase or nuclease and is responsible for CI induction by males, while the upstream product when expressed in females binds its sperm-introduced cognate partner and rescues viability. Both toxin-antidote and host-modification mechanisms have been proposed to explain CI. Interestingly, male killing by either Spiroplasma or Wolbachia endosymbionts involves deubiquitylases as well. Interference with the host ubiquitin system may therefore be a common theme among endosymbiont-mediated reproductive alterations.", "generated_text": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a reproductive manipulation induced by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, results in embryonic lethality when infected males mate with uninfected females or females infected with a different Wolbachia strain. This phenomenon is mediated by a toxin-antidote system, where the CI factor (CifA) acts as a toxin and the rescue factor (CifB) as an antidote. Recent studies have identified CifA and CifB as a nuclease and a deubiquitylase, respectively, suggesting that CI is regulated through post-translational modifications and DNA damage responses. Additionally, Wolbachia can induce male killing, another reproductive manipulation, which eliminates male embryos to increase the relative fitness of infected females. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying CI and male killing, highlighting the roles of CifA and CifB in these processes and their implications for population dynamics and vector control strategies.", "label": 1}
