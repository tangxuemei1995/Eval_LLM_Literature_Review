{"grounding": "Fungal-mediated disease progression and antifungal drug efficacy are significantly impacted by the dynamic infection microenvironment. At the site of infection, oxygen often becomes limiting and induces a hypoxia response in both the fungal pathogen and host cells. The fungal hypoxia response impacts several important aspects of fungal biology that contribute to pathogenesis, virulence, antifungal drug susceptibility, and ultimately infection outcomes. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the hypoxia response in the most common human fungal pathogens, discuss potential therapeutic opportunities, and highlight important areas for future research.", "generated_text": "Recent studies have elucidated the critical role of hypoxia in the virulence and disease progression of human fungal pathogens. These pathogens adapt to low oxygen environments, enhancing their survival and resistance to antifungal drugs. Mechanisms such as altered gene expression and metabolic reprogramming under hypoxic conditions contribute to fungal virulence. Understanding these adaptations is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the latest findings on how hypoxia influences fungal pathogenesis and highlights potential targets for antifungal interventions.", "label": 1}
