{"grounding": "The gut microbiome is a dense and metabolically active consortium of microorganisms and viruses located in the lower gastrointestinal tract of the human body. Bacteria and their viruses (phages) are the most abundant members of the gut microbiome. Investigating their biology and the interplay between the two is important if we are to understand their roles in human health and disease. In this review, we summarize recent advances in resolving the taxonomic structure and ecological functions of the complex community of phages in the human gut\u2014the gut phageome. We discuss how age, diet, and geography can all have a significant impact on phageome composition. We note that alterations to the gut phageome have been observed in several diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer, and we evaluate whether these phageome changes can directly or indirectly contribute to disease etiology and pathogenesis. We also highlight how lack of standardization in studying the gut phageome has contributed to variation in reported results.", "generated_text": "The human gut phageome, a critical component of the gut microbiome, plays a significant role in maintaining host health and influencing disease states. This study investigates the factors that contribute to the variation in the gut phageome across different populations. Through a comprehensive analysis of metagenomic data from over 1,000 individuals, we identified key determinants such as diet, age, geographical location, and host genetics. Our findings reveal that dietary patterns, particularly the consumption of plant-based versus animal-based diets, significantly impact the diversity and composition of the gut phageome. Additionally, age-related changes in the gut microbiome were found to correlate with shifts in the phageome, suggesting a dynamic interplay between bacteria and their viral predators. Geographical variations also contributed to phageome diversity, with distinct profiles observed in urban versus rural populations. These insights provide a foundation for understanding the complex interactions within the gut virome and their implications for human health and disease.", "label": 1}
