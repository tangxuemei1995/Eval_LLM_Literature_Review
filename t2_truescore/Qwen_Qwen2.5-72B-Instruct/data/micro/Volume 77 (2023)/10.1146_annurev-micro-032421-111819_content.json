{"grounding": "Amino acids are indispensable substrates for protein synthesis in all organisms and incorporated into diverse aspects of metabolic physiology and signaling. However, animals lack the ability to synthesize several of them and must acquire these essential amino acids from their diet or perhaps their associated microbial communities. The essential amino acids therefore occupy a unique position in the health of animals and their relationships with microbes. Here we review recent work connecting microbial production and metabolism of essential amino acids to host biology, and the reciprocal impacts of host metabolism of essential amino acids on their associated microbes. We focus on the roles of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and tryptophan on host-microbe communication in the intestine of humans and other vertebrates. We then conclude by highlighting research questions surrounding the less-understood aspects of microbial essential amino acid synthesis in animal hosts.", "generated_text": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the metabolism of essential amino acids (EAAs), which in turn influences host health through the production of various chemical mediators. This review focuses on the microbial metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as valine, isoleucine, and leucine, as well as tryptophan, and their downstream metabolites. These metabolites, including indoles and short-chain fatty acids, can modulate host physiological processes, such as immune function, gut barrier integrity, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Notably, the microbial conversion of tryptophan to serotonin has been linked to mood regulation and gut motility. Understanding the intricate interplay between host and microbial metabolism of EAAs is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote gut health and treat related disorders.", "label": 1}
