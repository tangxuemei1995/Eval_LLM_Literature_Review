{"grounding": "Apicomplexan parasites constitute more than 6,000 species infecting a wide range of hosts. These include important pathogens such as those causing malaria and toxoplasmosis. Their evolutionary emergence coincided with the dawn of animals. Mitochondrial genomes of apicomplexan parasites have undergone dramatic reduction in their coding capacity, with genes for only three proteins and ribosomal RNA genes present in scrambled fragments originating from both strands. Different branches of the apicomplexans have undergone rearrangements of these genes, with Toxoplasma having massive variations in gene arrangements spread over multiple copies. The vast evolutionary distance between the parasite and the host mitochondria has been exploited for the development of antiparasitic drugs, especially those used to treat malaria, wherein inhibition of the parasite mitochondrial respiratory chain is selectively targeted with little toxicity to the host mitochondria. We describe additional unique characteristics of the parasite mitochondria that are being investigated and provide greater insights into these deep-branching eukaryotic pathogens.", "generated_text": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, are significant pathogens causing diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. These organisms belong to the Myzozoa, a group characterized by unique mitochondrial properties. Apicomplexan mitochondria exhibit distinctive features in their electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase, which differ from those of their mammalian hosts. The ETC in these parasites often lacks complex I and has a modified complex III, while complex IV is present but with altered subunit composition. Additionally, the ATP synthase in apicomplexans has unique structural and functional characteristics, making it a potential target for antiparasitic drugs. Understanding these unique properties is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that selectively target apicomplexan mitochondria without affecting host cells.", "label": 1}
