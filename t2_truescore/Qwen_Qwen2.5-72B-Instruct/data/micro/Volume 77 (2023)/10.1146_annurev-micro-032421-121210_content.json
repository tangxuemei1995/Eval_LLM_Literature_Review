{"grounding": "Infections caused by malaria parasites place an enormous burden on the world's poorest communities. Breakthrough drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. As an organism that undergoes rapid growth and division, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is highly reliant on protein synthesis, which in turn requires aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to charge tRNAs with their corresponding amino acid. Protein translation is required at all stages of the parasite life cycle; thus, aaRS inhibitors have the potential for whole-of-life-cycle antimalarial activity. This review focuses on efforts to identify potent plasmodium-specific aaRS inhibitors using phenotypic screening, target validation, and structure-guided drug design. Recent work reveals that aaRSs are susceptible targets for a class of AMP-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates that target the enzymes via a novel reaction hijacking mechanism. This finding opens up the possibility of generating bespoke inhibitors of different aaRSs, providing new drug leads.", "generated_text": "Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a critical role in the accurate translation of the genetic code by charging tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, aaRSs represent a promising target for antimalarial drug development. This review highlights recent advances in understanding the unique features of Plasmodium aaRSs and their potential as therapeutic targets. Specifically, we discuss the concept of reaction hijacking, a novel strategy that exploits the catalytic activity of aaRSs to introduce toxic substrates into the parasite's protein synthesis machinery. This approach has shown promising results in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the potential of aaRSs as a viable target for the development of new antimalarial drugs. The identification of specific inhibitors and the optimization of their pharmacological properties are ongoing areas of research, with the ultimate goal of addressing the growing challenge of drug-resistant malaria.", "label": 1}
