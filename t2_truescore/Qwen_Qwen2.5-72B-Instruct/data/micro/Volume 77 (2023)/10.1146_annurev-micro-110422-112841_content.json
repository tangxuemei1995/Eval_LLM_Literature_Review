{"grounding": "My scientific career has resulted from key decisions and reorientations, sometimes taken rapidly but not always, guided by discussions or collaborations with amazing individuals from whom I learnt a lot scientifically and humanly. I had never anticipated that I would accomplish so much in what appeared as terra incognita when I started to interrogate the mechanisms underlying the virulence of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. All this has been possible thanks to a number of talented team members who ultimately became friends.", "generated_text": "This review highlights the transformation of Listeria monocytogenes from a foodborne pathogen to a model system in infection biology and cellular microbiology. Postgenomic approaches have unveiled intricate DNA-protein interactions and RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, underscoring its utility in dissecting host-pathogen interactions. The journey of Listeria as a model organism reflects the evolution of microbiological research, integrating molecular, genetic, and systems biology perspectives.", "label": 0}
