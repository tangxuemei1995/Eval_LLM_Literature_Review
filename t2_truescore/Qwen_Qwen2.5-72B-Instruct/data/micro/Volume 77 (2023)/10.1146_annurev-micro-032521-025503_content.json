{"grounding": "Two of the most fascinating bacterial nanomachines\u2014the broadly disseminated rotary flagellum at the heart of cellular motility and the eukaryotic cell\u2013puncturing injectisome essential to specific pathogenic species\u2014utilize at their core a conserved export machinery called the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS not only secretes the components that self-assemble into their extracellular appendages but also, in the case of the injectisome, subsequently directly translocates modulating effector proteins from the bacterial cell into the infected host. The injectisome is thought to have evolved from the flagellum as a minimal secretory system lacking motility, with the subsequent acquisition of additional components tailored to its specialized role in manipulating eukaryotic hosts for pathogenic advantage. Both nanomachines have long been the focus of intense interest, but advances in structural and functional understanding have taken a significant step forward since 2015, facilitated by the revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy technologies. With several seminal structures of each nanomachine now captured, we review here the molecular similarities and differences that underlie their diverse functions.", "generated_text": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are essential for the function of both the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome, playing critical roles in bacterial motility and pathogenicity. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have provided unprecedented structural insights into these complex molecular machines. This study integrates high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions with cryo-ET data to elucidate the architectural and functional similarities and differences between the flagellar T3SS and the injectisome T3SS. Key findings include the identification of conserved structural motifs and unique adaptations that facilitate the specific functions of each system. The detailed structural analysis reveals the dynamic nature of the secretion apparatus, highlighting the mechanisms of substrate recognition, translocation, and assembly. These insights enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of bacterial motility and pathogenesis, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.", "label": 0}
