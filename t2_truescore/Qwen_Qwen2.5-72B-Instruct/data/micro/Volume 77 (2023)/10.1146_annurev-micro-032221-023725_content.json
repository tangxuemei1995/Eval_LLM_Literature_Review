{"grounding": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is the physiological process that enables the reduction or oxidation of molecules and minerals beyond the surface of a microbial cell. The first bacteria characterized with this capability were Shewanella and Geobacter, both reported to couple their growth to the reduction of iron or manganese oxide minerals located extracellularly. A key difference between EET and nearly every other respiratory activity on Earth is the need to transfer electrons beyond the cell membrane. The past decade has resolved how well-conserved strategies conduct electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. However, recent data suggest a much wider and less well understood collection of mechanisms enabling electron transfer to distant acceptors. This review reflects the current state of knowledge from Shewanella and Geobacter, specifically focusing on transfer across the outer membrane and beyond\u2014an activity that enables reduction of highly variable minerals, electrodes, and even other organisms.", "generated_text": "This study explores the mechanisms of extracellular electron transfer (EET) in Shewanella and Geobacter species, focusing on the role of cytochromes and electron shuttles in facilitating electron transfer beyond the outer membrane. These microorganisms are known for their ability to transfer electrons to extracellular acceptors, a process critical for their survival in diverse environments. We investigate the structural and functional properties of outer membrane cytochromes and soluble electron shuttles, which are essential for mediating long-range electron transfer. Our findings reveal that specific cytochrome arrangements and the presence of redox-active molecules significantly enhance the efficiency of EET, enabling these bacteria to utilize a wide range of electron acceptors. This research provides insights into the biogeochemical cycling of elements and has implications for the development of microbial fuel cells and bioremediation technologies.", "label": 1}
