{"grounding": "Plant roots associate with diverse microbes (including bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, and viruses) collectively called the root-associated microbiome. Among them, mycorrhizal fungi colonize host roots and improve their access to nutrients, usually phosphorus and nitrogen. In exchange, plants deliver photosynthetic carbon to the colonizing fungi. This nutrient exchange affects key soil processes, the carbon cycle, and plant health and therefore has a strong influence on the plant and microbe ecosystems. The framework of nutrient exchange and regulation between host plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has recently been established. The local and systemic regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by plant nutrient status and the autoregulation of mycorrhizae are strategies by which plants maintain a stabilizing free-market symbiosis. A better understanding of the synergistic effects between mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizosphere microorganisms is an essential precondition for their use as biofertilizers and bioprotectors for sustainable agriculture and forestry management.", "generated_text": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation, influencing nutrient exchange and ecosystem dynamics. This review explores the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying mycorrhizal associations, the function of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) in facilitating resource sharing, and the role of mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB) in enhancing symbiotic efficiency. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae (ARM) pathway is discussed as a key regulatory mechanism that balances symbiotic interactions. Recent studies highlight the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in improving plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, and pathogen attack. The integration of these findings into ecosystem management practices can enhance soil health and agricultural sustainability. This comprehensive overview underscores the multifaceted benefits of mycorrhizal symbiosis, from individual plant fitness to broader ecological resilience.", "label": 1}
