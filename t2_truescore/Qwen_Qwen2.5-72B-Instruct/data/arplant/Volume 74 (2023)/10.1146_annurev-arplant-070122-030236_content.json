{"grounding": "\ncis-Regulatory elements encode the genomic blueprints that ensure the proper spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression necessary for appropriate development and responses to the environment. Accumulating evidence implicates changes to gene expression as a major source of phenotypic novelty in eukaryotes, including acute phenotypes such as disease and cancer in mammals. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic variation affecting cis-regulatory sequences over longer evolutionary timescales has become a recurring theme in studies of morphological divergence and local adaptation. Here, we discuss the functions of and methods used to identify various classes of cis-regulatory elements, as well as their role in plant development and response to the environment. We highlight opportunities to exploit cis-regulatory variants underlying plant development and environmental responses for crop improvement efforts. Although a comprehensive understanding of cis-regulatory mechanisms in plants has lagged behind that in animals, we showcase several breakthrough findings that have profoundly influenced plant biology and shaped the overall understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.", "generated_text": "cis-Regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in the precise control of gene expression, which is essential for plant development, adaptation, and evolution. These elements, including promoters, enhancers, and silencers, interact with transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to modulate the transcriptional response to environmental cues and developmental signals. Recent advances in genomics and epigenomics have provided insights into the complex regulatory networks involving CREs, revealing their dynamic nature and the importance of chromatin structure in transcription regulation. Studies have shown that CREs are hotspots for evolutionary divergence, contributing to species-specific traits and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Understanding the function and evolution of CREs is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying plant plasticity and for developing strategies to enhance crop resilience in changing environments.", "label": 1}
