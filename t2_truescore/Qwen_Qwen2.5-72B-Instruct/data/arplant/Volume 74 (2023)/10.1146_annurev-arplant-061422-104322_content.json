{"grounding": "Despite the numerous advances made in our understanding of the physiology and molecular genetics of salinity tolerance, there have been relatively few applications of these to improve the salt tolerance of crops. The most significant advances have historically utilized intraspecific variation, introgression of traits from close crop wild relatives, or, less frequently, introgression from more distant relatives. Advanced lines often fail due to difficulties in the introgression or tracking of traits or due to yield penalties associated with the alleles in nonsaline environments. However, the greatest limitation is that salinity is not a primary trait for breeders. We must close the gap between research and delivery, especially for farmers who have precious few alternatives. These efforts should include a reassessment of old techniques such as grafting current crops with salt-tolerant hybrid rootstocks. Alternatively, future crops can be produced via domestication of salt-tolerant wild species\u2014an approach that is now feasible in our lifetime.", "generated_text": "Salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting crop productivity worldwide, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. With the increasing demand for food security, developing salt-tolerant crops has become imperative. This review explores the latest advancements in enhancing salinity tolerance in crops through various approaches, including the utilization of crop wild relatives, neodomestication, and genetic modification. Crop wild relatives, which possess a rich genetic diversity, offer valuable traits for improving salt tolerance. Neodomestication, the process of domesticating wild species, provides an alternative strategy to enhance crop resilience. Genetic modification techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9, have also shown promise in conferring salt tolerance by targeting specific genes involved in ion transport and osmotic adjustment. Integrating these approaches can lead to the development of more robust and productive salt-tolerant crops, contributing significantly to global food security in the face of increasing soil salinity.", "label": 1}
