{"grounding": "The plant hormone auxin is certainly the most studied developmental regulator in plants. The many functions of auxin during development, from the embryo to the root and shoot construction, are mediated by an ever-growing collection of molecular regulators, with an overwhelming degree of both ubiquity and complexity that we are still far from fully understanding and that biological experiments alone cannot grasp. In this review, we discuss how bioinformatics and computational modeling approaches have helped in recent years to explore this complexity and to push the frontiers of our understanding of auxin biology. We focus on how analysis of massive amounts of genomic data and construction of computational models to simulate auxin-regulated processes at different scales have complemented wet experiments to increase the understanding of how auxin acts in the nucleus to regulate transcription and how auxin movement between cells regulates development at the tissular scale.", "generated_text": "Auxin, a key phytohormone, orchestrates plant development through intricate signaling and transport mechanisms. This review integrates recent advances in auxin biology with computational approaches, highlighting the role of bioinformatics and computational modeling in elucidating auxin signaling pathways and polar auxin transport. By leveraging large-scale data sets and sophisticated algorithms, researchers can simulate auxin dynamics, predict gene regulatory networks, and design synthetic auxin-responsive systems. These computational tools not only enhance our understanding of auxin's role in plant development and evolution but also pave the way for innovative applications in synthetic biology. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between molecular biology and computational science, offering new insights into the complex auxin matrix that governs plant growth and form.", "label": 1}
