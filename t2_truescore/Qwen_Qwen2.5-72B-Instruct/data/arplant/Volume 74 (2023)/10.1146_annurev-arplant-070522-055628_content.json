{"grounding": "Photoperiod-measuring mechanisms allow organisms to anticipate seasonal changes to align reproduction and growth with appropriate times of the year. This review provides historical and modern context to studies of plant photoperiodism. We describe how studies of photoperiodic flowering in plants led to the first theoretical models of photoperiod-measuring mechanisms in any organism. We discuss how more recent molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis and rice have revisited these concepts. We then discuss how photoperiod transcriptomics provides new lessons about photoperiodic gene regulatory networks and the discovery of noncanonical photoperiod-measuring systems housed in metabolic networks of plants. This leads to an examination of nonflowering developmental processes controlled by photoperiod, including metabolism and growth. Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding photoperiodism in the context of climate change, delving into the rapid latitudinal migration of plant species and the potential role of photoperiod-measuring systems in generating photic barriers during migration.", "generated_text": "This review explores recent advancements in the field of plant photoperiodism, focusing on the mechanisms that plants use to measure day length and regulate their developmental processes. Traditional models of photoperiodism, such as the external coincidence hypothesis, have been expanded to include noncanonical photoperiod measurement systems that integrate metabolic and photosynthetic signals. These systems allow plants to fine-tune their responses to environmental cues, ensuring optimal growth and reproductive timing. Recent studies have identified key molecular components involved in these processes, including photoreceptors, circadian clock genes, and metabolic regulators. The integration of these findings into a comprehensive model of photoperiodic control highlights the complexity and adaptability of plant responses to changing day lengths. This review also discusses the implications of these discoveries for agricultural practices, particularly in the context of climate change and the need for crops with enhanced photoperiodic flexibility.", "label": 1}
