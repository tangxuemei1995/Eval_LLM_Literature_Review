{"grounding": "Plant invasions, a byproduct of globalization, are increasing worldwide. Because of their ecological and economic impacts, considerable efforts have been made to understand and predict the success of non-native plants. Numerous frameworks, hypotheses, and theories have been advanced to conceptualize the interactions of multiple drivers and context dependence of invasion success with the aim of achieving robust explanations with predictive power. We review these efforts from a community-level perspective rather than a biogeographical one, focusing on terrestrial systems, and explore the roles of intrinsic plant properties in determining species invasiveness, as well as the effects of biotic and abiotic conditions in mediating ecosystem invasibility (or resistance) and ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consider the fundamental influences of human-induced changes at scales ranging from local to global in triggering, promoting, and sustaining plant invasions and discuss how these changes could alter future invasion trajectories.", "generated_text": "Invasive plants, often referred to as alien or non-native species, pose significant ecological and economic challenges due to their rapid spread and dominance in new environments. This study explores the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the success of invasive plants, focusing on biotic interactions, competition, and ecosystem invasibility. Through a comprehensive review of functional traits associated with invasiveness, we identify key attributes such as rapid growth rates, high reproductive output, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. These traits enable invasive plants to outcompete native species for resources, alter community structures, and disrupt ecosystem functions. Additionally, the role of biotic interactions, including mutualisms and enemy release, is examined to understand how these relationships facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive species. The findings highlight the importance of integrating functional trait analysis with ecological context to predict and manage the impacts of invasive plants on native ecosystems.", "label": 1}
