{"grounding": "The establishment, maintenance, and removal of epigenetic modifications provide an additional layer of regulation, beyond genetically encoded factors, by which plants can control developmental processes and adapt to the environment. Epigenetic inheritance, while historically referring to information not encoded in the DNA sequence that is inherited between generations, can also refer to epigenetic modifications that are maintained within an individual but are reset between generations. Both types of epigenetic inheritance occur in plants, and the functions and mechanisms distinguishing the two are of great interest to the field. Here, we discuss examples of epigenetic dynamics and maintenance during selected stages of growth and development and their functional consequences. Epigenetic states are also dynamic in response to stress, with consequences for transposable element regulation. How epigenetic resetting between generations occurs during normal development and in response to stress is an emerging area of research.", "generated_text": "Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in plant development and the plant's response to environmental cues, such as heat stress. This study explores the mechanisms of epigenetic memory, focusing on histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are essential for the stable inheritance of gene expression patterns. Transposable elements, often silenced by these epigenetic marks, can become active under stress conditions, potentially contributing to adaptive responses. We review recent findings on how these epigenetic modifications are established and maintained during key developmental stages, and how they can be reprogrammed in response to environmental changes. Our analysis highlights the dynamic nature of the epigenome and its significance in plant resilience and evolution.", "label": 1}
