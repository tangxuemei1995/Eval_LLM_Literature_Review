{"grounding": "Optogenetics is a technique employing natural or genetically engineered photoreceptors in transgene organisms to manipulate biological activities with light. Light can be turned on or off, and adjusting its intensity and duration allows optogenetic fine-tuning of cellular processes in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally resolved manner. Since the introduction of Channelrhodopsin-2 and phytochrome-based switches nearly 20 years ago, optogenetic tools have been applied in a variety of model organisms with enormous success, but rarely in plants. For a long time, the dependence of plant growth on light and the absence of retinal, the rhodopsin chromophore, prevented the establishment of plant optogenetics until recent progress overcame these difficulties. We summarize the recent results of work in the field to control plant growth and cellular motion via green light\u2013gated ion channels and present successful applications to light-control gene expression with single or combined photoswitches in plants. Furthermore, we highlight the technical requirements and options for future plant optogenetic research.", "generated_text": "Optogenetic methods have revolutionized the study of plant biology by enabling precise spatiotemporal control over cellular processes. This review highlights recent advancements in the use of photoreceptors, rhodopsins, and optoswitches to manipulate gene expression, protein localization, and signaling pathways in plants. Key developments include the engineering of light-sensitive biosensors that allow real-time monitoring of intracellular events, such as calcium dynamics and hormone signaling. Additionally, the integration of optogenetic tools with CRISPR-Cas systems has facilitated the precise editing of plant genomes in response to light stimuli. These techniques not only enhance our understanding of fundamental plant processes but also offer promising applications in crop improvement and synthetic biology. The continued refinement of optogenetic tools and their application in diverse plant species will further expand the horizons of plant research and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
