{"grounding": "Proteins are workhorses in the cell; they form stable and more often dynamic, transient protein\u2013protein interactions, assemblies, and networks and have an intimate interplay with DNA and RNA. These network interactions underlie fundamental biological processes and play essential roles in cellular function. The proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling approach combined with mass spectrometry (PL-MS) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to dissect the complex cellular network at the molecular level. In PL-MS, by fusing a genetically encoded proximity-labeling (PL) enzyme to a protein or a localization signal peptide, the enzyme is targeted to a protein complex of interest or to an organelle, allowing labeling of proximity proteins within a zoom radius. These biotinylated proteins can then be captured by streptavidin beads and identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. Recently engineered PL enzymes such as TurboID have a much-improved enzymatic activity, enabling spatiotemporal mapping with a dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio. PL-MS has revolutionized the way we perform proteomics by overcoming several hurdles imposed by traditional technology, such as biochemical fractionation and affinity purification mass spectrometry. In this review, we focus on biotin ligase\u2013based PL-MS applications that have been, or are likely to be, adopted by the plant field. We discuss the experimental designs and review the different choices for engineered biotin ligases, enrichment, and quantification strategies. Lastly, we review the validation and discuss future perspectives.", "generated_text": "Proximity labeling (PL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for elucidating the subcellular and cell type\u2013specific proteomes in plants, offering unprecedented insights into protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleotide interactions. These methods, such as BioID and APEX, enable the identification of proteins in their native cellular environments by labeling proteins in close proximity to a bait protein with biotin, which can then be isolated and identified through mass spectrometry. This review highlights recent advancements in PL methodologies, focusing on their application in plant systems to uncover dynamic protein interactions and subcellular organization. We discuss the optimization of PL conditions for various plant tissues and cell types, emphasizing the importance of minimizing background labeling and maximizing the specificity of the labeling reaction. Additionally, we explore the integration of PL with quantitative proteomics approaches, which allows for the precise quantification of protein abundance and interaction dynamics. The application of PL in plants has led to the discovery of novel protein complexes and regulatory mechanisms, contributing to a deeper understanding of plant biology. Future directions include the development of more sensitive and specific labeling enzymes, as well as the application of PL in combination with other omics technologies to provide a comprehensive view of cellular processes in plants.", "label": 1}
