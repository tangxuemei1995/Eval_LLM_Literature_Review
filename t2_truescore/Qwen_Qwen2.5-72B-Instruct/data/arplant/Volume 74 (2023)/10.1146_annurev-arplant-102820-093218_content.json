{"grounding": "SWITCH deficient SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) class chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to facilitate access of proteins to the genomic DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Uniquely, SWI/SNF CRCs can both slide the histone octamer along the DNA or eject it from the DNA. Given their ability to change the chromatin status quo, SWI/SNF remodelers are critical for cell fate reprogramming with pioneer and other transcription factors, for responses to environmental challenges, and for disease prevention. Recent cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry approaches have uncovered different subtypes of SWI/SNF complexes with unique properties and functions. At the same time, tethering or rapid depletion and inactivation of SWI/SNF have provided novel insight into SWI/SNF requirements for enhancer activity and into balancing chromatin compaction and accessibility in concert with Polycomb complexes. Given their importance, SWI/SNF recruitment to genomic locations by transcription factors and their biochemical activity is tightly controlled. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of SWI/SNF CRCs in animals and plants and discusses the multiple nuclear and biological roles of SWI/SNF CRCs and how SWI/SNF activity is altered by complex subunit composition, posttranslational modifications, and the chromatin context to support proper development and response to extrinsic cues.", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by altering the structure of chromatin. These complexes, powered by ATPases, facilitate the repositioning, eviction, or restructuring of nucleosomes, thereby modulating the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Recent studies have highlighted the diverse functions of SWI/SNF remodelers in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and cellular responses to environmental stimuli. The intricate interplay between SWI/SNF ATPases and the chromatin landscape is essential for the precise control of gene expression, ensuring that cells can adapt to changing conditions and maintain proper function. Mutations in SWI/SNF components have been implicated in a range of diseases, underscoring their importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF remodelers influence chromatin structure and function, and discusses their broader implications in health and disease.", "label": 1}
