{"grounding": "Since the discovery of the first ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), scientists have been on a quest to decipher the identities and functions of RNA modifications in biological systems. The last decade has seen monumental growth in the number of studies that have characterized and assessed the functionalities of RNA modifications in the field of plant biology. Owing to these studies, we now categorize RNA modifications based on their chemical nature and the RNA on which they are found, as well as the array of proteins that are involved in the processes that add, read, and remove them from an RNA molecule. Beyond their identity, another key piece of the puzzle is the functional significance of the various types of RNA modifications. Here, we shed light on recent studies that help establish our current understanding of the diversity of RNA modifications found in plant transcriptomes and the functions they play at both the molecular (e.g., RNA stability, translation, and transport) and organismal (e.g., stress response and development) levels. Finally, we consider the key research questions related to plant gene expression and biology in general and highlight developments in various technologies that are driving our insights forward in this research area.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes in plants. This review summarizes the current understanding of the diversity and functions of mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA modifications in plants, with a focus on the well-characterized m6A and m5C modifications. These modifications are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, translation, and stress response. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of novel RNA modifications and their specific sites, providing insights into the functional diversity of RNA modifications in plants. The review also highlights the importance of RNA modifications in plant stress responses, such as drought, salinity, and pathogen attack, and discusses the potential of manipulating RNA modifications to enhance plant resilience. Future research directions include the development of tools to study the dynamic nature of RNA modifications and their impact on plant development and environmental adaptation.", "label": 1}
