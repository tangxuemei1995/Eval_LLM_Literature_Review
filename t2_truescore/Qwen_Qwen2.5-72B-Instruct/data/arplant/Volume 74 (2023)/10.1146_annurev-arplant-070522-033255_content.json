{"grounding": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) genes encode ion channels with demonstrated roles in electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. The expansion of the GLR family along the lineage of land plants, culminating in the appearance of a multiclade system among flowering plants, has been a topic of interest since their discovery nearly 25 years ago. GLRs are involved in many physiological processes, from wound signaling to transcriptional regulation to sexual reproduction. Emerging evidence supports the notion that their fundamental functions are conserved among different groups of plants as well. In this review, we update the physiological and genetic evidence for GLRs, establishing their role in signaling and cell\u2013cell communication. Special emphasis is given to the recent discussion of GLRs\u2019 atomic structures. Along with functional assays, a structural view of GLRs\u2019 molecular organization presents a window for novel hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms underpinning signaling associated with the ionic fluxes that GLRs regulate. Newly uncovered transcriptional regulations associated with GLRs\u2014which propose the involvement of genes from all clades ofArabidopsis thaliana in ways not previously observed\u2014are discussed in the context of the broader impacts of GLR activity. We posit that the functions of GLRs in plant biology are probably much broader than anticipated, but describing their widespread involvement will only be possible with (a) a comprehensive understanding of the channel's properties at the molecular and structural levels, including protein\u2013protein interactions, and (b) the design of new genetic approaches to explore stress and pathogen responses where precise transcriptional control may result in more precise testable hypotheses to overcome their apparent functional redundancies.", "generated_text": "Plant glutamate receptor (GLR) ion channels represent a unique class of ligand-gated ion channels that play critical roles in various physiological processes, including cell excitability, cell\u2013cell communication, and calcium signaling. These channels, which are homologous to animal glutamate receptors, are activated by amino acids such as glutamate and are involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in plant signaling pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of GLRs in mediating electric signaling and action potential propagation, processes that are essential for rapid responses to environmental stimuli. GLRs are also implicated in the transport of calcium ions across cell membranes, influencing a wide range of cellular functions, from stomatal movement to root growth and development. Moreover, the interaction between GLRs and other signaling molecules, such as glutathione, suggests a complex network of regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. This review integrates the current understanding of the structural and functional aspects of GLRs, emphasizing their role in integrating multiple signaling pathways and their potential as targets for enhancing plant resilience and productivity.", "label": 1}
