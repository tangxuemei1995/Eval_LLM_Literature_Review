{"grounding": "Plant cells accumulate small RNA molecules that regulate plant development, genome stability, and environmental responses. These small RNAs fall into three major classes based on their function and mechanisms of biogenesis\u2014microRNAs, heterochromatic small interfering RNAs, and secondary small interfering RNAs\u2014plus several other less well-characterized categories. Biogenesis of each small RNA class requires a pathway of factors, some specific to each pathway and others involved in multiple pathways. Diverse sequenced plant genomes, along with rapid developments in sequencing, imaging, and genetic transformation techniques, have enabled significant progress in understanding the biogenesis, functions, and evolution of plant small RNAs, including those that had been poorly characterized because they were absent or had low representation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we review recent findings about plant small RNAs and discuss our current understanding of their biogenesis mechanisms, targets, modes of action, mobility, and functions in Arabidopsis and other plant species, including economically important crops.", "generated_text": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) play crucial roles in plant development and stress responses. This review focuses on the biogenesis, regulatory roles, and functions of microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), and mobile siRNAs in plants. miRNAs are processed from hairpin structures by Dicer-like enzymes and guide ARGONAUTE proteins to target mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. siRNAs, derived from double-stranded RNA precursors, mediate gene silencing through RNA-directed DNA methylation and post-transcriptional gene silencing. phasiRNAs, generated in a miRNA-dependent manner, regulate gene expression during development and stress responses. Mobile siRNAs can move between cells and tissues, coordinating gene expression over long distances. These sRNAs are essential for various developmental processes, including organ formation, flowering, and root development, as well as for defense against pathogens and abiotic stresses. Understanding the intricate regulatory networks involving sRNAs is crucial for advancing plant biology and biotechnology.", "label": 1}
