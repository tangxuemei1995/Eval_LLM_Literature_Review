{"grounding": "Living structures constantly interact with the biotic and abiotic environment by sensing and responding via specialized functional parts. In other words, biological bodies embody highly functional machines and actuators. What are the signatures of engineering mechanisms in biology? In this review, we connect the dots in the literature to seek engineering principles in plant structures. We identify three thematic motifs\u2014bilayer actuator, slender-bodied functional surface, and self-similarity\u2014and provide an overview of their structure\u2013function relationships. Unlike human-engineered machines and actuators, biological counterparts may appear suboptimal in design, loosely complying with physical theories or engineering principles. We postulate what factors may influence the evolution of functional morphology and anatomy to dissect and comprehend better the why behind the biological forms.", "generated_text": "This study explores the biomechanical principles underlying plant form and function, focusing on the structure\u2013function relationship in plant biology. By examining the bilayer and slender body mechanics, we uncover how plants optimize their structural integrity and resource efficiency. The self-similarity observed in plant architectures is analyzed to understand the scaling laws that govern their growth and development. These findings provide insights into the biological design strategies that plants employ to thrive in diverse environments, offering valuable lessons for engineering and materials science.", "label": 0}
