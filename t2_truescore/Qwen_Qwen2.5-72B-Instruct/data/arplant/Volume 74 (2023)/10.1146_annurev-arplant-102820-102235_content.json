{"grounding": "Temperature is a key environmental cue that influences the distribution and behavior of plants globally. Understanding how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development is important to determine how plants adapt to climate change and to apply this knowledge to the breeding of climate-resilient crops. The mechanisms of temperature perception in eukaryotes are only just beginning to be understood, with multiple molecular phenomena with inherent temperature dependencies, such as RNA melting, phytochrome dark reversion, and protein phase change, being exploited by nature to create thermosensory signaling networks. Here, we review recent progress in understanding how temperature sensing in four major pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana occurs: vernalization, cold stress, thermomorphogenesis, and heat stress. We discuss outstanding questions in the field and the importance of these mechanisms in the context of breeding climate-resilient crops.", "generated_text": "Temperature sensing is a critical mechanism in plants, enabling them to adapt to environmental changes and optimize growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana, recent studies have identified specific thermosensors that play key roles in thermomorphogenesis, the process by which plants alter their development in response to temperature. These thermosensors, including histone deacetylases and heat shock transcription factors, help plants respond to both heat and cold stress. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature sensing can provide insights into how plants adapt to climate change and inform strategies for improving crop resilience. This review summarizes the current knowledge on thermosensors in Arabidopsis, highlighting their roles in heat and cold stress responses and their implications for plant adaptation.", "label": 1}
