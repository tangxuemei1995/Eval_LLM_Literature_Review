{"grounding": "Recurring patterns are an integral part of life on Earth. Through evolution or breeding, plants have acquired systems that coordinate with the cyclic patterns driven by Earth's movement through space. The biosystem responses to these physical rhythms result in biological cycles of daily and seasonal activity that feed back into the physical cycles. Signaling networks to coordinate growth and molecular activities with these persistent cycles have been integrated into plant biochemistry. The plant circadian clock is the coordinator of this complex, multiscale, temporal schedule. However, we have detailed knowledge of the circadian clock components and functions in only a few species under controlled conditions. We are just beginning to understand how the clock functions in real-world conditions. This review examines what we know about the circadian clock in diverse plant species, the challenges with extrapolating data from controlled environments, and the need to anticipate how plants will respond to climate change.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, the intrinsic biological clocks that regulate physiological processes on a 24-hour cycle, play a crucial role in the adaptation of organisms to their environments. This review explores the intersection of circadian rhythms with changing environmental conditions, particularly in the context of climate change. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of circadian signaling networks in mediating responses to environmental cues such as light, temperature, and humidity. These networks enable organisms to anticipate and prepare for daily and seasonal changes, optimizing their metabolic and behavioral activities. However, rapid environmental changes due to climate change can disrupt these finely tuned rhythms, leading to mismatches between internal clocks and external conditions. This disruption can have significant impacts on health, survival, and reproductive success. Understanding the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying circadian adaptation is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of environmental changes on biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "label": 1}
