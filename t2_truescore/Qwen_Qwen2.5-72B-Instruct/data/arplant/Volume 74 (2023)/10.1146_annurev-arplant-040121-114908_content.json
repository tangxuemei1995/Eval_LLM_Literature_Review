{"grounding": "Plant volatiles comprise thousands of molecules from multiple metabolic pathways, distinguished by sufficient vapor pressure to evaporate into the headspace under normal environmental conditions. Many are implicated as ecological signals, but what is the evidence\u2014and how do they work? Volatiles diffuse, are carried by wind, and may be taken up by other organisms or degrade with exposure to atmospheric ozone, radicals, and UV light; visual signals such as color are not subject to these complications (but require a line of sight). Distantly related plants\u2014and nonplants\u2014produce many of the same volatiles, yet specific compounds and blends may be distinct. Here, I present a quantitative review of the literature on plant volatiles as ecological signals, illustrating a field that has focused on developing ideas as much as reporting primary data. I discuss advantages and constraints, review recent advances, and propose considerations for primary studies to elucidate particular functions of plant volatiles.", "generated_text": "Plant volatiles play a crucial role in mediating ecological signaling, influencing plant interactions with both biotic and abiotic factors. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant volatiles, highlighting their role in defense, communication, and attraction. The release of volatiles is influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind, which can alter their dispersion and effectiveness. Spatial distributions of volatiles are critical for understanding how plants signal to neighbors and attract beneficial organisms, while temporal dynamics reveal the timing and duration of these signals. Despite significant advances, research gaps remain, particularly in elucidating the mechanisms that govern the production and release of volatiles under varying environmental conditions. Future studies should focus on integrating environmental chemistry and physics to better predict the ecological impacts of plant volatiles in natural and managed ecosystems.", "label": 1}
