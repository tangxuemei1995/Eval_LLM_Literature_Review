{"grounding": "Plants\u2019 ability to chemically modify core structures of specialized metabolites is the main reason why the plant kingdom contains such a wide and rich array of diverse compounds. One of the most important types of chemical modifications of small molecules is the addition of an acyl moiety to produce esters and amides. Large-scale phylogenomics analyses have shown that the enzymes that perform acyl transfer reactions on the myriad small molecules synthesized by plants belong to only a few gene families. This review is focused on describing the biochemistry, evolutionary origins, and chemical ecology implications of one of these families\u2014the BAHD acyltransferases. The growth of advanced metabolomic studies coupled with next-generation sequencing of diverse plant species has confirmed that the BAHD family plays critical roles in modifying nearly all known classes of specialized metabolites. The current and future outlook for research on BAHDs includes expanding their roles in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.", "generated_text": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of a wide array of secondary metabolites in plants, including hydroxycinnamoyl esters and amides. These enzymes, particularly hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), are essential for the production of phenylpropanoids, which are vital for plant defense, UV protection, and structural integrity. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the diverse functions of BAHD acyltransferases, revealing their involvement in the synthesis of acylsugars and other specialized metabolites. This review highlights the evolutionary history of the BAHD family, tracing its expansion and diversification across land plants. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of these enzymes, as well as their impact on plant adaptation and survival. The ever-expanding roles of BAHD acyltransferases underscore their significance in plant biology and provide a foundation for future biotechnological applications.", "label": 1}
