{"grounding": "Plant hormones are a group of small signaling molecules produced by plants at very low concentrations that have the ability to move and function at distal sites. Hormone homeostasis is critical to balance plant growth and development and is regulated at multiple levels, including hormone biosynthesis, catabolism, perception, and transduction. In addition, plants move hormones over short and long distances to regulate various developmental processes and responses to environmental factors. Transporters coordinate these movements, resulting in hormone maxima, gradients, and cellular and subcellular sinks. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of most of the characterized plant hormone transporters with respect to biochemical, physiological, and developmental activities. We further discuss the subcellular localizations of transporters, their substrate specificities, and the need for multiple transporters for the same hormone in the context of plant growth and development.", "generated_text": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, play crucial roles in regulating growth, development, and stress responses in plants. This review focuses on the transport and localization mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). Recent advances in identifying specific transporters and understanding their regulation have shed light on how these signaling molecules are precisely distributed within the plant. For instance, auxin transport is mediated by PIN and ABCB transporters, while ABA is transported by NRT1/PTR family proteins. The dynamic interplay between synthesis, transport, and degradation ensures hormone homeostasis, which is essential for coordinating plant responses to environmental cues. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone transport and their implications for plant development and stress adaptation.", "label": 1}
