{"grounding": "Chloroplasts are the defining plant organelles with responsibility for photosynthesis and other vital functions. To deliver these functions, they possess a complex proteome comprising thousands of largely nucleus-encoded proteins. Composition of the proteome is controlled by diverse processes affecting protein translocation and degradation\u2014our focus here. Most chloroplast proteins are imported from the cytosol via multiprotein translocons in the outer and inner envelope membranes (the TOC and TIC complexes, respectively), or via one of several noncanonical pathways, and then sorted by different systems to organellar subcompartments. Chloroplast proteolysis is equally complex, involving the concerted action of internal proteases of prokaryotic origin and the nucleocytosolic ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). The UPS degrades unimported proteins in the cytosol and chloroplast-resident proteins via chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD). The latter targets the TOC apparatus to regulate protein import, as well as numerous internal proteins directly, to reconfigure chloroplast functions in response to developmental and environmental signals.", "generated_text": "Chloroplasts, essential organelles in plant cells, maintain a complex proteostasis network to ensure proper function and development. This network encompasses the import of nuclear-encoded proteins, their sorting to specific chloroplast compartments, and the regulation of protein turnover through ubiquitination and proteolysis. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein translocation across chloroplast membranes, highlighting the roles of translocons and chaperones. Within the chloroplast, proteins are sorted to the stroma, thylakoids, and other subcompartments via specific targeting signals. Ubiquitination, a key regulatory process, marks proteins for degradation by the chloroplast proteasome or other proteolytic systems. This review summarizes the current understanding of chloroplast proteostasis, emphasizing the interplay between import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis, and discusses the implications for chloroplast function and plant stress responses.", "label": 1}
