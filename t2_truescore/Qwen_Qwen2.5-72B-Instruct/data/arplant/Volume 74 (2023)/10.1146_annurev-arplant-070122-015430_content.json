{"grounding": "Parasitic plants use a special organ, the haustorium, to attach to and penetrate host tissues, forming phloem and/or xylem fusion with the host vascular systems. Across this haustorium\u2013host interface, not only water and nutrients are extracted from the host by the parasitic plant, but also secondary metabolites, messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs, proteins, and systemic signals are transported between the parasite and host and even among different hosts connected by a parasite. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi can form common mycelial networks (CMNs) that simultaneously interconnect multiple plants. Increasing lines of evidence suggest that CMNs can function as conduits, transferring stress-related systemic signals between plants. Between-plant signaling mediated by haustoria and CMNs likely has a profound impact on plant interactions with other organisms and adaptation to environmental factors. Here, we summarize the findings regarding between-plant transfer of biomolecules and systemic signals and the current understanding of the physiological and ecological implications of between-plant signaling.", "generated_text": "Between-plant signaling is a complex and dynamic process that facilitates communication and interaction among plants, often mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) through common mycelial networks (CMNs). These networks enable the transfer of nutrients, water, and signaling molecules, allowing plants to coordinate their responses to environmental stresses, such as herbivory and pathogen attack. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CMNs in systemic signaling, where plants can warn their neighbors of impending threats, leading to enhanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, parasitic plants can exploit these networks to detect and target host plants, further complicating the interplay between species. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms and ecological implications of between-plant signaling, emphasizing the importance of CMNs in facilitating these interactions and the potential applications in agriculture and ecosystem management.", "label": 1}
