{"grounding": "The human lung cellular portfolio, traditionally characterized by cellular morphology and individual markers, is highly diverse, with over 40 cell types and a complex branching structure highly adapted for agile airflow and gas exchange. While constant during adulthood, lung cellular content changes in response to exposure, injury, and infection. Some changes are temporary, but others are persistent, leading to structural changes and progressive lung disease. The recent advance of single-cell profiling technologies allows an unprecedented level of detail and scale to cellular measurements, leading to the rise of comprehensive cell atlas styles of reporting. In this review, we chronical the rise of cell atlases and explore their contributions to human lung biology in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the creation of comprehensive lung cell atlases, providing unprecedented insights into the cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms underlying lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These atlases reveal distinct cell types and states, their interactions, and the dynamic changes that occur in response to disease. By integrating these data with clinical outcomes, researchers can identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments. This review summarizes the key findings from lung cell atlases and discusses their implications for understanding and managing lung diseases.", "label": 1}
