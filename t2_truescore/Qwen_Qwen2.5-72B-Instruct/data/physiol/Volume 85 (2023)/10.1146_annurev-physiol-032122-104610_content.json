{"grounding": "Membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), or ER-PM junctions, are found in all eukaryotic cells. In excitable cells they play unique roles in organizing diverse forms of Ca2+ signaling as triggered by membrane depolarization. ER-PM junctions underlie crucial physiological processes such as excitation-contraction coupling, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and various forms of activity-dependent signaling and plasticity in neurons. In many cases the structure and molecular composition of ER-PM junctions in excitable cells comprise important regulatory feedback loops linking depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling at these sites to the regulation of membrane potential. Here, we describe recent findings on physiological roles and molecular composition of native ER-PM junctions in excitable cells. We focus on recent studies that provide new insights into canonical forms of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling occurring at junctional triads and dyads of striated muscle, as well as the diversity of ER-PM junctions in these cells and in smooth muscle and neurons.", "generated_text": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013plasma membrane (PM) junctions, also known as membrane contact sites (MCS), play a critical role in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and neurons. These junctions facilitate the rapid and localized transfer of Ca2+ ions, which act as second messengers, from the ER to the cytosol in response to depolarization. The structural and functional organization of these MCSs involves specific ion channels and proteins that mediate Ca2+ release and influx. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and L-type Ca2+ channels are key components, while in smooth muscle and neurons, other channels such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of ER\u2013PM junctions and their significance in the precise control of Ca2+ signaling, which is essential for various cellular processes including contraction, secretion, and neurotransmission.", "label": 1}
