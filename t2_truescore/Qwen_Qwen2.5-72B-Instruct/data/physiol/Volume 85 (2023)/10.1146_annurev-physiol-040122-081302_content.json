{"grounding": "The generation of an internal body model and its continuous update is essential in sensorimotor control. Although known to rely on proprioceptive sensory feedback, the underlying mechanism that transforms this sensory feedback into a dynamic body percept remains poorly understood. However, advances in the development of genetic tools for proprioceptive circuit elements, including the sensory receptors, are beginning to offer new and unprecedented leverage to dissect the central pathways responsible for proprioceptive encoding. Simultaneously, new data derived through emerging bionic neural machine\u2013interface technologies reveal clues regarding the relative importance of kinesthetic sensory feedback and insights into the functional proprioceptive substrates that underlie natural motor behaviors.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in genetic and bionic technologies are revolutionizing our understanding and enhancement of proprioception. This review highlights the role of proprioceptive sensory neurons, including muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, in conveying kinesthetic information to the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. Emerging genetic approaches are refining the precision of these sensory pathways, while bionic strategies, such as neural machine interfaces, are enabling more intuitive control of prosthetic limbs. These innovations not only promise to alleviate motor impairments but also deepen our comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying kinesthetic illusions. This convergence of genetic and bionic strategies heralds a new era in proprioceptive research and clinical applications.", "label": 1}
