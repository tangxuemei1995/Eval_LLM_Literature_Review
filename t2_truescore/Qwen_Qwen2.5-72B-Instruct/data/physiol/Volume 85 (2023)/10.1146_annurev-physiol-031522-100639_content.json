{"grounding": "Numerous trafficking and quality control pathways evolved to handle the diversity of proteins made by eukaryotic cells. However, at every step along the biosynthetic pathway, there is the potential for quality control system failure. This review focuses on the mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis. Inspired by diseases caused by misfolded proteins in the kidney (mucin 1 and uromodulin), we outline the general principles of protein biosynthesis, delineate the recognition and degradation pathways targeting misfolded proteins, and discuss the role of cargo receptors in protein trafficking and lipid homeostasis. We also discuss technical approaches including live-cell fluorescent microscopy, chemical screens to elucidate trafficking mechanisms, multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platforms to systematically delineate mechanisms of proteostasis, and the advancement of novel tools to degrade secretory and membrane-associated proteins. By focusing on components of trafficking that go awry, we highlight ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of disrupted proteostasis and implications for the treatment of human proteinopathies.", "generated_text": "Protein trafficking and quality control are essential processes for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the kidney, where precise regulation is crucial for proper function. This review highlights the mechanisms governing the secretory pathway, focusing on the roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vesicle-mediated transport. Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing (TMED) proteins play a pivotal role in cargo selection and vesicle formation, ensuring the accurate delivery of proteins to their destinations, including the lysosome for degradation. Disruptions in these pathways have been implicated in various kidney diseases, underscoring the importance of understanding the molecular details of protein trafficking and quality control. Advances in proteomics and imaging techniques are providing new insights into the dynamic nature of these processes, offering potential therapeutic targets for kidney and other systemic disorders.", "label": 1}
