{"grounding": "Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are components of plasma membranes and an efficient fuel source and also serve as metabolic regulators through FA signaling mediated by membrane FA receptors. Impaired tissue FA uptake has been linked to major complications of obesity, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Fatty acid interactions with a membrane receptor and the initiation of signaling can modify pathways related to nutrient uptake and processing, cell proliferation or differentiation, and secretion of bioactive factors. Here, we review the major membrane receptors involved in FA uptake and FA signaling. We focus on two types of membrane receptors for long-chain FAs: CD36 and the G protein\u2013coupled FA receptors FFAR1 and FFAR4. We describe key signaling pathways and metabolic outcomes for CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4 and highlight the parallels that provide insight into FA regulation of cell function.", "generated_text": "Fatty acids (FAs) play crucial roles in cellular metabolism and signaling, with transport proteins such as CD36 and G-protein coupled receptors like FFAR1 and FFAR4 mediating their cellular uptake and signaling pathways. CD36 facilitates FA uptake into cells, particularly in adipose tissue and muscle, where it is essential for \u03b2-oxidation and energy production. FFAR1 and FFAR4, activated by medium and long-chain FAs, modulate insulin secretion, inflammation, and tissue repair. Caveolin, a scaffolding protein, interacts with CD36 to regulate FA uptake and signaling, influencing metabolic homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways is implicated in metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review explores the mechanisms of FA transport and signaling, highlighting their physiological implications and potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases.", "label": 1}
