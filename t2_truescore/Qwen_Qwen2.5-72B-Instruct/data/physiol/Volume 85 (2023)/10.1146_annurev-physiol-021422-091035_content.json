{"grounding": "Information processing imposes urgent metabolic demands on neurons, which have negligible energy stores and restricted access to fuel. Here, we discuss metabolic recruitment, the tissue-level phenomenon whereby active neurons harvest resources from their surroundings. The primary event is the neuronal release of K+ that mirrors workload. Astrocytes sense K+ in exquisite fashion thanks to their unique coexpression of NBCe1 and \u03b12\u03b22 Na+/K+ ATPase, and within seconds switch to Crabtree metabolism, involving GLUT1, aerobic glycolysis, transient suppression of mitochondrial respiration, and lactate export. The lactate surge serves as a secondary recruiter by inhibiting glucose consumption in distant cells. Additional recruiters are glutamate, nitric oxide, and ammonium, which signal over different spatiotemporal domains. The net outcome of these events is that more glucose, lactate, and oxygen are made available. Metabolic recruitment works alongside neurovascular coupling and various averaging strategies to support the inordinate dynamic range of individual neurons.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes in brain tissue, focusing on the roles of glucose, lactate, and oxygen in energy metabolism. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques, we demonstrate that astrocytes play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal energy supply through the glycolytic production of lactate, which is subsequently utilized by neurons for oxidative metabolism. Our findings reveal that under conditions of increased neuronal activity, astrocytes enhance glycolysis and lactate production, while neurons increase their uptake and oxidation of lactate. This metabolic coupling is supported by the strategic localization of mitochondria in astrocytes and the efficient transport of lactate via specific monocarboxylate transporters. The study highlights the importance of astrocyte-neuron metabolic interactions in maintaining brain function and suggests potential therapeutic targets for neurological disorders associated with metabolic dysregulation.", "label": 0}
