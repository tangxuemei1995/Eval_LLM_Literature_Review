{"grounding": "Liver regeneration occurs in response to diverse injuries and is capable of functionally reestablishing the lost parenchyma. This phenomenon has been known since antiquity, encapsulated in the Greek myth where Prometheus was to be punished by Zeus for sharing the gift of fire with humanity by having an eagle eat his liver daily, only to have the liver regrow back, thus ensuring eternal suffering and punishment. Today, this process is actively leveraged clinically during living donor liver transplantation whereby up to a two-thirds hepatectomy (resection or removal of part of the liver) on a donor is used for transplant to a recipient. The donor liver rapidly regenerates to recover the lost parenchymal mass to form a functional tissue. This astonishing regenerative process and unique capacity of the liver are examined in further detail in this review.", "generated_text": "The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable heterogeneity and zonation, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and enabling efficient regeneration following acute and chronic injury. Recent studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of liver cells, revealing their plasticity and the intricate signaling pathways that govern their responses to damage. During homeostasis, distinct zones of the liver perform specialized metabolic functions, while in the context of injury, these zones can rapidly adapt and activate regeneration programs. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation, the role of cellular heterogeneity in maintaining homeostasis, and the plasticity of liver cells during regeneration. Understanding these processes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver repair and prevent disease progression.", "label": 1}
