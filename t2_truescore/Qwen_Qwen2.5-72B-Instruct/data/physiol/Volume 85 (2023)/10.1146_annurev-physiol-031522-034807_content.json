{"grounding": "Pericytes, attached to the surface of capillaries, play an important role in regulating local blood flow. Using optogenetic tools and genetically encoded reporters in conjunction with confocal and multiphoton imaging techniques, the 3D structure, anatomical organization, and physiology of pericytes have recently been the subject of detailed examination. This work has revealed novel functions of pericytes and morphological features such as tunneling nanotubes in brain and tunneling microtubes in heart. Here, we discuss the state of our current understanding of the roles of pericytes in blood flow control in brain and heart, where functions may differ due to the distinct spatiotemporal metabolic requirements of these tissues. We also outline the novel concept of electro-metabolic signaling, a universal mechanistic framework that links tissue metabolic state with blood flow regulation by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, with capillary KATP and Kir2.1 channels as primary sensors. Finally, we present major unresolved questions and outline how they can be addressed.", "generated_text": "Pericytes, specialized mural cells lining the microvasculature, play a crucial role in the regulation of blood flow in both the brain and heart. These cells are strategically positioned to modulate vascular tone and perfusion, thereby influencing tissue metabolism and function. In the brain, pericytes are integral to neurovascular coupling, where they respond to neuronal activity through electro-metabolic signaling pathways involving ion channels, particularly calcium and potassium channels. This dynamic interaction ensures that increased neuronal activity is matched by adequate blood supply. Similarly, in the heart, pericytes contribute to the fine-tuning of coronary blood flow, supporting cardiac function during varying metabolic demands. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericyte-derived signaling molecules and their impact on vascular reactivity and tissue homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms by which pericytes control blood flow in these vital organs is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to address conditions such as ischemia, stroke, and heart disease.", "label": 1}
