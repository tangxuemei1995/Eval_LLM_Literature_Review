{"grounding": "Polycystin subunits can form hetero- and homotetrameric ion channels in the membranes of various compartments of the cell. Homotetrameric polycystin channels are voltage- and calcium-modulated, whereas heterotetrameric versions are proposed to be ligand- or autoproteolytically regulated. Their importance is underscored by variants associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and by vital roles in fertilization and embryonic development. The diversity in polycystin assembly and subcellular distribution allows for a multitude of sensory functions by this class of channels. In this review, we highlight their recent structural and functional characterization, which has provided a molecular blueprint to investigate the conformational changes required for channel opening in response to unique stimuli. We consider each polycystin channel type individually, discussing how they contribute to sensory cell biology, as well as their impact on the physiology of various tissues.", "generated_text": "Polycystin channel complexes, primarily composed of polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). These proteins are integral components of the primary cilia, where they function as mechanosensors and calcium-permeable TRP channels. The gating mechanism of the polycystin channel complex is intricately regulated by mechanical stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins lead to ciliopathies, including ADPKD, characterized by the formation of renal cysts and progressive kidney dysfunction. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of polycystin channel complexes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the progression of ADPKD and related ciliopathies.", "label": 1}
