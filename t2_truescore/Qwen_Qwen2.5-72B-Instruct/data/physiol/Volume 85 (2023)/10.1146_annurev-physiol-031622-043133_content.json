{"grounding": "Insulin action is impaired in type 2 diabetes. The functions of the hormone are an integrated product of insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and insulin clearance by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation, mostly in liver (hepatocytes) and, to a lower extent, in extrahepatic peripheral tissues. Substantial evidence indicates that genetic or acquired abnormalities of insulin secretion or action predispose to type 2 diabetes. In recent years, along with the discovery of the molecular foundation of receptor-mediated insulin clearance, such as through the membrane glycoprotein CEACAM1, a consensus has begun to emerge that reduction of insulin clearance contributes to the disease process. In this review, we consider the evidence suggesting a pathogenic role for reduced insulin clearance in insulin resistance, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes.", "generated_text": "Insulin clearance, a critical component of glucose homeostasis, varies significantly in health and disease. This review examines the mechanisms and implications of altered insulin clearance in conditions such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. We explore how factors like age and ethnicity influence insulin action and clearance, highlighting the role of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as a key contributor to impaired insulin metabolism. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to manage metabolic disorders effectively.", "label": 1}
