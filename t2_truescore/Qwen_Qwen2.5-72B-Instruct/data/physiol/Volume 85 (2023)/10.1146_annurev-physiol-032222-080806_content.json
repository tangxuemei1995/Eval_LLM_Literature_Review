{"grounding": "The endothelium is one of the largest organ systems in the body, and data continue to emerge regarding the importance of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in vascular aging and a range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Over the last two decades and as a process intimately related to EC dysfunction, an increasing number of studies have also implicated endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) as a potentially disease-causal pathobiologic process that is involved in a multitude of differing CVDs. However, EndMT is also involved in physiologic processes (e.g., cardiac development), and transient EndMT may contribute to vascular regeneration in certain contexts. Given that EndMT involves a major alteration in the EC-specific molecular program, and that it potentially contributes to CVD pathobiology, the clinical translation opportunities are significant, but further molecular and translational research is needed to see these opportunities realized.\n", "generated_text": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a critical process in which endothelial cells lose their characteristic markers and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. This phenomenon plays a pivotal role in both physiological and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular development, tissue repair, and the progression of diseases such as atherosclerosis and fibrosis. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT, highlighting the involvement of signaling pathways such as TGF-\u03b2, Notch, and Wnt. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to modulate EndMT and improve outcomes in cardiovascular diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge of EndMT, its regulatory factors, and its implications in health and disease, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets.", "label": 1}
