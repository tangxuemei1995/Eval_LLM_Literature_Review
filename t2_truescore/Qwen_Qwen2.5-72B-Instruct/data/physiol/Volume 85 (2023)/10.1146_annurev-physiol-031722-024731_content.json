{"grounding": "Neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making have been extensively studied in experimental settings that mimic stable environments with repeating stimuli, fixed rules, and payoffs. In contrast, we live in an ever-changing environment and have varying goals and behavioral demands. To accommodate variability, our brain flexibly adjusts decision-making processes depending on context. Here, we review a growing body of research that explores the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility. We highlight diverse forms of context dependency in decision making implemented through a variety of neural computations. Context-dependent neural activity is observed in a distributed network of brain structures, including posterior parietal, sensory, motor, and subcortical regions, as well as the prefrontal areas classically implicated in cognitive control. We propose that investigating the distributed network underlying flexible decisions is key to advancing our understanding and discuss a path forward for experimental and theoretical investigations.", "generated_text": "Perceptual decisions are not rigid but can be dynamically adjusted based on current task demands, a process known as flexible decision making. This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility, focusing on how sensory inputs are mapped to actions in varying contexts. Using a combination of behavioral experiments and neural recordings, we demonstrate that distributed neural networks, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and sensory cortices, dynamically reconfigure their activity patterns during task switches. These changes in stimulus-action mapping are mediated by top-down signals that modulate the decision policy, allowing for rapid adaptation to new task rules. Our findings suggest that flexible perceptual decisions are supported by a dynamic interplay between sensory processing and executive control, highlighting the importance of distributed neural networks in sensory-guided behavior.", "label": 1}
