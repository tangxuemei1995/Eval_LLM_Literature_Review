{"grounding": "The rhythmicity of breath is vital for normal physiology. Even so, breathing is enriched with multifunctionality. External signals constantly change breathing, stopping it when under water or deepening it during exertion. Internal cues utilize breath to express emotions such as sighs of frustration and yawns of boredom. Breathing harmonizes with other actions that use our mouth and throat, including speech, chewing, and swallowing. In addition, our perception of breathing intensity can dictate how we feel, such as during the slow breathing of calming meditation and anxiety-inducing hyperventilation. Heartbeat originates from a peripheral pacemaker in the heart, but the automation of breathing arises from neural clusters within the brainstem, enabling interaction with other brain areas and thus multifunctionality. Here, we document how the recent transformation of cellular and molecular tools has contributed to our appreciation of the diversity of neuronal types in the breathing control circuit and how they confer the multifunctionality of breathing.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in molecular tools have revolutionized our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying breathing control. The preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) have emerged as critical regions in the regulation of respiratory rhythms and responses to lung sensory inputs. Molecular techniques, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, have enabled precise manipulation of specific neuronal populations, revealing the intricate roles of serotonin and the Hering-Breuer reflex in modulating breathing patterns. These studies have not only elucidated the complex interplay between central and peripheral respiratory control systems but also provided new insights into potential therapeutic targets for respiratory disorders. This review highlights the transformative impact of molecular tools on the field of respiratory neuroscience, emphasizing the dynamic and multifaceted nature of breathing control.", "label": 1}
