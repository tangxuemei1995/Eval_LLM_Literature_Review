{"grounding": "Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis across many individuals at single-cell resolution. Compared with bulk RNA sequencing, which averages gene expression across cell types and cell states, single-cell assays capture the transcriptional states of individual cells, including fine-grained, transient, and difficult-to-isolate populations at unprecedented scale and resolution. Single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) mapping can identify context-dependent eQTLs that vary with cell states, including some that colocalize with disease variants identified in genome-wide association studies. By uncovering the precise contexts in which these eQTLs act, single-cell approaches can unveil previously hidden regulatory effects and pinpoint important cell states underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Here, we present an overview of recently deployed experimental designs in sc-eQTL studies. In the process, we consider the influence of study design choices such as cohort, cell states, and ex vivo perturbations. We then discuss current methodologies, modeling approaches, and technical challenges as well as future opportunities and applications.", "generated_text": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) studies have emerged as a powerful approach to dissect the genetic basis of gene regulation at an unprecedented resolution. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with genotyping data, these studies enable the identification of genetic variants that influence gene expression in specific cell states. Recent advancements in sc-eQTL methodologies have revealed the dynamic nature of gene regulation, highlighting the role of noncoding variants in modulating cellular functions. This review summarizes key methods and insights from sc-eQTL studies, emphasizing the importance of context-specific regulatory mechanisms. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in interpreting sc-eQTL data, including the impact of cellular heterogeneity and the integration of multi-omics data. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases, paving the way for more precise and personalized medicine.", "label": 1}
