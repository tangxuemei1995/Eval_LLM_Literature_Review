{"grounding": "Elucidating spatiotemporal changes in gene expression has been an essential goal in studies of health, development, and disease. In the emerging field of spatially resolved transcriptomics, gene expression profiles are acquired with the tissue architecture maintained, sometimes at cellular resolution. This has allowed for the development of spatial cell atlases, studies of cell\u2013cell interactions, and in situ cell typing. In this review, we focus on padlock probe\u2013based in situ sequencing, which is a targeted spatially resolved transcriptomic method. We summarize recent methodological and computational tool developments and discuss key applications. We also discuss compatibility with other methods and integration with multiomic platforms for future applications.", "generated_text": "Padlock probe-based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful technique for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization and quantification of RNA molecules within cells and tissues. This method utilizes padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high sensitivity and specificity. Recent advancements have expanded its applications in generating spatial cell atlases and in situ cell typing, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. This review summarizes the key methods and highlights the diverse applications of padlock probe-based ISS in biological and medical research.", "label": 1}
