{"grounding": "The subcellular localization of a biopolymer often informs its function. RNA is traditionally confined to the cytosolic and nuclear spaces, where it plays critical and conserved roles across nearly all biochemical processes. Our recent observation of cell surface glycoRNAs may further explain the extracellular role of RNA. While cellular membranes are efficient gatekeepers of charged polymers such as RNAs, a large body of research has demonstrated the accumulation of specific RNA species outside of the cell, termed extracellular RNAs (exRNAs). Across various species and forms of life, protein pores have evolved to transport RNA across membranes, thus providing a mechanistic path for exRNAs to achieve their extracellular topology. Here, we review types of exRNAs and the pores capable of RNA transport to provide a logical and testable path toward understanding the biogenesis and regulation of cell surface glycoRNAs.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intricate systems and mechanisms that facilitate the crossing of RNA molecules across cellular membranes, focusing on extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs. Recent discoveries have unveiled the presence of glycoRNAs, a novel class of cell surface RNAs, which are modified with glycans and play crucial roles in cell signaling and intercellular communication. The paper discusses the biogenesis, trafficking, and functional implications of these RNA species, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Additionally, the mechanisms governing exRNA secretion and uptake, including vesicular and non-vesicular pathways, are examined, providing a comprehensive overview of the dynamic RNA trafficking landscape. This knowledge is essential for understanding the complex regulatory networks that govern cellular processes and intercellular communication.", "label": 1}
