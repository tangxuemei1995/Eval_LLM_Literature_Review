{"grounding": "Continued advances in precision medicine rely on the widespread sharing of data that relate human genetic variation to disease. However, data sharing is severely limited by legal, regulatory, and ethical restrictions that safeguard patient privacy. Federated analysis addresses this problem by transferring the code to the data\u2014providing the technical and legal capability to analyze the data within their secure home environment rather than transferring the data to another institution for analysis. This allows researchers to gain new insights from data that cannot be moved, while respecting patient privacy and the data stewards\u2019 legal obligations. Because federated analysis is a technical solution to the legal challenges inherent in data sharing, the technology and policy implications must be evaluated together. Here, we summarize the technical approaches to federated analysis and provide a legal analysis of their policy implications.", "generated_text": "Federated analysis represents a transformative approach to data sharing, enabling collaborative research while preserving privacy and compliance with legal frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This primer explores the technical and legal dimensions of federated analysis, particularly in the context of genomics. By distributing computation across multiple sites, federated analysis minimizes data movement, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring that sensitive information remains under local control. We discuss the technical mechanisms, including secure multi-party computation and differential privacy, that underpin federated analysis. Additionally, we examine the legal considerations, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, that must be addressed to align with GDPR requirements. This comprehensive overview aims to provide researchers and legal professionals with the necessary insights to implement federated analysis effectively and responsibly.", "label": 1}
