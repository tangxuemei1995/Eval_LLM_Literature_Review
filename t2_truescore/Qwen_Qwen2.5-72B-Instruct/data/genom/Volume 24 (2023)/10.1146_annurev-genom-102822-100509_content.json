{"grounding": "DECIPHER (Database of Genomic Variation and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) shares candidate diagnostic variants and phenotypic data from patients with genetic disorders to facilitate research and improve the diagnosis, management, and therapy of rare diseases. The platform sits at the boundary between genomic research and the clinical community. DECIPHER aims to ensure that the most up-to-date data are made rapidly available within its interpretation interfaces to improve clinical care. Newly integrated cardiac case\u2013control data that provide evidence of gene\u2013disease associations and inform variant interpretation exemplify this mission. New research resources are presented in a format optimized for use by a broad range of professionals supporting the delivery of genomic medicine. The interfaces within DECIPHER integrate and contextualize variant and phenotypic data, helping to determine a robust clinico-molecular diagnosis for rare-disease patients, which combines both variant classification and clinical fit. DECIPHER supports discovery research, connecting individuals within the rare-disease community to pursue hypothesis-driven research.", "generated_text": "DECIPHER, a dynamic platform for integrating genomic and clinical data, significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of genetic diagnosis in rare and complex genetic disorders. By leveraging advanced algorithms for variant interpretation and genotype\u2013phenotype correlation, DECIPHER facilitates the identification of disease-causing mutations, even in cases with limited or ambiguous clinical information. This study evaluates the impact of DECIPHER on diagnostic outcomes, demonstrating a substantial increase in the rate of confirmed genetic diagnoses compared to traditional methods. The platform's ability to continuously update and refine its data through user contributions and machine learning ensures that it remains a cutting-edge tool in the field of medical genetics. Our findings highlight the critical role of integrated data platforms in improving patient care and advancing our understanding of genetic disorders.", "label": 1}
