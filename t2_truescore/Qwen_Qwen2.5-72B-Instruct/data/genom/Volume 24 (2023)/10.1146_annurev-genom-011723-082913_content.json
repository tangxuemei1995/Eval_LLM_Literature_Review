{"grounding": "While the neural crest cell population gives rise to an extraordinary array of derivatives, including elements of the craniofacial skeleton, skin pigmentation, and peripheral nervous system, it is today increasingly recognized that Schwann cell precursors are also multipotent. Two mammalian paralogs of the SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin-remodeling complexes, BAF (Brg1-associated factors) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF), are critical for neural crest specification during normal mammalian development. There is increasing evidence that pathogenic variants in components of the BAF and PBAF complexes play central roles in the pathogenesis of neural crest\u2013derived tumors. Transgenic mouse models demonstrate a temporal window early in development where pathogenic variants in Smarcb1 result in the formation of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors, such as rhabdoid tumors. By contrast, later in development, homozygous inactivation of Smarcb1 requires additional pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor genes to drive the development of differentiated adult neoplasms derived from the neural crest, which have a comparatively good prognosis in humans.\n", "generated_text": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a critical role in neural crest cell (NCC) development and is implicated in various diseases, including schwannoma. This complex, which includes the SMARCB1 subunit, is essential for the proper differentiation and function of Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), a subset of NCCs. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of SWI/SNF in regulating gene expression during NCC migration and differentiation. Mutations in SMARCB1, a core component of the complex, are associated with rhabdoid tumors and schwannomas, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Additionally, the loss of NF2, a gene frequently mutated in schwannomas, disrupts SWI/SNF function, further emphasizing the complex's role in disease. This review summarizes the current understanding of the SWI/SNF complex's involvement in NCC development and its implications in schwannoma pathogenesis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets.", "label": 1}
