{"grounding": "The axial length of the eye is critical for normal visual function by enabling light to precisely focus on the retina. The mean axial length of the adult human eye is 23.5 mm, but the molecular mechanisms regulating ocular axial length remain poorly understood. Underdevelopment can lead to microphthalmia (defined as a small eye with an axial length of less than 19 mm at 1 year of age or less than 21 mm in adulthood) within the first trimester of pregnancy. However, continued overgrowth can lead to axial high myopia (an enlarged eye with an axial length of 26.5 mm or more) at any age. Both conditions show high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity associated with significant visual morbidity worldwide. More than 90 genes can contribute to microphthalmia, and several hundred genes are associated with myopia, yet diagnostic yields are low. Crucially, the genetic pathways underpinning the specification of eye size are only now being discovered, with evidence suggesting that shared molecular pathways regulate under- or overgrowth of the eye. Improving our mechanistic understanding of axial length determination will help better inform us of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations in both microphthalmia and myopia, dissect gene\u2013environment interactions in myopia, and develop postnatal therapies that may influence overall eye growth.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the genetic determinants of axial length (AL) variations, focusing on the spectrum from microphthalmia to high myopia in childhood. Utilizing a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a cohort of 2,500 children, we identified several novel genetic loci significantly associated with AL. Key findings include the identification of variants in the ZNF516 and SLC39A8 genes, which were strongly linked to both microphthalmia and high myopia. Additionally, we observed that the PAX6 gene, known for its role in eye development, exhibited a dose-dependent effect on AL, with greater expression associated with increased AL and higher myopia severity. Pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix organization are crucial in regulating AL. These findings provide insights into the genetic architecture underlying AL variations and highlight potential therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating the progression of high myopia and microphthalmia in children. The results underscore the importance of early genetic screening and personalized interventions in managing these conditions.", "label": 0}
