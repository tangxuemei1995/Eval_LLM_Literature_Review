{"grounding": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic blood disease caused by a point mutation in the gene coding for \u03b2-globin. The abnormal hemoglobin [sickle hemoglobin (HbS)] polymerizes under low-oxygen conditions and causes red blood cells to sickle. The clinical presentation varies from very severe (with acute pain, chronic pain, and early mortality) to normal (few complications and a normal life span). The variability of SCD might be due (in part) to various genetic modulators. First, we review the main genetic factors, polymorphisms, and modifier genes that influence the expression of globin or otherwise modulate the severity of SCD. Considering SCD as a complex, multifactorial disorder is important for the development of appropriate pharmacological and genetic treatments. Second, we review the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of the latest advances in gene therapy for SCD, from lentiviral-vector-based approaches to gene-editing strategies.", "generated_text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to distorted red blood cells and chronic complications. Recent advancements in understanding genetic modifiers have identified key factors influencing disease severity, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. Gene therapy trials, utilizing viral vectors to deliver functional genes, have shown promising results in correcting the underlying genetic defect. However, concerns over genotoxicity and long-term safety remain critical challenges. Emerging gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, offer precise correction of the sickle mutation, potentially providing a curative approach. This review summarizes the current state of SCD genetics, highlights recent gene therapy and gene editing advancements, and discusses the potential and limitations of these innovative treatments.", "label": 1}
