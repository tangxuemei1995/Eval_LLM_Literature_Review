{"grounding": "In meiosis, homologous chromosome synapsis is mediated by a supramolecular protein structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), that assembles between homologous chromosome axes. The mammalian SC comprises at least eight largely coiled-coil proteins that interact and self-assemble to generate a long, zipper-like structure that holds homologous chromosomes in close proximity and promotes the formation of genetic crossovers and accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. In recent years, numerous mutations in human SC genes have been associated with different types of male and female infertility. Here, we integrate structural information on the human SC with mouse and human genetics to describe the molecular mechanisms by which SC mutations can result in human infertility. We outline certain themes in which different SC proteins are susceptible to different types of disease mutation and how genetic variants with seemingly minor effects on SC proteins may act as dominant-negative mutations in which the heterozygous state is pathogenic.", "generated_text": "Meiosis is a specialized cell division essential for sexual reproduction, and its proper execution is crucial for fertility. The synaptonemal complex (SC) plays a pivotal role in meiotic chromosome structure and function, facilitating homologous chromosome pairing, recombination, and segregation. Disruptions in SC formation or function can lead to meiotic defects, which are often associated with infertility. Conditions such as azoospermia in males and primary ovarian failure in females, as well as recurrent pregnancy loss, have been linked to aberrations in the meiotic process. Recent studies have identified specific genetic mutations and environmental factors that affect SC assembly and stability, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these fertility disorders. Understanding the intricate relationship between meiotic chromosome structure, the synaptonemal complex, and reproductive health is crucial for developing diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies to address infertility.", "label": 1}
