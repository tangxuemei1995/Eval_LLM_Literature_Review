{"grounding": "The transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play a pivotal role in bone development and skeletal health. More than 30 different types of skeletal dysplasia are now known to be caused by pathogenic variants in genes that belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and/or regulate TGF-\u03b2/BMP bioavailability. This review describes the latest advances in skeletal dysplasia that is due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling and results in short stature (acromelic dysplasia and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome) or tall stature (Marfan syndrome). We thoroughly describe the clinical features of the patients, the underlying genetic findings, and the pathomolecular mechanisms leading to disease, which have been investigated mainly using patient-derived skin fibroblasts and mouse models. Although no pharmacological treatment is yet available for skeletal dysplasia due to impaired TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling, in recent years advances in the use of drugs targeting TGF-\u03b2 have been made, and we also discuss these advances.", "generated_text": "Skeletal dysplasias encompass a diverse group of genetic disorders affecting bone and cartilage development, often resulting in short or tall stature. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play crucial roles in skeletal development and growth. This review examines the current understanding of how alterations in TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of skeletal dysplasias characterized by atypical stature. Recent studies have identified specific mutations in genes encoding components of these pathways, such as BMPR1A, BMPR2, and TGFBR2, which are associated with both short and tall stature phenotypes. The mechanisms by which these mutations disrupt normal skeletal growth, including altered chondrocyte differentiation and bone matrix formation, are discussed. Additionally, the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting these signaling pathways to correct skeletal abnormalities is explored. Understanding the complex interplay between TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling in skeletal dysplasias may lead to novel treatments and improved clinical outcomes for affected individuals.", "label": 1}
