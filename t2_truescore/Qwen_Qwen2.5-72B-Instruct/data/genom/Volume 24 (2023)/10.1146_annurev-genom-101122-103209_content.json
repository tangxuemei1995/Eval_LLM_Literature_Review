{"grounding": "Genome sequencing is increasingly used in research and integrated into clinical care. In the research domain, large-scale analyses, including whole genome sequencing with variant interpretation and curation, virtually guarantee identification of variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic and actionable. Multiple guidelines recommend that findings associated with actionable conditions be offered to research participants in order to demonstrate respect for autonomy, reciprocity, and participant interests in health and privacy. Some recommendations go further and support offering a wider range of findings, including those that are not immediately actionable. In addition, entities covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be required to provide a participant's raw genomic data on request. Despite these widely endorsed guidelines and requirements, the implementation of return of genomic results and data by researchers remains uneven. This article analyzes the ethical and legal foundations for researcher duties to offer adult participants their interpreted results and raw data as the new normal in genomic research.", "generated_text": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized genomic research, presenting unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery. However, it has also introduced complex ethical, legal, and social issues, particularly concerning the return of results to participants. This paper explores the evolving landscape of returning results in genomic research, focusing on primary, secondary, and incidental findings. We review current guidelines and practices, highlighting the need for a standardized approach that balances the benefits of transparency and participant autonomy with the risks of misinterpretation and psychological impact. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent studies and ethical frameworks, we argue for the development of a new normal in genomic research that prioritizes clear communication, informed consent, and ongoing engagement with participants. This approach not only enhances trust and participation but also aligns with the principles of research ethics, ensuring that the return of results is both meaningful and responsible.", "label": 1}
