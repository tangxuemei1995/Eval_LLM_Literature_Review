{"grounding": "DNA sequencing has revolutionized medicine over recent decades. However, analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA, a hallmark of human genomes, has been limited by short-read technology, with read lengths of 100\u2013300 bp. Long-read sequencing (LRS) permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. LRS permits analysis of large structural variation and haplotypic phasing in human genomes and has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions. It has also recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. With the addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling, LRS promises to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations.", "generated_text": "Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics by enabling the accurate and comprehensive characterization of complex genomic regions, including structural variants, repetitive DNA, and epigenetic modifications. Recent advances in platforms such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore have significantly improved read lengths, accuracy, and throughput, facilitating the identification of pathogenic mutations that are often missed by short-read sequencing. These technologies have also enhanced our understanding of genome structure and function, particularly in non-coding regions. However, several challenges remain, including high error rates, computational demands, and the need for robust bioinformatics tools to analyze and interpret the data. This review highlights the latest developments in long-read sequencing, discusses their applications in clinical and research settings, and addresses the ongoing technical and analytical hurdles that must be overcome to fully realize the potential of these powerful tools.", "label": 1}
