{"grounding": "Genetic data contain a record of our evolutionary history. The availability of large-scale datasets of human populations from various geographic areas and timescales, coupled with advances in the computational methods to analyze these data, has transformed our ability to use genetic data to learn about our evolutionary past. Here, we review some of the widely used statistical methods to explore and characterize population relationships and history using genomic data. We describe the intuition behind commonly used approaches, their interpretation, and important limitations. For illustration, we apply some of these techniques to genome-wide autosomal data from 929 individuals representing 53 worldwide populations that are part of the Human Genome Diversity Project. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers in genomic methods to learn about population history. In sum, this review highlights the power (and limitations) of DNA to infer features of human evolutionary history, complementing the knowledge gleaned from other disciplines, such as archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in methods for assessing population relationships and history using genomic data, focusing on key areas such as demographic inference, admixture, ancestry, effective population size, and molecular clocks. We discuss the application of coalescent theory and population genetic models to infer historical population sizes and migration patterns. Novel approaches for detecting and quantifying admixture events are highlighted, along with their implications for understanding complex population structures. Additionally, we explore the use of molecular clocks to estimate the timing of divergence events and the integration of ancient DNA data to refine demographic models. The review also addresses the challenges and limitations of these methods, including issues of data quality, model assumptions, and computational complexity. Overall, the integration of these methodologies provides a robust framework for unraveling the intricate history and relationships of populations across diverse geographical and temporal scales.", "label": 1}
