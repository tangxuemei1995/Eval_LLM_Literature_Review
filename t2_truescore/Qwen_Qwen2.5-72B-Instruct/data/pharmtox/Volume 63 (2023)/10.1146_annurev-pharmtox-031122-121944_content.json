{"grounding": "The actions of estrogens and related estrogenic molecules are complex and multifaceted in both sexes. A wide array of natural, synthetic, and therapeutic molecules target pathways that produce and respond to estrogens. Multiple receptors promulgate these responses, including the classical estrogen receptors of the nuclear hormone receptor family (estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2), which function largely as ligand-activated transcription factors, and the 7-transmembrane G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor, GPER, which activates a diverse array of signaling pathways. The pharmacology and functional roles of GPER in physiology and disease reveal important roles in responses to both natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds in numerous physiological systems. These functions have implications in the treatment of myriad disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the complex pharmacology of GPER and summarizes major physiological functions of GPER and the therapeutic implications and ongoing applications of GPER-targeted compounds.", "generated_text": "The G protein\u2013coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a key player in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, cardiovascular health, endocrine function, immune responses, and metabolism. This receptor, distinct from classical nuclear estrogen receptors, mediates rapid, non-genomic effects of estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying GPER activation and signaling, revealing its involvement in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. In cancer, GPER is implicated in the progression and therapeutic resistance of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. In cardiovascular disease, GPER activation can exert protective effects, while in metabolic disorders, it modulates insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis. This review summarizes the current understanding of GPER's molecular pharmacology and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for a range of diseases, emphasizing the need for selective GPER agonists and antagonists to harness its therapeutic benefits while minimizing side effects.", "label": 1}
