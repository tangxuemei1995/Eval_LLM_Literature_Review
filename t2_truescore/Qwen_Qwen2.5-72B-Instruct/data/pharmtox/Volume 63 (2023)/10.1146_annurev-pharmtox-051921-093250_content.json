{"grounding": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to poor functional outcomes. Methods for assessment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are now well established. In addition, there has been increasing appreciation in recent years of the additional role of social cognitive impairment in driving functional outcomes and of the contributions of sensory-level dysfunction to higher-order impairments. At the neurochemical level, acute administration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists reproduces the pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia, encouraging the development of treatments targeted at both NMDAR and its interactome. At the local-circuit level, an auditory neurophysiological measure, mismatch negativity, has emerged both as a veridical index of NMDAR dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia and as a critical biomarker for early-stage translational drug development. Although no compounds have yet been approved for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, several candidates are showing promise in early-phase testing.", "generated_text": "Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by significant cognitive impairments, which often precede and persist beyond the onset of psychotic symptoms. These cognitive deficits, encompassing domains such as attention, memory, and executive function, are increasingly recognized as core features of the illness and major contributors to functional disability. Recent advances in neurobiology have highlighted the role of glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems in the pathophysiology of these cognitive deficits. Specifically, dysregulation of NMDA receptors and altered dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are implicated in the disrupted neural processing observed in schizophrenia. Electrophysiological measures, such as mismatch negativity, have provided insights into early sensory processing deficits, further supporting the involvement of glutamate and dopamine in cognitive dysfunction. Current treatment strategies, including atypical antipsychotics and cognitive remediation therapies, aim to address these deficits, but more targeted interventions are needed. Emerging pharmacological approaches, such as NMDA receptor modulators and dopamine D2 receptor agonists, show promise in improving cognitive outcomes. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and discusses potential therapeutic avenues.", "label": 1}
