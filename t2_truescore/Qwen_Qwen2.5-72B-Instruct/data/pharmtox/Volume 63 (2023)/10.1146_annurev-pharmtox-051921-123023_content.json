{"grounding": "Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cellular metabolism to electrical activity in multiple tissues; their unique assembly as four Kir6 pore-forming subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits has resulted in a large armory of selective channel opener and inhibitor drugs. The spectrum of monogenic pathologies that result from gain- or loss-of-function mutations in these channels, and the potential for therapeutic correction of these pathologies, is now clear. However, while available drugs can be effective treatments for specific pathologies, cross-reactivity with the other Kir6 or SUR subfamily members can result in drug-induced versions of each pathology and may limit therapeutic usefulness. This review discusses the background to KATP channel physiology, pathology, and pharmacology and considers the potential for more specific or effective therapeutic agents.", "generated_text": "This review focuses on the development of personalized therapeutics for KATP-dependent pathologies, emphasizing the roles of Kir6.2, Kir6.1, SUR1, and SUR2 subunits. Congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant\u00fa syndrome are highlighted as key conditions where mutations in these subunits lead to dysregulated ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel function. Recent advances in genetic screening and pharmacological interventions are discussed, including the use of sulfonylureas and KATP channel openers. The review also explores the potential of gene therapy and precision medicine approaches to tailor treatments to individual genetic profiles, aiming to improve clinical outcomes and reduce side effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders is crucial for developing effective, patient-specific therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
