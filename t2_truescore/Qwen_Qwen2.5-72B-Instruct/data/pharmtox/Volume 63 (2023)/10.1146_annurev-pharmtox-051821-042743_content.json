{"grounding": "Chronic diseases that affect our society are made more complex by comorbidities and are poorly managed by the current pharmacology. While all present inflammatory etiopathogeneses, there is an unmet need for better clinical management of these diseases and their multiple symptoms. We discuss here an innovative approach based on the biology of the resolution of inflammation. Studying endogenous pro-resolving peptide and lipid mediators, how they are formed, and which target they interact with, can offer innovative options through augmenting the expression or function of pro-resolving pathways or mimicking their actions with novel targeted molecules. In all cases, resolution offers innovation for the treatment of the primary cause of a given disease and/or for the management of its comorbidities, ultimately improving patient quality of life. By implementing resolution pharmacology, we harness the whole physiology of inflammation, with the potential to bring a marked change in the management of inflammatory conditions.", "generated_text": "The resolution of inflammation is a critical process that prevents chronic inflammation and tissue damage. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of annexin A1 (AnxA1) and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in promoting the resolution of inflammation. AnxA1, a protein with potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties, and its derived peptides have shown promise in modulating immune responses and facilitating tissue repair. SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that actively resolve inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization, enhancing bacterial clearance, and reducing cytokine production. Recent studies highlight the synergistic effects of AnxA1 and SPMs in various inflammatory conditions, suggesting their combined use as a novel therapeutic strategy. This review discusses the mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and future directions for the development of AnxA1 peptides and SPMs in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches in inflammation management.", "label": 0}
