{"grounding": "Inflammation and its timely resolution are critical to ensure effective host defense and appropriate tissue repair after injury and or infection. Chronic, unresolved inflammation typifies many prevalent pathologies. The key mediators that initiate and drive the inflammatory response are well defined and targeted by conventional anti-inflammatory therapeutics. More recently, there is a growing appreciation that specific mediators, including arachidonate-derived lipoxins, are generated in self-limiting inflammatory responses to promote the resolution of inflammation and endogenous repair mechanisms without compromising host defense. We discuss the proresolving biological actions of lipoxins and recent efforts to harness their therapeutic potential through the development of novel, potent lipoxin mimetics generated via efficient, modular stereoselective synthetic pathways. We consider the evidence that lipoxin mimetics may have applications in limiting inflammation and reversing fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Lipoxins, endogenous lipid mediators, play a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation by promoting anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals. This study investigates the efficacy of two novel lipoxin mimetics, AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, in modulating inflammatory responses and preventing fibrosis. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that both compounds significantly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance the expression of resolution-phase mediators. AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT effectively attenuate fibrotic changes in lung and liver tissues, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents. These findings underscore the importance of lipoxin mimetics in promoting the resolution of inflammation and suggest their utility in treating chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.", "label": 1}
