{"grounding": "Antiplatelet therapy is used in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clopidogrel is the most widely used antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor in clinical practice. Genetic variation in CYP2C19 may influence its enzymatic activity, resulting in individuals who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and thus have reduced active clopidogrel metabolites, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and increased ischemic risk. Prospective studies have examined the utility of CYP2C19 genetic testing to guide antiplatelet therapy, and more recently published meta-analyses suggest that pharmacogenetics represents a key treatment strategy to individualize antiplatelet therapy. Rapid genetic tests, including bedside genotyping platforms that are validated and have high reproducibility, are available to guide selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the background and rationale for the role of a guided antiplatelet approach to enhance patient care.", "generated_text": "Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in optimizing antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Variants in the CYP2C19 gene, a key enzyme in the metabolism of prodrugs like clopidogrel, significantly influence therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse events. This review synthesizes current evidence on the pharmacogenomics of antiplatelet agents, highlighting the clinical utility of CYP2C19 genotyping to guide personalized treatment strategies. Studies have demonstrated that CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with reduced drug efficacy and increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Precision medicine approaches, including genotype-guided dosing and alternative antiplatelet agents, have shown promise in improving outcomes and reducing complications. Future research should focus on validating these findings in diverse populations and integrating pharmacogenetic testing into routine clinical practice to enhance the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet therapy.", "label": 1}
