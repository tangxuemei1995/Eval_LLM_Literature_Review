{"grounding": "With the worldwide increase in life span, surgical patients are becoming older and have a greater propensity for postoperative cognitive impairment, either new onset or through deterioration of an existing condition; in both conditions, knowledge of the patient's preoperative cognitive function and postoperative cognitive trajectory is imperative. We describe the clinical utility of a tablet-based technique for rapid assessment of the memory and attentiveness domains required for executive function. The pathogenic mechanisms for perioperative neurocognitive disorders have been investigated in animal models in which excessive and/or prolonged postoperative neuroinflammation has emerged as a likely contender. The cellular and molecular species involved in postoperative neuroinflammation are the putative targets for future therapeutic interventions that are efficacious and do not interfere with the surgical patient's healing process.", "generated_text": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including postoperative delirium, pose significant challenges to perioperative brain health. This review examines experimental models and potential druggable targets to mitigate PNDs. Animal models, such as aged rodents subjected to surgical stress, have elucidated the role of neuroinflammation in cognitive decline. Key pathways, including the activation of microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, are identified as critical mediators. Clinical studies support these findings, highlighting the importance of comprehensive cognitive assessment and the development of care pathways to optimize perioperative management. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation, such as selective inhibitors of microglial activation, show promise in reducing the incidence and severity of PNDs. This integrative approach aims to enhance perioperative brain health and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
