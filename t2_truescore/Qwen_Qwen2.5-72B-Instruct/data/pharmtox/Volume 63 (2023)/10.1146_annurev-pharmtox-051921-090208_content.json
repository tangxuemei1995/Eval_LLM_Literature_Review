{"grounding": "The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in seafood, supplements, and concentrated pharmaceutical preparations. Prospective cohort studies demonstrate an association between higher intakes of EPA+DHA or higher levels of EPA and DHA in the body and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and of cardiovascular mortality in the general population. The cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA is due to the beneficial modulation of a number of risk factors for CVD. Some large trials support the use of EPA+DHA (or EPA alone) in high-risk patients, although the evidence is inconsistent. This review presents key studies of EPA and DHA in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD, briefly describes potential mechanisms of action, and discusses recently published RCTs and meta-analyses. Potential adverse aspects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in relation to CVD are discussed.", "generated_text": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential benefits in cardiovascular health. These fatty acids, commonly sourced from fish oil, have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels, lower blood pressure, and decrease the risk of arrhythmias. However, the evidence regarding their impact on major cardiovascular events remains mixed. Some studies suggest that LCn-3 PUFAs can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, while others indicate no significant benefit. Potential drawbacks include increased bleeding risk and interactions with anticoagulant medications. This review synthesizes current research to provide a balanced perspective on the pros and cons of LCn-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular health, highlighting the need for personalized approaches based on individual risk factors and medical history.", "label": 1}
