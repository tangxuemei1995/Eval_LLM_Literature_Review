{"grounding": "Lysosomes play fundamental roles in material digestion, cellular clearance, recycling, exocytosis, wound repair, Ca2+ signaling, nutrient signaling, and gene expression regulation. The organelle also serves as a hub for important signaling networks involving the mTOR and AKT kinases. Electrophysiological recording and molecular and structural studies in the past decade have uncovered several unique lysosomal ion channels and transporters, including TPCs, TMEM175, TRPMLs, CLN7, and CLC-7. They underlie the organelle's permeability to major ions, including K+, Na+, H+, Ca2+, and Cl\u2212. The channels are regulated by numerous cellular factors, ranging from H+ in the lumen and voltage across the lysosomal membrane to ATP in the cytosol to growth factors outside the cell. Genetic variations in the channel/transporter genes are associated with diseases that include lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies with human genetics and channel activators suggest that lysosomal channels may be attractive targets for the development of therapeutics for the prevention of and intervention in human diseases.", "generated_text": "Lysosomal ion channels, including transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPMLs), two-pore channels (TPCs), and transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175), play crucial roles in lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis. These channels regulate lysosomal pH, calcium signaling, and autophagy, which are essential for various physiological processes. Dysregulation of these channels has been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and mucolipidosis. Recent advances in structural biology and functional studies have provided insights into the mechanisms of these channels and their potential as therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the current understanding of lysosomal ion channels, their physiological functions, and the implications of their dysfunction in disease. Additionally, we discuss the emerging evidence supporting the druggability of these channels, highlighting the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate lysosomal function and treat neurodegenerative conditions.", "label": 1}
