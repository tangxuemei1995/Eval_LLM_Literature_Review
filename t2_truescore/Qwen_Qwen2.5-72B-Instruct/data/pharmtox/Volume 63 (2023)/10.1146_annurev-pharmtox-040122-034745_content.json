{"grounding": "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), an important intracellular second messenger, mediates cellular functional responses in all vital organs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is one of the 11 members of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) family that specifically targets cGMP generated by nitric oxide\u2013driven activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil and tadalafil, are widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and certain urological disorders. Preclinical studies have shown promising effects of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, cancer and anticancer-drug-associated cardiotoxicity, diabetes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and other aging-related conditions. Many clinical trials with PDE5 inhibitors have focused on the potential cardiovascular, anticancer, and neurological benefits. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PDE5 inhibitors and their potential therapeutic indications for various clinical disorders beyond erectile dysfunction.", "generated_text": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, initially developed for erectile dysfunction, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for a wide array of clinical disorders. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of PDE5 inhibitors in treating conditions characterized by endothelial dysfunction, such as cardiovascular diseases, where they exhibit cardioprotective effects by enhancing nitric oxide signaling and improving vascular function. Additionally, these inhibitors have shown potential in managing metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity, by modulating glucose metabolism and reducing insulin resistance. Emerging evidence also suggests their beneficial effects in mitigating age-related decline and their potential as adjunctive therapy in cancer, where they can enhance the efficacy of existing treatments and reduce tumor progression. This comprehensive overview underscores the broad therapeutic potential of PDE5 inhibitors beyond their traditional use, opening new avenues for their application in clinical practice.", "label": 1}
