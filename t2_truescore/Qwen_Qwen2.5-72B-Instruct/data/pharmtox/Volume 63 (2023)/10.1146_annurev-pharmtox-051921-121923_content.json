{"grounding": "Phosphatases and kinases maintain an equilibrium of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins, respectively, that are required for critical cellular functions. Imbalance in this equilibrium or irregularity in their function causes unfavorable cellular effects that have been implicated in the development of numerous diseases. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) catalyze the dephosphorylation of protein substrates on tyrosine residues, and their involvement in cell signaling and diseases such as cancer and inflammatory and metabolic diseases has made them attractive therapeutic targets. However, PTPs have proved challenging in therapeutics development, garnering them the unfavorable reputation of being undruggable. Nonetheless, great strides have been made toward the inhibition of PTPs over the past decade. Here, we discuss the advancement in small-molecule inhibition for the PTP subfamily known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs). We review strategies and inhibitor discovery tools that have proven successful for small-molecule inhibition of the MKPs and discuss what the future of MKP inhibition potentially might yield.", "generated_text": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs), a subset of dual specificity protein phosphatases, play a crucial role in regulating the activity of MAPKs, which are central to various cell signaling pathways. Despite their therapeutic potential, MKPs have long been considered undruggable due to the challenges associated with targeting the highly conserved catalytic site of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Recent advances in structural biology and chemical biology have identified novel allosteric sites on MKPs, providing new opportunities for the development of small molecule inhibitors. These inhibitors can modulate MKP activity and, consequently, the MAPK signaling pathways, offering promising therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights the latest progress in understanding the structure and function of MKPs and discusses the emerging approaches to target these proteins, emphasizing the potential of allosteric modulation as a viable strategy to overcome the undruggability of MKPs.", "label": 1}
