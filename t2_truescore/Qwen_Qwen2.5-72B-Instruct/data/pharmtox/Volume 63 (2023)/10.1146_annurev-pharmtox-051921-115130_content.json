{"grounding": "Apoptosis is central for the maintenance of health. In the immune system, apoptosis guarantees proper development of immune cells and shutdown of immune reactions by the coordinated elimination of activated immune cells. Limitation of the life span of granulocytes is important, as overactivation of these cells is associated with chronic inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Consequently, targeted induction of granulocyte apoptosis may be beneficial in the course of respective immune disorders. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies against IL-5R\u03b1 exert their function in part by triggering eosinophil apoptosis. Agonistic antibodies targeting Siglec-8 or death receptors are tested (pre)clinically. Moreover, a new class of inhibitors targeting antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins shows great promise for anticancer treatments. Because of their specificity and tolerable side effects, these so-called BH3 mimetics may be worthwhile to evaluate in inflammatory disorders. Here, we review past and recent data on pharmacological apoptosis induction of granulocytes and highlight respective therapeutic potential.", "generated_text": "This review explores the pharmacological strategies aimed at inducing cell death in granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Granulocytes play a critical role in innate immunity but can contribute to tissue damage and chronic inflammation when their activity is dysregulated. The mechanisms of apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in granulocytes are discussed, highlighting the specific pathways that can be targeted to promote cell death. Recent studies have identified several compounds, such as glucocorticoids, anthracyclines, and BH3 mimetics, that effectively induce apoptosis in granulocytes without significantly affecting lymphocytes. These findings suggest that pharmacological induction of granulocyte cell death could be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce inflammation and prevent tissue damage in conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and rheumatoid arthritis. Further research is needed to optimize these compounds and to evaluate their safety and efficacy in clinical settings.", "label": 1}
