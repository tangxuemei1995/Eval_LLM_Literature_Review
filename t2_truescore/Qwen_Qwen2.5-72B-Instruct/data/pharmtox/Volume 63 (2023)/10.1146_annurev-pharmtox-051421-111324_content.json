{"grounding": "A long-standing recognition that information from human genetics studies has the potential to accelerate drug discovery has led to decades of research on how to leverage genetic and phenotypic information for drug discovery. Established simple and advanced statistical methods that allow the simultaneous analysis of genotype and clinical phenotype data by genome- and phenome-wide analyses, colocalization analyses with quantitative trait loci data from transcriptomics and proteomics data sets from different tissues, and Mendelian randomization are essential tools for drug development in the postgenomic era. Numerous studies have demonstrated how genomic data provide opportunities for the identification of new drug targets, the repurposing of drugs, and drug safety analyses. With an increase in the number of biobanks that enable linking in-depth omics data with rich repositories of phenotypic traits via electronic health records, more powerful ways for the evaluation and validation of drug targets will continue to expand across different disciplines of clinical research.", "generated_text": "The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) with genomics offers a powerful approach to accelerate drug discovery. By leveraging large-scale genomic datasets and EHRs, researchers can identify novel drug targets through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). Mendelian randomization techniques further strengthen causal inference by using genetic variants as instrumental variables. This review highlights recent advancements in combining EHRs and genomics to uncover potential therapeutic targets, emphasizing the importance of rigorous data harmonization and analytical methods. Case studies demonstrate the successful application of these integrated approaches in identifying new targets for cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, and cancer. The synergy between EHRs and genomics not only enhances the efficiency of drug discovery but also paves the way for personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient outcomes.", "label": 0}
