{"grounding": "Leukotrienes are potent immune-regulating lipid mediators with patho-genic roles in inflammatory and allergic diseases, particularly asthma. These autacoids also contribute to low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and tumor diseases. Biosynthesis of leukotrienes involves release and oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid and proceeds via a set of cytosolic and integral membrane enzymes that are typically expressed by cells of the innate immune system. In activated cells, these enzymes traffic and assemble at the endoplasmic and perinuclear membrane, together comprising a biosynthetic complex. Here we describe recent advances in our molecular understanding of the protein components of the leukotriene-synthesizing enzyme machinery and also briefly touch upon the leukotriene receptors. Moreover, we discuss emerging opportunities for pharmacological intervention and development of new therapeutics.", "generated_text": "Leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid, play a pivotal role in mediating inflammatory responses and are implicated in various endemic diseases. This review highlights recent advances in the structural characterization of key leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes, including 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. These structural insights have facilitated the development of novel therapeutics through structure-based drug design, aiming to modulate enzyme activity and reduce leukotriene production. Emerging inhibitors show promising efficacy in preclinical models, suggesting potential for treating inflammatory conditions. The integration of structural biology with medicinal chemistry offers a robust framework for the discovery of next-generation anti-inflammatory drugs.", "label": 1}
