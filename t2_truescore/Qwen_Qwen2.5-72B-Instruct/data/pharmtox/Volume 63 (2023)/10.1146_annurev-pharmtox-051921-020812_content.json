{"grounding": "Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, with adsorbed organic and inorganic contaminants, to which exposure is lifelong. Epidemiological studies increasingly associate air pollution with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, findings supported by experimental animal models. This breadth of neurotoxicity across these central nervous system diseases and disorders likely reflects shared vulnerability of their inflammatory and oxidative stress\u2013based mechanisms and a corresponding ability to produce brain metal dyshomeo-stasis. Future research to define the responsible contaminants of air pollution underlying this neurotoxicity is critical to understanding mechanisms of these diseases and disorders and protecting public health.", "generated_text": "This review examines the impact of air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, on neurotoxicity across the life span. Emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to these pollutants disrupts brain metal dyshomeostasis, contributing to the development of neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in mediating these effects. The review also discusses the implications for public health and the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the adverse neurological outcomes associated with air pollution exposure.", "label": 0}
