{"grounding": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) that target the endocannabinoid system, triggering a plethora of actions (e.g., elevated mood sensation, relaxation, appetite stimulation) that resemble, but are more intense than, those induced by cannabis. Although some of these effects have been explored for therapeutic applications, anticipated stronger psychoactive effects than cannabis and reduced risk perception have increased the recreational use of SCs, which have dominated the NPS market in the United States and Europe over the past decade. However, rising SC-related intoxications and deaths represent a major public health concern and embody a major challenge for policy makers.\nHere, we review the pharmacology and toxicology of SCs. A thorough characterization of SCs\u2019 pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics is important to better understand the main mechanisms underlying acute and chronic effects of SCs, interpret the clinical/pathological findings related to SC use, and improve SC risk awareness.", "generated_text": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), often marketed as 'legal highs' or 'herbal incense,' represent a rapidly evolving class of new psychoactive substances (NPS) that mimic the effects of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. These compounds, including those found in products like Spice, bind to the endocannabinoid system, particularly the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with varying affinities and potencies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of SCs, highlighting their mechanisms of action, metabolic pathways, and the acute and chronic health risks associated with their use. The prevalence of SCs in the context of substance use disorders is discussed, along with the challenges in detecting and regulating these designer drugs. The findings underscore the need for enhanced public health interventions and more robust legislative frameworks to mitigate the adverse impacts of SCs on individual and community health.", "label": 1}
