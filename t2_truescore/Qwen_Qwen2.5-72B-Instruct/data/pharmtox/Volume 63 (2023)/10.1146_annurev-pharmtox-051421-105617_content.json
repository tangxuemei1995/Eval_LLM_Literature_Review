{"grounding": "Pharmacology and toxicology are part of a much broader effort to understand the relationship between chemistry and biology. While biomedicine has necessarily focused on specific cases, typically of direct human relevance, there are real advantages in pursuing more systematic approaches to characterizing how health and disease are influenced by small molecules and other interventions. In this context, the zebrafish is now established as the representative screenable vertebrate and, through ongoing advances in the available scale of genome editing and automated phenotyping, is beginning to address systems-level solutions to some biomedical problems. The addition of broader efforts to integrate information content across preclinical model organisms and the incorporation of rigorous analytics, including closed-loop deep learning, will facilitate efforts to create systems pharmacology and toxicology with the ability to continuously optimize chemical biological interactions around societal needs. In this review, we outline progress toward this goal.", "generated_text": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a powerful and scalable in vivo model for systems pharmacology and toxicology due to their genetic similarity to humans, rapid development, and cost-effectiveness. This review highlights the utility of zebrafish in elucidating the mechanisms of drug action and toxicity, facilitating high-throughput screening, and providing insights into complex biological processes. Recent advancements in genetic manipulation and imaging technologies have further enhanced the applicability of zebrafish for studying drug metabolism, transport, and target engagement. Additionally, zebrafish offer a valuable alternative to traditional mammalian models, reducing the need for higher vertebrates in preclinical research. This paper discusses key studies that demonstrate the translational potential of zebrafish, emphasizing their role in advancing drug discovery and safety assessment.", "label": 1}
