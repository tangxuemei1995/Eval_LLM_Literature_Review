{"grounding": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in pharmaceutical research and development has to date focused on research: target identification; docking-, fragment-, and motif-based generation of compound libraries; modeling of synthesis feasibility; rank-ordering likely hits according to structural and chemometric similarity to compounds having known activity and affinity to the target(s); optimizing a smaller library for synthesis and high-throughput screening; and combining evidence from screening to support hit-to-lead decisions. Applying AI/ML methods to lead optimization and lead-to-candidate (L2C) decision-making has shown slower progress, especially regarding predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology properties. The present review surveys reasons why this is so, reports progress that has occurred in recent years, and summarizes some of the issues that remain. Effective AI/ML tools to derisk L2C and later phases of development are important to accelerate the pharmaceutical development process, ameliorate escalating development costs, and achieve greater success rates.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the drug discovery process has revolutionized lead-to-candidate decision-making. This review highlights the advancements in AI and ML techniques that enhance decision quality, from initial hit identification to the optimization of lead compounds. Computational toxicology, a critical component in this pipeline, leverages these technologies to predict adverse effects and improve the safety profile of drug candidates. Case studies demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven models in reducing time and costs associated with traditional methods. The discussion also explores the challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for robust data integration and interdisciplinary collaboration to fully realize the potential of AI in drug discovery. This work underscores the transformative impact of AI and ML on the pharmaceutical industry, paving the way for more efficient and effective drug development processes.", "label": 0}
