{"grounding": "In ligand bias different agonist drugs are thought to produce distinct signaling outputs when activating the same receptor. If these signaling outputs mediate therapeutic versus adverse drug effects, then agonists that selectively activate the therapeutic signaling pathway would be extremely beneficial. It has long been thought that \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists that selectively activate G protein\u2013 over \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways would produce effective analgesia without the adverse effects such as respiratory depression. However, more recent data indicate that most of the therapeutic and adverse effects of agonist-induced activation of the \u03bc-opioid receptor are actually mediated by the G protein\u2013dependent signaling pathway, and that a number of drugs described as G protein biased in fact may not be biased, but instead may be low-intrinsic-efficacy agonists. In this review we discuss the current state of the field of bias at the \u03bc-opioid receptor and other opioid receptor subtypes.", "generated_text": "The concept of biased agonism, where a ligand preferentially activates one signaling pathway over another, has gained significant attention in the field of opioid receptor pharmacology. This review highlights recent studies that elucidate the mechanisms of ligand bias at opioid receptors, particularly focusing on the differential activation of G protein and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that biased agonists can offer therapeutic advantages by modulating specific signaling outcomes, potentially reducing side effects associated with traditional opioid analgesics. Through detailed analyses of molecular interactions and signaling cascades, this work provides insights into the design of more effective and safer opioid receptor agonists. The implications of these findings extend beyond pain management, offering a framework for the development of biased agonists in other therapeutic areas.", "label": 1}
