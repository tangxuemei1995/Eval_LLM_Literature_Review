{"grounding": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that are synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during the acute phase or resolution phase of inflammation. Synthetic SPMs possess broad safety profiles and exhibit potent actions in resolving inflammation in preclinical models. Accumulating evidence in the past decade has demonstrated powerful analgesia of exogenous SPMs in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain. Furthermore, endogenous SPMs are produced by sham surgery and neuromodulation (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation). SPMs produce their beneficial actions through multiple G protein\u2013coupled receptors, expressed by immune cells, glial cells, and neurons. Notably, loss of SPM receptors impairs the resolution of pain. I also highlight the emerging role of SPMs in the control of itch. Pharmacological targeting of SPMs or SPM receptors has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics for pain and itch as emerging approaches in resolution pharmacology.", "generated_text": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have emerged as key regulators in the resolution of inflammation and pain. This review highlights the role of SPMs, including neuroprotectin D1 and resolvins, in modulating nociceptive sensory neurons and their interactions with transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. These mediators exhibit neuroimmune modulatory properties, attenuating pain and itch by influencing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulating the activity of sensory neurons. Preclinical studies demonstrate that SPMs can reduce hyperalgesia and pruritus, suggesting their potential as novel therapeutic agents in resolution pharmacology. The mechanisms underlying these effects, including the activation of specific receptors and signaling pathways, are discussed, providing a foundation for the development of SPM-based therapies for chronic pain and itch management.", "label": 1}
