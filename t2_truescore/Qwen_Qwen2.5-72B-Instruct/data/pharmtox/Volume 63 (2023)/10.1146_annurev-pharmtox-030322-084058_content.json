{"grounding": "The coordinated movement of organic anions (e.g., drugs, metabolites, signaling molecules, nutrients, antioxidants, gut microbiome products) between tissues and body fluids depends, in large part, on organic anion transporters (OATs) [solute carrier 22 (SLC22)], organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) [solute carrier organic (SLCO)], and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) [ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (ABCC)]. Depending on the range of substrates, transporters in these families can be considered multispecific, oligospecific, or (relatively) monospecific. Systems biology analyses of these transporters in the context of expression patterns reveal they are hubs in networks involved in interorgan and interorganismal communication. The remote sensing and signaling theory explains how the coordinated functions of drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and regulatory proteins play a role in optimizing systemic and local levels of important endogenous small molecules. We focus on the role of OATs, OATPs, and MRPs in endogenous metabolism and how their substrates (e.g., bile acids, short chain fatty acids, urate, uremic toxins) mediate interorgan and interorganismal communication and help maintain and restore homeostasis in healthy and disease states.", "generated_text": "This review explores the role of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP2, MRP4) in the context of the Remote Sensing and Signaling (RSS) theory. These transporters, encoded by the SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCC2, and ABCC4 genes, are critical for the renal and hepatic clearance of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The RSS theory posits that these transporters not only facilitate the elimination of toxins but also act as sensors that modulate systemic homeostasis and inter-organ communication. Emerging evidence suggests that OAT, OATP, and MRP transporters can influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, thereby affecting therapeutic outcomes and toxicity. Additionally, the interplay between these transporters and other regulatory pathways, such as those involving the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), highlights the complexity of their roles in maintaining physiological balance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and physiological implications of these transporters, providing insights into their potential as therapeutic targets and biomarkers.", "label": 1}
