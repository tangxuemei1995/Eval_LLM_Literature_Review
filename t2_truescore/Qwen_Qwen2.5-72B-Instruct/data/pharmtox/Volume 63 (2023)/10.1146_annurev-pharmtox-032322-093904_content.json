{"grounding": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which comprises 22 structurally related proteins, plays diverse roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. Among them, two classical members (FGF1 and FGF4) and two endocrine members (FGF19 and FGF21) are important regulators of whole-body energy homeostasis, glucose/lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of these FGFs for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Several genetically engineered FGF19 and FGF21 analogs with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties have been developed and progressed into various stages of clinical trials. These FGF analogs are effective in alleviating hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis in biopsy-confirmed NASH patients, whereas their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects are mildand vary greatly in different clinical trials. This review summarizes recent advances in biopharmaceutical development of FGF-based therapies against obesity-related metabolic complications, highlights major challenges in clinical implementation, and discusses possible strategies to overcome these hurdles.", "generated_text": "Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications. This review summarizes recent advances in FGF-based pharmacotherapies, including recombinant proteins and agonistic antibodies, which have shown significant potential in modulating metabolic pathways. Studies have demonstrated that FGF19 and FGF21 analogs can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce hepatic steatosis, and lower systemic inflammation in preclinical models of obesity. Agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors have also been developed, offering a novel approach to enhance FGF signaling without the systemic side effects associated with traditional protein therapeutics. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these agents in human subjects, with preliminary results indicating a favorable risk-benefit profile. The integration of FGF-based therapies into the clinical management of obesity and its metabolic sequelae represents a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
