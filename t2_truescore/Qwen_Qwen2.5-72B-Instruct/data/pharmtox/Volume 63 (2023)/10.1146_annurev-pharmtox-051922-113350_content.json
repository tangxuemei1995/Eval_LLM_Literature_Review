{"grounding": "Early human life is considered a critical window of susceptibility to external exposures. Infants are exposed to a multitude of environmental factors, collectively referred to as the exposome. The chemical exposome can be summarized as the sum of all xenobiotics that humans are exposed to throughout a lifetime. We review different exposure classes and routes that impact fetal and infant metabolism and the potential toxicological role of mixture effects. We also discuss the progress in human biomonitoring and present possiblemodels for studying maternal\u2013fetal transfer. Data gaps on prenatal and infant exposure to xenobiotic mixtures are identified and include natural biotoxins, in addition to commonly reported synthetic toxicants, to obtain a more holistic assessment of the chemical exposome. We highlight the lack of large-scale studies covering a broad range of xenobiotics. Several recommendations to advance our understanding of the early-life chemical exposome and the subsequent impact on health outcomes are proposed.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, emphasizing the role of human biomonitoring in assessing prenatal and postnatal exposures. The exposome encompasses a wide array of xenobiotics and natural contaminants, which can cross the placental barrier and impact fetal development. Studies utilizing advanced biomonitoring techniques have identified numerous environmental chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants, in maternal and neonatal samples. The placenta, while providing a degree of protection, is not impermeable, and its role in modulating the transfer of these substances is a critical area of investigation. Early life exposure to these chemicals has been linked to adverse health outcomes, including neurodevelopmental disorders, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances. This review highlights the need for comprehensive, longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term health implications of the chemical exposome and to inform public health policies aimed at reducing exposure risks.", "label": 1}
