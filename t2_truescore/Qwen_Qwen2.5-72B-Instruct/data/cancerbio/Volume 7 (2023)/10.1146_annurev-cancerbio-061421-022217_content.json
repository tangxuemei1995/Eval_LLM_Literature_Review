{"grounding": "Ultrahigh\u2013dose rate FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a potentially paradigm-shifting treatment modality that holds the promise of expanding the therapeutic index for nearly any cancer. At the heart of this exciting technology comes the capability to ameliorate major normal tissue complications without compromising the efficacy of tumor killing. This combination of benefits has now been termed the FLASH effect and relies on an in vivo validation to rigorously demonstrate the absence of normal tissue toxicity. The FLASH effect occurs when the overall irradiation time is extremely short (<500 ms), and in this review we attempt to understand how FLASH-RT can kill tumors but spare normal tissues\u2014likely the single most pressing question confronting the field today.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in FLASH radiotherapy (RT) have sparked a reevaluation of radiobiological principles. Unlike conventional RT, FLASH RT delivers ultrahigh dose rates, significantly sparing normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing. This paradigm shift challenges traditional dose-rate theories and suggests a novel mechanism of action. Emerging studies indicate that the unique temporal and spatial distribution of energy in FLASH RT may alter cellular responses, reducing acute side effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This review synthesizes current evidence, highlighting the potential of FLASH RT to transform clinical practice and the need for further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and optimize treatment protocols.", "label": 1}
