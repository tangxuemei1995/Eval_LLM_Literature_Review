{"grounding": "Fusion oncoproteins (FOs) resulting from in-frame chromosomal translocations are associated with many aggressive cancers with poor patient outcomes. Several FOs are now understood to perform their oncogenic functions within biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Two classes of phase-separating FOs have emerged, those that form nuclear condensates and alter chromatin biology, including gene expression, and those that form cytoplasmic condensates and promote aberrant signaling, including RAS/MAPK signaling. The amino acid sequences of the FOs within these classes display LLPS-prone intrinsically disordered regions and folded domains that synergistically interact with themselves and other biomolecules to promote condensate formation. This review summarizes the roles of LLPS in the oncogenic functions of these two FO classes, provides examples of FOs that inhibit physiological LLPS in normal cells, and discusses the sequence features commonly associated with LLPS and their enrichment in many FOs.", "generated_text": "Recent studies have highlighted the significance of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the formation of biomolecular condensates, which play a crucial role in cellular processes such as transcription and signaling. In fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers, these condensates are increasingly recognized as key mediators of oncogenic activity. This review examines the current understanding of how fusion oncoproteins, often characterized by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), utilize LLPS to form functional condensates that dysregulate transcription and kinase signaling pathways. We discuss the sequence features that promote phase separation and the implications for therapeutic intervention. By targeting the biophysical properties of these condensates, novel strategies may emerge to disrupt the oncogenic functions of fusion proteins, offering promising avenues for cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
