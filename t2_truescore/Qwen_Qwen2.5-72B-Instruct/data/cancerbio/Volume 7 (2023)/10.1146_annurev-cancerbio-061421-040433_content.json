{"grounding": "The blood-brain barrier is critically important for the treatment of both primary and metastatic cancers of the central nervous system (CNS). Clinical outcomes for patients with primary CNS tumors are poor and have not significantly improved in decades. As treatments for patients with extracranial solid tumors improve, the incidence of CNS metastases is on the rise due to suboptimal CNS exposure of otherwise systemically active agents. Despite state-of-the art surgical care and increasingly precise radiation therapy, clinical progress is limited by the ability to deliver an effective dose of a therapeutic agent to all cancerous cells. Given the tremendous heterogeneity of CNS cancers, both across cancer subtypes andwithin a single tumor, and the range of diverse therapies under investigation, a nuanced examination of CNS drug exposure is needed. With a shared goal, common vocabulary, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the field is poised for renewed progress in the treatment of CNS cancers.", "generated_text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge in the development of effective therapies for central nervous system (CNS) tumors. This review examines the current understanding of the BBB's structure and function, and its implications for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of experimental cancer therapeutics. We discuss the mechanisms by which the BBB restricts the entry of therapeutic agents into the brain, including tight junctions, efflux transporters, and metabolic enzymes. Strategies to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, such as nanoparticle formulations, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and temporary disruption of the BBB, are evaluated. The review also highlights the importance of preclinical models that accurately mimic the human BBB to optimize drug development. Finally, we summarize recent advances in clinical trials targeting CNS tumors, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the BBB and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
