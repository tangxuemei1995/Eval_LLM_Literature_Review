{"grounding": "Normal tissues progressively acquire mutations. Some mutations are positively selected, driving clonal expansions that may colonize the majority of a tissue by old age. In several cases mutant clonal expansion is due to biasing stem cell fate toward proliferation. However, the expansionary phase is transient and is followed by reversion toward wild-type behavior so that normal tissue integrity is retained. Here we consider the implications of these findings for carcinogenesis. We propose that to be considered a cancer driver, a mutant gene should be more prevalent in tumors than the normal lineage from which it emerged. Cancer risk is not dependent on mutational burden, but rather may reflect the relative frequency of pro- and anti-oncogenic mutants within a tissue. Understanding the basis of mutant clonal advantage over wild-type cells allows interventions to halt the expansion or even deplete oncogenic mutants from normal tissue, potentially lowering cancer risk.", "generated_text": "Recent studies have revealed that somatic mutations accumulate in normal tissues over time, challenging the traditional view that mutations are primarily a consequence of cancer. This review explores the role of somatic mutations in the context of stem cells and aging, highlighting their potential as early indicators of carcinogenesis. Evidence suggests that chronic exposure to carcinogens and the natural aging process can lead to an increased mutational burden in stem cells, which may predispose tissues to malignant transformation. Understanding the mechanisms by which these mutations arise and persist in normal tissues could provide new insights into cancer prevention strategies. This perspective emphasizes the importance of early intervention and the potential for developing biomarkers to identify individuals at high risk of developing cancer.", "label": 1}
