{"grounding": "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies.", "generated_text": "Cellular senescence, characterized by a permanent cell cycle arrest, plays a dual role in cancer biology. Initially, it acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism by halting the proliferation of damaged cells. However, senescent cells can also promote tumor progression through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases, collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) further complicates this landscape, as it can either enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments or contribute to therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Recent advances in senolytic drugs, which selectively eliminate senescent cells, offer a promising strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of SASP and enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies. The 'one-two punch' approach, combining senolytics with conventional treatments, represents a novel paradigm in cancer therapy, aiming to exploit the potent and paradoxical biology of cellular senescence.", "label": 1}
