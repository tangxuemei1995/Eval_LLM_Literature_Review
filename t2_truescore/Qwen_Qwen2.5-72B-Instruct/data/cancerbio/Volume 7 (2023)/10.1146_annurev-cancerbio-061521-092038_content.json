{"grounding": "Histopathology plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and subtyping of solid tumors and has become a cornerstone of modern precision oncology. Histopathological evaluation is typically performed manually by expert pathologists due to the complexity of visual data. However, in the last ten years, new artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made it possible to train computers to perform visual tasks with high performance, reaching similar levels as experts in some applications. In cancer histopathology, these AI tools could help automate repetitive tasks, making more efficient use of pathologists\u2019 time. In research studies, AI methods have been shown to have an astounding ability to predict genetic alterations and identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers directly from routine tissue slides. Here, we give an overview of these recent applications of AI in computational pathology, focusing on new tools for cancer research that could be pivotal in identifying clinical biomarkers for better treatment decisions.", "generated_text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computational pathology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment. This review examines the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in the analysis of histopathological images, focusing on their impact on diagnostic workflows and clinical outcomes. Recent studies have demonstrated that AI algorithms can accurately identify and classify tumors, detect subtle histological features, and predict patient outcomes, often surpassing human pathologists in speed and precision. Moreover, AI-driven approaches have shown promise in the identification of novel biomarkers and the stratification of patients for personalized therapy. However, challenges remain, including the need for large, high-quality datasets, standardization of AI models, and the integration of AI tools into clinical practice. This paper discusses these challenges and highlights the potential of AI to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility of cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient care.", "label": 1}
