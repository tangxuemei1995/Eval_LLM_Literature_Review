{"grounding": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce significant and durable treatment responses in about 20% of all cancers, but many patients have natural resistance to current immunotherapies. The past decade of technological advances has resulted in large-scale profiling of many cancers and their tumor microenvironments, rapidly expanding our understanding of the mechanisms utilized by tumors to create immune-resistant microenvironments. In this review, we discuss key factors that create immune resistance and emerging concepts that are redefining how we view immune resistance, as well as highlight novel strategies that aim to convert immune-resistant into immune-sensitive tumors.", "generated_text": "This review explores innovative strategies to transform immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. By modulating the tumor microenvironment, approaches such as oncolytic viruses, radiation therapy, and targeted delivery of immune stimulants are discussed. Clinical trials evaluating these combinations show promising results, with improved patient outcomes and increased immune cell infiltration. The integration of these strategies holds significant potential for advancing cancer immunotherapy.", "label": 0}
