{"grounding": "Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression in several clinical and experimental settings and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Its relation to cancer immunosurveillance is complex. Clonally heterogeneous tumors are associated with decreased immunosurveillance and are less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition, but the mechanistic basis underlying these observations remains unclear. One possibility is that tumors that are under active immunosurveillance are relatively homogeneous because immunosurveillance prevents the outgrowth of immunogenic subclones. Alternatively, high ITH might directly impair immunosurveillance due to lower dosages of subclonal antigens, competition between antigens and immunodominance, the induction of detrimental T cell differentiation programs, or negative feedback loops. Here we review the evidence for these scenarios and outline hypotheses that could underlie the negative association between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance.", "generated_text": "Intratumor heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of multiple clonal subpopulations within a tumor, poses significant challenges to cancer immunosurveillance and therapeutic interventions. This study investigates how clonal diversity influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition and other immunotherapies. Using a combination of genomic analysis, immune profiling, and in vivo models, we demonstrate that tumors with higher clonal heterogeneity exhibit reduced sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This is attributed to the emergence of immune-resistant clones and the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Our findings highlight the importance of considering intratumor heterogeneity in the development of personalized immunotherapy strategies and suggest that combination therapies targeting both the tumor and the immune system may be necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms.", "label": 1}
