{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been a great success in CD19+ hematological diseases. Natural killer (NK) CAR cells offer an alternative to CAR T cells with an intrinsic potential for universal off-the-shelf cell therapeutics. The choice of cell type and the choice of CAR are both relevant for the feasibility, effectivity, engraftment, persistence, side effects, and safety of the cell therapy. Until recently CAR NK cells have proven difficult to develop into therapeutic products. Here, we give an overview of the source of CAR NK cells, gene transfer methods, and the manufacture of CAR NK cells for clinical application. We discuss improvements, as well as future options and problems that need to be addressed.", "generated_text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells represent a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, offering the potential for an 'off-the-shelf' product. Unlike CAR T cells, CAR NK cells can be derived from allogeneic sources, reducing the need for patient-specific customization and enabling rapid deployment. Recent studies have demonstrated their efficacy in targeting various malignancies, including hematological and solid tumors, with reduced risk of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. This review highlights the current state of CAR NK cell therapy, discussing recent clinical trials, manufacturing challenges, and future directions. The unique properties of NK cells, combined with the precision of CAR technology, position CAR NK cells as a transformative approach in the field of cell therapy.", "label": 1}
