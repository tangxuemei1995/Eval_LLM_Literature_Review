{"grounding": "Myeloid cells represent a dominant cellular compartment of tumor lesions and play key roles in tumor inception, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), which include dendritic cells and macrophages, are unique among myeloid cells, as they not only shape both the broader composition and state of the tumor microenvironment but can also specifically instruct cancer-specific, T cell\u2013mediated tumor cell killing, making them especially attractive targets for cancer treatment. Although MNPs remain difficult to modulate therapeutically, our understanding of MNP biology in the antitumor immune response has expanded significantly, offering hope for new possibilities in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the recent advances in our study of the cellular identity, molecular diversity, and spatial organization of MNPs in tumors, and we discuss the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to incorporate these new insights into cancer treatment design.", "generated_text": "Macrophages and dendritic cells, key components of the mononuclear phagocyte system, play pivotal roles in the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review elucidates the complex biology of these cells, their phenotypic plasticity, and their interactions with cancer cells and other immune cells. Macrophages can adopt pro-tumoral (M2) or anti-tumoral (M1) phenotypes, while dendritic cells are crucial for antigen presentation and the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Recent advances in therapeutic strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine modulation, and cell-based therapies, aim to reprogram these cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the function and polarization of macrophages and dendritic cells is essential for developing more effective cancer immunotherapies. This review highlights the latest findings and discusses the potential of targeting these cells to improve patient outcomes in various cancer types.", "label": 1}
