{"grounding": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a new opportunity for cancer treatment; however, resistance can occur due to intrinsic (T cells), extrinsic (tumors), or acquired (tumors) factors. In many cases, the knowledge of these mechanisms comes from clinical observations of patients treated with CAR T cells. In addition, the structure of the CAR molecule and the manufacturing process can impact CAR T cell efficacy. Extrinsic factors such as the mutations in the tumor cell, or cells in the tumor microenvironment, can also play a role. Tumor cells may exhibit acquired antigen loss or heterogeneity that enables resistance to CAR T cell killing; additionally, myeloid cells, T regulatory cells, and fibroblasts can exert an immunosuppressive effect and abrogate CAR T cell antitumor efficacy. We will discuss these mechanisms of resistance and the novel approaches being used to overcome them to improve the widespread use of this promising cancer therapy.", "generated_text": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, yet resistance remains a significant challenge. This review elucidates the mechanisms underlying resistance to CAR T cell therapies, categorizing them into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic resistance mechanisms include antigen loss, downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and exhaustion of CAR T cells, which can be driven by prolonged antigen exposure and chronic activation. Extrinsic resistance involves the tumor microenvironment, where immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, such as regulatory T cells and TGF-\u03b2, inhibit CAR T cell function. Additionally, metabolic alterations and hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment further impede CAR T cell efficacy. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to enhance the durability and effectiveness of CAR T cell therapies, potentially through combination approaches with other immunomodulatory agents or genetic modifications to CAR T cells.", "label": 1}
