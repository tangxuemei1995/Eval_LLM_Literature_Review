{"grounding": "During tumor evolution, cancer cells can acquire the ability to proliferate, invade neighboring tissues, evade the immune system, and spread systemically. Tracking this process remains challenging, as many key events occur stochastically and over long times, which could be addressed by studying the phylogenetic relationships among cancer cells. Several lineage tracing approaches have been developed and employed in many tumor models and contexts, providing critical insights into tumor evolution. Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing have greatly expanded the resolution, scale, and readout of lineage tracing toolkits. In this review, we provide an overview of static lineage tracing methods, and then focus on evolving lineage tracing technologies that enable reconstruction of tumor phylogenies at unprecedented resolution. We also discuss in vivo applications of these technologies to profile subclonal dynamics, quantify tumor plasticity, and track metastasis. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and emerging technologies for building comprehensive cancer evolution roadmaps.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in cancer biology have led to the development of innovative tools for lineage tracing in vivo, enhancing our understanding of tumor evolution and metastasis. This review highlights the integration of single-cell analysis and cell barcoding techniques, which enable the precise tracking of cellular lineages within complex tumor microenvironments. These methodologies provide unprecedented insights into the clonal dynamics and genetic heterogeneity of cancer cells, elucidating key mechanisms that drive tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. By leveraging these advanced tools, researchers can now dissect the intricate processes of cancer metastasis, offering new avenues for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies. The application of these technologies in preclinical models and clinical settings promises to revolutionize our approach to cancer diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
