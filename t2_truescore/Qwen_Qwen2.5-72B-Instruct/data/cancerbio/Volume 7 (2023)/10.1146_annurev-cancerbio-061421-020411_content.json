{"grounding": "The principle of independent drug action proposes that responses to drug combinations result from responses to one or the other of two combining agents, but not both. Explorations of biological pathway interactions in signal transduction and immunobiology as synergy have not been connected to mathematical demonstrations of above\u2013independent action activity, which would define pharmacologic synergy. We review independent action as the explanation for cancer drug combinations and find no evidence for pharmacologic synergy. Rather, a measure of correlation of response (\u03c1) when positive can explain below\u2013independent action results, and negative correlation can explain above\u2013independent action results. Anticorrelated responses may be a mathematical demonstration of collateral sensitivity, which can achieve above\u2013independent action activity. Inappropriate use of biological concepts of synergy may be contributing to high failure rates for immuno-oncology clinical trials, indicating a need for more rigorous applications of independent action to the development of cancer drug combination therapy.", "generated_text": "Combination therapies in cancer treatment are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance efficacy and reduce resistance. This review explores the rationales for combining therapies, focusing on independent action, response correlation, collateral sensitivity, and synergy. Independent action assumes that the effects of combined drugs are additive, while response correlation suggests that the effectiveness of one drug can predict the response to another. Collateral sensitivity leverages the idea that resistance to one therapy can render cancer cells more susceptible to another. Synergy, however, involves a greater-than-additive effect, where the combined impact of two or more drugs exceeds the sum of their individual effects. Clinical trials involving PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, for instance, have shown promising results when combined with other immunotherapies or targeted agents. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes in oncology.", "label": 0}
