{"grounding": "Estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 is expressed in the vast majority of breast cancers and is one of the most successfully prosecuted drug targets in oncology, with multiple classes of endocrine therapies approved for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. These existing agents are highly active, both as single agents and as combination partners for other targeted therapies, and have significantly benefited patients. However, each of these standard-of-care (SOC) therapies has liabilities that allow for the reengagement of ER signaling as a mechanism of resistance. Data supporting the continued dependence of tumors on ER signaling following exposure to SOC agents have underpinned an extraordinary reenergizing of academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical groups pursuing next-generation ER-targeted therapies. The hypothesis that there remains an opportunity to bring further meaningful benefit to patients through fully optimized ER-targeted therapies is currently being investigated in the clinic.", "generated_text": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health burden, with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity identified in approximately 70% of cases. Current therapeutic strategies, including selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs), aim to disrupt ER signaling, a key driver of tumor growth. However, resistance to these treatments is a growing concern. This review highlights the latest advancements in next-generation ER-targeted therapeutics, focusing on novel SERMs and SERDs designed to overcome resistance mechanisms. These agents exhibit improved pharmacokinetic properties and enhanced receptor specificity, leading to more effective tumor suppression. Preclinical studies and early clinical trials have shown promising results, with some candidates demonstrating significant efficacy in ER-positive breast cancer models resistant to current therapies. The integration of these next-generation therapeutics into clinical practice holds the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and redefine the landscape of breast cancer treatment.", "label": 1}
