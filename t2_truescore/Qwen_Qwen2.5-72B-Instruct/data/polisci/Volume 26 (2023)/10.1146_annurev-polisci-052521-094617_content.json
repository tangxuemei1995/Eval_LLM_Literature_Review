{"grounding": "In this review, we focus on political inequality in rich democracies. In the two main sections, we look at participation and representation, respectively. The former discusses whether rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions have led to higher levels of inequality in participation. The latter looks at substantive and descriptive representation and asks how they might be linked. Research highlights that people with fewer individual resources participate much less than those with more resources, and collective organizations lose their ability to counter these trends. In terms of representation, the pattern is very similar. Not only are the opinions of decision-makers more congruent with those of the better off but policy choices also reflect their preferences more clearly. As the social distance between rulers and ruled increases, representative democracy gets more biased in favor of higher-status social groups.", "generated_text": "This study examines the extent and mechanisms of political inequality in affluent democracies, focusing on the interplay between participation, representation, and policy responsiveness. Using a comparative analysis of advanced economies, we find that higher income inequality and weaker trade unions are associated with lower levels of political participation and representation among lower-income groups. The analysis reveals a significant gap in policy congruence, where the preferences of the affluent are more likely to be reflected in policy outcomes. The findings suggest that structural factors, such as income inequality and the strength of civil society organizations, play a crucial role in shaping political inequality. Policy recommendations include strengthening trade unions and implementing measures to enhance political engagement among marginalized populations to promote more equitable representation.", "label": 0}
