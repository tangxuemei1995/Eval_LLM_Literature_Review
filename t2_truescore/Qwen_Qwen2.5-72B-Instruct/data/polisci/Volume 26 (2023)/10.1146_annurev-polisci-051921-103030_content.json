{"grounding": "The article reviews the recent advances in comparative political economy. It reconnects knowledge on growth regimes and welfare regimes by analyzing how growth and welfare regimes covary over both time and space. It underlines the fact that governments pursue different growth strategies to adjust to new economic environments, focusing in particular on welfare state reforms. Synthesizing the literature, we propose a definition of growth and welfare regimes that integrates different engines of growth as a way to track general trends in the evolution of capitalism. We analyze the main trends of three eras of capitalism: Fordism, neoliberal financialization, and the digitalized knowledge-based economy. We trace the various paths of change by identifying the five growth strategies governments have pursued to adapt their growth and welfare regimes to the new capitalist era. The result is not a typology of fixed types of capitalist models but a dynamic process of adjustment.", "generated_text": "This study explores the divergent trajectories of growth and welfare regimes across different historical periods and geographical contexts, focusing on the transition from Fordist industrialization to financialization and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. By employing a comparative political economy framework, the research examines how varying institutional configurations and policy choices have shaped economic growth and social welfare outcomes. The analysis reveals that while the overarching trend towards economic modernization is consistent, the specific paths taken by different countries have led to distinct outcomes in terms of income distribution, labor market dynamics, and social protection. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between global economic forces and national institutional contexts in shaping growth and welfare regimes.", "label": 1}
