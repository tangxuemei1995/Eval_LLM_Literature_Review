{"grounding": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing scholarly interest in nonviolent resistance\u2014a method of conflict in which unarmed people mobilize collective protests, strikes, and boycotts in a coordinated way. Mass movements that rely overwhelmingly on nonviolent resistance sometimes feature unarmed collective violence, fringe violence, or even organized armed action. What do we know about the effects of violent flanks on movement outcomes? This article reviews findings on the relationships between nonviolent and unarmed resistance, violence, and the outcomes of mass mobilization, as well as the directionality of these relationships. The balance of empirical evidence suggests that organized armed violence appears to reduce the chances for otherwise nonviolent movements to succeed, whereas unarmed collective violence has more ambiguous effects. The field will benefit from greater analytical precision in comparing the units of analysis, scope, intensity, and media framing of violent flank activity.", "generated_text": "This study explores the paradoxical role of violence within nonviolent resistance movements, focusing on the concept of 'violent flanks' and their impact on the overall effectiveness of such movements. Through a comprehensive review of historical cases, including the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and the Arab Spring, the research examines how the presence of violent elements, such as riots and unarmed collective violence, can influence public perception, media coverage, and state responses. The findings suggest that while nonviolent movements generally achieve higher success rates, the strategic use or containment of violent flanks can either enhance or undermine their goals. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the complex dynamics between nonviolent protesters and violent actors, providing insights for activists, policymakers, and scholars.", "label": 1}
