{"grounding": "A recent wave of research in political science examines the past using statistical methods for causal inference and formal theory\u2014a field widely known as historical political economy (HPE). We examine the development of this field. Our survey reveals three common uses of history in HPE: understanding the past for its own sake, using history as a way to understand the present, and using history as a setting to explore theoretical conjectures. We present important work in each area and discuss trade-offs of each approach. We further identify key practical and analytical challenges for scholars of HPE, including the accessibility of data that do exist and obstacles to inference when they do not. Looking to the future, we see improved training for scholars entering the field, a heightened focus on the accumulation of knowledge, and greater attention to underexplored topics such as race, gender, ethnicity, and climate change.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolution and current state of historical political economy (HPE), emphasizing its role in understanding the legacies and persistence of historical events on contemporary political and economic outcomes. By integrating insights from history, economics, and political science, HPE offers a robust framework for causal inference, allowing researchers to trace the long-term impacts of historical institutions, policies, and events. The paper reviews key methodological advancements, including the use of formal theory and quantitative methods, which have enhanced the precision and reliability of HPE research. It also highlights emerging areas of inquiry, such as the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes and the role of historical trauma in shaping current economic behaviors. Finally, the paper discusses the future directions of HPE, advocating for a more interdisciplinary approach and the incorporation of new data sources to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between history and modern political economy.", "label": 1}
