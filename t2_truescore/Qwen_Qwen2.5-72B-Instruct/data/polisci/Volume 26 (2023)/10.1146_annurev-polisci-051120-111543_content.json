{"grounding": "The structure and governance of global supply chains not only shape social and environmental outcomes for both countries and firms, but also affect the quality of life at the local level, for those who live and work at each site of production. Existing literature on supply chain governance focuses on the transnational firm and has yielded a wide range of theoretical and empirical findings about firm- and nation-level outcomes. However, we know less about the drivers of variation in more localized social and environmental outcomes across production sites, which may result from local, national, and global actors and institutions that may interact. I provide a brief overview of the dominant literature on supply chain governance, highlighting the tendency to take an actor-centric approach. I then identify opportunities to study local social and environmental consequences of networked production using a more explicitly multi-actor and multi-level approach that can allow us to identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers between social and environmental outcomes.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between supply chain governance and the multi-level context in which it operates, emphasizing the role of network structures, environmental factors, and labor dynamics. By adopting a polycentric perspective, the research examines how governance mechanisms at different levels\u2014firm, network, and institutional\u2014interact to manage complexity and achieve sustainable outcomes. The analysis reveals that effective governance requires a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within and between these levels, highlighting the importance of context in shaping governance strategies. Empirical evidence from case studies across diverse industries underscores the need for adaptive and collaborative approaches to address the challenges of modern supply chains, such as regulatory compliance, ethical labor practices, and environmental sustainability. The findings contribute to the theoretical framework of supply chain governance by integrating insights from network theory, institutional theory, and complexity science.", "label": 0}
