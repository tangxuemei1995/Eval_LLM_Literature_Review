{"grounding": "The public's health is intimately linked to politics and policy. But political science has yet to make a major contribution to understanding the political economy of health (as distinct from medical care). In order to advance understanding of the drivers of health in an era of emerging infectious disease and global pandemics, more political scientists must begin to do what we are uniquely well situated to do: analyze in a contextualized way the pathways and mechanisms through which power configurations cause illness and inequity. This article reviews key findings from recent literature about the policy, political, and structural contributors to population health and health equity and sketches what a political economy of health more deeply rooted in political science could look like.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intersection of political economy and public health, emphasizing the role of political science in understanding and addressing health inequities. By integrating insights from political economy, we examine how political structures, economic policies, and social determinants collectively shape population health outcomes. The analysis highlights the importance of governance, policy-making processes, and the distribution of power in health systems. Case studies from diverse contexts illustrate how political factors influence access to healthcare, resource allocation, and the implementation of health interventions. The paper argues for a more interdisciplinary approach to health research and policy, advocating for the inclusion of political science to achieve more equitable health outcomes.", "label": 1}
