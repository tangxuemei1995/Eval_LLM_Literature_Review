{"grounding": "Recent years have seen a renewed interest in southern distinctiveness within the United States and its ramifications for the nation. This review provides an analysis of recent works and the interpretive issues they raise. I argue that collectively they have broken with the long-established image of the South in political science, the study of which was long organized around the region's anticipated convergence to the patterns of the post\u2013New Deal North. Recent texts have instead emphasized an enduring commitment to white supremacy and a determining influence for the region in shaping national politics and institutions. I identify two broad pathways of southern influence and discuss the debates over its sources. I then discuss recent works on southern regimes and the debates these have provoked. I conclude by suggesting that overcoming the limits of recent works will ultimately undermine some of our more sweeping interpretive claims and foundational premises.", "generated_text": "This study examines the profound impact of the South on American political development, particularly through the lens of Jim Crow laws, authoritarianism, and white supremacy. The region's unique political culture, characterized by a deep-seated commitment to racial hierarchy, has shaped national policies and political institutions, including the New Deal. By analyzing historical and contemporary data, this research highlights how southern politics have influenced the trajectory of American democracy, often reinforcing authoritarian tendencies and limiting the scope of progressive reforms. The findings underscore the enduring legacy of the South in shaping the political landscape of the United States, with implications for current debates on racial justice and political polarization.", "label": 0}
