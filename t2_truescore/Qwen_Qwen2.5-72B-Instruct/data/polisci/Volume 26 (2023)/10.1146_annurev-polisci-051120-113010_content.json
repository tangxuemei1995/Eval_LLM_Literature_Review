{"grounding": "There is an unexamined paradox in the history of government in the West. The so-called absolutist monarchs of Europe overwhelmingly chartered republican corporations\u2014e.g., towns, universities, and guilds whose members elected their leaders. Indeed, modern constitutional democracy is patterned after them. Yet, modern democracies themselves have overwhelmingly chartered authoritarian corporations\u2014e.g., universities and business corporations whose subjects have no vote. After this Great Inversion, corporations, which once distributed power and wealth, now concentrate them, straining constitutional democracy. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the major types of relation maintained between states and corporations: constitutive (states charter corporations), mimetic (states and corporations recurrently copy one another's organizational features), and instrumental (each leans on the other, and sometimes captures it, to better advance its own purposes). The article then examines the special challenges that corporate economies pose to constitutional democracy and considers whether a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce them.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the historical and contemporary relationship between democracy and the corporation, examining how the principles of republicanism and constitutionalism have shaped corporate governance and societal structures. By analyzing the long-term evolution of corporate forms, the study highlights the tension between democratic ideals and the concentration of economic power within corporations. It argues that the rise of enterprise foundations and other corporate governance innovations can serve as mechanisms to mitigate inequality and enhance democratic participation. Through a comparative analysis of different national contexts, the paper identifies key factors that influence the alignment of corporate practices with democratic values, suggesting that a more integrated approach to constitutionalism and corporate governance is essential for fostering a more equitable and participatory economic system.", "label": 1}
