{"grounding": "The concept of racist dehumanization is essential for political scientists who seek to understand the nature, scope, and consequences of white racial prejudice in the United States today. Racist dehumanization consists of a variety of processes that construct, refashion, and maintain race by coding some people as white and therefore fully human and others as other than white and therefore less than fully human. In this review, we focus on the racist dehumanization of Indigenous people and Black people, arguing that processes of dehumanization have long been implicated in both the practice of race-making and concurrent efforts to exploit and dominate racialized groups. We posit that contemporary white racial prejudice can be understood, in part, as the residue of these processes, and we conclude by describing how accounting for racist dehumanization can transform the study of white racial prejudice.", "generated_text": "This study examines the political dimensions of racist dehumanization in the United States, focusing on how racial attitudes and prejudice shape the perception and treatment of Black and Indigenous communities by white Americans. Through a comprehensive analysis of survey data, historical documents, and contemporary media, the research reveals that dehumanizing rhetoric and policies are not only prevalent but are often politically motivated. The findings indicate that dehumanization is a strategic tool used to justify systemic inequalities and to mobilize support for policies that disproportionately harm marginalized racial groups. The study also highlights the role of political leaders and institutions in perpetuating these attitudes and the potential for counter-narratives to challenge and dismantle racist dehumanization.", "label": 0}
