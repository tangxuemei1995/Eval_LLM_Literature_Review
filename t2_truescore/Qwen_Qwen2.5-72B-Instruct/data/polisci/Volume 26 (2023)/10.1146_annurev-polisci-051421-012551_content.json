{"grounding": "A growing literature explores how local environments, or contexts, affect political behavior, especially by shaping interpersonal contact with social out-groups. While many studies still draw directly on long-standing hypotheses from contact theory, this research agenda increasingly focuses on new research questions, beyond the classic social psychology literature, and new empirical cases, including from across the lower- and middle-income world. We develop a typology of forms of context and contact to aid the aggregation of findings across disparate cases and demonstrate that the mechanisms that may account for the political effects of intergroup context and contact are broader than those typically explored in psychologically oriented research. We propose future directions for research in this area, including greater focus on the intersection of ethnic and class-based contact and greater attention to how built or computer-based environments may mediate or mirror the effects of demographic contexts.", "generated_text": "This study integrates context and contact theory to explore how the built environment and neighborhood characteristics influence political behavior and ethnic politics. By examining the interplay between physical surroundings and social interactions, we argue that the design of urban spaces can either exacerbate or mitigate political inequalities. Using a mixed-methods approach, including spatial analysis and survey data, we find that neighborhoods with higher levels of mixed-use development and walkability promote greater inter-ethnic contact, leading to more inclusive political attitudes and behaviors. Conversely, areas characterized by segregation and poor infrastructure are associated with heightened political polarization and reduced civic engagement. These findings underscore the importance of considering both the physical and social dimensions of the environment in understanding and addressing political inequalities.", "label": 0}
