{"grounding": "Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. Gonz\u00e1lez (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all. This is an edited transcript of the conversation and includes a bibliography of the sources mentioned. A video of the conversation is available online at \nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/r/BeyondtheBallotBox\n.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, particularly through the lens of multiracial democracy and racial authoritarianism. It examines how historical and contemporary policing practices have shaped and been shaped by democratic institutions, often reinforcing racial hierarchies and undermining the principles of equal protection and due process. The study draws on a range of interdisciplinary sources, including political science, sociology, and critical race theory, to analyze the ways in which policing intersects with identity and criminal justice. Through case studies and empirical data, the paper highlights the challenges and opportunities for reform, emphasizing the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach to law enforcement that aligns with democratic values. The findings suggest that fostering a multiracial democracy requires not only electoral reforms but also a fundamental rethinking of the role of policing in society, with a focus on community engagement, accountability, and the reduction of racial disparities in the criminal justice system.", "label": 0}
