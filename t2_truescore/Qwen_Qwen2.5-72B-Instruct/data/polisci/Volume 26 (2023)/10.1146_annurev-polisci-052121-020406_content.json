{"grounding": "We provide a unified language for studying power sharing in authoritarian regimes. Power-sharing deals entail not only sharing spoils between a ruler and challenger, but also establishing an enforcement mechanism. An arrangement does not truly share power without reallocating power to make it costly for the ruler to renege. Institutional concessions, such as delegating agenda control over policy decisions or empowering third-party enforcers, can reallocate power. However, weak institutions create a Catch-22 that inhibits credible commitment. When institutions are weak, self-enforcing power sharing is still possible if challengers have coercive means to defend their spoils. However, challengers can leverage their coercive capabilities to overthrow the ruler. This double-edged sword implies that a strategic dictator shares power only under specific conditions: challengers can credibly punish an autocratic ruler; if the ruler shares power, the challenger must willingly forgo taking harmful actions; and the ruler willingly acquiesces to diminished power and rents.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, a phenomenon where autocratic regimes distribute political authority among various factions to maintain stability and prevent coups. By integrating insights from the literature on civil wars, commitment problems, and institutional design, we examine the mechanisms through which authoritarian leaders manage internal threats and external pressures. We argue that power-sharing arrangements, such as coalition governments, military pacts, and patronage networks, serve as strategic tools to balance competing interests and reduce the likelihood of regime collapse. Through a comparative analysis of case studies, we highlight the conditions under which these arrangements are effective and the challenges they face. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the resilience and adaptability of authoritarian regimes in the face of internal and external challenges.", "label": 1}
