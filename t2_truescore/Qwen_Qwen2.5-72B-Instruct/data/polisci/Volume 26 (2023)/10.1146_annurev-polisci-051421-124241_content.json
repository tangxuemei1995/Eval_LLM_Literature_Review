{"grounding": "Global climate change is opening up new questions and reinvigorating old lines of inquiry in the study of international energy politics. Many policymakers and stakeholders are pushing for a clean energy transition away from the fossil fuels that have long dominated the world's energy supply. On some issues, there is considerable consensus between political scientists and other analysts, such as the basic categories of the \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d from the clean energy transition. On other issues, however, political science tends to depart significantly from other disciplines. The politics of the desired clean energy transition are highly complicated and filled with obstacles beyond those typically highlighted by either economics or physical sciences. For these reasons, energy politics associated with oil and other fossil fuels are far from over and continue to develop, even as new political dynamics associated with the clean energy transition emerge.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the evolving landscape of international energy politics in the context of climate change, focusing on the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. The analysis highlights the complex interplay between global environmental goals and the economic interests of major oil-producing nations. It explores how distributive politics influence the pace and direction of the clean energy transition, particularly in regions heavily reliant on oil exports. The study also assesses the role of international agreements and policies in facilitating or hindering this transition, and discusses the implications for global energy security and economic stability. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the paper provides insights into the strategic challenges and opportunities that arise as the world seeks to balance energy needs with climate imperatives.", "label": 0}
