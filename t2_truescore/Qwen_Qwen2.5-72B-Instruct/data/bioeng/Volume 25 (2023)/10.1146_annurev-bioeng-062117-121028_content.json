{"grounding": "The need for hydration monitoring is significant, especially for the very young and elderly populations who are more vulnerable to becoming dehydrated and suffering from the effects that dehydration brings. This need has been among the drivers of considerable effort in the academic and commercial sectors to provide a means for monitoring hydration status, with a special interest in doing so outside the hospital or clinical setting. This review of emerging technologies provides an overview of many technology approaches that, on a theoretical basis, have sensitivity to water and are feasible as a routine measurement. We review the evidence of technical validation and of their use in humans. Finally, we highlight the essential need for these technologies to be rigorously evaluated for their diagnostic potential, as a necessary step to meet the need for hydration monitoring outside of the clinical environment.", "generated_text": "Dehydration is a significant health concern, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and athletes. This review evaluates the current state of noninvasive hydration monitoring technologies, including wearable devices and medical sensors. Despite advancements, challenges remain in achieving accurate and reliable hydration status assessments. Studies have shown that bioimpedance analysis and near-infrared spectroscopy hold promise, but their performance varies across different populations and environmental conditions. Moreover, the integration of these technologies into user-friendly, continuous monitoring systems is still in its infancy. Future research should focus on validating these methods across diverse groups and improving the sensitivity and specificity of hydration markers. The development of a robust, noninvasive dehydration detection tool is crucial for early intervention and prevention of dehydration-related complications.", "label": 1}
