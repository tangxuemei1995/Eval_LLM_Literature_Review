{"grounding": "Neurotechnologies for treating pain rely on electrical stimulation of the central or peripheral nervous system to disrupt or block pain signaling and have been commercialized to treat a variety of pain conditions. While their adoption is accelerating, neurotechnologies are still frequently viewed as a last resort, after many other treatment options have been explored. We review the pain conditions commonly treated with electrical stimulation, as well as the specific neurotechnologies used for treating those conditions. We identify barriers to adoption, including a limited understanding of mechanisms of action, inconsistent efficacy across patients, and challenges related to selectivity of stimulation and off-target side effects. We describe design improvements that have recently been implemented, as well as some cutting-edge technologies that may address the limitations of existing neurotechnologies. Addressing these challenges will accelerate adoption and change neurotechnologies from last-line to first-line treatments for people living with chronic pain.", "generated_text": "Chronic pain, a debilitating condition affecting millions, remains a significant challenge in pain management. This review explores the latest advancements in neurotechnology, focusing on deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). These interventions target the peripheral nervous system and central pain pathways to modulate pain signals. DBS, by stimulating specific brain regions, has shown promise in treating refractory chronic pain conditions. SCS, which involves the placement of electrodes in the epidural space of the spinal cord, has been effective in managing neuropathic pain. TENS, a non-invasive technique, delivers electrical impulses to peripheral nerves, providing analgesic effects. This paper synthesizes clinical outcomes, safety profiles, and patient selection criteria for these neurotechnological approaches, highlighting their potential to transform pain management practices and improve quality of life for chronic pain sufferers.", "label": 1}
