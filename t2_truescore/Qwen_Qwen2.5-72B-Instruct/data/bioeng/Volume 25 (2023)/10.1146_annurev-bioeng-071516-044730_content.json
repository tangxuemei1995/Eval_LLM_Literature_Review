{"grounding": "Over the last half century, the autofluorescence of the metabolic cofactors NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) has been quantified in a variety of cell types and disease states. With the spread of nonlinear optical microscopy techniques in biomedical research, NADH and FAD imaging has offered an attractive solution to noninvasively monitor cell and tissue status and elucidate dynamic changes in cell or tissue metabolism. Various tools and methods to measure the temporal, spectral, and spatial properties of NADH and FAD autofluorescence have been developed. Specifically, an optical redox ratio of cofactor fluorescence intensities and NADH fluorescence lifetime parameters have been used in numerous applications, but significant work remains to mature this technology for understanding dynamic changes in metabolism. This article describes the current understanding of our optical sensitivity to different metabolic pathways and highlights current challenges in the field. Recent progress in addressing these challenges and acquiring more quantitative information in faster and more metabolically relevant formats is also discussed.", "generated_text": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging (OMI) has emerged as a powerful tool for non-invasively monitoring metabolic processes in cells and tissues. This technique leverages the intrinsic autofluorescence of key metabolic coenzymes, such as NADH and FAD, to provide real-time insights into cellular redox states and metabolic pathways. By combining multiphoton microscopy with fluorescence lifetime imaging, OMI can distinguish between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, offering a high-resolution map of metabolic activity. This approach has been applied to study a wide range of biological processes, from cancer metabolism to neurodegeneration, and has the potential to advance our understanding of metabolic dysregulation in disease. The ability to perform label-free, dynamic imaging of metabolic processes makes OMI a valuable tool for both basic research and clinical applications.", "label": 1}
