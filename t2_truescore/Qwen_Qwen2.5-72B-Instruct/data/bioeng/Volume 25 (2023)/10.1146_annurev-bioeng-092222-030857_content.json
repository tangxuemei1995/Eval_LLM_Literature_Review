{"grounding": "Although sex differences have been noted in cellular function and behavior, therapy efficacy, and disease incidence and outcomes, the adoption of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine remains limited. Furthering the development of personalized, precision medicine requires considering biological sex at the bench and in the clinic. This review provides the basis for considering biological sex when designing tissue-engineered constructs and regenerative therapies by contextualizing sex as a biological variable within the tissue engineering triad of cells, matrices, and signals. To achieve equity in biological sex within medicine requires a cultural shift in science and engineering research, with active engagement by researchers, clinicians, companies, policymakers, and funding agencies.", "generated_text": "This review highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Sexual dimorphism in stem cell behavior, tissue responses, and disease pathophysiology underscores the need for sex-specific approaches in developing tissue models and therapeutic strategies. Evidence from recent studies indicates that sex differences influence the efficacy and safety of regenerative therapies, emphasizing the potential of precision medicine to address these variations. Integrating sex characteristics into experimental designs and clinical trials can enhance the translational potential of tissue engineering, leading to more effective and personalized treatments.", "label": 1}
