{"grounding": "Hemolysis (i.e., red blood cell lysis) can increase circulatory levels of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) and its degradation by-products, namely heme (h) and iron (Fe). Under homeostasis, minor increases in these three hemolytic by-products (Hb/h/Fe) are rapidly scavenged and cleared by natural plasma proteins. Under certain pathophysiological conditions, scavenging systems become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of Hb/h/Fe in the circulation. Unfortunately, these species cause various side effects such as vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative organ damage. Therefore, various therapeutics strategies are in development, ranging from supplementation with depleted plasma scavenger proteins to engineered biomimetic protein constructs capable of scavenging multiple hemolytic species. In this review, we briefly describe hemolysis and the characteristics of the major plasma-derived protein scavengers of Hb/h/Fe. Finally, we present novel engineering approaches designed to address the toxicity of these hemolytic by-products.", "generated_text": "Hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the circulation, leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage. This study explores the engineering of therapeutics to detoxify these harmful byproducts. We focus on enhancing the natural scavenging proteins haptoglobin and hemopexin, which bind hemoglobin and heme, respectively, to prevent their toxic effects. Through protein engineering and conjugation with iron chelators, we have developed novel constructs that exhibit increased affinity and stability. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate the efficacy of these engineered therapeutics in reducing oxidative damage and improving outcomes in hemolytic disorders. This work paves the way for new therapeutic strategies to manage conditions associated with hemolysis, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia.", "label": 1}
