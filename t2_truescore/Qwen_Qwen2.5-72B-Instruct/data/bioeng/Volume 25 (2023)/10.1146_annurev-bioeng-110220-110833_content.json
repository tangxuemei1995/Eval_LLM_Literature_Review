{"grounding": "Brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to treat sensorimotor neurological disorders by creating artificial motor and/or sensory pathways. Introducing artificial pathways creates new relationships between sensory input and motor output, which the brain must learn to gain dexterous control. This review highlights the role of learning in BMIs to restore movement and sensation, and discusses how BMI design may influence neural plasticity and performance. The close integration of plasticity in sensory and motor function influences the design of both artificial pathways and will be an essential consideration for bidirectional devices that restore both sensory and motor function.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of neural plasticity in sensorimotor brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs). By integrating sensory and motor neural circuits, BMIs facilitate adaptive learning and functional recovery. We explore how plasticity mechanisms enable the reorganization of neural networks in response to BMI training, enhancing motor control and sensory feedback. Our findings highlight the importance of bidirectional communication in BMIs for optimizing neural adaptation and improving user performance. These insights have implications for the development of more effective therapeutic BMIs for neurological disorders.", "label": 1}
