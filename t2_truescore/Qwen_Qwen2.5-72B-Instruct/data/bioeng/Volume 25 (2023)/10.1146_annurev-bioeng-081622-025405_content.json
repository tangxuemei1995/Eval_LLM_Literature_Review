{"grounding": "Photoacoustic techniques have shown promise in identifying molecular changes in bone tissue and visualizing tissue microstructure. This capability represents significant advantages over gold standards (i.e., dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) for bone evaluation without requiring ionizing radiation. Instead, photoacoustic imaging uses light to penetrate through bone, followed by acoustic pressure generation, resulting in highly sensitive optical absorption contrast in deep biological tissues. This review covers multiple bone-related photoacoustic imaging contributions to clinical applications, spanning bone cancer, joint pathologies, spinal disorders, osteoporosis, bone-related surgical guidance, consolidation monitoring, and transsphenoidal and transcranial imaging. We also present a summary of photoacoustic-based techniques for characterizing biomechanical properties of bone, including temperature, guided waves, spectral parameters, and spectroscopy. We conclude with a future outlook based on the current state of technological developments, recent achievements, and possible new directions.", "generated_text": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging, a non-invasive and non-ionizing modality, has emerged as a promising technique for the characterization of bone in medical applications. This review provides an overview of the current state of PA imaging in bone research, highlighting its ability to provide high-resolution images and quantitative information. Key applications include the assessment of bone density, microstructure, and composition, as well as the monitoring of bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Spectral unmixing techniques are discussed for their potential to enhance the specificity of PA signals, enabling the differentiation of bone from surrounding tissues. The integration of PA imaging with quantitative ultrasound further enhances the diagnostic capabilities, offering a comprehensive approach to bone health assessment. Future directions and challenges in the clinical translation of PA imaging for bone are also outlined, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and advanced image processing algorithms.", "label": 1}
