{"grounding": "Lipids are essential cellular components forming membranes, serving as energy reserves, and acting as chemical messengers. Dysfunction in lipid metabolism and signaling is associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Heterogeneity in cell behavior including lipid signaling is increasingly recognized as a driver of disease and drug resistance. This diversity in cellular responses as well as the roles of lipids in health and disease drive the need to quantify lipids within single cells. Single-cell lipid assays are challenging due to the small size of cells (\u223c1 pL) and the large numbers of lipid species present at concentrations spanning orders of magnitude. A growing number of methodologies enable assay of large numbers of lipid analytes, perform high-resolution spatial measurements, or permit highly sensitive lipid assays in single cells. Covered in this review are mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, and fluorescence-based assays including microscopy and microseparations.", "generated_text": "This review highlights recent advancements in analytical techniques for the biochemical analysis of lipids at the single-cell level. Techniques such as mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, capillary electrophoresis, and thin layer chromatography have been adapted and optimized to provide high-resolution, quantitative data on lipid composition and distribution within individual cells. Mass spectrometry, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool due to its high sensitivity and ability to identify a wide range of lipid species. Raman imaging offers non-destructive, label-free visualization of lipid structures, while capillary electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography provide complementary methods for separating and quantifying lipids with high precision. These techniques are crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and the role of lipids in various physiological and pathological processes.", "label": 1}
