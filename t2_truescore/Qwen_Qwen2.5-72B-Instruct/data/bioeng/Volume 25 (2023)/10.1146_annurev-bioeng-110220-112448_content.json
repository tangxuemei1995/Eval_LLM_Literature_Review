{"grounding": "Energy-efficient sensing with physically secure communication for biosensors on, around, and within the human body is a major area of research for the development of low-cost health care devices, enabling continuous monitoring and/or secure perpetual operation. When used as a network of nodes, these devices form the Internet of Bodies, which poses challenges including stringent resource constraints, simultaneous sensing and communication, and security vulnerabilities. Another major challenge is to find an efficient on-body energy-harvesting method to support the sensing, communication, and security submodules. Due to limitations in the amount of energy harvested, we require a reduction in energy consumed per unit information, making the use of in-sensor analytics and processing imperative. In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities of low-power sensing, processing, and communication with possible powering modalities for future biosensor nodes. Specifically, we analyze, compare, and contrast (a) different sensing mechanisms such as voltage/current domain versus time domain, (b) low-power, secure communication modalities including wireless techniques and human body communication, and (c) different powering techniques for wearable devices and implants.", "generated_text": "The integration of bioelectronic sensor nodes into the Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a significant advancement in the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and biotechnology. These sensor nodes, equipped with advanced biosensors, enable real-time monitoring of physiological parameters, facilitating applications in healthcare, fitness, and environmental exposure. In-sensor analytics and on-board computation capabilities enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of these devices, reducing the need for continuous data transmission and thereby conserving power. Communication protocols are optimized for low-power, high-reliability data transfer, ensuring secure and seamless integration with existing IoT infrastructures. Security measures, including encryption and authentication, are critical to protect sensitive personal health data. Powering these devices remains a challenge, but recent advancements in energy harvesting and low-power design are paving the way for sustainable and long-lasting operation. This review explores the current state of bioelectronic sensor nodes, highlighting key technological innovations and addressing the challenges and future directions in the field of IoB.", "label": 1}
