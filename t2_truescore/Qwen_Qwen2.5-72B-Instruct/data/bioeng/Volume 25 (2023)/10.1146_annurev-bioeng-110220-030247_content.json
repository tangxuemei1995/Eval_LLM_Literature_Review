{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are currently widely employed in medicine and healthcare. A PubMed search returns more than 100,000 articles on these topics published between 2018 and 2022 alone. Notwithstanding several recent reviews in various subfields of AI and ML in medicine, we have yet to see a comprehensive review around the methods\u2019 use in longitudinal analysis and prediction of an individual patient's health status within a personalized disease pathway. This review seeks to fill that gap. After an overview of the AI and ML methods employed in this field and of specific medical applications of models of this type, the review discusses the strengths and limitations of current studies and looks ahead to future strands of research in this field. We aim to enable interested readers to gain a detailed impression of the research currently available and accordingly plan future work around predictive models for deterioration in health status.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development and application of predictive models using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to forecast health deterioration and understand disease pathways, aiming to advance personalized medicine. By leveraging time series analysis and digital health pathways, the research identifies key biomarkers and clinical indicators that correlate with disease progression. The models, trained on a diverse dataset of patient records, demonstrate high accuracy in predicting adverse health events, enabling early intervention and tailored therapeutic strategies. The integration of these predictive tools into clinical practice has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and the dynamic nature of disease trajectories, underscoring the need for adaptive and patient-specific approaches in medical care.", "label": 0}
