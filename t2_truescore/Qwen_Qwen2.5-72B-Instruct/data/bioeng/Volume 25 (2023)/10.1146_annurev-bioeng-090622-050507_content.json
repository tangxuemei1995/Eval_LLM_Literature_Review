{"grounding": "Penetrating neural electrodes provide a powerful approach to decipher brain circuitry by allowing for time-resolved electrical detections of individual action potentials. This unique capability has contributed tremendously to basic and translational neuroscience, enabling both fundamental understandings of brain functions and applications of human prosthetic devices that restore crucial sensations and movements. However, conventional approaches are limited by the scarce number of available sensing channels and compromised efficacy over long-term implantations. Recording longevity and scalability have become the most sought-after improvements in emerging technologies. In this review, we discuss the technological advances in the past 5\u201310 years that have enabled larger-scale, more detailed, and longer-lasting recordings of neural circuits at work than ever before. We present snapshots of the latest advances in penetration electrode technology, showcase their applications in animal models and humans, and outline the underlying design principles and considerations to fuel future technological development.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in the development of penetrating neural electrodes have significantly enhanced our ability to record neural activity at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This review focuses on the emerging technologies that aim to achieve large-scale and long-term stable recordings, crucial for both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications. Key innovations include the use of flexible and biocompatible materials, novel microfabrication techniques, and advanced signal processing algorithms. These advancements address the critical challenges of minimizing tissue damage, reducing immune responses, and maintaining electrode functionality over extended periods. Studies have demonstrated the potential of these electrodes in chronic implantation, enabling the continuous monitoring of neural circuits and the development of more effective neuroprosthetic devices. Future directions will likely involve further integration of these technologies with machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance data interpretation and therapeutic outcomes.", "label": 1}
