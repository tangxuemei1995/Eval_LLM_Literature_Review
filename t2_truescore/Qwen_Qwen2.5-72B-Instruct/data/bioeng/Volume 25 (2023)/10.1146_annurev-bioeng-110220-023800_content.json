{"grounding": "Over the past decade, the increased adoption of electroporation-based technologies has led to an expansion of clinical research initiatives. Electroporation has been utilized in molecular biology for mammalian and bacterial transfection; for food sanitation; and in therapeutic settings to increase drug uptake, for gene therapy, and to eliminate cancerous tissues. We begin this article by discussing the biophysics required for understanding the concepts behind the cell permeation phenomenon that is electroporation. We then review nano- and microscale single-cell electroporation technologies before scaling up to emerging in vivo applications.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in electroporation technologies have significantly expanded their applications from laboratory research to clinical settings. Pulsed field ablation, transfection, gene therapy, and electrochemotherapy have shown promising results, enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects. Microfluidic platforms have further refined these techniques, enabling precise control and scalability. This review highlights the latest developments, focusing on the integration of microfluidics and the clinical translation of electroporation-based therapies.", "label": 1}
