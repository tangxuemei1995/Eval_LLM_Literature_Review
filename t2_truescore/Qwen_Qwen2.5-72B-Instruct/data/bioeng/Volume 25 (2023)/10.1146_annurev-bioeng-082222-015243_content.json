{"grounding": "One of the greatest concerns in the subzero storage of cells, tissues, and organs is the ability to control the nucleation or recrystallization of ice. In nature, evidence of these processes, which aid in sustaining internal temperatures below the physiologic freezing point for extended periods of time, is apparent in freeze-avoidant and freeze-tolerant organisms. After decades of studying these proteins, we now have easily accessible compounds and materials capable of recapitulating the mechanisms seen in nature for biopreser-vation applications. The output from this burgeoning area of research can interact synergistically with other novel developments in the field of cryobiology, making it an opportune time for a review on this topic.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development of engineered compounds designed to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, processes critical in various industrial and biological applications. Inspired by natural antifreeze (glyco)proteins, these compounds exhibit enhanced thermal hysteresis, effectively lowering the freezing point and inhibiting ice crystal growth. Through a combination of molecular design and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these engineered compounds can significantly reduce ice nucleation rates and prevent recrystallization, offering promising solutions for cryopreservation, food storage, and materials science.", "label": 0}
