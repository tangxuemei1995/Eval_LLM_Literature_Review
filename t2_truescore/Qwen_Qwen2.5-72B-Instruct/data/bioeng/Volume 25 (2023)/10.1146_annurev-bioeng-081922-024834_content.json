{"grounding": "A shift in the traditional technocentric view of medical device design to a human-centered one is needed to bridge existing translational gaps and improve health equity. To ensure the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations, engineers must think beyond the device and the direct end user and must seek a more holistic understanding of broader stakeholder needs and the intended context of use early in a design process. The objectives of this review article are (a) to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy, (b) to review existing frameworks and human- and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation for improved adoption of innovative technologies, and (c) to present case studyexamples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.", "generated_text": "This paper provides an overview of human- and equity-centered approaches in the design of health technologies, emphasizing the importance of contextual investigation and stakeholder engagement. Traditional design processes often focus narrowly on the technical aspects of devices, overlooking the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts in which they will be used. By integrating human-centered design principles, which prioritize user needs and experiences, and equity-centered engineering, which seeks to address and mitigate disparities, this approach ensures that health technologies are not only effective but also accessible and inclusive. The paper highlights the critical role of community engagement in the design process, advocating for the active participation of diverse stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and community leaders. Through case studies and best practices, the paper demonstrates how these approaches can lead to more sustainable and impactful health solutions, ultimately improving health outcomes for all populations.", "label": 1}
