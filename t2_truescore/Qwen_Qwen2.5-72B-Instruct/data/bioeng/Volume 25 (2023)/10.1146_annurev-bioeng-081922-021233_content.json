{"grounding": "The central dogma of gene expression involves DNA transcription to RNA and RNA translation into protein. As key intermediaries and modifiers, RNAs undergo various forms of modifications such as methylation, pseudouridylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. These modifications, termed epitranscriptional regulations, lead to functional changes in RNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated crucial roles for RNA modifications in gene translation, DNA damage response, and cell fate regulation. Epitranscriptional modifications play an essential role in development, mechanosensing, atherogenesis, and regeneration in the cardiovascular (CV) system, and their elucidation is critically important to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CV physiology and pathophysiology. This review aims at providing biomedical engineers with an overview of the epitranscriptome landscape, related key concepts, recent findings in epitranscriptional regulations, and tools for epitranscriptome analysis. The potential applications of this important field in biomedical engineering research are discussed.", "generated_text": "Epitranscriptional modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular function. In the context of cardiovascular bioengineering, these modifications, particularly those affecting RNA molecules, have emerged as critical regulators of cardiovascular development, homeostasis, and disease. This review highlights recent advances in understanding how specific RNA modifications, such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C), influence cardiovascular gene regulation. We discuss the implications of these modifications in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, and explore the potential of targeting the epitranscriptome for therapeutic intervention. By integrating insights from molecular biology and bioengineering, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the epitranscriptome's role in cardiovascular health and disease, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
