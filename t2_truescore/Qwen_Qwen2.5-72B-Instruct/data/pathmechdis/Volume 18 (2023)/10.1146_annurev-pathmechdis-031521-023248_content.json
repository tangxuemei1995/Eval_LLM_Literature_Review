{"grounding": "Nerves not only regulate the homeostasis and energetic metabolism of normal epithelial cells but also are critical for cancer, as cancer recapitulates the biology of neural regulation of epithelial tissues. Cancer cells rarely develop in denervated organs, and denervation affects tumorigenesis, in vivo and in humans. Axonogenesis occurs to supply the new malignant epithelial growth with nerves. Neurogenesis happens later, first in ganglia around organs or the spinal column and subsequently through recruitment of neuroblasts from the central nervous system. The hallmark of this stage is regulation of homeostasis and energetic metabolism. Perineural invasion is the most efficient interaction between cancer cells and nerves. The hallmark of this stage is increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Finally, carcinoma cells transdifferentiate into a neuronal profile in search of neural independence. The latter is the last stage in neuroepithelial interactions. Treatments for cancer must address the biology of neural regulation of cancer.", "generated_text": "Neuroepithelial interactions play a critical role in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. This review explores the bidirectional communication between nerves and cancer cells, focusing on the processes of axonogenesis and neurogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have highlighted the perineural invasion as a key mechanism by which cancer cells exploit neuronal structures to facilitate their spread. Additionally, the transdifferentiation of cancer cells into neuronal-like phenotypes has been observed, suggesting a potential for cancer cells to adopt neurogenic properties. These interactions not only influence tumor growth and invasion but also impact therapeutic responses. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these neuroepithelial interactions could provide novel targets for cancer therapy, potentially disrupting the perineural niche and inhibiting cancer progression.", "label": 0}
