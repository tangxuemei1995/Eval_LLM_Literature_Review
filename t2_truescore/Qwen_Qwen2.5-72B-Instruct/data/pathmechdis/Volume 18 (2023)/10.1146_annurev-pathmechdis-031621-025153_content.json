{"grounding": "African trypanosomes are bloodstream protozoan parasites that infect mammals including humans, where they cause sleeping sickness. Long-lasting infection is required to favor parasite transmission between hosts. Therefore, trypanosomes have developed strategies to continuously escape innate and adaptive responses of the immune system, while also preventing premature death of the host. The pathology linked to infection mainly results from inflammation and includes anemia and brain dysfunction in addition to loss of specificity and memory of the antibody response. The serum of humans contains an efficient trypanolytic factor, the membrane pore-forming protein apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). In the two human-infective trypanosomes, specific parasite resistance factors inhibit APOL1 activity. In turn, many African individuals express APOL1 variants that counteract these resistance factors, enabling them to avoid sleeping sickness. However, these variants are associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of virus-induced inflammation such as coronavirus disease 2019. Vaccination perspectives are discussed.", "generated_text": "African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the tsetse fly. The pathogenesis of this disease is characterized by the parasite's ability to evade the host immune system through antigenic variation, primarily mediated by the expression of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs). This continuous switching of VSGs allows the parasite to persist in the host, leading to chronic infection and severe clinical manifestations. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of host factors, such as apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), in the defense against trypanosomes. However, genetic variations in APOL1 can predispose individuals to kidney disease, complicating the clinical outcomes of African trypanosomiasis. Understanding the interplay between parasite evasion mechanisms and host defense responses is crucial for developing effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against this debilitating disease.", "label": 0}
