{"grounding": "Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms defined by a numerical increase and accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in various organ systems. The disease may present as cutaneous mastocytosis or systemic mastocytosis (SM). On the basis of histopathological and molecular features, clinical variables, and organ involvement, SM is divided into indolent SM, smoldering SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia. Each variant is defined by unique diagnostic criteria and a unique spectrum of clinical presentations. A key driver of MC expansion and disease evolution is the oncogenic machinery triggered by mutant forms of KIT. The genetic background, additional somatic mutations, and comorbidities also contribute to the course and prognosis. Patients with SM may also suffer from mediator-related symptoms or even an MC activation syndrome. This article provides an update of concepts on the genetics, etiology, and pathology of mastocytosis, with emphasis on diagnostic criteria and new treatment concepts.", "generated_text": "Mastocytosis, a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of mast cells, has seen significant advances in understanding its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. The KIT D816V mutation is a key genetic risk factor, present in over 90% of adult cases, driving mast cell proliferation and activation. Recent studies have elucidated the role of tryptase and other mast cell mediators in the development of systemic symptoms, including anaphylaxis. Novel diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and advanced imaging techniques, have improved the accuracy of prognostication. Targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, are emerging as promising treatments, offering more personalized and effective management options. This review summarizes the latest insights into the etiology and pathophysiology of mastocytosis, highlighting the clinical implications of these findings for improved patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
