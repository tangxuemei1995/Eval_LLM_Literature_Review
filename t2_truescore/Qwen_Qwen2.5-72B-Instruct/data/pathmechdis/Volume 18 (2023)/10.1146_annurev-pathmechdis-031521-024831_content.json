{"grounding": "Hepatocytes are the main workers in the hepatic factory, managing metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics, production and recycling of proteins, and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Division of labor between hepatocytes is critical to coordinate complex complementary or opposing multistep processes, similar to distributed tasks at an assembly line. This so-called metabolic zonation has both spatial and temporal components. Spatial distribution of metabolic function in hepatocytes of different lobular zones is necessary to perform complex sequential multistep metabolic processes and to assign metabolic tasks to the right environment. Moreover, temporal control of metabolic processes is critical to align required metabolic processes to the feeding and fasting cycles. Disruption of this complex spatiotemporal hepatic organization impairs key metabolic processes with both local and systemic consequences. Many metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes, are associated with impaired metabolic liver zonation. Recent technological advances shed new light on the spatiotemporal gene expression networks controlling liver function and how their deregulation may be involved in a large variety of diseases. We summarize the current knowledge about spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and consequences on liver pathobiology.", "generated_text": "The liver exhibits a remarkable spatiotemporal organization, with distinct metabolic functions distributed across its lobules, influenced by circadian rhythms and WNT signaling. This zonation is critical for efficient hepatic detoxification and metabolic homeostasis. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying this spatial lobular organization, highlighting the role of WNT signaling in establishing and maintaining metabolic zonation. Disruptions in this zonation, often observed in liver monogenic diseases and other pathologies, can lead to impaired metabolic function and increased susceptibility to liver damage. Moreover, the interplay between circadian rhythms and metabolic zonation has significant implications for chronopharmacology, suggesting that the timing of drug administration can affect therapeutic outcomes. Understanding the complex interrelationships between liver zonation, circadian rhythms, and metabolic pathways is essential for developing targeted therapies and improving the management of liver diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on liver zonation and its consequences on pathophysiology, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
