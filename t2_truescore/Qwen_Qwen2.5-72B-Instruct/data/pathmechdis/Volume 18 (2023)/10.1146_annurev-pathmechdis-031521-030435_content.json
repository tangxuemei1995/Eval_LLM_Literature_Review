{"grounding": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one of the major diseases arising from chronic alcohol consumption and is one of the most common causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. ALD includes asymptomatic liver steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alcohol-associated hepatitis and its complications. The progression of ALD involves complex cell-cell and organ-organ interactions. We focus on the impact of alcohol on dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms and regulation of injury and repair in the liver. In particular, we discuss recent advances in understanding the disruption of balance between programmed cell death and prosurvival pathways, such as autophagy and membrane trafficking, in the pathogenesis of ALD. We also summarize current understanding of innate immune responses, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction and hepatic stellate cell activation, and gut-liver and adipose-liver cross talk in response to ethanol. In addition,we describe the current potential therapeutic targets and clinical trials aimed at alleviating hepatocyte injury, reducing inflammatory responses, and targeting gut microbiota, for the treatment of ALD.", "generated_text": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) remains a significant global health burden, with recent advances shedding light on its complex pathogenesis. This review highlights the pivotal roles of programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, pattern recognition receptors (PRR), and the complement system in the development and progression of ALD. Emerging evidence suggests that PCD pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, contribute to hepatocyte injury and inflammation. PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors, are activated by alcohol-derived products and microbial components from the gut, exacerbating liver damage. The complement system, a key component of innate immunity, is also implicated in ALD through its involvement in inflammation and tissue injury. Additionally, the gut-liver axis plays a crucial role, as alcohol disrupts the intestinal barrier, leading to increased translocation of gut-derived endotoxins and bacteria to the liver. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ALD and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.", "label": 1}
