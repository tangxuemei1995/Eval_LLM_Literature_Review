{"grounding": "Molecular monitoring of tumor-derived alterations has an established role in the surveillance of leukemias, and emerging nucleic acid sequencing technologies are likely to similarly transform the clinical management of lymphomas. Lymphomas are well suited for molecular surveillance due to relatively high cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA concentrations, high somatic mutational burden, and the existence of stereotyped variants enabling focused interrogation of recurrently altered regions. Here, we review the clinical scenarios and key technologies applicable for the molecular monitoring of lymphomas, summarizing current evidence in the literature regarding molecular subtyping and classification, evaluation of treatment response, the surveillance of active cellular therapies, and emerging clinical trial strategies.", "generated_text": "Molecular monitoring of lymphomas through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a critical tool for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) and evaluating treatment response. Utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS), this approach enables the detection of minimal residual disease with high sensitivity and specificity, facilitating early identification of relapse and guiding personalized therapy. This review summarizes recent advancements in ctDNA analysis for lymphoma, highlighting its potential to improve clinical outcomes by providing real-time, non-invasive monitoring of disease status.", "label": 0}
