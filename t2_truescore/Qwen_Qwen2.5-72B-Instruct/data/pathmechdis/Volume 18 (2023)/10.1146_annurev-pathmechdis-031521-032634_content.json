{"grounding": "Among human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated disorders, celiac disease has an immunopathogenesis that is particularly well understood. The condition is characterized by hypersensitivity to cereal gluten proteins, and the disease lesion is localized in the gut. Still, the diagnosis can be made by detection of highly disease-specific autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 in the blood. We now have mechanistic insights into how the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ molecules, via presentation of posttranslationally modified gluten peptides, are connected to the generation of these autoantibodies. This review presents our current understanding of the immunobiology of this common disorder that is positioned in the border zone between food hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.", "generated_text": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The pathogenesis of CD involves a complex interplay between environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and the immune system. Key genetic factors, particularly HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, predispose individuals to CD. Upon gluten ingestion, transglutaminase 2 (TG2) deamidates gluten peptides, enhancing their binding to HLA molecules and subsequent presentation to T cells. This leads to T cell activation, cytokine release, and B cell differentiation into plasma cells producing autoantibodies against TG2. The resulting inflammatory response damages the intestinal mucosa, leading to malabsorption and various clinical manifestations. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.", "label": 0}
