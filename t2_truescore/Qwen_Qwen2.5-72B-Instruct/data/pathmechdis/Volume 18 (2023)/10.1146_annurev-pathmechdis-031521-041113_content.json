{"grounding": "Reprogrammed metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC cells are geared toward rapid proliferation, requiring nutrients and the removal of cellular waste in nutrient-poor environments. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the primary cell of origin for CRCs, must adapt their metabolism along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to the unique features of their complex microenvironment that include interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis. Here, we focus on describing the metabolism of ISCs, diets that influence CRC initiation, CRC genetics and metabolism, and the tumor microenvironment. The mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in enhancing or supporting CRC tumorigenesis are becoming better understood. Thus, greater knowledge of CRC metabolism holds promise for improved prevention and treatment.", "generated_text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with metabolism playing a pivotal role in its development and progression. Recent studies have highlighted the intricate relationship between metabolic pathways, dietary habits, and the gut microbiome in CRC. Altered metabolic profiles, such as increased glucose uptake and lipid synthesis, are common in CRC cells, contributing to their survival and proliferation. Diet, particularly high in red and processed meats and low in fiber, has been linked to an increased risk of CRC through mechanisms that affect gut microbiota composition and metabolic outputs. The gut microbiome, in turn, modulates host metabolism and immune responses, influencing CRC risk and progression. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the metabolic alterations in CRC, the impact of diet, and the role of the gut microbiome, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets and preventive strategies.", "label": 1}
