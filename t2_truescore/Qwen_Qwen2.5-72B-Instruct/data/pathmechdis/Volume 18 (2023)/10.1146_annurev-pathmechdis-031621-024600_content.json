{"grounding": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) features a prominent stromal microenvironment with remarkable cellular and spatial heterogeneity that meaningfully impacts disease biology and treatment resistance. Recent advances in tissue imaging capabilities, single-cell analytics, and disease modeling have shed light on organizing principles that shape the stromal complexity of PDAC tumors. These insights into the functional and spatial dependencies that coordinate cancer cell biology and the relationships that exist between cells and extracellular matrix components present in tumors are expected to unveil therapeutic vulnerabilities. We review recent advances in the field and discuss current understandings of mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment shapes PDAC pathogenesis and therapy resistance.", "generated_text": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic stroma, which contributes to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. This review highlights the role of the tumor microenvironment, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells, in modulating the tumor's aggressive behavior. CAFs secrete growth factors and cytokines that promote tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, while also creating a physical barrier that hinders drug delivery. Immune cells within the microenvironment, such as T regulatory cells and macrophages, often suppress antitumor immunity. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies that target both the tumor and its microenvironment, potentially overcoming resistance and improving patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
