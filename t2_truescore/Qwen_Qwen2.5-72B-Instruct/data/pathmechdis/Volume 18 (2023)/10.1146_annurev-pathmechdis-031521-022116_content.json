{"grounding": "Tumor cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can function as mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. EVs contain a host of bioactive cargo, including membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear proteins, in addition to noncoding RNAs, other RNA types, and double-stranded DNA fragments. These shed vesicles may deposit paracrine information and can also be taken up by stromal cells, causing the recipient cells to undergo phenotypic changes that profoundly impact diverse facets of cancer progression. For example, this unique form of cellular cross talk helps condition the premetastatic niche, facilitates evasion of the immune response, and promotes invasive and metastatic activity. These findings, coupled with those demonstrating that the number and content of EVs produced by tumors can vary depending on their tumor of origin, disease stage, or response to therapy, have raised the exciting possibility that EVs can be used for risk stratification, diagnostic, and even prognostic purposes. We summarize recent developments and the current knowledge of EV cargoes, their impact on disease progression, and implementation of EV-based liquid biopsies as tumor biomarkers.", "generated_text": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment by facilitating intercellular communication and modulating various aspects of tumor biology. These EVs carry a diverse array of cargoes, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can be transferred to recipient cells, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This transfer of EV cargoes can influence cell migration, promote tumor invasion, and alter the immune response, thereby contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Recent advances in the characterization of tumor-derived EVs have highlighted their potential as biomarkers in liquid biopsies, offering a non-invasive means to monitor disease status and response to therapy. Understanding the multifaceted functions of tumor-derived EVs is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment.", "label": 1}
