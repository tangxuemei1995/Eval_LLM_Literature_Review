{"grounding": "Despite the advent of sophisticated and efficient new biologics to treat inflammation in asthma, the disease persists. Even following treatment, many patients still experience the well-known symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. What are we missing? Here we examine the evidence that mucus plugs contribute to a substantial portion of disease, not only by physically obstructing the airways but also by perpetuating inflammation. In this way, mucus plugs may act as an immunogenic stimulus even in the absence of allergen or with the use of current therapeutics. The alterations of several parameters of mucus biology, driven by type 2 inflammation, result in sticky and tenacious sputum, which represents a potent threat, first due to the difficulties in expectoration and second by acting as a platform for viral, bacterial, or fungal colonization that allows exacerbations. Therefore, in this way, mucus plugs are an overlooked but critical feature of asthmatic airway disease.", "generated_text": "Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, is characterized by airway obstruction, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Despite significant advances in understanding its pathology, the precise mechanisms underlying airway obstruction remain elusive. This review focuses on the role of mucus hypersecretion and the emerging importance of galectin-10, a protein involved in modulating immune responses. Galectin-10 has been shown to influence the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, which contribute to airway inflammation and mucus production. Neutrophils, traditionally associated with acute infections, are increasingly recognized as key players in the chronic inflammation observed in asthma. By examining the interplay between galectin-10, neutrophils, and mucus, this study aims to elucidate the complex pathways that lead to airway obstruction, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention.", "label": 1}
