{"grounding": "Metastatic dissemination has lethal consequences for cancer patients. Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that tumor cells can migrate and metastasize as clusters of cells while maintaining contacts with one another. Collective metastasis enables tumor cells to colonize secondary sites more efficiently, resist cell death, and evade the immune system. On the other hand, tumor cell clusters face unique challenges for dissemination particularly during systemic dissemination. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding how tumor cell clusters overcome these disadvantages as well as mechanisms they utilize to gain advantages throughout the metastatic process. We consider useful models for studying collective metastasis and reflect on how the study of collective metastasis suggests new opportunities for eradicating and preventing metastatic disease.", "generated_text": "Collective migration of tumor cell clusters plays a pivotal role in the metastatic cascade, facilitating polyclonal seeding and enhancing the invasive potential of cancer cells. This review elucidates the mechanisms by which circulating tumor cell clusters orchestrate collective migration and metastasis, emphasizing the importance of collective signaling and intercellular communication. Recent studies highlight the advantages of cluster migration, including increased survival in the bloodstream and enhanced colonization of distant organs. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies to target collective metastasis and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
