{"grounding": "Tuft cells are found in tissues with distinct stem cell compartments, tissue architecture, and luminal exposures but converge on a shared transcriptional program, including expression of taste transduction signaling pathways. Here, we summarize seminal and recent findings on tuft cells, focusing on major categories of function\u2014instigation of type 2 cytokine responses, orchestration of antimicrobial responses, and emerging roles in tissue repair\u2014and describe tuft cell\u2013derived molecules used to affect these functional programs. We review what is known about the development of tuft cells from epithelial progenitors under homeostatic conditions and during disease. Finally, we discuss evidence that immature, or nascent, tuft cells with potential for diverse functions are driven toward dominant effector programs by tissue- or perturbation-specific contextual cues, which may result in heterogeneous mature tuft cell phenotypes both within and between tissues.", "generated_text": "Tuft cells, a conserved cell lineage found in various epithelial tissues, play a crucial role in mucosal immunity and homeostasis. These cells are characterized by their unique morphology and expression of specific markers such as IL-25 and acetylcholine. Recent studies have highlighted the context- and tissue-specific programming of tuft cells, which can modulate mucociliary clearance and type 2 immunity. For instance, in the gut, tuft cells are involved in type II taste transduction and the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which can influence immune responses. In the respiratory tract, tuft cells contribute to the maintenance of mucociliary clearance and the defense against parasitic infections. This review discusses the diverse functions of tuft cells across different tissues and the molecular mechanisms underlying their tissue-specific programming, emphasizing their importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune responses.", "label": 1}
