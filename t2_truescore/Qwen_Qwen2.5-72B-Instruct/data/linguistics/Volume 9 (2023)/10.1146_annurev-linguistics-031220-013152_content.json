{"grounding": "Environmental linguistics is an emerging field at the intersection of linguistics and natural sciences. It recognizes the mutual relationship between cultural and ecological diversity, documenting linguistic structures and verbal practices by which speakers conceptualize, encode, and transmit knowledge about the natural world. It surpasses the largely metaphorical and narrative program of ecolinguistics to position language as the preeminent conceptual framework and channel for environmental knowledge. Natural phenomena\u2014as Indigenous experts explain\u2014cannot be understood apart from the languages that encode them, and vice versa. Language diversity is thus the key to safeguarding biodiversity and a balanced human relationship with nature. Environmental linguistics helps decolonize linguistics as our field evolves to prioritize knowledge coproduction over data extraction. Examples from my fieldwork in Tuva cover six domains of knowledge: landscapes, lifeforms, time, sound, memory, and survival. This article reviews recent literature from many cultures, emphasizing works by Indigenous authors.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of language and environmental knowledge, focusing on the Tuva region, where traditional ecological knowledge and native science are deeply embedded in the local language. By analyzing linguistic data and conducting interviews with indigenous communities, the research highlights the role of language in preserving biodiversity and environmental intelligence. The findings suggest that decolonization efforts in linguistics can enhance the recognition and integration of indigenous knowledge systems, contributing to more sustainable environmental practices. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in environmental linguistics, bridging the gap between linguistic studies and ecological conservation.", "label": 1}
