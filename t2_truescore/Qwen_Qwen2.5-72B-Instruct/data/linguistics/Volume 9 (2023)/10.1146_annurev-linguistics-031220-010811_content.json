{"grounding": "The past decade has seen the rapid development of a new approach to pragmatics that attempts to integrate insights from formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics, psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science in the study of meaning: probabilistic pragmatics. The most influential probabilistic approach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation. It also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation. I highlight key challenges for RSA, which include scalability, the treatment of the boundedness of cognition, and the incremental and compositional nature of language.", "generated_text": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework is a probabilistic model of pragmatics that aims to explain how speakers and listeners use context to infer meaning in communication. By integrating principles from game theory, decision theory, and Bayesian inference, the RSA framework provides a computational account of how speakers optimize their utterances to convey intended meanings and how listeners interpret these utterances based on the likelihood of different interpretations. This framework has been applied to a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including scalar implicatures, referential expressions, and metaphorical language. Experimental studies have shown that the RSA model accurately predicts human behavior in various communicative tasks, providing strong support for its theoretical underpinnings. The RSA framework not only advances our understanding of how context influences language use but also has implications for the development of more sophisticated natural language processing systems.", "label": 0}
