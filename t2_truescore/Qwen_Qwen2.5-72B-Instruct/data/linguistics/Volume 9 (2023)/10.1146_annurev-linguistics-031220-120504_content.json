{"grounding": "Language documentation as a subfield of linguistics has arisen over the past roughly two and a half decades more or less simultaneously with the widespread availability of inexpensive hardware and software for creating, storing, and sharing digital objects. Thus, in some ways the history of advancements within the discipline is also a history of how technological tools have been developed, tested, adopted, and eventually abandoned as newer technologies appear. In this article we examine some recent technologies used both for creating documentary resources, usually considered to include recorded language events in a variety of genres and settings and enough annotation to make them decipherable, and for then mobilizing those resources so that they can be used and shared in language learning, reclamation, revitalization, and analysis.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews recent technological advancements that have significantly impacted the processes of resource creation and mobilization in language documentation. The integration of digital tools, such as automated transcription software, machine learning algorithms, and cloud-based storage solutions, has streamlined the collection, analysis, and dissemination of linguistic data. These technologies not only enhance the efficiency and accuracy of documentation efforts but also facilitate broader access to linguistic resources for researchers, communities, and educators. Case studies from various global linguistic contexts illustrate the practical applications and benefits of these innovations, highlighting their potential to support the preservation and revitalization of endangered languages. The paper also discusses the ethical considerations and challenges associated with the adoption of these technologies, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and data sovereignty.", "label": 0}
