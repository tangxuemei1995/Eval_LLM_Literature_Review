{"grounding": "Detailed comparative studies have revealed many surface similarities between linguistic communication and the communication of nonhumans. How should we interpret these discoveries in linguistic and cognitive perspective? We review the literature with a specific focus on analogy (similar features and function but not shared ancestry) and homology (shared ancestry). We conclude that combinatorial features of animal communication are analogous but not homologous to natural language. Homologies are found instead in cognitive capacities of attention manipulation, which are enriched in humans, making possible many distinctive forms of communication, including language use. We therefore present a new, graded taxonomy of means of attention manipulation, including a new class we call Ladyginian, which is related to but slightly broader than the more familiar class of Gricean interaction. Only in the latter do actors have the goal of revealing specifically informative intentions. Great ape interaction may be best characterized as Ladyginian but not Gricean.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the linguistic and cognitive dimensions of animal communication, drawing on historical and contemporary research. By examining the seminal works of Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts, we provide a comparative analysis of communication systems across species, highlighting the cognitive underpinnings that support these systems. We also integrate Grice's cooperative principles to assess the intentional and contextual aspects of animal signals. The paper further investigates the presence of duality of patterning and generativity in animal communication, key features that distinguish human language from other forms of communication. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to elucidate the extent to which animal communication systems share structural and functional similarities with human language, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the evolution of linguistic and cognitive abilities.", "label": 1}
