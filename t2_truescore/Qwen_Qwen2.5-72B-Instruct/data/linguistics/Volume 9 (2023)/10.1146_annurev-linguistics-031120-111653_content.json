{"grounding": "Interpreting anaphoric references is a fundamental aspect of our language competence that has long attracted the attention of computational linguists. The appearance of ever-larger anaphorically annotated data sets covering more and more anaphoric phenomena in ever-greater detail has spurred the development of increasingly more sophisticated computational models; as a result, the most recent state-of-the-art neural models are able to achieve impressive performance by leveraging linguistic, lexical, discourse, and encyclopedic information. This article provides a thorough survey of anaphora resolution (coreference) throughout this development, reviewing the available data sets and covering both the preneural history of the field and\u2014in more detail\u2014current neural models, including research on less-studied aspects of anaphoric interpretation such as bridging reference resolution and discourse deixis interpretation.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the development and evaluation of computational models for anaphora resolution, focusing on coreference and bridging reference. We review recent advancements in neural models and their application to large annotated corpora, highlighting their effectiveness in handling complex discourse phenomena such as discourse deixis. The paper also discusses the challenges posed by the Winograd Schema Challenge, which tests a model's ability to resolve anaphora in context-dependent scenarios. Our analysis underscores the importance of integrating linguistic and contextual information to improve the accuracy of anaphora resolution systems.", "label": 1}
