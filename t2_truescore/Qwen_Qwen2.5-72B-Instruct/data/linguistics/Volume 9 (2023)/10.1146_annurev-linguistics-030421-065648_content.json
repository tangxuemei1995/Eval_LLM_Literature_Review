{"grounding": "Chinese developmental dyslexia (DD) research provides important insights into the language-universal and language-specific mechanisms underlying dyslexia. In this article, we review recent advances in Chinese DD. Converging behavioral evidence suggests that, while phonological and rapid automatized naming deficits are language universal, orthographic and morphological deficits are specific to the linguistic properties of Chinese. At the neural level, hypoactivation in the left superior temporal/inferior frontal regions in dyslexic children across Chinese and alphabetic languages may indicate a shared phonological processing deficit, whereas hyperactivation in the right inferior occipital/middle temporal regions and atypical activation in the left frontal areas in Chinese dyslexic children may indicate a language-specific compensatory strategy for impaired visual-spatial analysis and a morphological deficit in Chinese DD, respectively. The findings call for further theoretical endeavors to understand the language-universal and Chinese-specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying dyslexia and to design more effective and efficient intervention programs.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in the understanding of Chinese developmental dyslexia, focusing on linguistic profiles, brain abnormalities, and genetic susceptibility. Studies have identified unique linguistic challenges in Chinese dyslexic readers, such as difficulties with character recognition and phonological processing, which differ from those observed in alphabetic languages. Neuroimaging research has revealed specific brain regions, including the left middle frontal gyrus and the left occipito-temporal area, that exhibit atypical activation patterns in dyslexic individuals. Genetic studies have also pinpointed several susceptibility genes, such as DCDC2 and KIAA0319, which may contribute to the development of dyslexia in Chinese populations. These findings highlight both language-universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and intervention strategies.", "label": 1}
