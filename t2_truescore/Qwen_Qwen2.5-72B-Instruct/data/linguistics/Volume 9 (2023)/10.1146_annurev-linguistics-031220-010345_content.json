{"grounding": "Much has been written on the abuse and misuse of statistical methods, including p values, statistical significance, and so forth. I present some of the best practices in statistics using a running example data analysis. Focusing primarily on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, I illustrate some defensible ways in which statistical inference\u2014specifically, hypothesis testing using Bayes factors versus estimation or uncertainty quantification\u2014can be carried out. The key is to not overstate the evidence and to not expect too much from statistics. Along the way, I demonstrate some powerful ideas, including the use of simulation to understand the design properties of one's experiment before running it, visualization of data before carrying out a formal analysis, and simulation of data from the fitted model to understand the model's behavior.", "generated_text": "This paper explores effective methodologies for analyzing (psycho)linguistic data, emphasizing the integration of Bayesian methods and hypothesis testing. We discuss the advantages of Bayesian approaches in quantifying uncertainty and providing a more nuanced understanding of experimental results. Through case studies, we illustrate how Bayes factors can be used to evaluate competing hypotheses, offering a robust alternative to traditional null hypothesis significance testing. The paper also highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and model selection, advocating for transparent and reproducible research practices. By adopting these right ways, researchers can enhance the reliability and interpretability of their findings in experimental linguistics.", "label": 1}
