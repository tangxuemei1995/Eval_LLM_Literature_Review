{"grounding": "In this review, we discuss the limits of the concept of the modern nation-state to explore language issues in postcolonial contexts, as in Africa. We argue in favor of a revision of the history of the field of language policy and planning (LPP) and sociolinguistics, paying attention to how the colonial issue has been erased and downplayed. We first explore the colonial history of LPP and how this field contributed to frame African multilingualisms as problems to be solved. Second, we briefly discuss how the contemporary understanding of citizenship in Africa is entangled with the colonial history of a particular version of the state in Africa; we focus on Sudan as an example. We problematize the construct of \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d inscribed in the methodological nationalism that characterizes the early LPP framework, which reverberates in contemporary public policies. By doing so, we advocate for a perspective of language that is historically and locally embedded, following a politics that recognizes the importance of Southern epistemologies to language studies.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intersection of postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) and the conceptual limitations of the modern nation-state, with a particular focus on Sudan. Drawing on Southern perspectives, the study critically examines how postcolonial contexts challenge the conventional frameworks of LPP, which are often rooted in Western notions of the nation-state. By analyzing the linguistic landscape and policy implementations in Sudan, the paper highlights the complexities and contradictions that arise when attempting to fit postcolonial societies into the rigid structures of the modern state. The research underscores the need for a more nuanced and context-sensitive approach to LPP that acknowledges the historical, cultural, and political specificities of postcolonial settings. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the limitations of the nation-state model in addressing the diverse linguistic needs and identities of postcolonial societies.", "label": 1}
