{"grounding": "In response to uncovering brain mechanisms underlying vocal communication and searching for biomarkers for mental illnesses, speech prosody has been increasingly studied in recent years in multiple disciplines, including psycholinguistics. In this article, we provide an up-to-date synthesis of the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence to profile linguistic and emotional prosody in the proper characterization of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Our review reveals a need to develop theoretically motivated and methodologically integrated approaches to the study of context-driven comprehension and expression of pragmatic-affective prosody, which will help elucidate the core features of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders. We propose that comprehensive models within and across the conventional cognition-emotion-language trichotomy need to be developed to integrate current findings and guide future research. In particular, there needs to be due emphasis on investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in normal and pathological prosody research. Our review calls for multidisciplinary efforts to address the challenging issues to inform and inspire the advancement of linguistic theories and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of speech prosody in individuals diagnosed with various mental disorders, focusing on both prosody recognition and production. Prosody, the melody and rhythm of speech, is a critical component in conveying pragmatic and affective information. Individuals with mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, often exhibit altered prosodic patterns, which can impact social communication and interpersonal relationships. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data from speech samples, this research highlights the specific prosodic features that are commonly affected in these disorders. The findings suggest that deficits in prosody production, such as reduced pitch variation and abnormal intonation, are prevalent, while prosody recognition, particularly in identifying emotional cues, is also impaired. These insights have implications for the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions aimed at improving social communication skills in individuals with mental disorders.", "label": 1}
