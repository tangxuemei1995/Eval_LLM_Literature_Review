{"grounding": "Impersonal pronouns are prototypically used in generic sentences to make generalizations about people. Yet they are unlike bare plural people or indefinite singular a person in that they exhibit a sensitivity to first-person perspective. This relationship can be seen in (a) inferences of first-person experience associated with use of these pronouns, (b) additional meaning components carried by impersonally used personal pronouns involving a presumption of empathy or (dis)agreement, and (c) their interpretation in attitude reports, including referential dependency on the attitude holder and the de se/de re distinction. I survey recent findings on the perspectival interpretation of impersonal pronouns including English generic one, German man, French on, and Italian si, as well as impersonally used personal pronouns like English you and German ich and du. I end by identifying some common themes emerging from recent formal semantic analyses of impersonal pronouns. One of the key notions here is the treatment of impersonals as Heimian indefinites, which in generic contexts get bound by the generic operator.", "generated_text": "This study explores the nuanced use of impersonal pronouns in expressing first-person perspectives, particularly within the context of attitude reports. Drawing on a corpus of contemporary texts, we analyze how impersonal pronouns can convey de se attitudes, which are self-ascriptions of properties or states. The investigation reveals that impersonal pronouns, while typically devoid of specific referential content, can serve as a means to express generic or indexical meanings that are closely tied to the speaker's own perspective. This finding challenges the traditional view that impersonal pronouns are strictly non-referential and suggests a more dynamic role in linguistic communication. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for theories of indexicality and genericity, highlighting the complex interplay between linguistic form and cognitive perspective.", "label": 1}
