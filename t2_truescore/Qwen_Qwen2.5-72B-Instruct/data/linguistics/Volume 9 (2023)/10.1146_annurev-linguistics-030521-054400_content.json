{"grounding": "The physician\u2013patient relationship has evolved significantly in the past century. Physician authority has been reduced while patients have been empowered. This review focuses on face-to-face clinical care and argues that current physician\u2013patient relations range from partnerships between social actors who each play critical roles in negotiating care to a more adversarial duel in which both participants advocate for goals that are not necessarily shared. While the former is the hope of increased patient involvement, the latter is increasingly common. Through our discussion of existing studies, we document that while high levels of patient participation are beneficial to treatment outcomes, this engagement also has a dark side that threatens treatment outcomes. We discuss some communication resources patients use that affect treatment outcomes, exemplify how patient engagement affects physician communication, and discuss some strategies that current research finds effective for communicating about treatment with today's engaged patients.", "generated_text": "This study explores the critical role of communication in the physician\u2013patient relationship and its impact on treatment outcomes. Utilizing conversation analysis, we examine the nuances of social interaction during medical consultations, focusing on the processes of negotiation and decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of effective communication strategies in enhancing patient understanding, engagement, and adherence to treatment plans. Improved communication not only fosters a more collaborative environment but also leads to better health outcomes and patient satisfaction. The implications of this research underscore the need for training programs that equip healthcare providers with the skills necessary to navigate complex social interactions and support informed decision-making.", "label": 0}
