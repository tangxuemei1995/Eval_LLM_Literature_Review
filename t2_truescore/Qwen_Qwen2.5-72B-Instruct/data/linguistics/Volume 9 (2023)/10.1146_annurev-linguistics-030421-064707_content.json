{"grounding": "Linguistic research focuses primarily on the thousands of naturally occurring languages, but there are also languages that have been consciously created by individuals. There are four main types of these constructed languages. First, so-called philosophical languages were created in the seventeenth century as a way to better capture the reality of the world. Second, many international auxiliary languages were constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a way to solve practical problems of international communication. Third, many languages have been created in recent decades for the purposes of fiction (e.g., novels, film, television), especially in the realms of science fiction and fantasy, or simply as an enjoyable hobby. Fourth, it is now common to construct languages for use in psycholinguistic experiments. Each of these types of constructed languages presents interesting research questions and deserves increased attention from linguists.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the multifaceted domain of constructed languages (conlangs), encompassing both philosophical languages and international auxiliary languages. It delves into the historical and cognitive motivations behind the creation of these languages, with a particular focus on Esperanto, one of the most widely used and studied conlangs. The review integrates insights from psycholinguistics to examine how constructed languages influence cognitive processes, language acquisition, and communication. The paper also discusses the role of conlangs in fostering cross-cultural understanding and their potential applications in education and international diplomacy. By synthesizing findings from various disciplines, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on constructed languages and highlight avenues for future investigation.", "label": 0}
