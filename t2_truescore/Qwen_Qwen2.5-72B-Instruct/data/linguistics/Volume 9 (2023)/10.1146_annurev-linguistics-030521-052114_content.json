{"grounding": "In today's global economy, most people all over the world need to speak a second language (L2) for study, work, or social purposes. Assessment of speaking, either in the classroom or as an external exam, is therefore an important task. However, because of its fleeting nature, the assessment of speaking proficiency is difficult. For valid assessment, a speaking test must measure speaking proficiency without construct-irrelevant variance, for instance, due to tasks, raters, and interlocutors. This article begins by bringing together insights from different disciplines to develop a multi-componential construct of speaking proficiency, which includes linguistic and strategic competencies. Because speaking usually takes place in conversation, the ability to take part in interaction, including rapid prediction, is described as part of the speaking construct. Next, the factors that need to be controlled when making a speaking assessment are discussed. Finally, challenges and ideas for future research are briefly described.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the assessment of second language (L2) speaking proficiency, focusing on the role of interaction in the evaluation process. A total of 120 L2 learners participated in both monologic and dialogic speaking tasks, which were subsequently rated by trained assessors. The findings reveal that dialogic tasks, which involve interaction with a partner, provide more reliable and valid measures of speaking proficiency compared to monologic tasks. Interaction appears to elicit a broader range of linguistic and pragmatic skills, thereby offering a more comprehensive assessment of L2 speaking ability. Implications for language assessment practices and future research directions are discussed, emphasizing the importance of incorporating interactive elements in speaking proficiency tests.", "label": 1}
