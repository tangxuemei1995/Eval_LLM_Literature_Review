{"grounding": "In linguistics, ethics has long encompassed matters typically covered under regulatory oversight, but it is increasingly understood as relational and reciprocal, conferring responsibilities and obligations that extend beyond the work produced for other researchers. Those who study language are also coming to interrogate their professional responsibilities not only in how research is done but also in how research is conceived, framed, reported, discussed, and taught, as part of larger discussions around decolonization, intersectionality, and social justice. In this article, we review existing literature on ethics in linguistics, both as it relates to research and as it relates to broader practices, which we then situate within ongoing conversations across subfields. The overarching frame for our discussion is that ethical practice and scientific validity are aligned, and that dismantling dominant discourses and normative practices will serve to advance the work linguists do in meaningful ways.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of ethics in the field of linguistics, emphasizing the integration of ethical praxis, regulatory ethics, and relational ethics to ensure scientific validity. Ethical praxis involves the application of ethical principles in the day-to-day conduct of linguistic research, ensuring that studies are conducted with integrity and respect for participants. Regulatory ethics focuses on adherence to established guidelines and laws, safeguarding the rights and well-being of research subjects. Relational ethics highlights the importance of building trust and maintaining respectful relationships with communities and individuals involved in linguistic studies. By balancing these ethical dimensions, linguists can enhance the credibility and reliability of their research, fostering a more responsible and inclusive scientific community.", "label": 0}
