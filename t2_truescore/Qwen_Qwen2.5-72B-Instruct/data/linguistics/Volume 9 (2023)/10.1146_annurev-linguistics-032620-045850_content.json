{"grounding": "In science, we look for the big picture, but in autobiography, it is the details that we care more about. Inevitably, my piece embodies this contradiction. The linguistic parts aim to bring out the unifying themes behind what may look like a hopelessly all-over-the-place curriculum vitae of research and teaching. The autobiographical parts are mostly vignettes of my formative years, places where I have lived, events that have made an impression on me, and people I have crossed paths with.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the interplay between language change and poetic form through the lens of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar, examining how historical shifts in language have influenced the evolution of poetic structures. It also delves into the autobiographical elements within these changes, offering a retrospective analysis and prospective insights into the future of linguistic and literary traditions.", "label": 0}
