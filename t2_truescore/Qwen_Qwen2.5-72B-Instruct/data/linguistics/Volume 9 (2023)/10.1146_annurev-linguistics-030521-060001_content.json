{"grounding": "The term homesign has been used to describe the signing of deaf individuals who have not had sustained access to the linguistic resources of a named language. Early studies of child homesigners focused on documenting their manual communication systems through the lens of developmental psycholinguistics and generative linguistics, but a recent wave of linguistic ethnographic investigations is challenging many of the established theoretical presuppositions that underlie the foundational homesign research. Sparked by a larger critical movement within Deaf Studies led by deaf scholars, this new generation of scholarship interrogates how researchers portray deaf individuals and their communication practices and questions the conceptualization of language in the foundational body of homesign research. In this review, we discuss these contested issues and the current moment of transition within research on homesign.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the contested issues surrounding homesign, a form of sign language developed by deaf individuals who lack exposure to a conventional sign language. Through a linguistic ethnographic approach, the study examines the sociolinguistic dynamics that influence the emergence and structure of homesign systems. Key debates include the extent to which homesigns exhibit systematic linguistic properties, their role in the broader deaf community, and the implications for language acquisition theories. The research highlights the variability in homesign systems and the impact of social interaction on their development, challenging the notion of a universal grammar. Findings suggest that homesigns are dynamic and context-dependent, reflecting the unique communicative needs and environmental factors of their creators.", "label": 1}
