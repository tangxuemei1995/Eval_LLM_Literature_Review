{"grounding": "Socioeconomic status (SES) differences in language development are ubiquitous, but existing research has yet to wrestle with how language gaps reflect (a) differences in relevant concepts for communication, (b) comprehension strategies to access meanings, and (c) production practices that express social identity. In child-directed input, parents use verbs to describe similar concepts across SES, and the largest gaps emerge when frequent meanings are being conveyed. During comprehension, children acquire infrequent aspects of grammar across SES but differ in context-specific strategies for interpreting likely meanings. In production, children are sensitive to sociolinguistic implications and adopt context-specific strategies to signal social identity. This suggests that language is a flexible medium for communicating thoughts and that SES effects signal latent differences in meanings and identities across social classes. Whether language gaps contribute to achievement gaps may depend on the extent to which learning and communication draw on these meanings and value these identities.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on language processing and development, focusing on the role of parental input in shaping syntactic parsing and communication skills. Drawing from a longitudinal dataset of children aged 2 to 5 years, we examine how variations in SES correlate with differences in language acquisition and usage. Results indicate that children from higher SES backgrounds exhibit more advanced syntactic parsing abilities and a richer vocabulary, which are strongly associated with the quantity and quality of parental linguistic input. Sociolinguistic analysis reveals that higher SES parents tend to use more complex sentence structures and engage in more frequent and diverse conversations with their children. These findings underscore the importance of early language exposure and suggest potential interventions to mitigate disparities in language development across SES backgrounds.", "label": 1}
