{"grounding": "After decades of fast-paced technical advances, optical/infrared (O/IR) interferometry has seen a revolution in recent years:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with four 8-m telescopes reaches thousand-times-fainter objects than possible with earlier interferometers, and the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array (CHARA) routinely offers up to 330-m baselines and aperture synthesis with six 1-m telescopes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe observed objects are fainter than 19 mag, the images have submilliarcsecond resolution, and the astrometry reaches microarcsecond precision.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThis led to breakthrough results on the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei, young stellar objects, and stellar physics.\n\n\n\nFollowing a primer in interferometry, we summarize the advances that led to the performance boost of modern interferometers:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSingle-mode beam combiners now combine up to six telescopes, and image reconstruction software has advanced over earlier developments for radio interferometry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tWith a combination of large telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), fringe tracking, and especially dual-beam interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\nAnother order-of-magnitude improvement will come from laser guide star AO. In combination with large separation fringe tracking, O/IR interferometry will then provide complete sky coverage for observations in the Galactic plane and substantial coverage for extragalactic targets.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in optical and infrared interferometry have significantly enhanced our ability to probe the fine details of astronomical objects, including the Galactic Center, exoplanets, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and stars. This review highlights the latest developments in interferometric instrumentation, which have led to improved spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling unprecedented observations. High-precision measurements of the Galactic Center have revealed the dynamics of stars orbiting the supermassive black hole, providing insights into the gravitational environment and the nature of the black hole itself. In the realm of exoplanets, interferometry has facilitated the direct imaging of planetary systems, allowing for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and the study of their formation processes. For AGNs, interferometric techniques have enabled the mapping of the inner regions of these powerful engines, shedding light on the accretion processes and jet dynamics. Similarly, observations of YSOs have provided detailed images of protoplanetary disks, crucial for understanding the early stages of star and planet formation. Finally, interferometric studies of stars have led to precise measurements of stellar diameters, temperatures, and surface features, contributing to our understanding of stellar evolution. These advancements underscore the pivotal role of interferometry in modern astrophysics and its potential to address some of the most fundamental questions in astronomy.", "label": 1}
