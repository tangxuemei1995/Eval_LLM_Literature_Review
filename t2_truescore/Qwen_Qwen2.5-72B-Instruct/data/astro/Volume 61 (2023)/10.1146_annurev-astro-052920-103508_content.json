{"grounding": "The past two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain data sets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and comparative robustness, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such data sets. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modeling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain data sets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code; discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability; and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open-source GP software packages. In summary:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGP regression is a conceptually simple but statistically principled and powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIt is already widely used in some subfields, such as exoplanets, and gaining traction in many others, such as optical transients.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDriven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time-domain astronomy for many years to come.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing astronomical time series data, offering a flexible and robust framework for modeling complex and non-linear relationships. This study explores the application of GPR in time-domain astronomy, focusing on its ability to handle irregularly sampled data, which is common in astronomical observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GPR in various scenarios, including the detection of periodic signals in variable stars, the characterization of transient events such as supernovae, and the modeling of long-term trends in exoplanet transit data. The computational methods employed in this research, including efficient kernel selection and hyperparameter optimization, are discussed in detail. We also compare GPR with traditional time-series analysis techniques, such as Lomb-Scargle periodograms and autoregressive models, highlighting the advantages of GPR in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The results of this study underscore the potential of GPR as a key technique in the astrostatistics toolkit, providing astronomers with a versatile method for extracting meaningful insights from time-domain data.", "label": 1}
