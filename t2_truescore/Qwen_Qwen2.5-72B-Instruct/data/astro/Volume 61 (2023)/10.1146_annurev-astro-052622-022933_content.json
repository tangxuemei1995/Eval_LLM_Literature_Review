{"grounding": "We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in big disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCircumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at P\nb (the binary period) or \u223c5P\nb, depending on the binary eccentricity e\nb and mass ratio q\nb.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g., planet migration) taking place in the disk.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tOver long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters (e\nb and q\nb) and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tA misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when e\nb is significant, the disk can evolve toward \u201cpolar alignment,\u201d with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Circumbinary accretion plays a crucial role in the evolution of binary systems, from stellar binaries to massive binary black holes. This review explores the current understanding of circumbinary accretion processes, focusing on the dynamics of accretion disks and their impact on star formation, black hole growth, and the formation of exoplanets. Recent hydrodynamic simulations have provided insights into the complex interactions between the binary components and the surrounding accretion disk, revealing the formation of gaps, spiral arms, and density waves. These features not only influence the mass transfer rates but also affect the orbital evolution of the binary system. In the context of star formation, circumbinary disks are shown to be capable of supporting the formation of protoplanetary disks, which can lead to the development of exoplanets in binary star systems. For supermassive black hole binaries, the accretion process is critical for understanding the growth and coalescence of these massive objects, which are key to the study of gravitational wave astronomy. The review also highlights the observational challenges and recent advances in detecting and characterizing circumbinary accretion disks, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of this field, which bridges astrophysics, hydrodynamics, and gravitational wave physics.", "label": 1}
