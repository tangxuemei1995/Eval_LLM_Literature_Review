{"grounding": "Interstellar interlopers are bodies formed outside of the Solar System but observed passing through it. The first two identified interlopers, 1I/\u2018Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, exhibited unexpectedly different physical properties. 1I/\u2018Oumuamua appeared unresolved and asteroid-like, whereas 2I/Borisov was a more comet-like source of both gas and dust. Both objects moved under the action of nongravitational acceleration. These interlopers and their divergent properties provide our only window so far onto an enormous and previously unknown galactic population. The number density of such objects is \u223c0.1 AU\u22123 which, if uniform across the galactic disk, would imply 1025 to 1026 similar objects in the Milky Way. The interlopers likely formed in, and were ejected from, the protoplanetary disks of young stars. However, we currently possess too little data to firmly reject other explanations.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of interstellar interlopers, particularly comets, in the dynamics and composition of protoplanetary disks. Using high-resolution spectroscopy and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of these interstellar objects on the chemical and physical evolution of young stellar systems. Our findings suggest that interstellar comets can significantly alter the disk's gas and dust composition, potentially influencing the formation and migration of planets. The implications of these results extend to our understanding of the early Solar System and the potential for similar processes in exoplanetary systems.", "label": 0}
