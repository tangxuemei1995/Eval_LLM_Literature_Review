{"grounding": "Spurred by rich, multiwavelength observations and enabled by new simulations, ranging from cosmological to subparsec scales, the past decade has seen major theoretical progress in our understanding of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We review key physical processes in the CGM. Our conclusions include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is hot (roughly virial temperature), whereas the gas is cold (T \u223c 104 K) when cooling is rapid.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tGas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through winds and gas stripping.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases continuously exchange mass, energy, and momentum. The interaction between turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold gas structures, going down to subparsec scales, arises from fragmentation, coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tMagnetic fields, thermal conduction, and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.\n\n\nKey open questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies.", "generated_text": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, serving as a reservoir of gas that can be accreted or ejected through various physical processes. This review focuses on the key physical processes governing the CGM, including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and their interplay with the intergalactic medium (IGM). Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the CGM is a complex, multiphase environment characterized by a range of temperatures and densities, which are influenced by feedback from galactic winds, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These processes can heat the gas, drive outflows, and enrich the CGM with metals, affecting the galaxy's star formation history. Additionally, the CGM is subject to thermal and magnetic instabilities, which can lead to the formation of cold clouds and filaments. Theoretical models and cosmological simulations suggest that the CGM's structure and dynamics are closely tied to the larger-scale cosmic web, with the IGM providing a continuous supply of gas that can be accreted onto galaxies. Understanding these processes is essential for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution, and for interpreting observations of the CGM in various galactic environments.", "label": 1}
