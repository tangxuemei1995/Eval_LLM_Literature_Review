{"grounding": "Atomic hydrogen (Hi) is a critical stepping stone in the gas evolution cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way. Hi traces both the cold, premolecular state before star formation and the warm, diffuse ISM before and after star formation. This review describes new, sensitive Hi absorption and emission surveys, which, together with high angular and spectral resolution Hi emission data, have revealed the physical properties of Hi, its structure, and its association with magnetic fields. We give an overview of the Hi phases and discuss how Hi properties depend on the environment and what its structure can tell us about feedback in the ISM. Key findings include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe mass fraction of the cold neutral medium is \u227240% on average, increasing with A\nV due to the increase of mean gas density.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe cold disk extends to at least R \u223c 25 kpc.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tApproximately 40% of the Hi is warm, with structural characteristics that derive from feedback events.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCold Hi is highly filamentary, whereas warm Hi is more smoothly distributed.\n\n\n\nWe summarize future observational and simulation opportunities that can be used to unravel the 3D structure of the atomic ISM and the effects of heating and cooling on Hi properties.", "generated_text": "Atomic hydrogen (HI), a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM), plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, including the Milky Way. This study explores the distribution, dynamics, and physical properties of HI in the Milky Way, emphasizing its significance as a stepping stone in galaxy evolution. By analyzing HI data from large-scale surveys, we investigate the interaction between HI and magnetic fields, which are known to influence the structure and dynamics of the ISM. Our findings reveal that magnetic fields can significantly affect the distribution and kinematics of HI, leading to the formation of dense molecular clouds and star-forming regions. Additionally, we examine the role of HI in the recycling of gas within the galaxy, highlighting its importance in the continuous process of star formation and feedback. The results provide insights into the complex interplay between atomic hydrogen, magnetic fields, and the overall evolution of the Milky Way, contributing to a broader understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the universe.", "label": 1}
