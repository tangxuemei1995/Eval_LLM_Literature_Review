{"grounding": "The first generation of stars, often called Population III (or Pop III), form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts z \u223c 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star-formation history until z \u223c 15\u201320, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Population II stars takes over. We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties, and impact of Pop III stars and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tPrimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFeedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIn extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 105M\u2299. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDirect observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21-cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tStellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The formation of the first stars, known as Population III stars, marks a pivotal epoch in the early Universe, transitioning from a pristine, metal-free environment to one enriched with the products of stellar nucleosynthesis. These stars, formed from primordial gas clouds in the high-redshift Universe, are hypothesized to be massive, with masses ranging from several tens to hundreds of solar masses. Their intense radiation and supernova explosions played a crucial role in reionizing the intergalactic medium and seeding the formation of subsequent stellar populations, including Population II stars, which are observed in the halo of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Galactic archaeology, the study of the oldest and most metal-poor stars, provides valuable insights into the chemical and dynamical properties of these early stellar populations. Observational efforts, such as high-resolution spectroscopy and deep-field surveys, are essential for identifying and characterizing the remnants of the first stars and understanding their impact on the evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe. This review synthesizes recent theoretical models and observational data to elucidate the formation mechanisms, properties, and cosmological significance of the first stars, highlighting the interplay between star formation, galaxy evolution, and the chemical enrichment of the early Universe.", "label": 1}
