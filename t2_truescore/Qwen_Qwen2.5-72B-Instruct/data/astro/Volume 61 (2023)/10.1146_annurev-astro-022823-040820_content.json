{"grounding": "Planets form in disks of gas and dust around young stars. The disk molecular reservoirs and their chemical evolution affect all aspects of planet formation, from the coagulation of dust grains into pebbles to the elemental and molecular compositions of the mature planet. Disk chemistry also enables unique probes of disk structures and dynamics, including those directly linked to ongoing planet formation. We review the protoplanetary disk chemistry of the volatile elements H, O, C, N, S, and P; the associated observational and theoretical methods; and the links between disk and planet chemical compositions. Three takeaways from this review are:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe disk chemical composition, including the organic reservoirs, is set by both inheritance and in situ chemistry.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tDisk gas and solid O/C/N/H elemental ratios often deviate from stellar values due to a combination of condensation of molecular carriers, chemistry, and dynamics.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChemical, physical, and dynamical processes in disks are closely linked, which complicates disk chemistry modeling, but these links also present an opportunity to develop chemical probes of different aspects of disk evolution and planet formation.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are complex environments where chemical processes play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. This study explores the chemical composition and dynamics within protoplanetary disks, focusing on the interplay between gas and dust, and the influence of physical conditions such as temperature and radiation. Using high-resolution spectroscopic observations and advanced chemical models, we investigate the distribution of key molecular species, including H2O, CO, and NH3, which are essential for the formation of planetary cores and atmospheres. Our findings reveal that the chemical gradients within the disk can significantly affect the composition of forming planets, with implications for the habitability of exoplanets. Additionally, we examine the role of photochemistry and grain surface reactions in shaping the chemical landscape of protoplanetary disks. These results provide new insights into the astrochemical processes that govern the early stages of planet formation, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of planetary systems.", "label": 1}
