{"grounding": "We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the \u039bCDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following:", "generated_text": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in the study of galaxy formation and evolution, offering detailed insights into the complex interplay between dark matter, gas, and stellar processes. These simulations have successfully reproduced key observational properties of the galaxy population, such as the luminosity function, stellar mass distribution, and morphological diversity. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in accurately modeling feedback processes from supernovae and active galactic nuclei, which are crucial for regulating star formation and shaping galaxy halos. Additionally, the treatment of gas cooling, metal enrichment, and the cosmic web's influence on galaxy growth continues to pose computational and theoretical hurdles. This review highlights the enduring successes of hydrodynamical simulations in galaxy studies and discusses the outstanding challenges that must be addressed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of galaxy formation.", "label": 1}
