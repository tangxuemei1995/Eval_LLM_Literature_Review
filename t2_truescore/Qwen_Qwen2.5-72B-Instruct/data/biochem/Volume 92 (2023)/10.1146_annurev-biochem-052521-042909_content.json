{"grounding": "Muscles are essential for movement and heart function. Contraction and relaxation of muscles rely on the sliding of two types of filaments\u2014the thin filament and the thick myosin filament. The thin filament is composed mainly of filamentous actin (F-actin), tropomyosin, and troponin. Additionally, several other proteins are involved in the contraction mechanism, and their malfunction can lead to diverse muscle diseases, such as cardiomyopathies. We review recent high-resolution structural data that explain the mechanism of action of muscle proteins at an unprecedented level of molecular detail. We focus on the molecular structures of the components of the thin and thick filaments and highlight the mechanisms underlying force generation through actin\u2013myosin interactions, as well as Ca2+-dependent regulation via the dihydropyridine receptor, the ryanodine receptor, and troponin. We particularly emphasize the impact of cryo\u2013electron microscopy and cryo\u2013electron tomography in leading muscle research into a new era.", "generated_text": "This study provides a comprehensive structural analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle contraction, focusing on the interactions between actin, myosin, troponin, and the ryanodine receptor. Utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques, we have elucidated the conformational changes in these proteins during the contraction cycle. Our findings reveal the precise binding sites and structural transitions of myosin heads on actin filaments, as well as the regulatory role of troponin in modulating these interactions. Additionally, we have mapped the structural dynamics of the ryanodine receptor, a key calcium release channel, which is essential for the initiation of muscle contraction. These insights enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of muscle function and provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies for muscle disorders.", "label": 1}
