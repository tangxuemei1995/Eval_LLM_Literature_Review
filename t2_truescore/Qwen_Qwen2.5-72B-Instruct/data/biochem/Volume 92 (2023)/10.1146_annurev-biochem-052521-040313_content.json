{"grounding": "Ligands of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway are paracrine signaling molecules that coordinate tissue development in metazoans. A remarkable feature of HH signaling is the repeated use of cholesterol in steps spanning ligand biogenesis, secretion, dispersal, and reception on target cells. A cholesterol molecule covalently attached to HH ligands is used as a molecular baton by transfer proteins to guide their secretion, spread, and reception. On target cells, a signaling circuit composed of a cholesterol transporter and sensor regulates transmission of HH signals across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The repeated use of cholesterol in signaling supports the view that the HH pathway likely evolved by coopting ancient systems to regulate the abundance or organization of sterol-like lipids in membranes.", "generated_text": "Cholesterol plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. This relationship is mediated through the primary cilium, a cellular organelle that acts as a signaling hub. Cholesterol modulates the activity of the Hh receptor, Patched, and the G protein\u2013coupled receptor, Smoothened, by influencing their localization and conformation within biological membranes. Disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis can lead to aberrant Hh signaling, contributing to developmental disorders and diseases such as cancer. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between cholesterol and Hh signaling, emphasizing the importance of lipid composition in the regulation of cell surface receptors and the primary cilium.", "label": 1}
