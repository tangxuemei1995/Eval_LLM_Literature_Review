{"grounding": "Thiolases are CoA-dependent enzymes that catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA, as well as its reverse reaction, which is the thioester-dependent Claisen condensation reaction. Thiolases are dimers or tetramers (dimers of dimers). All thiolases have two reactive cysteines: (a) a nucleophilic cysteine, which forms a covalent intermediate, and (b) an acid/base cysteine. The best characterized thiolase is the Zoogloea ramigera thiolase, which is a bacterial biosynthetic thiolase belonging to the CT-thiolase subfamily. The thiolase active site is also characterized by two oxyanion holes, two active site waters, and four catalytic loops with characteristic amino acid sequence fingerprints. Three thiolase subfamilies can be identified, each characterized by a unique sequence fingerprint for one of their catalytic loops, which causes unique active site properties. Recent insights concerning the thiolase reaction mechanism, as obtained from recent structural studies, as well as from classical and recent enzymological studies, are addressed, and open questions are discussed.", "generated_text": "Thiolase represents a versatile biocatalyst that employs coenzyme A (CoA)\u2013thioester chemistry to facilitate the formation and cleavage of carbon\u2013carbon (C\u2013C) bonds. This enzyme is characterized by a unique active site architecture, featuring an oxyanion hole and a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes transition states and intermediates during catalysis. The proton wire, a series of hydrogen-bonded residues, plays a critical role in proton transfer, enhancing the efficiency of the Claisen condensation and thioester hydrolysis reactions. These features enable thiolase to catalyze a wide range of reactions, making it a valuable tool in biocatalysis and synthetic biology. This review highlights the structural and mechanistic insights into thiolase, emphasizing its potential applications in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and the development of novel biocatalytic processes.", "label": 1}
