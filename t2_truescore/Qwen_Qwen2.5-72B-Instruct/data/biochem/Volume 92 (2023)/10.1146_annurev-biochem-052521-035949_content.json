{"grounding": "Chemical modifications on mRNA represent a critical layer of gene expression regulation. Research in this area has continued to accelerate over the last decade, as more modifications are being characterized with increasing depth and breadth. mRNA modifications have been demonstrated to influence nearly every step from the early phases of transcript synthesis in the nucleus through to their decay in the cytoplasm, but in many cases, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain mysterious. Here, we highlight recent work that has elucidated the roles of mRNA modifications throughout the mRNA life cycle, describe gaps in our understanding and remaining open questions, and offer some forward-looking perspective on future directions in the field.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications play a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA metabolism and function, contributing to the complexity of the epitranscriptome. These chemical alterations, including methylation, pseudouridylation, and acylation, can influence various aspects of posttranscriptional regulation, such as mRNA stability, splicing, and translation efficiency. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the comprehensive mapping of these modifications, revealing their dynamic nature and potential regulatory mechanisms. This review highlights the current understanding of how RNA modifications modulate mRNA fate and function, emphasizing their impact on gene expression and cellular processes.", "label": 1}
