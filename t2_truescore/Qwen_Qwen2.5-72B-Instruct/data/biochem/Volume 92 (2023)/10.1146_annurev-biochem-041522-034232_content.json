{"grounding": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR), discovered as preferential nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers located in transcribed mammalian genes compared to those in nontranscribed regions of the genome, is defined as faster repair of the transcribed strand versus the nontranscribed strand in transcribed genes. The phenomenon, universal in model organisms including Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, mice, and humans, involves a translocase that interacts with both RNA polymerase stalled at damage in the transcribed strand and nucleotide excision repair proteins to accelerate repair. Drosophila, a notable exception, exhibits TCR but lacks an obvious TCR translocase. Mutations inactivating TCR genes cause increased damage-induced mutagenesis in E. coli and severe neurological and UV sensitivity syndromes in humans. To date, only E. coli TCR has been reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. Detailed investigations of TCR using genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, cryo\u2013electron microscopy, single-molecule analysis, and other approaches have revealed fascinating mechanisms.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially repairs DNA damage in the transcribed strand of active genes. This process is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis, particularly in highly expressed genes. Key factors involved in TCR include the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd in bacteria and CSB in eukaryotes, which recognize RNA polymerase stalling at damaged sites and recruit NER machinery. Recent studies have highlighted the role of TCR in the regulation of the circadian clock, suggesting a link between DNA repair and circadian gene expression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of TCR not only provides insights into the cellular response to DNA damage but also has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting mutagenesis and circadian disorders.", "label": 1}
