{"grounding": "Over the past decade, mRNA modifications have emerged as important regulators of gene expression control in cells. Fueled in large part by the development of tools for detecting RNA modifications transcriptome wide, researchers have uncovered a diverse epitranscriptome that serves as an additional layer of gene regulation beyond simple RNA sequence. Here, we review the proteins that write, read, and erase these marks, with a particular focus on the most abundant internal modification, N\n6-methyladenosine (m6A). We first describe the discovery of the key enzymes that deposit and remove m6A and other modifications and discuss how our understanding of these proteins has shaped our views of modification dynamics. We then review current models for the function of m6A reader proteins and how our knowledge of these proteins has evolved. Finally, we highlight important future directions for the field and discuss key questions that remain unanswered.", "generated_text": "The field of epitranscriptomics has emerged as a critical area of study, focusing on the dynamic modifications of mRNA that regulate gene expression. This review highlights the roles of key proteins involved in mRNA modification, including methyltransferases (writers), reader proteins, and demethylases (erasers). Specifically, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA, influencing various aspects of RNA metabolism such as splicing, stability, and translation. Methyltransferase complexes, such as METTL3 and METTL14, are responsible for adding m6A marks, while demethylases like FTO and ALKBH5 remove these modifications. Reader proteins, including YTH domain-containing proteins, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA, mediating downstream functional outcomes. Understanding the interplay between these proteins is essential for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of the epitranscriptome and their implications in cellular processes and disease.", "label": 1}
