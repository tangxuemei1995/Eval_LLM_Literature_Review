{"grounding": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and other genotoxic stresses induce bulky DNA lesions, which threaten genome stability and cell viability. Cells have evolved two main repair pathways to remove such lesions: global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The modes by which these subpathways recognize DNA lesions are distinct, but they converge onto the same downstream steps for DNA repair. Here, we first summarize the current understanding of these repair mechanisms, specifically focusing on the roles of stalled RNA polymerase II, Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), CSA and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) in TC-NER. We also discuss the intriguing role of protein ubiquitylation in this process. Additionally, we highlight key aspects of the effect of UV irradiation on transcription and describe the role of signaling cascades in orchestrating this response. Finally, we describe the pathogenic mechanisms underlying xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, the two main diseases linked to mutations in NER factors.", "generated_text": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially repairs DNA damage in the transcribed strand of active genes. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing transcriptional arrest caused by UV-induced DNA damage. Unlike global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), which operates throughout the genome, TC-NER is initiated by the stalling of RNA polymerase II at the site of damage. The recruitment of repair factors, such as the CSA and CSB proteins, is essential for the efficient removal of lesions and the resumption of transcription. Defects in TC-NER are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light, developmental abnormalities, and neurodegeneration. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying TC-NER, its interplay with the transcriptional machinery, and the clinical implications of TC-NER deficiencies.", "label": 1}
