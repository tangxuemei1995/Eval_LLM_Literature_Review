{"grounding": "Formation of the 3\u2032 end of a eukaryotic mRNA is a key step in the production of a mature transcript. This process is mediated by a number of protein factors that cleave the pre-mRNA, add a poly(A) tail, and regulate transcription by protein dephosphorylation. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in humans, or cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) in yeast, coordinates these enzymatic activities with each other, with RNA recognition, and with transcription. The site of pre-mRNA cleavage can strongly influence the translation, stability, and localization of the mRNA. Hence, cleavage site selection is highly regulated. The length of the poly(A) tail is also controlled to ensure that every transcript has a similar tail when it is exported from the nucleus. In this review, we summarize new mechanistic insights into mRNA 3\u2032-end processing obtained through structural studies and biochemical reconstitution and outline outstanding questions in the field.", "generated_text": "The 3\u2032-end processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving the precise cleavage and polyadenylation of the transcript. This process, mediated by a complex machinery including endonucleases and poly(A) polymerases, ensures the stability and translational efficiency of mature mRNA. The cleavage site is recognized by a consensus sequence, and the addition of the poly(A) tail is regulated by various factors, including transcriptional pausing and the interplay between RNA-binding proteins and the transcription machinery. Dysregulation of 3\u2032-end processing can lead to aberrant mRNA levels and is implicated in several diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of this process, revealing its impact on alternative polyadenylation and the fine-tuning of gene expression in response to cellular signals.", "label": 1}
