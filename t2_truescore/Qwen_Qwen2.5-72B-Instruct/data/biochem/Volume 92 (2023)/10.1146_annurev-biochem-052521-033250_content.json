{"grounding": "The insulin receptor (IR) is a type II receptor tyrosine kinase that plays essential roles in metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Dysregulation of IR signaling is linked to many human diseases, such as diabetes and cancers. The resolution revolution in cryo\u2013electron microscopy has led to the determination of several structures of IR with different numbers of bound insulin molecules in recent years, which have tremendously improved our understanding of how IR is activated by insulin. Here, we review the insulin-induced activation mechanism of IR, including (a) the detailed binding modes and functions of insulin at site 1 and site 2 and (b) the insulin-induced structural transitions that are required for IR activation. We highlight several other key aspects of the activation and regulation of IR signaling and discuss the remaining gaps in our understanding of the IR activation mechanism and potential avenues of future research.", "generated_text": "The activation mechanism of the insulin receptor (IR) is a critical process in cellular metabolism, involving intricate structural changes upon insulin binding. Recent advancements in cryo-EM have provided high-resolution insights into the conformational dynamics of the IR. This study elucidates the structural transitions at insulin-binding sites 1 and 2, which are essential for receptor activation. The binding of insulin to site 1 induces a conformational shift that propagates through the ectodomain, leading to the exposure of site 2. This sequential binding and structural rearrangement facilitate the dimerization and autophosphorylation of the IR, ultimately activating downstream signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for insulin-related disorders.", "label": 1}
