{"grounding": "Carbon fixation is the process by which CO2 is converted from a gas into biomass. The Calvin\u2013Benson\u2013Bassham cycle (CBB) is the dominant carbon-consuming pathway on Earth, driving >99.5% of the \u223c120 billion tons of carbon that are converted to sugar by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The carboxylase enzyme in the CBB, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), fixes one CO2 molecule per turn of the cycle into bioavailable sugars. Despite being critical to the assimilation of carbon, rubisco's kinetic rate is not very fast, limiting flux through the pathway. This bottleneck presents a paradox: Why has rubisco not evolved to be a better catalyst? Many hypothesize that the catalytic mechanism of rubisco is subject to one or more trade-offs and that rubisco variants have been optimized for their native physiological environment. Here, we review the evolution and biochemistry of rubisco through the lens of structure and mechanism in order to understand what trade-offs limit its improvement. We also review the many attempts to improve rubisco itself and thereby promote plant growth.", "generated_text": "Rubisco, a pivotal carboxylase in the Calvin cycle, is central to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Despite its essential role, Rubisco is known for its inefficiency, with a slow catalytic rate and a tendency to fix oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to photorespiration. This review explores the evolutionary history of Rubisco, highlighting the diverse forms found across different taxa, from cyanobacteria to land plants. Recent advances in enzyme engineering have aimed to enhance Rubisco's catalytic efficiency and specificity, with strategies including directed evolution, rational design, and the introduction of alternative carboxylases. These efforts not only promise to improve photosynthetic efficiency in crops but also offer insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing Rubisco's function. The integration of these engineered enzymes into plant systems represents a promising avenue for increasing agricultural productivity and addressing global food security challenges.", "label": 1}
