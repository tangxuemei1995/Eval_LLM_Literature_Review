{"grounding": "Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes use a site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster and SAM to initiate radical reactions through liberation of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl (5\u2032-dAdo\u2022) radical. They form the largest enzyme superfamily, with more than 700,000 unique sequences currently, and their numbers continue to grow as a result of ongoing bioinformatics efforts. The range of extremely diverse, highly regio- and stereo-specific reactions known to be catalyzed by radical SAM superfamily members is remarkable. The common mechanism of radical initiation in the radical SAM superfamily is the focus of this review. Most surprising is the presence of an organometallic intermediate, \u03a9, exhibiting an Fe\u2013C5\u2032-adenosyl bond. Regioselective reductive cleavage of the SAM S\u2013C5\u2032 bond produces 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 to form \u03a9, with the regioselectivity originating in the Jahn\u2013Teller effect. \u03a9 liberates the free 5\u2032-dAdo\u2022 as the catalytically active intermediate through homolysis of the Fe\u2013C5\u2032 bond, in analogy to Co\u2013C5\u2032 bond homolysis in B12, which was once viewed as biology's choice of radical generator.", "generated_text": "The Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme superfamily plays a crucial role in a wide array of biological processes, including the biosynthesis of complex natural products and the repair of DNA. These enzymes initiate radical chemistry through the reductive cleavage of SAM, generating a highly reactive 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical. This radical is then used to initiate a diverse array of organometallic reactions, often involving the activation of unreactive substrates. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism of radical initiation, highlighting the importance of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the reduction of SAM and the subsequent formation of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical. This review summarizes the current understanding of the radical initiation mechanism in Radical SAM enzymes, emphasizing the structural and mechanistic insights gained from recent biochemical and spectroscopic studies.", "label": 1}
