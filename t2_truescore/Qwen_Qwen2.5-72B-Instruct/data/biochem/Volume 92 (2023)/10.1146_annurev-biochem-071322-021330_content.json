{"grounding": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations of vital importance in mammalian cells. Their cellular levels are tightly regulated by degradation and synthesis, as well as by uptake and export. Here, we discuss the delicate balance between the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of polyamines in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyamine levels decline with aging and are altered in patients with PD, whereas recent mechanistic studies on ATP13A2 (PARK9) demonstrated a driving role of a disturbed polyamine homeostasis in PD. Polyamines affect pathways in PD pathogenesis, such as \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and influence PD-related processes like autophagy, heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal/mitochondrial dysfunction. We formulate outstanding research questions regarding the role of polyamines in PD, their potential as PD biomarkers, and possible therapeutic strategies for PD targeting polyamine homeostasis.", "generated_text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, play critical roles in cellular processes, but their dysregulation can contribute to neurotoxicity. This review explores the dual role of polyamines in PD, highlighting their interactions with mitochondria and endo/lysosomal systems, which are key organelles implicated in PD pathogenesis. Polyamines can modulate \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD, and influence astrocyte function, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal health. While excessive polyamine levels can exacerbate neurotoxicity, controlled polyamine metabolism may offer neuroprotective benefits. Understanding the balance between these effects could provide new therapeutic targets for PD.", "label": 1}
