{"grounding": "SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) protein complexes are an evolutionarily conserved family of motor proteins that hold sister chromatids together and fold genomes throughout the cell cycle by DNA loop extrusion. These complexes play a key role in a variety of functions in the packaging and regulation of chromosomes, and they have been intensely studied in recent years. Despite their importance, the detailed molecular mechanism for DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes remains unresolved. Here, we describe the roles of SMCs in chromosome biology and particularly review in vitro single-molecule studies that have recently advanced our understanding of SMC proteins. We describe the mechanistic biophysical aspects of loop extrusion that govern genome organization and its consequences.", "generated_text": "Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a crucial role in genome organization through the mechanism of DNA loop extrusion. Recent single-molecule studies have provided insights into the dynamic processes by which SMC complexes, such as cohesin and condensin, form and maintain loops along the chromatin fiber. These loops are essential for various cellular functions, including gene regulation, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. This review summarizes the current understanding of how SMC complexes facilitate DNA loop extrusion, highlighting the molecular mechanisms and the implications for genome architecture and function.", "label": 1}
