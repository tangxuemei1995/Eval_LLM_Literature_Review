{"grounding": "In this autobiographical article, I reflect on my Swedish background. Then I discuss endogenous DNA alterations and the base excision repair pathway and alternative repair strategies for some unusual DNA lesions. Endogenous DNA damage, such as loss of purine bases and cytosine deamination, is proposed as a major source of cancer-causing mutations.", "generated_text": "This paper reflects on the author\u2019s journey in understanding endogenous DNA damage and the mechanisms of base excision repair, highlighting the role of DNA glycosylases in preventing cancer mutations. Personal insights and key discoveries are discussed.", "label": 0}
