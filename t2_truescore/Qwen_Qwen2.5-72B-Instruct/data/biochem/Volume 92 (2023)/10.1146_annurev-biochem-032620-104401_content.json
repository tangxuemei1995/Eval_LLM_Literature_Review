{"grounding": "According to the endosymbiotic theory, most of the DNA of the original bacterial endosymbiont has been lost or transferred to the nucleus, leaving a much smaller (\u223c16 kb in mammals), circular molecule that is the present-day mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The ability of mtDNA to escape mitochondria and integrate into the nuclear genome was discovered in budding yeast, along with genes that regulate this process. Mitochondria have emerged as key regulators of innate immunity, and it is now recognized that mtDNA released into the cytoplasm, outside of the cell, or into circulation activates multiple innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we first review the mechanisms through which mtDNA is released into the cytoplasm, including several inducible mitochondrial pores and defective mitophagy or autophagy. Next, we cover how the different forms of released mtDNA activate specific innate immune nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes. Finally, we discuss how intracellular and extracellular mtDNA release, including circulating cell-free mtDNA that promotes systemic inflammation, are implicated in human diseases, bacterial and viral infections, senescence and aging.", "generated_text": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol plays a critical role in innate immune signaling, contributing to inflammation and disease progression. Under stress conditions, such as infection or tissue damage, mtDNA can be released through mitochondrial pores, activating cytosolic DNA sensors like cGAS and AIM2. These sensors trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, amplifying the immune response. However, excessive or uncontrolled mtDNA release can lead to chronic inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms governing mitochondrial pore formation and the subsequent release of mtDNA, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for modulating innate immune responses. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate inflammation and treat diseases associated with aberrant mtDNA release.", "label": 1}
