{"grounding": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translational efficiency are two crucial aspects of the post-transcriptional process that profoundly impact protein production in a cell. While it is widely known that ribosomes produce proteins, studies during the past decade have surprisingly revealed that ribosomes also control mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner, a process referred to as codon optimality. Therefore, codons, the three-nucleotide words read by the ribosome, have a potent effect on mRNA stability and provide cis-regulatory information that extends beyond the amino acids they encode. While the codon optimality molecular mechanism is still unclear, the translation elongation rate appears to trigger mRNA decay. Thus, transfer RNAs emerge as potential master gene regulators affecting mRNA stability. Furthermore, while few factors related to codon optimality have been identified in yeast, the orthologous genes in vertebrates do not necessary share the same functions. Here, we discuss codon optimality findings and gene regulation layers related to codon composition in different eukaryotic species.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between codon usage, tRNA abundance, and mRNA stability is a critical aspect of gene expression regulation. This review explores how codon optimality and tRNA availability influence translation elongation rates and, consequently, mRNA decay. Codons that are translated more efficiently due to higher tRNA abundance can lead to faster elongation, which in turn can affect the stability of the mRNA. Studies have shown that suboptimal codons can slow down translation, potentially exposing the mRNA to degradation pathways. Additionally, the use of specific codons can recruit RNA-binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability. This interplay between codon usage, translation efficiency, and mRNA decay highlights the multifaceted mechanisms by which cells fine-tune gene expression. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the regulatory networks that govern cellular function and for developing strategies to manipulate gene expression in therapeutic contexts.", "label": 1}
