{"grounding": "DNA-editing enzymes perform chemical reactions on DNA nucleobases. These reactions can change the genetic identity of the modified base or modulate gene expression. Interest in DNA-editing enzymes has burgeoned in recent years due to the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems, which can be used to direct their DNA-editing activity to specific genomic loci of interest. In this review, we showcase DNA-editing enzymes that have been repurposed or redesigned and developed into programmable base editors. These include deaminases, glycosylases, methyltransferases, and demethylases. We highlight the astounding degree to which these enzymes have been redesigned, evolved, and refined and present these collective engineering efforts as a paragon for future efforts to repurpose and engineer other families of enzymes. Collectively, base editors derived from these DNA-editing enzymes facilitate programmable point mutation introduction and gene expression modulation by targeted chemical modification of nucleobases.", "generated_text": "The development of base editors, which enable precise modification of single nucleotides in DNA, has revolutionized the field of genome editing. This review focuses on the design and application of DNA-editing enzymes, including deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases, as base editors. Through protein engineering, these enzymes have been optimized to enhance their specificity, efficiency, and versatility. Base editors have been successfully applied in various organisms, from bacteria to mammals, for correcting genetic mutations, studying gene function, and developing therapeutic strategies. However, challenges such as off-target effects and delivery methods remain. This paper discusses recent advancements, current limitations, and future directions in the field of base editing, highlighting the potential of these tools in both research and clinical settings.", "label": 0}
