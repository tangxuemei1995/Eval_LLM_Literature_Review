{"grounding": "This article reviews the anthropological scholarship that engages with religious conversion as a political phenomenon, broadly defined. It develops the idea of making a difference as an overarching framework with a double meaning. First, this idiom captures how, by framing religious conversion in political terms, anthropologists have claimed to have substantially intervened\u2014have made a difference, so to speak\u2014in the discussion of conversion. Second, the article sets aside the prevalent problematization of conversion as a category of change, showing instead how anthropologists have sought to establish how religious change makes a difference\u2014in the interweaved realities of individuals, collectives, and polities. I scrutinize and contextualize the belated consolidation of this area of inquiry, map its major strands, and identify the interrelated theoretical developments within anthropology. Seeing these strands as a generative domain of inquiry, I conclude with a number of suggestions for future research, such as paying closer attention to political conversions and to the links between religious conversion and political crises.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between religious conversion and political engagement, examining how the act of changing one's religious affiliation can lead to significant political transformations. Drawing on a diverse range of case studies from various cultural and geographical contexts, the research highlights the ways in which religious conversion not only alters individual identities but also reshapes community dynamics and political landscapes. The analysis reveals that religious conversion can serve as a catalyst for political activism, often leading to the formation of new social movements and the reconfiguration of existing political alliances. By focusing on the lived experiences of converts and their interactions with both religious and secular institutions, this study underscores the complex interplay between religious difference and political difference. The findings suggest that religious conversion can be a powerful force for political change, challenging existing power structures and promoting social justice.", "label": 0}
