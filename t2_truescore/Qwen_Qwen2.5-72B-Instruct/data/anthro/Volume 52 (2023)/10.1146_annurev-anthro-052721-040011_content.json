{"grounding": "In this article, we explore critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that interrogates structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions and political movements. Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the origins of the American university to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects, as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. We then bring the lens of CUS to bear on critical work by anthropologists on higher education and on the discipline more broadly. We explore the challenges of advocating for antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology without attending to the structures of Western/white superiority that have enabled its institutionalization. We conclude by considering interventions by the emerging field of abolitionist anthropology.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the interdisciplinary field of Critical University Studies, focusing on its role in challenging and transforming the structures and ideologies of higher education. By integrating perspectives from decolonization, abolition, and Black studies, the paper examines how these frameworks can be applied to address systemic issues such as racial injustice, academic elitism, and the corporatization of universities. Through a critical analysis of current educational practices and policies, the study highlights the importance of fostering inclusive and equitable learning environments. The research also emphasizes the need for a radical reimagining of the university's purpose and function, advocating for a more democratic and socially just approach to higher education. This work contributes to ongoing conversations about the future of academia and the potential for transformative change within the institution.", "label": 1}
