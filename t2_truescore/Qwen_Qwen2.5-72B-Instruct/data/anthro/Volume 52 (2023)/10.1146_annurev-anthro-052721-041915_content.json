{"grounding": "This review surveys studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines, as well as theoretical frameworks and debates among anthropologists and other relevant scholars in the field. It also aims to assess developments in these studies since an earlier Annual Review of Anthropology article was published on this subject. By considering the ethnographic boom in men and masculinities studies across the globe since 2000, increasingly authored by anthropologists from the Global South, this review considers anthropology's singular contributions topically and conceptually\u2014for example, masculinity and militarism, men and public health, gender inequalities, and trans* social movements\u2014including through innovative research in biological and linguistic anthropology and archaeology. Throughout, this article reflects on the extent to which anthropologists have moved (and if they should have moved) beyond the study of women or men to instead explore gender, sex, and sexuality of humans and nonhuman animals in less binary frameworks.", "generated_text": "This paper revisits the anthropology of masculinity, a field that has evolved significantly since its inception. By examining the ways in which masculinity is constructed, performed, and negotiated across diverse cultural contexts, the study highlights the dynamic and multifaceted nature of male identities. It explores the intersections of masculinity with other social categories such as race, class, and sexuality, and how these intersections contribute to patterns of inequality and power. The research also addresses the ongoing changes in gender norms and the implications of these shifts for men\u2019s roles and relationships. Through a critical analysis of contemporary ethnographic data, the paper argues for a more nuanced understanding of masculinity that recognizes both its fluidity and its impact on broader social structures. This re-examination aims to contribute to the broader discourse on gender equality and social change.", "label": 0}
