{"grounding": "This review examines the discourses and practices that have produced a lively literature on museum decolonization created by scholars of museum practices and curators. We consider the trajectory of decolonization efforts in museums, focusing especially on the care of Native North American heritage, with comparison to similar trajectories internationally. We begin with a discussion of decolonizing moments in theory and practice, with particular attention to 1990s critique of ethnographic museums and developments after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Following this discussion is a review of works on concerns regarding Native American representation and public displays, involvement in collections care, and the varied collaborations that are changing museum practices. The final section foregrounds the fluorescence of tribal museums and their contributions to the decolonization and indigenization of museums, as well as emerging paradigm shifts in both the anthropology of museums and anthropology in museums.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the ongoing process of decolonizing museums, emphasizing the need for a paradigm shift in museum practices to better reflect and honor Indigenous perspectives and knowledge systems. Drawing on Native American scholarship, the study highlights the importance of indigenization, which involves not only the repatriation of cultural artifacts but also the reimagining of curatorial practices to include Indigenous voices and methodologies. Through a review of recent initiatives and case studies, the paper demonstrates how museums are beginning to transform their roles from custodians of colonial legacies to partners in the preservation and celebration of Indigenous cultures. The research underscores the critical role of collaboration between museums and Indigenous communities, advocating for a more equitable and inclusive approach to cultural representation and heritage management.", "label": 1}
