{"grounding": "\u201cIntervention\u201d is central to global health, but the significance and effects of how intervention is practiced are often taken for granted. This review takes interventions into health and medicine as subjects for ethnographic inquiry. We highlight three lines of anthropological contributions: studies of global health interventions that serve imperial and military objectives, studies of \u201cmagic bullet\u201d interventions arising from laboratory science, and studies of interventions based on deterministic modeling techniques. We then outline examples of \u201cintervention otherwise,\u201d in which people build relations of solidarity and care through global health programming, design interventions to be interactive and adaptable, and use data and modeling to support health justice. Whereas many global health interventions reproduce Western power hierarchies, intervention otherwise draws attention to alternative forms of knowledge, action, and expertise. Our analysis of lively and multivalent practices of intervention has implications for debates about the im/possibility of decolonizing global health.", "generated_text": "This paper critically examines the role of military interventions, magic bullet approaches, and deterministic models in global public health, highlighting their limitations and the need for a more nuanced, context-sensitive approach. Drawing on anthropological perspectives and historical analyses, the study reveals how these interventions often perpetuate colonial legacies and overlook the complex social, economic, and cultural determinants of health. Through case studies from various regions, the paper illustrates how top-down, technocratic solutions can undermine local health systems and community resilience. It argues for a shift towards more participatory and equitable models of global health care, emphasizing the importance of local knowledge, community engagement, and sustainable development. The findings suggest that effective global health interventions require a deeper understanding of the historical and social contexts in which they are implemented.", "label": 1}
