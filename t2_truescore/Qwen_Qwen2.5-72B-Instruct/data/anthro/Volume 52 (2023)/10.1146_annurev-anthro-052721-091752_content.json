{"grounding": "In this review, we call for heightened attention to the labor of interpreters to think more reflexively about our own professional ethics and the paradoxes of global capitalism within which both interpreters and anthropologists work. Like other forms of communicative labor, interpretation is often devalued, unrecognized, and uncompensated\u2014a form of invisible labor. Professional language ideologies, some paradoxically perpetuated by the profession itself, contribute to interpreters\u2019 invisibility in their workplaces. Global and multilingual organizations depend on ideologies of transparency and the assumption that language transmission is easy; examining interpreters\u2019 labor ethnographically troubles these assumptions. Interpreters also confront an ethical tension in their position that mirrors a tension in anthropology: namely, between ideals of professional neutrality and analytic distance versus intentional advocacy. The study of interpreters offers ways to critically assess anthropologists\u2019 own professional practices and dig deeply into the contradictions of global capitalism.", "generated_text": "This study explores the invisible labor and ethical dimensions of interpreting within the frameworks of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews with professional interpreters, the research highlights the often-overlooked emotional and cognitive efforts required in the profession. Interpreters navigate complex linguistic and cultural landscapes, mediating not only words but also the nuanced meanings and power dynamics inherent in their work. The findings reveal that interpreters frequently face ethical dilemmas, particularly in contexts where their voices and decisions can significantly impact the outcomes for vulnerable populations. The study argues for a greater recognition of the invisible labor of interpreters and the need for ethical guidelines that support their well-being and professional integrity. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the role of interpreters in shaping communication and power relations in globalized settings.", "label": 1}
