{"grounding": "This review sketches a linguistic anthropology of images. While linguistic anthropology has not historically focalized images as a central theoretical object of concern, linguistic anthropologists\u2019 research has increasingly concerned images of various sorts. Furthermore, in its critique of structuralist reductions of language, the field has advanced an analytic vocabulary for thinking about the image in discourse. In this article, I review scholarship in linguistic anthropology on prototypic images to show how these advances (e.g., entextualization, performativity, perspective, and enregisterment) can be leveraged to theorize images more generally. In doing so, I argue against any hard distinction between language and image. I conclude by expanding out from a linguistic anthropology of images to what I call \u201ca linguistic anthropology of\u2026,\u201d a field characterized by an open-ended horizon of objects and modes of inquiry, all linked together as linguistic anthropology.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual semiotics, focusing on how images function as linguistic entities within social contexts. By examining processes of entextualization, performativity, and enregisterment, the research elucidates how images are imbued with meaning and how they participate in the construction of social realities. Through a series of case studies, the paper demonstrates how images can be analyzed as texts, highlighting their role in communication and cultural practices. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of the semiotic landscape, where visual and linguistic elements are interwoven in complex ways, shaping human interaction and identity.", "label": 1}
