{"grounding": "Human habitation and adaptation to extreme environments have a deep history in anthropological research. Anthropologists\u2019 understanding of these ecological pressures and how humans respond to them has grown substantially over the last 100+ years. This review covers long-standing knowledge on adaptation to classic extreme conditions of heat, cold, and high altitude, while also updating the areas in which recent research has broadened our understanding of human adaptation, acclimatization, and resilience. Unfortunately, the intersecting stresses of structural inequality and climate change have made these extremes more extreme, with drastic negative impacts on health and well-being. Future research will need to explore how extreme environments, structural inequality, and climate change are embodied as well as mitigated so that humans are better prepared to face a rapidly changing world.", "generated_text": "This review examines the physiological and metabolic adaptations of human bodies in extreme environments, including high altitudes, arctic conditions, and deserts. The study highlights the role of thermoregulation and metabolic adjustments in enabling survival and performance in these challenging settings. Additionally, it explores the impact of climate change on the prevalence and nature of extreme environments, and how structural inequalities affect access to adaptive resources and technologies. The findings underscore the need for interdisciplinary approaches to enhance human resilience and mitigate the adverse effects of environmental extremes.", "label": 1}
