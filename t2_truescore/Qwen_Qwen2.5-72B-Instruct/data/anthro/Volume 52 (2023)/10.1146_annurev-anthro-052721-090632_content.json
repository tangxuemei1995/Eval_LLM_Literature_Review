{"grounding": "Contesting ideas about what is \u201cnormal\u201d human behavior or biology is a core contribution of anthropology. In efforts to provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions about what it means to be normal. Meanings of the term normal encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative), i.e., judgments about a given characteristic. In biomedicine, \u201chealthy\u201d is often the value ascribed to normal, but embedded in healthy are biases that derive from particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review how the term normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation. I propose the biological normalcy framework for understanding how the statistical and normative meanings of normal mutually inform each other and their consequences for human population biology. Several examples provide illustrations of the framework.", "generated_text": "This study explores the concept of biological normalcy, integrating perspectives from human biology, cultural norms, and statistical analysis. By examining the variability in physiological and genetic traits across diverse populations, we challenge the notion of a universal biological norm. Our findings highlight the significant role of cultural and environmental factors in shaping normative views of human biology. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and original data analysis, we demonstrate that what is considered 'normal' often reflects cultural biases rather than objective biological standards. This research underscores the importance of recognizing biological variation and the need for more inclusive definitions of normalcy in medical and social contexts.", "label": 1}
