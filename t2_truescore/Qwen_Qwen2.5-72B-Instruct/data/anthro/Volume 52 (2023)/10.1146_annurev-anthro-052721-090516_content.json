{"grounding": "The trajectory of human aging varies widely from one individual to the next due to complex interactions between the genome and the environment that influence the aging process. Such differences in age-specific mortality and disease risk among same-aged individuals reflect variation in the pace of biological aging. Certain mechanisms involved in the progression of biological aging originate in the epigenome, where chemical modifications to the genome are able to alter gene expression without modifying the underlying DNA sequence. The epigenome serves as an interface for environmental signals, which are able to \u201cget under the skin\u201d to influence health and aging. A number of the molecular mechanisms involved in the aging process have been identified, although few aging phenotypes have been definitively traced to their underlying molecular causes thus far. In this review, we discuss variation in human biological aging and the epigenome's role in promoting heterogeneity in human longevity and healthspan.", "generated_text": "Aging is a complex process influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in epigenetics have shed light on how environmental exposures can modify gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, thereby affecting the pace of human aging. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and pollution, and epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA. The epigenetic clock, a biomarker of biological age, has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify the impact of these environmental influences on aging. Studies have shown that adverse environmental conditions can accelerate the epigenetic clock, leading to an increased risk of age-related diseases. Conversely, interventions that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce environmental stressors may decelerate the epigenetic clock and extend healthspan. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental factors on aging and improve public health outcomes.", "label": 1}
