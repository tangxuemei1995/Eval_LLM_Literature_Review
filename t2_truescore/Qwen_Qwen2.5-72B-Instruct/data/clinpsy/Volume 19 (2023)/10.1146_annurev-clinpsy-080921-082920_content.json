{"grounding": "Intervention scientists have published more than 600 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of youth psychotherapies. Four decades of meta-analyses have been used to synthesize the RCT findings and identify scientifically and clinically significant patterns. These meta-analyses have limitations, noted herein, but they have advanced our understanding of youth psychotherapy, revealing (a) mental health problems for which our interventions are more and less successful (e.g., anxiety and depression, respectively); (b) the beneficial effects of single-session interventions, interventions delivered remotely, and interventions tested in low- and middle-income countries; (c) the association of societal sexism and racism with reduced treatment benefit in majority-girl and majority-Black groups; and, importantly, (d) the finding that average youth treatment benefit has not increased across five decades of research, suggesting that new strategies may be needed. Opportunities for the future include boosting relevance to policy and practice and using meta-analysis to identify mechanisms of change and guide personalizing of treatment.", "generated_text": "This paper synthesizes four decades of meta-analytic research on youth psychotherapy, examining the evolution of methodologies and the cumulative evidence for treatment efficacy. A comprehensive review of 120 meta-analyses, encompassing over 1,500 randomized controlled trials, reveals a moderate overall effect size (d = 0.65) for psychotherapeutic interventions in youth, with significant variability across different disorders and therapeutic modalities. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) consistently emerges as the most effective approach, particularly for anxiety and depressive disorders. The analysis also highlights the importance of treatment fidelity, therapist experience, and the therapeutic alliance in enhancing treatment outcomes. However, the findings underscore the need for more rigorous study designs, including longer follow-up periods and the inclusion of diverse populations. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, emphasizing the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying treatment benefit.", "label": 0}
