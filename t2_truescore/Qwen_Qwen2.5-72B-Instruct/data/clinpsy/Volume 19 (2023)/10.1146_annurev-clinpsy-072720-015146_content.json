{"grounding": "Racism constitutes a significant risk to the mental health of African American children, adolescents, and emerging adults. This review evaluates recent literature examining ethnic and racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity and spirituality, and family and parenting as racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors that shape the impact of racism on youth mental health. Representative studies, purported mechanisms, and critiques of prior research are presented for each factor. Recent studies of racism and resilience revisit foundational resilience factors from prior research while reflecting new and important advances (e.g., consideration of gender, cultural context, structural racism), providing important insights for the development of prevention and intervention efforts and policy that can alleviate mental health suffering and promote health and mental health equity for African American youth.", "generated_text": "This study examines the role of racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in the mental health of African American youth. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, the research highlights the protective effects of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, and positive family dynamics. Findings indicate that these factors mitigate the adverse impacts of racism and discrimination, fostering psychological well-being and resilience. The study underscores the importance of culturally informed interventions that support these protective mechanisms, particularly in parenting practices and community-based programs. Implications for mental health professionals and policymakers are discussed, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive approaches to address the unique challenges faced by African American youth.", "label": 1}
