{"grounding": "Numerous studies associate childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) with adverse adjustment in the domains of mental health, social, and academic functioning. This review synthesizes this literature and highlights the critical role of child self-regulation in mediating children's adjustment outcomes. We discuss major methodological problems of the field, including failure to consider the effects of prenatal IPV exposure and the limitations of variable-oriented and cross-sectional approaches. Finally, we present a comprehensive theoretical model of the effects of IPV on children's development. This model includes three mechanistic pathways\u2014one that is unique to IPV (maternal representations) and two that are consistent with the effects of other stressors (maternal mental health and physiological functioning). In our model, the effects of these three pathways on child adjustment outcomes are mediated through parenting and child self-regulation. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed in the context of the model.", "generated_text": "This study examines the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, focusing on the impact of prenatal stress and attachment patterns. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that exposure to IPV, particularly during the prenatal period, can lead to adverse outcomes in cognitive, emotional, and social development. Children exposed to IPV are at higher risk for developing insecure attachment styles, which can affect their relationships and mental health throughout life. The findings highlight the critical role of early intervention and support for families experiencing IPV to mitigate these negative effects. Implications for clinical practice and policy are discussed, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address the complex needs of these children and their families.", "label": 1}
