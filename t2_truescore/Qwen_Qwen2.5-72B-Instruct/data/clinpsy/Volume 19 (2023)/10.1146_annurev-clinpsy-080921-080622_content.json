{"grounding": "Acculturation and psychopathology are linked in integrated, interactional, intersectional, and dynamic ways that span different types of intercultural contact, levels of analysis, timescales, and contexts. A developmental psychopathology approach can be useful to explain why, how, and what about psychological acculturation results in later adaptation or maladaptation for acculturating youth and adults. This review applies a conceptual model of acculturation and developmental psychopathology to a widely used framework of acculturation variables producing an Integrated Process Framework of Acculturation Variables (IP-FAV). This new comprehensive framework depicts major predisposing acculturation conditions (why) as well as acculturation orientations and processes (how) that result in adaptation and maladaptation across the life span (what). The IP-FAV is unique in that it integrates both proximal and remote acculturation variables and explicates key acculturation processes to inform research, practice, and policy.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex relationship between acculturation and psychopathology among immigrants and refugees, distinguishing between proximal and remote acculturation processes. Proximal acculturation, involving direct interactions with the host culture, is associated with increased stress and anxiety, while remote acculturation, characterized by indirect exposure through media and technology, may offer protective factors. Developmental psychopathology frameworks are applied to understand how these processes interact with individual resilience and vulnerability. The findings suggest that while globalization facilitates remote acculturation, it also exacerbates the psychological challenges faced by newcomers. Implications for mental health interventions and policy are discussed, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive support systems that address both the immediate and long-term impacts of acculturation.", "label": 0}
