{"grounding": "This review updates and extends Gone & Trimble's (2012) prior review of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) mental health. First, it defines AI/AN populations in the USA, with an explanation of the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations as primary for categorizing this population. Second, it presents an updated summary of what is known about AI/AN mental health, with careful notation of recurrent findings concerning community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide. Third, this article reviews key literature about AI/AN community mental health services appearing since 2010, including six randomized controlled trials of recognizable mental health treatments. Finally, it reimagines the AI/AN mental health enterprise in response to an \u201calter-Native psy-ence,\u201d which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the integration of evidence-based practices (EBPs) with culturally adapted, or 'alter-Native psy-ence,' approaches in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Postcolonial anomie, characterized by social dislocation and cultural disruption, exacerbates mental health disparities among AI/AN populations. While EBPs offer standardized, empirically validated interventions, they often fail to address the unique cultural and historical contexts of AI/AN communities. Indigenized therapies, which incorporate traditional healing practices and cultural values, have shown promise in enhancing treatment engagement and outcomes. This review synthesizes the literature on the effectiveness of combining EBPs with alter-Native psy-ence, highlighting the importance of community-based participatory research and culturally responsive care. The findings suggest that a hybrid approach, which respects and integrates Indigenous knowledge systems, can better address the mental health needs of AI/AN communities, fostering resilience and healing.", "label": 1}
