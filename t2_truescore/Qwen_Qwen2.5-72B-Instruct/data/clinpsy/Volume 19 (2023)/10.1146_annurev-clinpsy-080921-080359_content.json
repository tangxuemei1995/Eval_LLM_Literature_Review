{"grounding": "The number of refugees and internally displaced people in 2022 is the largest since World War II, and meta-analyses demonstrate that these people experience elevated rates of mental health problems. This review focuses on the role of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee mental health and includes current knowledge of the prevalence of PTSD, risk factors, and apparent differences that exist between PTSD in refugee populations and PTSD in other populations. An emerging literature on understanding mechanisms of PTSD encompasses neural, cognitive, and social processes, which indicate that these factors may not function exactly as they have functioned previously in other PTSD populations. This review recognizes the numerous debates in the literature on PTSD in refugees, including those on such issues as the conceptualization of mental health and the applicability of the PTSD diagnosis across cultures, as well as the challenge of treating PTSD in low- and middle-income countries that lack mental health resources to offer standard PTSD treatments.", "generated_text": "This review examines the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among refugees, a population disproportionately affected by traumatic events. Studies indicate that up to 30% of refugees experience PTSD, often compounded by ongoing stressors such as displacement and socioeconomic instability. The review highlights the role of pre-migration trauma, including war, persecution, and loss, as significant risk factors. Additionally, post-migration factors such as social isolation and cultural dislocation exacerbate symptoms. Mechanisms underlying PTSD in refugees involve neurobiological alterations, cognitive processing, and social determinants. Effective interventions include trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and community-based support programs. However, access to these treatments remains limited, particularly in low-resource settings. Future research should focus on culturally adapted interventions and the long-term outcomes of PTSD in refugee populations. This review underscores the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to address the mental health needs of refugees.", "label": 1}
