{"grounding": "Parental incarceration is a significant, inequitably distributed form of adversity that affects millions of US children and increases their risk for emotional and behavioral problems. An emerging body of research also indicates, however, that children exhibit resilience in the context of parental incarceration. In this article, we review evidence regarding the adverse implications of parental incarceration for children's adjustment and consider factors that account for these consequences with special attention to naturally occurring processes and interventions that may mitigate risk and contribute to positive youth development. We also offer a critical reframing of resilience research and argue that (a) scholars should adopt more contextualized approaches to the study of resilience that are sensitive to intersecting inequalities and (b) resilience research and practice should be conceptualized as important complements to, rather than substitutes for, social and institutional change. We conclude by offering social justice\u2013informed recommendations for future research and practice.", "generated_text": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of parental incarceration on children, integrating perspectives from psychology, sociology, and criminology. By employing an intersectional lens, the study highlights how factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and community context intersect to shape the experiences of these children. The review identifies key risk factors, including economic hardship, social stigma, and disrupted family relationships, while also exploring protective factors that foster resilience, such as supportive caregiving and community resources. The paper critically reframes the discourse around children with incarcerated parents, emphasizing the need for holistic, equity-focused interventions that address systemic inequalities and promote social justice. Recommendations for future research and practice are provided, underscoring the importance of collaborative, community-based approaches to support these vulnerable youth.", "label": 0}
