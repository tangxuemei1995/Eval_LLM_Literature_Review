{"grounding": "Over the past decade, behavioral interventions have become increasingly recognized and recommended as effective first-line therapies for treating individuals with tic disorders. In this article, we describe a basic theoretical and conceptual framework through which the reader can understand the application of these interventions for treating tics. The three primary behavioral interventions for tics with the strongest empirical support (habit reversal, Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, and exposure and response prevention) are described. Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments is summarized along with a discussion of the research evaluating the delivery of these treatments in different formats and modalities. The article closes with a review of the possible mechanisms of change underlying behavioral interventions for tics and areas for future research.", "generated_text": "Tic disorders, including Tourette disorder, significantly impact the quality of life for both children and adults. This review examines the efficacy of behavioral interventions, particularly habit reversal training (HRT) and comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT), in managing tic symptoms. HRT and CBIT have been shown to reduce tic frequency and severity through techniques such as awareness training, competing response training, and exposure. Recent studies highlight the long-term benefits of these interventions, with sustained improvements observed up to one year post-treatment. Additionally, the integration of exposure therapy has further enhanced outcomes by addressing the anxiety and stress that often accompany tic disorders. These findings underscore the importance of behavioral interventions as a first-line treatment for tic disorders, offering a non-pharmacological alternative with minimal side effects.", "label": 1}
