{"grounding": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) children and adolescents are an increasingly visible yet highly stigmatized group. These youth experience more psychological distress than not only their cisgender, heterosexual peers but also their cisgender, sexual minority peers. In this review, we document these mental health disparities and discuss potential explanations for them using a minority stress framework. We also discuss factors that may increase and decrease TGD youth's vulnerability to psychological distress. Further, we review interventions, including gender-affirming medical care, that may improve mental health in TGD youth. We conclude by discussing limitations of current research and suggestions for the future.", "generated_text": "This study examines the mental health challenges faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth, a population disproportionately affected by psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the study highlights the critical role of social support, family acceptance, and access to gender-affirming care in mitigating these risks. Data from multiple longitudinal studies and surveys indicate that TGD youth who experience supportive environments exhibit significantly better mental health outcomes. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and policies to improve the well-being of TGD youth.", "label": 1}
