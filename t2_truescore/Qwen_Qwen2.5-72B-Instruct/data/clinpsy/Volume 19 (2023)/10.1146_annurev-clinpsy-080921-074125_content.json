{"grounding": "While boys and men have historically been underrepresented in eating disorder research, increasing interest and research during the twenty-first century have contributed important knowledge to the field. In this article, we review the epidemiology of eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia (the pathological pursuit of muscularity) in boys and men; specific groups of men at increased risk for eating disorders; sociocultural, psychological, and biological vulnerability factors; and male-specific assessment measures. We also provide an overview of current research on eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia prevention efforts, treatment outcomes, and mortality risk in samples of boys and men. Priorities for future research are including boys and men in epidemiological studies to track changes in incidence, identifying (neuro)biological factors contributing to risk, eliminating barriers to treatment access and utilization, and refining male-specific prevention and treatment efforts.", "generated_text": "Eating disorders (EDs) are often perceived as predominantly affecting females; however, recent epidemiological studies highlight a significant and growing prevalence among boys and men. This review synthesizes current literature on the epidemiology, intervention strategies, and outcomes of EDs in male populations. Data indicate that while the incidence is lower compared to females, the severity and comorbidity rates are comparable. Key risk factors include body image dissatisfaction, social pressures, and mental health issues. Interventions tailored to male-specific concerns, such as muscle dysmorphia, have shown promising outcomes, emphasizing the need for gender-sensitive approaches in treatment. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term outcomes and to develop more effective, targeted interventions for boys and men with EDs.", "label": 1}
