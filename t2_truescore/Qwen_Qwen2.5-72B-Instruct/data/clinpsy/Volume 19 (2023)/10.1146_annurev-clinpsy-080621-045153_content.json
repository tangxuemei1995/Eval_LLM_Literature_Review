{"grounding": "Research conducted over the past several decades has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the immune system in neural and psychological development and function across the life span. Our goal in this review is to introduce this dynamic area of research to a psychological audience and highlight its relevance for clinical psychology. We begin by introducing the basic physiology of immune-to-brain signaling and the neuroimmune network, focusing on inflammation. Drawing from preclinical and clinical research, we then examine effects of immune activation on key psychological domains, including positive and negative valence systems, social processes, cognition, and arousal (fatigue, sleep), as well as links with psychological disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia). We also consider psychosocial stress as a critical modulator of neuroimmune activity and focus on early life adversity. Finally, we highlight psychosocial and mind\u2013body interventions that influence the immune system and may promote neuroimmune resilience.", "generated_text": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is an interdisciplinary field that explores the complex interactions between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, and their implications for mental and physical health. This review introduces the mechanisms of immune-to-brain communication, focusing on how psychosocial stress and inflammation can influence neurobiological processes and contribute to the development of mood disorders, particularly depression. Sickness behavior, a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, anhedonia, and social withdrawal, is discussed as a model for understanding the bidirectional relationship between immune activation and psychological distress. The translational potential of PNI research is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of integrating immune markers into clinical assessments and therapeutic interventions to improve patient outcomes. This overview underscores the need for a more holistic approach to mental health, recognizing the critical role of immune function in psychological well-being.", "label": 1}
