{"grounding": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified racism as a serious threat to public health. Structural racism is a fundamental cause of inequity within interconnected institutions and the social environments in which we live and develop. This review illustrates how these ethnoracial inequities impact risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. Black and Latinx populations are more likely than White populations to report psychotic experiences in the United States due to social determining factors such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. Unless we dismantle these discriminatory structures, the chronic stress and biological consequences of this race-based stress and trauma will impact the next generation's risk for psychosis directly, and indirectly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions show promise in improving prognosis, but coordinated care and other treatments still need to be more accessible and address the racism-specific adversities many Black and Latinx people face in their neighborhoods and social environments.", "generated_text": "This study explores the complex interplay between racism and social determinants in the development of psychosis. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine how racial discrimination, neighborhood factors, and structural racism contribute to the onset and progression of psychotic experiences. Our findings indicate that individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by these social determinants, which can exacerbate psychological stress and increase the risk of early psychosis. The study highlights the critical role of community-level interventions and policy changes to address structural inequalities and mitigate the adverse mental health outcomes associated with racism. By integrating these insights, mental health professionals can develop more culturally sensitive and effective strategies to support at-risk populations.", "label": 1}
