{"grounding": "For many people worldwide, supernatural beliefs and attributions\u2014those focused on God, the devil, demons, spirits, an afterlife, karma, or fate\u2014are part of everyday life. Although not widely studied in clinical psychology, these beliefs and attributions are a key part of human diversity. This article provides a broad overview of research on supernatural beliefs and attributions with special attention to their psychological relevance: They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, psychopathology signals, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Although supernatural attributions sometimes involve dramatic experiences seen to violate natural laws, people more commonly think of supernatural entities working indirectly through natural events. A whole host of factors can lead people to make supernatural attributions, including contextual factors, specific beliefs, psychopathology, cognitive styles and personality, and social and cultural influences. Our aim is to provide clinical psychologists with an entry point into this rich, fascinating, and often overlooked literature.", "generated_text": "This study explores the prevalence and psychological underpinnings of supernatural attributions, focusing on how individuals perceive God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma as causes of significant life events. Drawing from a diverse sample of participants, the research employs both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the relationship between supernatural beliefs, paranormal experiences, and spiritual struggles. Findings indicate that individuals with higher levels of religious involvement and those who have experienced anomalous phenomena are more likely to attribute events to supernatural causes. The study also highlights the role of cognitive and emotional factors in shaping these attributions, suggesting that spiritual experiences and personal crises can intensify the tendency to seek supernatural explanations. Implications for understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying supernatural beliefs and their impact on mental health and well-being are discussed.", "label": 1}
