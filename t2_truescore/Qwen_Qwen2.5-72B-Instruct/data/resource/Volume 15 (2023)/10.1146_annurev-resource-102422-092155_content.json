{"grounding": "The Annual Review of Resource Economics presents Professor Sir Partha Dasgupta in conversation with economist Dr. David Zilberman. In the conversation, we follow Sir Partha's life from his childhood in Bangladesh, where his father was a distinguished economist, to his childhood and undergraduate studies in India, his graduate studies in England, and his fascinating academic career, mostly in Cambridge, UK. We discuss Sir Partha's seminal contributions to multiple fields. He was among the founders of modern resource economics and the emerging multidisciplinary field of ecological economics. He also played a fundamental role in establishing the venues and agenda for research on the environment and development, led initiatives to incorporate nature into national accounting, and pioneered analysis of the economics of population growth and the foundation of a just society. We also learn about Sir Partha's family and life, his collaboration and perspective on leading scholars, and his vision for economics, science, and humanity.", "generated_text": "Sir Partha Dasgupta, a distinguished economist, has made seminal contributions to the fields of environmental and development economics. His work emphasizes the interplay between economic growth, resource depletion, and environmental sustainability. In this autobiographical account, Dasgupta reflects on his academic journey, highlighting key research milestones and the evolution of his thinking on critical issues such as the measurement of inclusive wealth, the role of natural capital in economic development, and the ethical dimensions of intergenerational equity. Dasgupta\u2019s insights into the complexities of sustainable development have influenced policy and academic discourse globally. He advocates for a holistic approach that integrates ecological, social, and economic factors to address the pressing challenges of our time, including climate change and biodiversity loss. This reflection not only provides a personal perspective on his contributions but also offers valuable lessons for future generations of economists and policymakers.", "label": 1}
