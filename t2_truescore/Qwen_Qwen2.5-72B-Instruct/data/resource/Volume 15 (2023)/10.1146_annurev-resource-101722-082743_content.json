{"grounding": "Identifying mechanisms of real-life human decision-making is central to inform effective, human-centric public policy. Here, we report larger trends and synthesize preliminary lessons from behavioral economic and neuro-economic investigations focusing on environmental values. We review the currently available evidence at different levels of granularity, from insights into how individuals value natural resources (individual level), evidence from work on group externalities, common pool resources, and social norms (social group level) to the study of incentives, policies, and their impact (institutional level). At each level, we identify viable directions for future scientific research and actionable items for policy-makers. Coupled with new technological and methodological advances, we suggest that behavioral economic and neuroeconomic insights may inform an effective strategy to optimize environmental resources. We conclude that the time is ripe for action to enrich policies with scientifically grounded insights, making an impact in the interest of current and future generations.", "generated_text": "This study integrates insights from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics to explore the underlying mechanisms of individual decision-making regarding environmental values and the management of common pool resources. By employing a combination of experimental economic games and neuroimaging techniques, we investigate how cognitive biases, social preferences, and neural activity influence decisions that impact environmental sustainability. Our findings reveal that individuals exhibit a tendency to overexploit resources due to present-biased preferences and limited empathy for future generations. However, social norms and information interventions can significantly enhance cooperative behavior. Neuroimaging data indicate that the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in mediating these decisions, with increased activation associated with more sustainable choices. These results have important implications for the design of policies aimed at promoting environmental stewardship and sustainable resource management.", "label": 0}
