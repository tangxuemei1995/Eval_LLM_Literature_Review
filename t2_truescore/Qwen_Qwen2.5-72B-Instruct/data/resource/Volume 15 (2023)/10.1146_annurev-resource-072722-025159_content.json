{"grounding": "In 2015, the United Nations and the G20 put food loss and food waste on the global agenda. While progress has been made since then, the scale of the problem persists because food loss and food waste are measured together, not separately. The paucity of data also poses a challenge. This article reviews the measurements, causes, and determinants of food loss as well as the interventions to reduce it. The review finds that food loss is considered in isolation, even though it is one of the causes and results of how agrifood systems function. The review calls for improved microdata collection and standardized measurements to separate food loss from food waste. Such efforts would help integrate feedback loops and cascading effects across the value chain with agrifood systems to identify intervention hot spots, trade-offs, and synergies of interventions as well as the effects of food loss reduction on socioeconomic, environmental, and food security goals.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on food losses within agrifood systems, focusing on the measurement, determinants, and interventions to mitigate these losses. Food loss, distinct from food waste, occurs primarily in the early stages of the value chain, from production to processing. The review highlights the significant variability in loss rates across different commodities and regions, influenced by factors such as climate, infrastructure, and market access. Key determinants include post-harvest handling practices, storage conditions, and transportation efficiency. The paper also discusses the impact of food losses on food security and economic outcomes, emphasizing the need for context-specific interventions. Successful strategies include improved storage technologies, better market linkages, and policy support. However, challenges remain in accurately measuring and monitoring losses, particularly in developing countries. This review underscores the importance of a systems approach to address food losses, integrating multiple stakeholders and leveraging technological advancements to enhance the resilience and sustainability of agrifood systems.", "label": 1}
