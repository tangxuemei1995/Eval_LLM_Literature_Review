{"grounding": "This review evaluates three micro and three macro estimation approaches to determine whether unrealistic differences exist in estimating the size of nonobserved/shadow economies. While some macro-MIMIC estimates are higher than estimates using the statistical discrepancy approach, when adjusting for double-counting, MIMIC approaches provide similar results. Macro approaches usually cover not only typical shadow economy activities, but also voluntary work, do-it-yourself activities, and classical crime activities; by nature, macro approaches will lead to higher and more accurate estimates than micro approaches. However, if certain adjustments are made, the estimated size of the shadow economy using the MIMIC approach comes close to the size of the shadow economy indicated by micro survey approaches. Hence, claims that macro approaches are unrealistically high and rely on unrealistic assumptions must be reconsidered.", "generated_text": "This study investigates whether different estimation methods produce significant and implausible variations in the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. Utilizing a comparative analysis of the MIMIC (Multiple Indicators, Multiple Causes) estimation approaches, micro survey approach, and the consumption-income gap approach, we assess the consistency and reliability of these methods. Our preliminary findings suggest that while the MIMIC and micro survey approaches yield relatively consistent estimates, the consumption-income gap approach often overestimates the size of the shadow economy. This discrepancy highlights the importance of methodological considerations in accurately measuring the shadow economy, which is crucial for policy-making and economic planning. The study underscores the need for further research to refine and standardize estimation techniques.", "label": 1}
