{"grounding": "Traditionally, competition law and practice serve to preserve competition, with a focus on the maximization of consumer welfare. This has been criticized as conflicting with society's overarching goal of achieving greater (environmental) sustainability. Consequently, various jurisdictions have recently reformed their laws and guidance allowing them to account for sustainability benefits in the assessment of cooperation between competitors, with potentially considerable implications for how firms can jointly develop and introduce more sustainable technologies and products. This has opened a new research frontier in the long-standing tradition of marrying the theory of industrial organization with the field of environmental and resource economics. The consideration of sustainability benefits in competition analysis also requires both the transfer and adaptation of measurement techniques. We summarize recent developments and sketch potential research opportunities.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, focusing on the role of antitrust laws in facilitating or hindering sustainability agreements among firms. Through a comprehensive analysis of industrial organization principles, the study examines how cooperation and firm green preferences can be aligned with competitive market dynamics. It highlights the potential for competition authorities to support sustainable practices without compromising market efficiency. The research identifies key conditions under which sustainability agreements can enhance environmental outcomes while maintaining competitive integrity, offering policy recommendations for fostering a balanced approach to competition and environmental protection.", "label": 0}
