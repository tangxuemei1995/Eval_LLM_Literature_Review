{"grounding": "Agroecology is often considered as the ultimate and most comprehensive solution to the many challenges of the agricultural and food system, also referred to as the agri-food system. This review investigates to what extent agroecology can become the mainstream model for transforming agriculture toward more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems within the given economic and political context. We find that enhancing agroecology will require a fully integrated multiscale systems approach from farm to region to globe. The approach must consider relevant processes and relationships, actors and stakeholders as well as drivers, sustainability indicators, and the respective assessment methods across all scales. Giving specific attention to drivers related to economy, technology, and policy we point out that agroecology needs to be economically viable for farmers and other food system actors. In particular, new and emerging technologies related to digitalization and breeding should be given more consideration in agroecological transformation. We stress the need for an analytical and operational framework and adequate multiscale policy design and suggest six areas of needed attention to support the large-scale adoption of agroecology.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the role of agroecology in fostering a sustainable agriculture and food system, emphasizing the transition from local solutions to large-scale adoption. Agroecology, which integrates ecological principles with agricultural practices, offers a promising framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, and social equity. The study examines multiactor approaches, involving farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers, to facilitate the adoption of agroecological practices across multiple scales. It highlights the importance of agricultural and food policies in supporting this transformation, particularly in the context of emerging technologies that can enhance the efficiency and resilience of agroecological systems. Case studies from diverse regions illustrate the potential of agroecology to improve soil health, biodiversity, and farm productivity while reducing environmental impacts. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy interventions and research priorities to accelerate the widespread implementation of agroecological practices, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable food system globally.", "label": 1}
