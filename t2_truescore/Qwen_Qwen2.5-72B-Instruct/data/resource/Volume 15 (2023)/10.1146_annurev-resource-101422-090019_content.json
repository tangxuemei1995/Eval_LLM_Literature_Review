{"grounding": "More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production, a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning. The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.", "generated_text": "This study examines the economic implications of crop residue management practices, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for smallholder farmers. The analysis integrates data on crop biomass utilization, residue burning, and the adoption of alternative technologies. Key findings highlight the significant environmental effects of residue burning, including contributions to climate change and local air pollution. The study also assesses the economic benefits and barriers to adopting sustainable residue management practices, such as composting and bioenergy production. Results indicate that while initial costs and lack of awareness pose significant hurdles, policy support and technological innovations can enhance the adoption of these practices, leading to improved environmental outcomes and economic benefits for smallholder farmers.", "label": 0}
