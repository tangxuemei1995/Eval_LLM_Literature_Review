{"grounding": "This article reviews the literature on the financial sector impacts of natural disasters and physical climate change risks, covering banking, insurance, stock markets, bond markets, and international financial flows. Most studies have applied statistical approaches to historical data from developed countries to identify these impacts, while some have also used theoretical and computational modeling to assess future risks under climate change scenarios. The findings show that natural disasters and climate change risks generally lower insurer profitability and risk-sharing capacity, bank stability and credit supply, returns and stability of stock and bond markets, foreign direct investment inflows, and international lending. Factors such as income levels, rigorous financial regulations, capital abundance, market diversification, and adaptation strategies mitigate the negative effects. Natural disasters increase remittance inflows and financial assistance to low- and middle-income countries. We recommend future research on forward-looking computational modeling to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers. Future research should also consider hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to more comprehensively assess the economic effects of natural disasters in general and for vulnerable countries in particular.", "generated_text": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of climate change-related risks on the financial sector, focusing on banking, insurance, and financial markets. Climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of natural disasters, posing significant financial and operational challenges. Banks face increased credit risk due to the potential default of borrowers in vulnerable regions, while insurance companies encounter higher claims and underwriting losses. Financial markets are also affected, with climate-related events leading to increased volatility and the potential for systemic risk. The review highlights the need for robust risk management strategies, including stress testing and scenario analysis, to assess and mitigate these risks. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to incorporate climate risk considerations, emphasizing the importance of transparency and disclosure. The financial sector's response to climate change is critical not only for its own stability but also for the broader economy's resilience. This paper synthesizes existing literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research and identifies key areas for future investigation.", "label": 1}
