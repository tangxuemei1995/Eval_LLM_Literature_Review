{"grounding": "R&D is slow magic. It takes many years before research investments begin to affect productivity, but then they can affect productivity for a long time. Many economists get this wrong. Here, we revisit the conceptual foundations for R&D lag models used to represent the temporal links between research investments and impact, review prevalent practice, and document and discuss a range of evidence on R&D lags in agriculture and other industries. Our theory and evidence consistently support the use of longer lags with a different overall lag profile than is typically imposed in studies of industrial R&D and government compilations of R&D knowledge stocks. Many studies systematically fail to recognize the many years of investment and effort typically required to create a new technology and bring it to market and the subsequent years as the technology is diffused and adopted. Consequential distortions in the measures and economic understanding are implied.", "generated_text": "This study examines the differences in R&D lag models between the agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the dynamics of knowledge stocks and flows. By analyzing the adoption and diffusion processes of technological innovations, we identify key factors that contribute to the slower pace of technological change in agriculture compared to industry. The research employs a comprehensive dataset spanning several decades and utilizes econometric models to quantify the impact of R&D investments on productivity gains. Findings suggest that the agricultural sector faces unique challenges, such as longer development cycles and greater dependency on environmental conditions, which contribute to extended R&D lags. Policy implications are discussed, emphasizing the need for targeted support to accelerate innovation and adoption in agriculture.", "label": 1}
