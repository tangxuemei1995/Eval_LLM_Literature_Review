{"grounding": "This article reviews recent economic studies on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity. The negative effects of extreme temperatures are widespread, and the magnitudes of the impact differ across social and economic factors. In addition to physical outputs, extreme temperatures also impair mental productivity, including cognition and learning. In utero exposure to extreme temperatures has profound effects on human development. Although the literature has detected various adaptation strategies, the conclusions are mixed. We discuss some limitations of existing studies and propose several directions for future research.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of temperature on labor and mental productivity, considering adaptation and early-life exposure. Using a comprehensive dataset, we find that extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, significantly reduce productivity, with greater adverse effects in regions with less adaptive capacity. Early-life exposure to temperature extremes also influences long-term productivity. Distributional effects highlight disparities, with vulnerable populations experiencing more pronounced impacts. Policy interventions aimed at adaptation and resilience can mitigate these effects.", "label": 0}
