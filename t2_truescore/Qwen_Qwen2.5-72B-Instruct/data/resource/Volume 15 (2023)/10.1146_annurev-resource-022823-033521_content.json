{"grounding": "Based on an extensive literature review and publicly available data, this article provides insights into the differences in prevalence, sociodemographics, contributing factors, socioeconomic consequences, health effects, and public policies related to obesity between developed and developing countries. Most importantly, it explores the relationship between obesity and life expectancy and identifies potential mechanisms through which obesity affects mortality, highlighting the differences between developed and developing countries and by gender. It also examines how the associations between obesity and life expectancy differ at the population level compared with the individual level. The evidence shows a negative association between obesity and longevity, as well as an increased risk of various diseases with the rising rates of obesity. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing countries and by gender. The article also discusses the effectiveness of various policies adopted to address obesity and provides suggestions to address obesity problems and improve health and well-being in these countries.", "generated_text": "This study examines the heterogeneous impacts of obesity on life expectancy across developed and developing countries, integrating data from global health surveys and mortality statistics. Obesity, a significant public health issue, is associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy. However, the magnitude of this impact varies significantly between different economic contexts. In developed countries, where obesity rates are generally higher, the adverse effects on life expectancy are more pronounced due to the prevalence of obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Conversely, in developing countries, the relationship is more complex, influenced by factors such as undernutrition, infectious diseases, and limited healthcare access. The analysis reveals that while obesity reduces life expectancy in both contexts, the reduction is more severe in developed countries. Policy implications suggest a need for tailored interventions that address the specific health challenges and resource constraints of each region to mitigate the impact of obesity on life expectancy.", "label": 0}
