{"grounding": "Having experienced low prices for about a decade, the European Union Emissions Trading System has been supplemented with the market stability reserve (MSR) that adjusts the supply of allowances to market outcomes. We critically review the literature assessing the performance of the MSR against several policy objectives. In doing so, we cover both conceptual aspects and quantitative assessments. We conclude by pointing out important policy implications and open issues for further research.", "generated_text": "This paper critically reviews the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) within the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), assessing its effectiveness in stabilizing carbon prices and addressing surplus allowances. The analysis highlights the MSR's role in overlapping climate policies and its impact on market dynamics, suggesting potential improvements to enhance its functionality and alignment with broader climate goals.", "label": 1}
