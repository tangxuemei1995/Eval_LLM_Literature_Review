{"grounding": "Understanding the potential effect of environmental regulation on employment is of broad interest to key stakeholders. Concerns encompass both short- and longer-term effects on workers within the regulated sector, affected communities that already suffer from a lack of employment opportunities, and net employment in the overall economy. We begin our review by presenting a neoclassical microeconomic framework demonstrating how environmental regulations might affect labor demand. We then summarize the main empirical findings from the literature, including sector-specific partial equilibrium estimates and general equilibrium approaches to identifying the employment impacts of regulations. We also briefly describe the literature on how environmental regulations affect labor supply. Finally, we discuss remaining research gaps.", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes the existing literature on the impact of environmental regulations on labor demand, focusing on empirical evidence from various industries and regions. The analysis reveals that while stringent environmental regulations can lead to short-term reductions in employment, the long-term effects are more nuanced. In many cases, the introduction of environmental policies stimulates technological innovation and the creation of green jobs, offsetting initial job losses. The evidence suggests that the net effect on labor demand is context-dependent, influenced by factors such as the industry's adaptability, the regulatory design, and the availability of complementary policies. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of a balanced approach to environmental regulation that considers both environmental and economic objectives.", "label": 1}
