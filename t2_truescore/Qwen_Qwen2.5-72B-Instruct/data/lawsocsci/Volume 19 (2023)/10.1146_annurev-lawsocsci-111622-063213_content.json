{"grounding": "To address issues of bias and discrimination in many areas of social life, scientists have developed a variety of strategies to debias people's minds and reduce discrimination and the disparities that stem from it. A large body of research has documented, however, that debias trainings have short-lived effects on changing patterns of thinking (i.e., they last less than 24 hours) and minimal effects on behaviors. In this article, I argue that such limited effects of one-time trainings are to be expected, given the segregated and stratified social structure we live in that was created by historic and contemporary laws and policies. After explaining the mechanisms through which laws and policies create biased people, I then explain how laws and policies can instead be used as levers to create long-lasting changes in biases.", "generated_text": "This study explores the role of laws and policies in shaping social cognition, particularly in the context of intergroup relations and implicit bias. By examining the impact of desegregation policies and anti-discrimination laws, we investigate how these interventions can either mitigate or exacerbate cognitive biases. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates psychology and law, we analyze empirical data from various social settings, including education and employment. Our findings suggest that while certain policies effectively reduce implicit biases and improve intergroup relations, others may inadvertently reinforce existing cognitive barriers. This research highlights the importance of carefully designed social interventions to promote equitable outcomes and foster more inclusive societies.", "label": 0}
