{"grounding": "This review addresses three questions surrounding authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China. First, what is legality, and does it exist in China's Leninist single-party state? Scholars who characterize the system as order maintenance find the absence of legality. Those employing dual-state and instrumentalist views of law find partial legality. Scholars promoting the notion of bare legality find complete legality. Second, does authoritarian legality strengthen regime legitimacy? Scholars agree that the state seeks legitimation through its embrace of authoritarian legality. Empirical research tests this claim. Third, is China in transition from plan to market, and what is the role of law in state capitalism? The teleology of the transition paradigm overlooks illiberal underpinnings of property rights and factor markets. Answers to these questions help explain regime resilience, economic growth, economic crisis, and inequality in China. Both the institution of the dual state and the perpetuation of plan elements reinforce state power.", "generated_text": "This study examines the interplay between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in contemporary China, focusing on the dual state structure that balances formal legal institutions with informal political mechanisms. The research highlights how the Chinese state has managed to foster economic growth and market development while maintaining tight political control. By analyzing property rights, land, and labor markets, the study reveals that the rule of law in China is selectively applied to support state objectives and protect state-owned enterprises. The dual state framework allows for the coexistence of market mechanisms and authoritarian governance, creating a unique model of state capitalism. This model has implications for understanding the role of legal institutions in non-democratic settings and the potential for economic development under authoritarian regimes.", "label": 1}
