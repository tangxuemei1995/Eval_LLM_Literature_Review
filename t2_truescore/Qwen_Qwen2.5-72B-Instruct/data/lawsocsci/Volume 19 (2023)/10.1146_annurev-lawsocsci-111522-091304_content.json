{"grounding": "International agreements on Intellectual Property (IP) have proven to be a good example to study global lawmaking. Beginning by looking at the 1990s Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and into the negotiation and implementation of regional and national trade agreements, this article reflects on the intricate relationship between international IP agreements and public health. The comprehensive analysis of these international rules and their effect provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping health policies. Building upon the IP case, we categorize existing scholarship on global lawmaking into three methodological approaches: (a) methodological internationalism, (b) methodological nationalism, and (c) the interplay between domestic and international factors. We close with a call for researchers to advocate and integrate into their methods a co-constitutive approach that considers the simultaneous shaping of domestic and international elements.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the methodologies and frameworks necessary for studying global lawmaking, particularly focusing on the domains of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies. By critiquing methodological nationalism, the research highlights the importance of a transnational approach to understanding how global legal norms are shaped and implemented. The analysis draws on case studies of international agreements, such as the TRIPS Agreement and the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations, to illustrate the complex interplay between state and non-state actors in the global legal landscape. The findings suggest that effective global lawmaking requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse interests and power dynamics at play, and the paper offers recommendations for future research to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications in global governance.", "label": 1}
