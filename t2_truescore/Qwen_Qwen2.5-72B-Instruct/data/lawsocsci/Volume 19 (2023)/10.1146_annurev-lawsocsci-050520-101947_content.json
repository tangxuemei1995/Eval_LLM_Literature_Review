{"grounding": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many complexities involved in using data and advanced technologies to help resolve public health emergencies. These complexities highlight the need to embrace a broader framework of data governance with three foundational questions: (a) who decides about data flows, (b) on what basis, and (c) with what accountability and oversight. These questions can accommodate the issues that have arisen in the literature regarding new types of data harms. However, these questions also foreground important issues of power, authority, and legitimacy. Data governance can provide an organizing normative framework to address emerging data themes including access to data, collective decision making, data intermediaries, data sovereignty, design and digital infrastructure, regulatory technologies, the rule of law, and social trust and license. The pandemic experience with contact tracing apps, in particular, showed the many unresolved governance challenges.", "generated_text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of data in managing public health crises, yet it has also exposed significant gaps in data governance frameworks. This study examines the challenges and opportunities in leveraging data, particularly through artificial intelligence (AI) and contact tracing technologies, while ensuring privacy and trust. By analyzing existing data governance models and their application during the pandemic, the research highlights the need for a robust, privacy-by-design approach. The findings suggest that integrating ethical considerations and transparent data practices can enhance public trust and the effectiveness of AI-driven solutions in pandemic response. The implications of this study are crucial for policymakers and technologists aiming to balance innovation with individual privacy rights.", "label": 1}
