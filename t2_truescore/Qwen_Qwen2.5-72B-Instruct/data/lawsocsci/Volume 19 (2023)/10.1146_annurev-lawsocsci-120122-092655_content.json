The causes of such growth in jail populations are difficult to pinpoint, but some are more readily apparent: Fear over rising crime rates, judicial reluctance to release accused persons, and monetary burdens associated with release have all contributed to increased detention pretrial across criminal legal systems in the United States. This article examines various pretrial detention reform efforts and highlights the need for greater research in the area.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the evolving landscape of pretrial detention reform, focusing on recent legislative and judicial efforts to reduce reliance on cash bail and address disparities in the criminal justice system.
