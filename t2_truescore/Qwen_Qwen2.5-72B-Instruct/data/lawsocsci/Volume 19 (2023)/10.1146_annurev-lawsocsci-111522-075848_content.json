{"grounding": "A significant body of social science research is now working with the concept of refeudalization\u2014as well as related terms such as neo-feudalism and neo-medievalism\u2014to analyze a variety of contemporary developments. The social science scholars who use these terms challenge an oversimplified modernization model that regards power relations such as serfdom, vassalage, suzerainty, and fiefdom as merely historical relics. The refeudalization process has significant legal dimensions, which this review outlines to draw out the central implications of the concept of refeudalization for an adequate understanding of current developments in law, society, and politics. Topics covered include the changing relationship between public and private law; the privatization of public authority and responsibilities; the territorial unbundling of sovereignty and the tendency toward multiple, overlapping authorities and jurisdictions; the contractualization of groups and political units as well as individuals; and the changing relationship between sovereignty and political representation.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the phenomenon of refeudalization in contemporary legal systems, marking a shift from the rule of law towards a system characterized by ties of allegiance. It examines how the erosion of traditional democratic institutions and the rise of contractualization in governance have led to a reconfiguration of sovereignty and representation. Through a comparative analysis of various legal frameworks, the study highlights the ways in which modern legal practices are increasingly resembling feudal structures, where personal loyalty and patronage play a pivotal role. The implications of this shift for democratic accountability and the protection of individual rights are critically assessed, suggesting that refeudalization poses significant challenges to the foundational principles of modern legal and political systems.", "label": 0}
