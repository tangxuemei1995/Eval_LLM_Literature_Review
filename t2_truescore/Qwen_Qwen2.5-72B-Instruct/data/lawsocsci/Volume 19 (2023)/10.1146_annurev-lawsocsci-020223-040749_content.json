{"grounding": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a salient but polarizing issue of recent times. Actors around the world are engaged in building a governance regime around it. What exactly the \u201cit\u201d is that is being governed, how, by who, and why\u2014these are all less clear. In this review, we attempt to shine some light on those questions, considering literature on AI, the governance of computing, and regulation and governance more broadly. We take critical stock of the different modalities of the global governance of AI that have been emerging, such as ethical councils, industry governance, contracts and licensing, standards, international agreements, and domestic legislation with extraterritorial impact. Considering these, we examine selected rationales and tensions that underpin them, drawing attention to the interests and ideas driving these different modalities. As these regimes become clearer and more stable, we urge those engaging with or studying the global governance of AI to constantly ask the important question of all global governance regimes: Who benefits?", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and global governance, focusing on the modalities, rationales, and tensions that arise from the integration of AI into international regulatory frameworks. As AI technologies, including machine learning algorithms, become increasingly pervasive, they present both opportunities and challenges for global governance. The paper examines how algorithmic regulation can enhance efficiency and transparency in governance processes, while also highlighting the risks associated with bias, accountability, and the potential for exacerbating global inequalities. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, the research identifies key tensions between the need for robust AI regulation and the sovereignty of nations, as well as the ethical implications of delegating decision-making to automated systems. The findings suggest that a balanced approach, combining international cooperation with localized governance strategies, is essential for harnessing the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.", "label": 1}
