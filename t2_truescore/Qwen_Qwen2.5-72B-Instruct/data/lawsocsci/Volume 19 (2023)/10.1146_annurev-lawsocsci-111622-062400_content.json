{"grounding": "This review examines the historical and contemporary factors driving immigrant worker precarity and the central role of race in achieving worker justice. We build from the framework of racial capitalism and historicize the legacies of African enslavement and Indigenous dispossession, which have cemented an exclusionary economic system in the United States and globally. We consider how racism and colonial legacies create migrant displacement and shape the experiences of immigrant workers. We also detail how racism permeates the immigration bureaucracy, driving migrant worker precarity. The traditional labor movement has played an important role in closing this gap, but increasingly so have worker centers and the immigrant rights movement as a whole. These partnerships have had to navigate coalitional tensions as they build new strategies for realizing immigrant worker rights.", "generated_text": "This study examines the intersection of race and low-wage immigrant labor, highlighting how racialized structures and practices perpetuate inequality and exploitation in the workforce. By centering race in the analysis, the research reveals how systemic racism intersects with immigration policies to marginalize and devalue immigrant workers. The findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the racial dimensions of labor, advocating for policies that address both racial and economic justice. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative data analysis, the study provides evidence of the pervasive impact of racism on immigrant workers' experiences and rights, calling for comprehensive reforms to protect vulnerable populations and promote equitable working conditions.", "label": 1}
