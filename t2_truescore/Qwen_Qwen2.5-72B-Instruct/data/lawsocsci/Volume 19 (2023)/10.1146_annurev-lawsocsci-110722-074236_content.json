{"grounding": "My scholarly career has centered around articulating and testing a model of legitimacy-based law and governance. In recent decades, that model has achieved considerable success in shaping the way legal authority is understood and exercised. At the same time the legitimacy of legal, political, and social institutions and authorities has declined, raising questions about the future viability of a legitimacy-based model. In this review, I discuss the ascension and potential decline of legitimacy-based governance and outline alternative models of authority that may emerge in the twenty-first century. Three issues are addressed: whether there are ways to reinvigorate legitimacy-based law and governance; whether social norms, moral values, or ideologies are viable alternative forms of authority; and whether it is better to accept that no single form of authority works best in all situations and theories should focus on identifying the contingencies under which different forms of authority are most desirable.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the evolving concept of legitimacy in the context of legal authority in the twenty-first century. Drawing on a range of interdisciplinary perspectives, it examines how trust and confidence in legal institutions are shaped by normative alignment between the values of the populace and those embodied in the law. The study highlights the critical role of compliance, cooperation, and engagement as indicators of legitimacy, suggesting that these factors are increasingly influenced by the personal experiences and autobiographies of individuals. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the paper argues that the traditional sources of legitimacy are being challenged by new forms of social and political engagement, necessitating a reevaluation of how legal authority is perceived and maintained in contemporary society.", "label": 0}
