{"grounding": "Feminists have long demonstrated the invisibility of women's reproductive labor, performed in bearing and raising children, maintaining households, and socially sustaining male labor. Every wave of feminist struggle from the late nineteenth century onward has actively queried the inequalities that characterize women's performance of such work, variously referred to as unpaid domestic and care work, domestic labor, or care work. Robust traditions of scholarship on women's unpaid work animate various disciplines, often spilling into political struggles for adequate recognition of this work. As the pandemic has rendered visible once again the reproductive labor of women the world over, this article offers an overview of social reproduction theory, feminist legal theorizations of reproductive labor, and how we might recuperate a rich tradition of theorizing on social reproduction to develop a materialist approach to law's regulation of reproductive labor across the marriage-market spectrum with a view to social and economic justice.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the intersection of social reproduction, unpaid and domestic work, and care within the framework of legal realism and materialist feminism. By examining the legal and economic structures that underpin these forms of labor, the study highlights how the law perpetuates and legitimizes the exploitation and undervaluation of social reproductive work. Through a critical analysis of legal doctrines and policies, the paper argues that the current legal framework fails to recognize and support the essential role of social reproduction in sustaining the economy and society. Drawing on materialist feminist theory, the research proposes a reconceptualization of law and political economy that centers the value and necessity of social reproductive labor, advocating for legal reforms that acknowledge and compensate this work. The findings suggest that a more equitable and sustainable society requires a legal system that integrates the principles of social reproduction and care.", "label": 0}
