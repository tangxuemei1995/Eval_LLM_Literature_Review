{"grounding": "In this review, we explore the impact of technology on US and UK law firms, focusing in particular on the recent machine learning wave of artificial intelligence. Technology has not so far ushered the end of law firms as we know them. Adoption of artificial intelligence/machine learning is in its early stages in the sector, and its impact has been constrained by the scope of use cases for which it is so far well-suited. Technology is nevertheless transforming law firms, in the sense of leading to material changes to their current forms, in the following novel ways: (a) deployment not only in the back office but in the front office, affecting lawyers\u2019 core tasks of advising clients; (b) opportunities for lawyers to pursue alternative career paths with different skill sets across the profession; and (c) emerging options for law firms to adopt business models creating value from nonhuman capital and nonlegal human capital.", "generated_text": "This study explores the extent to which technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is transforming law firms and the broader legal profession. Drawing on a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies from leading law firms, the research examines the integration of AI tools in legal practice, including document review, contract analysis, and predictive analytics. The findings suggest that while AI has the potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy, its impact on the organizational structure and workflow of law firms is more nuanced. The concept of organizational complementarity is introduced to explain how law firms are adapting to new technologies by redefining roles and processes to leverage human expertise alongside AI capabilities. The study concludes that the transformation of law firms is an ongoing process, with significant variations in adoption and impact across different firms and practice areas.", "label": 1}
