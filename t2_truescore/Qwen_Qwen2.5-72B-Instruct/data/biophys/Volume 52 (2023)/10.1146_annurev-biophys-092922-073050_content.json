{"grounding": "Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are critical intracellular immune receptors in both animals and plants. Perception of pathogen-derived or stress-associated signals induces NLR oligomerization to form multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in animals or resistosomes in plants to mediate host immune response. Significant progress has been made during the past few years in our understanding of NLR biology, particularly the structural perspective of these two types of NLR-containing complexes. In this article, we review the latest advances in our structural knowledge of how NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are activated and assembled and how the structural information provides insight into their distinct mechanisms of action. Commonalities and differences between NLR inflammasomes and resistosomes are also discussed.", "generated_text": "NLR proteins play a crucial role in innate immunity through the formation of resistosomes and inflammasomes. These multiprotein complexes are assembled upon ligand recognition, transitioning from an autoinhibited monomeric state to an active oligomeric holoenzyme. The NADase activity of certain NLRs, such as NLRP1, is essential for resistosome function, facilitating the formation of a membrane-permeable channel that mediates immune responses. Structural studies reveal the intricate architecture of these complexes, highlighting the mechanisms of autoinhibition, ligand-induced activation, and the assembly of the resistosome channel. Understanding these processes is vital for elucidating the regulation of innate immune responses and the development of therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
