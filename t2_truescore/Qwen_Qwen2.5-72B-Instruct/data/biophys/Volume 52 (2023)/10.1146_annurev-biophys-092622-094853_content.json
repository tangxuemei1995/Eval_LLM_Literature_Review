{"grounding": "Mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular tasks, such as ATP synthesis, metabolism, metabolite and ion transport, regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, signaling, and inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. The majority of the correct functioning of mitochondria is based on the large electrochemical proton gradient, whose component, the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, is strictly controlled by ion transport through mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, mitochondrial function is critically dependent on ion homeostasis, the disturbance of which leads to abnormal cell functions. Therefore, the discovery of mitochondrial ion channels influencing ion permeability through the membrane has defined a new dimension of the function of ion channels in different cell types, mainly linked to the important tasks that mitochondrial ion channels perform in cell life and death. This review summarizes studies on animal mitochondrial ion channels with special focus on their biophysical properties, molecular identity, and regulation. Additionally, the potential of mitochondrial ion channels as therapeutic targets for several diseases is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular energy production and apoptosis, and their functions are regulated by various ion channels. This review focuses on the diverse mitochondrial ion channels, including calcium, potassium, chloride channels, and the mitochondrial megachannel. Calcium channels, such as the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, are essential for calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism. Potassium channels, like the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel, influence membrane potential and cell survival. Chloride channels, although less studied, are involved in volume regulation and osmotic balance. The mitochondrial megachannel, a large conductance channel, is implicated in the release of apoptogenic factors. Porin, a voltage-dependent anion channel, facilitates the passage of small molecules and ions across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Understanding the structure, function, and regulation of these channels is vital for elucidating mitochondrial physiology and developing therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disorders.", "label": 1}
