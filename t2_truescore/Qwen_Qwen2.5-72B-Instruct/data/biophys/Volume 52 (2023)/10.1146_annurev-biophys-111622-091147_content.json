{"grounding": "Large biomolecular systems are at the heart of many essential cellular processes. The dynamics and energetics of an increasing number of these systems are being studied by computer simulations. Pushing the limits of length- and timescales that can be accessed by current hard- and software has expanded the ability to describe biomolecules at different levels of detail. We focus in this review on the ribosome, which exemplifies the close interplay between experiment and various simulation approaches, as a particularly challenging and prototypic nanomachine that is pivotal to cellular biology due to its central role in translation. We sketch widely used simulation methods and demonstrate how the combination of simulations and experiments advances our understanding of the function of the translation apparatus based on fundamental physics.", "generated_text": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine essential for protein synthesis, presents significant challenges for structural and functional studies due to its size and dynamic nature. This paper explores the integration of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of ribosomal function and the impact of antibiotics. Cryo-EM provides high-resolution structural snapshots, while MD simulations offer insights into the dynamic processes of translation. By combining these approaches, we can better understand the conformational changes and interactions that govern ribosomal activity and the binding modes of antibiotics, which is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Our findings highlight the synergistic power of computational and experimental techniques in advancing the field of structural biology.", "label": 1}
