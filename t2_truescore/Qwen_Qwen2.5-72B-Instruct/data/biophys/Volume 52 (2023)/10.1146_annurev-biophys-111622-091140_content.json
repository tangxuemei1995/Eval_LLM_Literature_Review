{"grounding": "Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have become indispensable tools for the study of biomolecules. In this article, we briefly review the basic methodological details of QM/MM approaches and discuss their applications to various energy transduction problems in biomolecular machines, such as long-range proton transports, fast electron transfers, and mechanochemical coupling. We highlight the particular importance for these applications of balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Using several recent examples, we illustrate the value and limitations of QM/MM methodologies for both ground and excited states, as well as strategies for calibrating them in specific applications. We conclude with brief comments on several areas that can benefit from further efforts to make QM/MM analyses more quantitative and applicable to increasingly complex biological problems.", "generated_text": "This study employs hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods to elucidate the mechanisms of energy transduction in biomolecular machines, focusing on processes such as proton transfers, electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis. By integrating high-level quantum mechanical descriptions of active sites with classical molecular mechanical models of the surrounding environment, we provide detailed insights into the energetics and dynamics of these critical biological processes. Our findings reveal the intricate interplay between local quantum events and the broader biomolecular context, highlighting the role of specific residues and structural motifs in facilitating efficient energy conversion. The results have significant implications for understanding the functional mechanisms of complex biological systems and for the design of biomimetic devices.", "label": 0}
