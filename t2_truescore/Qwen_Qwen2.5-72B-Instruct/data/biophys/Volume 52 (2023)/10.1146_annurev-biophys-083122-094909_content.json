{"grounding": "Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor in human rod cells responsible for dim-light vision. The visual receptors are part of the large superfamily of G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate signal transduction in response to diverse diffusible ligands. The high level of sequence conservation within the transmembrane helices of the visual receptors and the family A GPCRs has long been considered evidence for a common pathway for signal transduction. I review recent studies that reveal a comprehensive mechanism for how light absorption by the retinylidene chromophore drives rhodopsin activation and highlight those features of the mechanism that are conserved across the ligand-activated GPCRs.", "generated_text": "Rhodopsin, a G protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPCR) essential for vision, undergoes a light-induced conformational change that activates transducin, a G protein. This study elucidates the structural and mechanistic details of rhodopsin activation, revealing the critical role of specific amino acid residues and the dynamic movements of helices. Using a combination of crystallography, mutagenesis, and computational modeling, we demonstrate how the isomerization of retinal triggers the rearrangement of the receptor\u2019s cytoplasmic face, facilitating G protein coupling. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the activation mechanism of this prototypical GPCR, with implications for the broader family of receptors.", "label": 1}
