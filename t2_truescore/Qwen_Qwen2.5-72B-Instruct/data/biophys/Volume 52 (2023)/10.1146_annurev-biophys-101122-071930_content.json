{"grounding": "Many proteins contain large structurally disordered regions or are entirely disordered under physiological conditions. The functions of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often involve interactions with other biomolecules. An important emerging effort has thus been to identify the molecular mechanisms of IDP interactions and how they differ from the textbook notions of biomolecular binding for folded proteins. In this review, we summarize how the versatile tool kit of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy can aid the investigation of these conformationally heterogeneous and highly dynamic molecular systems. We discuss the experimental observables that can be employed and how they enable IDP complexes to be probed on timescales from nanoseconds to hours. Key insights include the diverse structural and dynamic properties of bound IDPs and the kinetic mechanisms facilitated by disorder, such as fly-casting; disorder-mediated encounter complexes; and competitive substitution via ternary complexes, which enables rapid dissociation even for high-affinity complexes. We also discuss emerging links to aggregation, liquid\u2013liquid phase separation, and cellular processes, as well as current technical advances to further expand the scope of single-molecule spectroscopy.", "generated_text": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play crucial roles in cellular processes, often through transient and dynamic interactions. This study employs single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to investigate the interaction dynamics of IDPs, focusing on the kinetics and structural ensembles of disordered complexes. By combining smFRET with molecular simulations, we provide a detailed characterization of the binding mechanisms and conformational changes that occur upon interaction. Our results reveal the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of IDP complexes, highlighting the importance of transient interactions in their functional roles. The insights gained from this study enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IDP-mediated cellular processes and offer a framework for the design of targeted therapies.", "label": 1}
