{"grounding": "Advances in a scientific discipline are often measured by small, incremental steps. In this review, we report on two intertwined disciplines in the protein structure prediction field, modeling of single chains and modeling of complexes, that have over decades emulated this pattern, as monitored by the community-wide blind prediction experiments CASP and CAPRI. However, over the past few years, dramatic advances were observed for the accurate prediction of single protein chains, driven by a surge of deep learning methodologies entering the prediction field. We review the mainscientific developments that enabled these recent breakthroughs and feature the important role of blind prediction experiments in building up and nurturing the structure prediction field. We discuss how the new wave of artificial intelligence\u2013based methods is impacting the fields of computational and experimental structural biology and highlight areas in which deep learning methods are likely to lead to future developments, provided that major challenges are overcome.", "generated_text": "This review critically evaluates the methodologies employed in predicting the three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and protein complexes, focusing on the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) initiatives. These community-wide experiments have been pivotal in advancing the field by benchmarking and refining computational methods. Recent advancements, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, have significantly enhanced the accuracy and reliability of structure predictions. However, challenges remain, especially in predicting the structures of large, complex assemblies and in accurately modeling protein interactions. This paper discusses the current state of the art, highlights key successes and limitations, and outlines future directions for improving the predictive power of computational tools in structural biology. The implications of these advancements for understanding protein function and for applications in drug discovery and biotechnology are also considered.", "label": 1}
