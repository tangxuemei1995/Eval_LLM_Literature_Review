{"grounding": "The mechanism and the evolution of DNA replication and transcription, the key elements of the central dogma of biology, are fundamentally well explained by the physicochemical complementarity between strands of nucleic acids. However, the determinants that have shaped the third part of the dogma\u2014the process of biological translation and the universal genetic code\u2014remain unclear. We review and seek parallels between different proposals that view the evolution of translation through the prism of weak, noncovalent interactions between biological macromolecules. In particular, we focus on a recent proposal that there exists a hitherto unrecognized complementarity at the heart of biology, that between messenger RNA coding regions and the proteins that they encode, especially if the two are unstructured. Reflecting the idea that the genetic code evolved from intrinsic binding propensities between nucleotides and amino acids, this proposal promises to forge a link between the distant past and the present of biological systems.", "generated_text": "The process of biological translation, which decodes the universal genetic code into functional proteins, is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology. This review explores the molecular interactions at the heart of this process, focusing on the stereochemical hypothesis and the role of noncovalent interactions. Aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases (aaRSs) play a crucial role by ensuring the accurate pairing of amino acids with their corresponding tRNAs, a process that is guided by specific noncovalent interactions. The mRNA\u2013protein complementarity hypothesis further suggests that the primary sequence of mRNA can influence protein structure and function through direct interactions. These interactions not only highlight the precision required for accurate translation but also provide insights into the evolutionary origins of the genetic code. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is essential for advancing our knowledge of protein synthesis and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting translation.", "label": 1}
