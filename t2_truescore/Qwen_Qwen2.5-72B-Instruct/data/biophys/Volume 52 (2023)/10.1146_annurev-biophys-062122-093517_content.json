{"grounding": "My accidental encounter with protein hydrogen exchange (HX) at its very beginning and its continued development through my scientific career have led us to a series of advances in HX measurement, interpretation, and cutting edge biophysical applications. After some thoughts about how life brought me there, I take the opportunity to reflect on our early studies of allosteric structure and energy change in hemoglobin, the still-current protein folding problem, and our most recent forward-looking studies on protein machines.", "generated_text": "This review intertwines personal reflections with a deep dive into the molecular mechanisms of hydrogen exchange (HX) in proteins, focusing on hemoglobin allostery, protein folding, and the dynamic functions of AAA+ proteins. By exploring these interconnected processes, we elucidate the intricate workings of protein machines, highlighting the critical role of HX in understanding their structural and functional dynamics.", "label": 0}
