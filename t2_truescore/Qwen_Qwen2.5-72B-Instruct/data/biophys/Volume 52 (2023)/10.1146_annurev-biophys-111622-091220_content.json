{"grounding": "Diffusion is a pervasive process present in a broad spectrum of cellular reactions. Its mathematical description has existed for nearly two centuries and permits the construction of simple rules for evaluating the characteristic timescales of diffusive processes and some of their determinants. Although the term diffusion originally referred to random motions in three-dimensional (3D) media, several biological diffusion processes in lower dimensions have been reported. One-dimensional (1D) diffusions have been reported, for example, for translocations of various proteins along DNA or protein (e.g., microtubule) lattices and translation of helical peptides along the coiled-coil interface. Two-dimensional (2D) diffusion has been shown for dynamics of proteins along membranes. The microscopic mechanisms of these 1\u20133D diffusions may vary significantly depending on the nature of the diffusing molecules, the substrate, and the interactions between them. In this review, we highlight some key examples of 1\u20133D biomolecular diffusion processes and illustrate the roles that electrostatic interactions and intrinsic disorder may play in modulating these processes.", "generated_text": "The dynamics of protein diffusion along DNA and protein lattices, such as microtubules, are critical for various cellular processes, including gene regulation and intracellular transport. This study investigates the role of electrostatic interactions and disordered regions in modulating the diffusion coefficient and sliding behavior of proteins. Using a combination of single-molecule tracking, molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions significantly enhance the diffusion rate of proteins along DNA and microtubules. Disordered regions, characterized by their flexible and unstructured nature, further facilitate the sliding process by reducing the energy barriers for protein movement. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying efficient DNA search and intracellular transport, highlighting the importance of both electrostatics and disordered regions in these processes.", "label": 1}
