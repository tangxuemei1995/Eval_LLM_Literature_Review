{"grounding": "Efforts to combine theory and experiment to advance our knowledge of molecular processes relevant to biophysics have been considerably enhanced by the contribution of statistical-mechanics simulations. Key to the understanding of such molecular processes is the underlying free-energy change. Being able to accurately predict this change from first principles represents an appealing prospect. Over the past decades, the synergy between steadily growing computational resources and unrelenting methodological developments has brought free-energy calculations into the arsenal of tools commonly utilized to tackle important questions that experiment alone has left unresolved. The continued emergence of new options to determine free energies has also bred confusion amid the community of users, who may find it difficult to choose the best-suited algorithm to address the problem at hand. In an attempt to clarify the current landscape, this review recounts how the field has been shaped and how the broad gamut of methods available today is rooted in a few foundational principles laid down many years ago.Three examples of molecular processes central to biophysics illustrate where free-energy calculations stand and what are the conceptual and practical obstacles that we must overcome to increase their predictive power.", "generated_text": "Free energy methods are essential tools in the computational description of molecular processes, enabling the accurate quantification of thermodynamic properties and the elucidation of complex biological phenomena. This review highlights recent advancements in free energy methods, particularly in the context of computer simulations, importance sampling, and enhanced sampling techniques. These methods are crucial for understanding processes such as recognition and association, permeation through biological membranes, and conformational transitions in proteins and nucleic acids. Importance sampling techniques, such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics, have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of free energy calculations, allowing for the exploration of rare events and metastable states. Enhanced sampling methods, including replica exchange and parallel tempering, further extend the applicability of these techniques to systems with high-dimensional free energy landscapes. The integration of these methods with advanced computational algorithms and hardware accelerators has opened new avenues for the detailed investigation of molecular processes, providing insights that are difficult to obtain through experimental means alone. This review discusses the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and recent applications of free energy methods, emphasizing their role in advancing our understanding of molecular systems.", "label": 1}
