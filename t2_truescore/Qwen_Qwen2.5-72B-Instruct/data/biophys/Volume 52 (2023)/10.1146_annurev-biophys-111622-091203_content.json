{"grounding": "Synthetic biology seeks to probe fundamental aspects of biological form and function by construction [i.e., (re)synthesis] rather than deconstruction (analysis). In this sense, biological sciences now follow the lead given by the chemical sciences. Synthesis can complement analytic studies but also allows novel approaches to answering fundamental biological questions and opens up vast opportunities for the exploitation of biological processes to provide solutions for global problems. In this review, we explore aspects of this synthesis paradigm as applied to the chemistry and function of nucleic acids in biological systems and beyond, specifically, in genome resynthesis, synthetic genetics (i.e., the expansion of the genetic alphabet, of the genetic code, and of the chemical make-up of genetic systems), and the elaboration of orthogonal biosystems and components.", "generated_text": "The expanded central dogma of molecular biology now encompasses the synthesis of genomes and the creation of orthogonal biosystems, which operate independently of natural biological processes. Advances in synthetic biology have enabled the design and construction of synthetic genetic systems, including the incorporation of unnatural base pairs and the use of XNA (xeno-nucleic acids) as alternative genetic polymers. These innovations not only challenge the traditional boundaries of life but also open new avenues for biotechnology, drug discovery, and the study of evolutionary biology. This review highlights recent progress in genome resynthesis, the development of orthogonal biosystems, and the potential applications of synthetic genetics, emphasizing the importance of orthogonality in ensuring the stability and functionality of these novel biological systems.", "label": 0}
