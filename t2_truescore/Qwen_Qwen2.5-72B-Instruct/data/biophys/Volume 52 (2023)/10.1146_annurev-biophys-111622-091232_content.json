{"grounding": "ABC transporters are essential for cellular physiology. Humans have 48 ABC genes organized into seven distinct families. Of these genes, 44 (in five distinct families) encode for membrane transporters, of which several are involved in drug resistance and disease pathways resulting from transporter dysfunction. Over the last decade, advances in structural biology have vastly expanded our mechanistic understanding of human ABC transporter function, revealing details of their molecular arrangement, regulation, and interactions, facilitated in large part by advances in cryo-EM that have rendered hitherto inaccessible targets amenable to high-resolution structural analysis. As a result, experimentally determined structures of multiple members of each of the five families of ABC transporters in humans are now available. Here we review this recent progress, highlighting the physiological relevance of human ABC transporters and mechanistic insights gleaned from their direct structure determination. We also discuss the impact and limitations of model systems and structure prediction methods in understanding human ABC transporters and discuss current challenges and future research directions.", "generated_text": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a large family of membrane proteins that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including lipid homeostasis, drug extrusion, and the maintenance of cellular barriers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided unprecedented insights into the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters. These studies reveal the intricate architecture of these proteins and their dynamic conformational changes during the transport cycle, which are powered by ATP hydrolysis. Understanding the molecular details of ABC transporter function is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human diseases such as cystic fibrosis, multidrug resistance in cancer, and various metabolic disorders. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the structural and functional aspects of human ABC transporters, highlighting the implications for therapeutic intervention and the development of novel drugs targeting these proteins.", "label": 1}
