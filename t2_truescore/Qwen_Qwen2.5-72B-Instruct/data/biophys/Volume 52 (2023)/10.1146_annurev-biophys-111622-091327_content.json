{"grounding": "Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have marked only the beginning of the potential of this technique. To bring structure into cell biology, the modality of cryo-electron tomography has fast developed into a bona fide in situ structural biology technique where structures are determined in their native environment, the cell. Nearly every step of the cryo-focused ion beam-assisted electron tomography (cryo-FIB-ET) workflow has been improved upon in the past decade, since the first windows were carved into cells, unveiling macromolecular networks in near-native conditions. By bridging structural and cell biology, cryo-FIB-ET is advancing our understanding of structure\u2013function relationships in their native environment and becoming a tool for discovering new biology.", "generated_text": "Cryo-electron tomography (CET) has emerged as a powerful technique for visualizing the molecular architecture of cells in their native state. This review highlights recent advances in CET that have enabled high-resolution, in situ structural biology, providing unprecedented insights into the organization and dynamics of cellular components. By integrating CET with quantitative cell biology and biophysical modeling, researchers can now elucidate the structural principles underlying complex cellular processes. These developments are paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of cellular function and dysfunction, with implications for both basic science and translational research.", "label": 1}
