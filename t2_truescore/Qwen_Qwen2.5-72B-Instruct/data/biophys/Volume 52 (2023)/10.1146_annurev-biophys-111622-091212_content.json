{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy allows the investigation of cellular structures at nanoscale resolution using light. Current developments in super-resolution microscopy have focused on reliable quantification of the underlying biological data. In this review, we first describe the basic principles of super-resolution microscopy techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), and then give a broad overview of methodological developments to quantify super-resolution data, particularly those geared toward SMLM data. We cover commonly used techniques such as spatial point pattern analysis, colocalization, and protein copy number quantification but also describe more advanced techniques such as structural modeling, single-particle tracking, and biosensing. Finally, we provide an outlook on exciting new research directions to which quantitative super-resolution microscopy might be applied.", "generated_text": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is a powerful super-resolution nanoscopy technique that enables the precise localization and quantitative analysis of individual molecules within cells. This method surpasses the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy, providing unprecedented spatial resolution and detailed insights into cellular structures and dynamics. By accurately measuring the number, distribution, and interactions of molecules, SMLM facilitates a deeper understanding of complex biological processes at the molecular level. This review highlights recent advancements in SMLM, focusing on its applications in quantitative cell biology, and discusses the challenges and future directions for improving quantitative accuracy and expanding its utility in biological research.", "label": 1}
