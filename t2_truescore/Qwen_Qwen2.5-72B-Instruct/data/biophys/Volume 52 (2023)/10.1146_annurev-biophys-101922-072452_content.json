{"grounding": "Faithful translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is essential to maintain protein homeostasis in the cell. Spontaneous translation errors are very rare due to stringent selection of cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the tight control of the mRNA reading frame by the ribosome. Recoding events, such as stop codon readthrough, frameshifting, and translational bypassing, reprogram the ribosome to make intentional mistakes and produce alternative proteins from the same mRNA. The hallmark of recoding is the change of ribosome dynamics. The signals for recoding are built into the mRNA, but their reading depends on the genetic makeup of the cell, resulting in cell-specific changes in expression programs. In this review, I discuss the mechanisms of canonical decoding and tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation; describe alternative pathways leading to recoding; and identify the links among mRNA signals, ribosome dynamics, and recoding.", "generated_text": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine, plays a crucial role in the translation of mRNA into proteins. This process involves the precise decoding of mRNA sequences and the accurate incorporation of amino acids by tRNAs, facilitated by elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G. Recent studies have revealed that the ribosome can also recode mRNA sequences through mechanisms such as frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, which expand the coding capacity of the genome. These phenomena are regulated by specific mRNA structures and sequences, as well as by the kinetics of ribosomal movements. Understanding the molecular details of these processes is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of gene expression and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting the ribosome.", "label": 1}
