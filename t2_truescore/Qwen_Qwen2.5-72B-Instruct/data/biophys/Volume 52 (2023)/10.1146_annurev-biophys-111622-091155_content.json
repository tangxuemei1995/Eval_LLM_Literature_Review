{"grounding": "Proteins guide the flows of information, energy, and matter that make life possible by accelerating transport and chemical reactions, by allosterically modulating these reactions, and by forming dynamic supramolecular assemblies. In these roles, conformational change underlies functional transitions. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction methods characterize these transitions either by directly triggering sequences of functionally important motions or, more broadly, by capturing the motions of which proteins are capable. To date, most successful have been experiments in which conformational change is triggered in light-dependent proteins. In this review, I emphasize emerging techniques that probe the dynamic basis of function in proteins lacking natively light-dependent transitions and speculate about extensions and further possibilities. In addition, I review how the weaker and more distributed signals in these data push the limits of the capabilities of analytical methods. Taken together, these new methods are beginning to establish a powerful paradigm for the study of the physics of protein function.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques, particularly serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX), have revolutionized the study of protein dynamics. These methods enable the capture of transient structural changes in proteins upon excitation, providing insights into the mechanisms of protein function at atomic resolution. By utilizing ultrafast X-ray pulses, SFX can probe the dynamics of proteins in their excited states, revealing the intricate interplay between structure and function. The application of electric fields in conjunction with time-resolved X-ray crystallography further enhances the ability to control and observe protein mechanics, offering a powerful tool for understanding the dynamic processes that govern protein behavior. This review highlights the latest developments in these techniques and their potential to elucidate the complex dynamics of proteins, paving the way for new discoveries in structural biology and biophysics.", "label": 1}
