{"grounding": "An ideal biosensor material at room temperature, with an extremely large surface area per unit mass combined with the possibility of harnessing quantum mechanical attributes, would be comprised of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials. The sensing of a variety of sizes and types of biomolecules involves modulation of the electrical charge density of (current through) the 2D material and manifests through specific components of the capacitance (resistance). While sensitive detection at the single-molecule level, i.e., at zeptomolar concentrations, may be achieved, specificity in a complex mixture is more demanding. Attention should be paid to the influence of inevitably present defects in the 2D materials on the sensing, as well as calibration of obtained results with acceptable standards. The consequent establishment of a roadmap for the widespread deployment of 2D material\u2013based biosensors in point-of-care platforms has the potential to revolutionize health care.", "generated_text": "This review explores the application of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials in the sensing of biomolecules, focusing on their unique properties such as high specific surface area (SSA) and tunable density of states (DOS). The integration of these materials into field effect transistors (FETs) and impedance-based sensors has enabled the development of highly sensitive and selective detection platforms. The influence of defects on the performance of these sensors is discussed, along with the importance of standardization in sensor fabrication and characterization. Impedance models are presented to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the interaction between 2D materials and biomolecules, providing a foundation for the optimization of sensor design. This work highlights the potential of graphene and 2D materials to revolutionize biomolecular sensing, with implications for diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and personalized medicine.", "label": 1}
