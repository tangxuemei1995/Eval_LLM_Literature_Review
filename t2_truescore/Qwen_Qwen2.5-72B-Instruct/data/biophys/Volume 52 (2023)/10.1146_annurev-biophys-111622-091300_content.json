{"grounding": "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has matured into a robust method for the determination of biological macromolecule structures in the past decade, complementing X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Constant methodological improvements in both cryo-EM hardware and image processing software continue to contribute to an exponential growth in the number of structures solved annually. In this review, we provide a historical view of the many steps that were required to make cryo-EM a successful method for the determination of high-resolution protein complex structures. We further discuss aspects of cryo-EM methodology that are the greatest pitfalls challenging successful structure determination to date. Lastly, we highlight and propose potential future developments that would improve the method even further in the near future.", "generated_text": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized the field of structural biology, enabling the determination of the 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This technique overcomes many limitations of traditional methods, such as crystallography, by allowing the visualization of flexible and heterogeneous samples. However, achieving atomic resolution remains challenging due to factors such as sample preparation, beam-induced damage, and optical aberrations. Recent advancements in detector technology, image processing algorithms, and computational power have significantly improved the resolution and reliability of cryo-EM structures. Despite these advances, further improvements in hardware and software are necessary to enhance the resolution and throughput of cryo-EM, making it a more accessible and routine tool for structural biologists.", "label": 1}
