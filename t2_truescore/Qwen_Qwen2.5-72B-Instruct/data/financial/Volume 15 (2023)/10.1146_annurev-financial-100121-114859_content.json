{"grounding": "This article surveys the recent empirical literature on historical banking crises, defined as events taking place before 1980. Advances in data collection and identification have provided new insights into the causes and consequences of crises both immediately and over the long run. We highlight three overarching threads that emerge from the literature: First, leverage in the financial system is a systematic precursor to crises; second, crises have sizable negative effects on the real economy; and third, government interventions can ameliorate these effects. Contrasting historical episodes reveals that the process of crisis formation and evolution varies significantly across time and space. Thus, we also highlight specific institutions, regulations, and historical contexts that give rise to these divergent experiences. We conclude by identifying important gaps in the literature and discussing avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the historical context and evolution of banking crises, focusing on the critical roles of intermediation, leverage, and the lender of last resort in maintaining financial stability. By analyzing key episodes from the 19th century to the present, we identify recurring patterns and structural vulnerabilities that have precipitated systemic failures. The study highlights the importance of regulatory frameworks and central bank interventions in mitigating the severity and frequency of crises. Historical lessons underscore the need for robust risk management practices and the continuous adaptation of financial policies to address emerging challenges in the global economy.", "label": 0}
