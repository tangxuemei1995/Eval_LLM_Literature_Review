{"grounding": "The purpose of this article is to review the literature on inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives. The methodology for valuation and risk management of these securities is an application of the foreign currency extension of a standard HJM term structure model. The two \u201ccurrencies\u201d in the extended model are real and nominal prices. Currently, for their use in monetary policy, the empirical literature primarily uses these models to estimate both the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. A literature investigating the efficiency of the inflation derivative markets and a comparison of the relevant valuation models is almost nonexistent and a fruitful area for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the pricing and risk management of inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model. By incorporating the term structure of interest rates and inflation, we derive a framework for valuing inflation-indexed securities and their derivatives. The model allows for the accurate calculation of break-even inflation rates, which are crucial for investors and policymakers. Empirical analysis using market data confirms the model's effectiveness in capturing the dynamics of inflation and interest rates, providing insights into the pricing of inflation-linked instruments.", "label": 1}
