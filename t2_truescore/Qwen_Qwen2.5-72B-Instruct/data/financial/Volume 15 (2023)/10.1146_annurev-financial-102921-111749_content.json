{"grounding": "Most Western countries use a single discount rate to evaluate public investments and policies. This ignores the differential cost of risk, in a world where most risk markets exhibit surprisingly large prices of risk. The current discounting guidelines generate a misallocation of capital that entails a large welfare cost. We claim that the well-established asset pricing literature provides a strong normative justification in favor of risk-adjusting discount rates. More specifically, project-specific discount rates should be increasing in the income elasticity of the project's net benefit. This will favor projects whose net benefit materializes preferentially in low-income states, thereby recognizing their insurance benefit ex ante. The intuition is simple, the welfare benefit of the reform is large, and the methodology only requires evaluators to estimate an income elasticity on top of what is required in the current approach. It is time to fix our public discounting systems.", "generated_text": "This paper addresses the critical issue of reforming public discounting systems to better align with long-term sustainability goals. Current discounting practices often undervalue future costs and benefits, particularly in the context of environmental and social impacts. We propose a framework that incorporates risk adjustment and dynamic discount rates to more accurately reflect the uncertainties and long-term risks associated with climate change and other sustainability challenges. The integration of carbon pricing into cost-benefit analysis is emphasized as a key mechanism to internalize environmental externalities. Empirical evidence from case studies demonstrates that these adjustments can lead to more robust and equitable policy decisions, ensuring that future generations are not disproportionately burdened by current economic activities.", "label": 0}
