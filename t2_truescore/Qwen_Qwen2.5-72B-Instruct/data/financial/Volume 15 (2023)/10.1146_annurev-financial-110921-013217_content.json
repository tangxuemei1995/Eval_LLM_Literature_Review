{"grounding": "Robo-advice uses big and open data to provide consumers with fully informed and rational-expectation benchmarks in all realms of household finance, including consumption, saving, investment, and debt management choices. It also minimizes the monetary, cognitive, and psychological costs that households face in economic transactions. We review recent research on the features and effects of robo-advice on individual and aggregate economic outcomes through the lens of its differences from traditional human advice. We discuss the distributional implications of robo-advice, its potential role in increasing the effectiveness of economic policies, the role of providers\u2019 incentives, and several questions that are still wide open for researchers in finance, economics, social psychology, and related fields.", "generated_text": "This study explores the impact of robo-advice on transforming households into more rational economic agents. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, robo-advisors provide personalized financial guidance, influencing consumption, debt management, and investment decisions. The research integrates insights from FinTech, household finance, and behavioral finance to assess how these technological tools mitigate cognitive biases and enhance financial literacy. Empirical analysis reveals significant improvements in household financial health, with reduced debt levels and optimized investment portfolios. The findings suggest that robo-advice can play a crucial role in promoting financial well-being and economic stability.", "label": 1}
