{"grounding": "The principles of financial economics provide equally important insights into the optimal choice of discount rates for both public and private sector decision-makers. However, most governments largely ignore those principles, taking their cost of capital for most purposes as their borrowing rate. This article reviews the arguments often made in support of status quo discounting practices, along with the counterarguments to them. Governments have a choice between several methodologies for risk adjustment, and the practical and conceptual reasons that favor a fair value approach are recapped. The limitations of a financial economics approach become apparent for decisions involving very long time horizons, such as for climate policies. For policies with long-term impacts, intergenerational concerns become paramount, projections of cash flows and discount rates become highly uncertain, and present value calculations are an intrinsically unreliable measure of value. No approach to discount rate selection can overcome those problems; alternative decision criteria need to be established. However, most government investments involve much shorter horizons, and the adoption of standard approaches to risk adjustment could significantly improve social welfare.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the applicability and limitations of financial economics in determining the social discount rate (SDR) for government projects. The SDR is a critical parameter in cost-benefit analysis, influencing decisions on public investments and resource allocation. While financial economics provides valuable insights into market-based valuation and risk assessment, its direct application to government projects is constrained by the unique characteristics of public sector finance. The paper examines how concepts such as fair value accounting and budgetary accounting differ from private sector practices, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach to government cost of capital. It argues that while market-derived discount rates can inform the SDR, they must be adjusted to reflect social objectives, long-term impacts, and the non-market nature of many government activities. The discussion also considers the implications of these adjustments for transparency and accountability in public financial management.", "label": 1}
