{"grounding": "After two decades of low initial public offering (IPO) activity and a number of regulatory changes, the number of IPOs of both operating companies and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) boomed in the United States in 2021 before collapsing in 2022. In recent years, surging valuations have resulted in many private companies achieving \u201cunicorn\u201d status, a valuation of $1 billion or more, partly fueled by investments from mutual funds. Many of the unicorns that have gone public have done so with dual-class share structures. We compare three alternative mechanisms for going public, including traditional IPOs, mergers with SPACs, and direct listings. The most common exit for successful venture capital\u2013backed companies, however, continues to be by merging with a larger company.", "generated_text": "This paper examines recent developments in the landscape of initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), focusing on the emergence of unicorns, confidential filings, direct listings, and the use of dual-class shares. The study analyzes trends in IPO and SPAC activity, highlighting the increasing popularity of SPACs as an alternative to traditional IPOs. It also explores regulatory changes and market dynamics that have influenced these trends, providing insights into the implications for investors, companies, and the broader financial ecosystem.", "label": 1}
