{"grounding": "We explain the mechanics of smart contracts. We then highlight the benefits of smart contracts, such as overcoming commitment problems. We also discuss limitations, such as the difficulty for smart contracts to access information external to the blockchain and the difficulty of integrating smart contract code with traditional legal enforcement. We further highlight how the absence of a trusted intermediary inflates implementation costs for blockchain applications. We conclude with a discussion of the most prominent smart contract applications in decentralized finance: token issuance (e.g., initial coin offerings, nonfungible tokens), decentralized exchanges, and protocols for loanable funds. Our survey covers both institutional details and relevant literature.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the role of smart contracts in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, focusing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts enable trustless and automated financial services, enhancing transparency and reducing intermediation costs. The study analyzes the mechanisms of DEXs and PLFs, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems. However, it also addresses the challenges, including security vulnerabilities and regulatory uncertainties, that must be overcome for widespread adoption. Empirical data from leading DeFi platforms are used to illustrate the current state and future prospects of this emerging field.", "label": 1}
