{"grounding": "We explore the design of climate stress tests to assess and manage macroprudential risks from climate change in the financial sector. We review the climate stress scenarios currently employed by regulators, highlighting the need to (a) consider many transition risks as dynamic policy choices, (b) better understand and incorporate feedback loops between climate change and the economy, and (c) further explore compound risk scenarios in which climate risks co-occur with other risks. We discuss how the process of mapping climate stress scenarios into financial firm outcomes can incorporate existing evidence on the effects of various climate-related risks on credit and market outcomes. We argue that more research is required to (a) identify channels through which plausible scenarios can lead to meaningful short-run impact on credit risks given typical bank loan maturities, (b) incorporate bank-lending responses to climate risks, (c) assess the adequacy of climate risk pricing in financial markets, and (d) better understand how market participants form climate risk expectations and how that affects financial stability. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using market-based climate stress tests that can be conducted with publicly available data to complement existing stress-testing frameworks.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of climate stress testing as a critical tool for assessing and managing climate-related risks to financial stability. By integrating climate risk into traditional financial stress testing frameworks, the research aims to identify potential vulnerabilities in the financial system that could arise from physical and transition risks associated with climate change. The methodology involves the development of scenario analysis, incorporating both acute and chronic climate impacts, as well as policy and technological shifts. The findings highlight the significant exposure of financial institutions to climate-related systemic risks, emphasizing the need for proactive regulatory measures and enhanced disclosure practices. The study also underscores the importance of cross-sector collaboration to develop robust climate resilience strategies, ensuring the long-term stability of the financial system. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies and empirical data, the research provides actionable insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on financial stability.", "label": 1}
