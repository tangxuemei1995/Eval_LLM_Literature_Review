{"grounding": "This article reviews the recent literature on algorithmic fairness, with a particular emphasis on credit scoring. We discuss human versus machine bias, bias measurement, group versus individual fairness, and a collection of fairness metrics. We then apply these metrics to the US mortgage market, analyzing Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data on mortgage applications between 2009 and 2015. We find evidence of group imbalance in the dataset for both gender and (especially) minority status, which can lead to poorer estimation/prediction for female/minority applicants. Loan applicants are handled mostly fairly across both groups and individuals, though we find that some local male (nonminority) neighbors of otherwise similar rejected female (minority) applicants were granted loans, something that warrants further study. Finally, modern machine learning techniques substantially outperform logistic regression (the industry standard), though at the cost of being substantially harder to explain to denied applicants, regulators, or the courts.", "generated_text": "This study explores the critical issue of algorithmic fairness in machine learning, particularly in the context of credit scoring. We examine various fairness metrics and their implications on reducing bias in algorithmic decision-making processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis, we identify key challenges and propose a framework for evaluating and mitigating bias. Our findings highlight the importance of transparent and accountable algorithms, suggesting that a multi-faceted approach, including regulatory oversight and technical innovations, is essential for achieving fairer outcomes in credit scoring systems.", "label": 1}
