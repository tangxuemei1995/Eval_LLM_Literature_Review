{"grounding": "Unfunded public pension obligations represent the largest liability for state and local governments in the United States. As of fiscal year 2021, the total reported unfunded liabilities of these plans are $1.076 trillion. In contrast, the market value of the unfunded liability is approximately $6.501 trillion. As a result, the reported funding ratio of 82.5% falls to 43.8% under a market-based valuation. The market values reflect the fact that accrued pension promises are a form of government debt with strong statutory and contractual rights. The assumed discount rates are based on expected returns and remain elevated relative to risk-free rates, despite a decline since 2014. As a result, not only is the unfunded pension liability understated, but the yearly pension cost for newly accruing liabilities is also understated. In order to achieve high returns, pension funds have accumulated large exposure to risky assets, in particular alternative investments, which results in highly uncertain investment returns.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolving landscape of state and local pension funds in the United States, focusing on trends in pension costs, funding levels, and the impact of retirement policies on government debt. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from 2000 to 2020, the analysis reveals a significant increase in unfunded liabilities, driven by demographic shifts, investment shortfalls, and policy decisions that have delayed necessary reforms. The research highlights the growing financial pressure on state and local governments, which has been exacerbated by economic downturns and the increasing cost of healthcare for retirees. The findings suggest that without substantial changes in pension policies, including adjustments to benefit structures and increased contributions, the sustainability of these funds remains at risk. The study also explores potential solutions, such as hybrid pension models and improved investment strategies, to address the long-term challenges facing public pension systems.", "label": 0}
