{"grounding": "The past half-century has seen major shifts in inflation expectations, how inflation comoves with the business cycle, and how stocks comove with Treasury bonds. Against this backdrop, we review the economic channels and empirical evidence on how inflation is priced in financial markets. Not all inflation episodes are created equal. Using a New Keynesian model, we show how \u201cgood\u201d inflation can be linked to demand shocks and \u201cbad\u201d inflation to cost-push shocks driving the economy. We then discuss asset pricing implications of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d inflation. We conclude by providing an outlook for inflation risk premia in the world of newly rising inflation.", "generated_text": "This study examines the relationship between inflation and asset returns, focusing on the predictability of bond returns and the impact of monetary policy. Using a comprehensive dataset, we find that inflation significantly affects risk premia and asset pricing, particularly during periods of stagflation. Our results suggest that monetary policy plays a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of inflation on financial markets, highlighting the importance of policy stability and transparency. The findings have implications for investors and policymakers in managing economic risks and optimizing portfolio strategies.", "label": 0}
