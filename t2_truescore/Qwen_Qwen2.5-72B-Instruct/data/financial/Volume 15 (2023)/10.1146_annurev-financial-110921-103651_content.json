{"grounding": "This review revisits the literature on fiscal capacity using modern tools from asset pricing. We find that properly accounting for aggregate risk substantially reduces fiscal capacity. In this environment, the gap between the risk-free rate and the expected growth rate is not a sufficient statistic for fiscal capacity. To borrow at the risk-free rate when aggregate growth is risky, governments need to ask taxpayers to insure bondholders against aggregate risk, but governments in advanced economies tend to insure taxpayers against aggregate risk. We use this asset pricing perspective to review alternative mechanisms to boost fiscal capacity that have been explored in the literature.", "generated_text": "This paper examines the role of fiscal capacity in asset pricing, focusing on the term structure of interest rates and the maturity of government debt. We incorporate the concept of convenience yield, which reflects the benefits of holding government debt as a safe asset, into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Our findings suggest that a higher fiscal capacity, characterized by a more flexible and credible fiscal policy, can lead to a flatter term structure and a lower convenience yield, thereby influencing the pricing of long-term bonds. The implications of these results for monetary-fiscal policy coordination and financial stability are discussed.", "label": 0}
