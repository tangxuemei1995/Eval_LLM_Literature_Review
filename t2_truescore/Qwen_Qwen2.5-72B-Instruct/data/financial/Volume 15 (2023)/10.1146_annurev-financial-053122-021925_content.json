{"grounding": "This survey discusses the state of the art in research in racetrack and lottery investment markets. Market efficiency and the pricing of various wagers are studied along with new developments since the Thaler & Ziemba (1988) review. The weak form inefficient market pricing approach using stochastic programming optimization models changed racetrack betting from handicapping to a financial market allowing professional syndicates to operate as hedge funds. Topics discussed include arbitrage and risk arbitrage, syndicates, betting exchange rebates, behavioral biases, and fundamental and mispricing information in racetrack and lottery markets. Similar models can be used to successfully trade stock market anomalies. \nSupplemental Materials\n are included online.", "generated_text": "This study revisits the efficiency of pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries. Using stochastic programming optimization models, we analyze the favorite-longshot bias and its implications for bettors. The research reveals that while racetrack markets exhibit a significant favorite-longshot bias, lottery strategies can be optimized to mitigate this effect. The findings suggest that bettors can improve their outcomes by adopting strategic approaches, particularly in identifying and exploiting inefficiencies in the markets. The study contributes to the understanding of market dynamics and offers practical insights for participants in pari-mutuel betting systems.", "label": 0}
