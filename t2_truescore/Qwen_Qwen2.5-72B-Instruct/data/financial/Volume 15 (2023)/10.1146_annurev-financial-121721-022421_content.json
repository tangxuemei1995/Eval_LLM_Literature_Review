{"grounding": "Discounting of deferred impacts of government policies is a long-established practice that has been the target of substantial litigation and continued philosophical debate. Legal challenges to the social rate of discount have resulted in general acceptance of the principle of discounting at a nonzero rate for both monetary and nonmonetary impacts. Courts have displayed a general familiarity with discounting and often require transparent justification for the selection of the discount rate based on established scientific principles. The philosophical issues are more wide-ranging and include whether nonmonetary impacts should be discounted, the use of the opportunity cost of capital or the social rate of time preference, the time frame that is pertinent for setting the discount rate, and determination of whose preferences should have standing. Intergenerational issues are particularly challenging, raising questions regarding which generation's preferences should be recognized, the potential for dynamic inconsistencies arising from preferential discount rates, and intertemporal inequities. Benefit-cost analyses that include appropriate recognition of benefits and costs for future generations serve a constructive function in providing a mechanism for recognizing future effects on social welfare.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the legal and philosophical foundations of the social discount rate (SDR) in the context of intertemporal and intergenerational decision-making. The SDR is a critical parameter in benefit-cost analysis, influencing how future costs and benefits are valued relative to the present. We examine the ethical implications of discounting future welfare, considering both utilitarian and deontological perspectives. The legal dimension is analyzed through the lens of regulatory frameworks and judicial interpretations, highlighting the role of the SDR in environmental and economic policies. The paper argues that a balanced approach, integrating both ethical and legal considerations, is necessary to ensure that the SDR reflects societal values and promotes sustainable development. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we provide insights into the challenges and potential solutions in setting an appropriate SDR for long-term policy decisions.", "label": 1}
