{"grounding": "In this article, we review the literature on the recent growth of corporate debt in China and present stylized facts on the evolution of debt composition, nonperforming loans, defaults, and bankruptcy filings. We then describe the legal and political institutions that characterize the system for restructuring and liquidating financially distressed firms, including recent reforms of China's bankruptcy law. Finally, we discuss the main challenges faced by China in the implementation of these reforms, including frictions in judicial enforcement. We also propose potential avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the evolution of default and bankruptcy resolution mechanisms in China, focusing on the interplay between formal bankruptcy law and informal practices.
