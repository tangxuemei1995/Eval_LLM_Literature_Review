{"grounding": "The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to a large number of studies in household finance, using new high-frequency data in close to real time. In this article, we survey household behavior during the pandemic, with a focus on consumption, government policies, credit, and investment. The pandemic induced a rapid decline in consumption, which was affected by but largely preceded stay-at-home orders and was followed by a rapid rebound. Government stimulus was less effective in 2020 relative to other recessions, which is consistent with both shutdowns and precautionary savings. Delinquency rates fell, unlike in other recessions, likely due to government debt relief policies. Household investment behavior was affected by pandemic-induced changes in beliefs. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household financial behavior, focusing on consumption, credit, and investment patterns. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of household financial transactions and survey responses, we find that the pandemic led to a significant reduction in discretionary spending and an increase in savings, particularly among higher-income households. The introduction of government stimulus measures temporarily boosted consumption but did not fully offset the overall decline. Credit usage decreased as households sought to reduce debt and improve financial resilience. Investment activities were cautious, with a shift towards safer assets. These findings highlight the complex and heterogeneous responses of households to economic shocks and the importance of targeted policy interventions to support financial stability during crises.", "label": 1}
