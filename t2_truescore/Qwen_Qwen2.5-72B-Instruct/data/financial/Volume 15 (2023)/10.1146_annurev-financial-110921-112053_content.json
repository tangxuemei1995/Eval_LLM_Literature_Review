{"grounding": "We review macro-finance models featuring nonlinear dynamics that have recently been developed in the literature, including models with funding liquidity constraints, market liquidity frictions, and bank run frictions, and discuss the empirical evidence and challenges of this class of models. We also construct an illustrative model featuring financial frictions and nonlinear dynamics for readers who are unfamiliar with the literature. We solve the model using different solution techniques, including both global and perturbation solution methods, and comprehensively compare the accuracy of these solutions. Within this framework, we highlight that local linearization approximations omit important nonlinear dynamics and yield biased impulse responses.", "generated_text": "This paper develops a class of macro-finance models that incorporate nonlinear dynamics, focusing on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks. The models account for systemic risk and endogenous jump risk, integrating financial constraints and liquidity issues. By extending traditional DSGE models, the analysis reveals how nonlinearities in financial markets can amplify economic fluctuations and affect policy outcomes. Empirical applications demonstrate the model's ability to capture key features of financial crises and business cycles, providing insights into the design of macroprudential policies.", "label": 0}
