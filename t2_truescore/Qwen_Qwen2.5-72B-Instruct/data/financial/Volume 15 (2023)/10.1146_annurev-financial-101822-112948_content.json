{"grounding": "Market interest rates reflect the preferences of market participants. When market participants are missing, the average discount rate in the population may therefore differ from the market rate. Missing current market participants, such as constrained borrowers, tends to imply an average discount rate that is above the market rate, whereas missing future market participants, such as future generations, tends to imply an average rate below the market rate. Nonetheless, a government with the ability to transfer wealth intratemporally across agents will generally wish to use the market interest rate as a guide to policy. One robust argument for the use of a lower social discount rate is intrapersonal: Future selves discount the past, whereas current selves discount the future. Legacy utility may also justify a low social discount rate.", "generated_text": "This study explores the impact of missing participants and incomplete markets on the social discount rate, focusing on the roles of borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, we examine how these factors influence individual and collective decision-making processes. Our findings suggest that borrowing constraints and the lack of complete markets lead to higher social discount rates, as individuals prioritize short-term gains over long-term investments. However, the presence of altruism and the desire for legacy can mitigate these effects, promoting more sustainable and equitable outcomes. This research contributes to the understanding of how social and economic structures shape intertemporal choices and policy implications for addressing market inefficiencies.", "label": 0}
