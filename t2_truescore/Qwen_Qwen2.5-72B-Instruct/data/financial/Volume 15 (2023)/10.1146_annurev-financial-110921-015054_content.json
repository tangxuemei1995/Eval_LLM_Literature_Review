{"grounding": "The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the predominant family of global short-term rate benchmarks for the past 40 years, ceased to exist in June 2023. Given the low volumes of interbank loans on which LIBOR had been based, the revelations that LIBOR had been manipulated, and the risks that countless LIBOR-dependent financial instruments without fallback rates would be cast into limbo, regulators over the last decade pushed to replace LIBOR with risk-free overnight rate benchmarks. In the United States, the new benchmark, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), is an overnight rate based on US Treasury repo transactions: Use of term rates and derivatives on term rates is limited, and use of credit-sensitive term rates is discouraged. This article recounts the rise and fall of LIBOR; reviews the academic literature on the efficiency benefits of benchmarks, the LIBOR scandal, and the pros and cons of risk-free versus credit-sensitive rate benchmarks; and calls for further academic work on the current policy of entrenching a single-benchmark SOFR regime relative to the alternative of encouraging a two- or multi-benchmark regime of SOFR and one or more credit-sensitive term rates.", "generated_text": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative rate benchmarks marks a significant shift in the global financial landscape. This study examines the characteristics and implications of the new short-term rate benchmarks, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States, and the continued use of credit-sensitive rates such as Euribor in Europe. We analyze the adoption of risk-free rates (RFRs) and credit-sensitive rates (CSRs) in various financial instruments, particularly interest rate derivatives. The research highlights the challenges and benefits associated with the transition, such as the reduction of systemic risk and the potential for basis risk in hybrid financial products. Additionally, the study explores the role of emerging benchmarks like Ameribor, BSBY, and AXI in providing credit-sensitive alternatives. Empirical evidence suggests that while RFRs offer greater stability and transparency, CSRs continue to be favored in certain markets due to their alignment with underlying credit conditions. The findings underscore the need for a nuanced approach to benchmark selection, balancing regulatory requirements with market preferences.", "label": 1}
