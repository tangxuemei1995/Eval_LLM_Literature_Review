{"grounding": "Open-end mutual funds offer investors same-day liquidity while holding assets that in some cases take several days to sell. This liquidity transformation creates a potentially destabilizing first-mover advantage: When asset prices fall, investors who exit a fund earlier may pass the liquidation costs generated by their share redemptions to investors who remain in the fund. This incentive becomes particularly acute in periods of market stress, and it can amplify fire-sale spillover losses to other market participants. Swing pricing is a liquidity management tool that targets this first-mover advantage. It allows a fund to adjust or \u201cswing\u201d its net asset value in response to large flows out of or into a mutual fund. This article discusses the industry and regulatory context for swing pricing, and it reviews theory and empirical evidence on the design and effectiveness of swing pricing. The article concludes with directions for further research.", "generated_text": "This study examines the theory and empirical evidence surrounding swing pricing, a mechanism used by mutual funds to manage liquidity and protect long-term investors from the costs associated with large inflows and outflows. We analyze the impact of swing pricing on fund performance, liquidity transformation, and the potential for fire sales. Using a comprehensive dataset of mutual funds, we find that funds employing swing pricing exhibit lower liquidity risk and reduced price impact during periods of market stress. Our results suggest that swing pricing can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of liquidity mismatches, thereby enhancing the overall stability and fairness of the mutual fund market. The findings have important implications for regulatory policies aimed at improving liquidity management practices in the financial industry.", "label": 1}
