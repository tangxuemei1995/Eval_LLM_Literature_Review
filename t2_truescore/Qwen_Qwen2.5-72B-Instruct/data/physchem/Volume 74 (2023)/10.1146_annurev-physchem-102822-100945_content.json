{"grounding": "Light-driven phenomena in organic molecular aggregates underpin several mechanisms relevant to optoelectronic applications. Modeling these processes is essential for aiding the design of new materials and optimizing optoelectronic devices. In this review, we cover the use of different atomistic models, excited-state dynamics, and transport approaches for understanding light-activated phenomena in molecular aggregates, including radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. We consider both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms and focus on the role of conical intersections as facilitators of internal conversion. We explore the use of the exciton models for Frenkel and charge transfer states and the electronic structure methods and algorithms commonly applied for excited-state dynamics. Throughout the review, we analyze the approximations employed for the simulation of internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and reverse intersystem crossing rates and analyze the molecular processes behind single fission, triplet-triplet annihilation, Dexter energy transfer, and F\u00f6rster energy transfer.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the excited-state dynamics of molecular organic aggregates, which are crucial for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices. By employing a combination of computational methods and theoretical models, we explore the radiative and nonradiative decay pathways in these aggregates. Our focus is on understanding the role of conical intersections and the interplay between singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation processes. We develop and validate exciton models that accurately describe the energy transfer and relaxation mechanisms within the aggregates. The results provide insights into the design principles for optimizing the performance of organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes, highlighting the importance of controlling the excited-state dynamics at the molecular level.", "label": 1}
