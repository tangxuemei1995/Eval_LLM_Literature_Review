{"grounding": "Interaction analysis techniques, including the many-body expansion (MBE), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, and energy decomposition analysis, allow for an intuitive understanding of complex molecular interactions. We review these methods by first providing a historical context for the study of many-body interactions and discussing how nonadditivities emerge from Hamiltonians containing strictly pairwise-additive interactions. We then elaborate on the synergy between these interaction analysis techniques and the development of advanced force fields aimed at accurately reproducing the Born\u2013Oppenheimer potential energy surface. In particular, we focus on ab initio\u2013based force fields that aim to explicitly reproduce many-body terms and are fitted to high-level electronic structure results. These force fields generally incorporate many-body effects through (a) parameterization of distributed multipoles, (b) explicit fitting of the MBE, (c) inclusion of many-atom features in a neural network, and (d) coarse-graining of many-body terms into an effective two-body term. We also discuss the emerging use of the MBE to improve the accuracy and speed of ab initio molecular dynamics.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate many-body effects in aqueous systems, emphasizing the synergistic relationship between advanced interaction analysis techniques and the development of polarizable force fields. By employing a many-body expansion approach, we dissect the contributions of various intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonding, to the overall stability and dynamics of water. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with state-of-the-art polarizable force fields, reveal the importance of higher-order many-body terms in accurately capturing the collective behavior of water molecules. Our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating these effects in force field models to enhance the predictive power of simulations, particularly in complex biological and environmental contexts. The integration of these methodologies not only advances our fundamental understanding of aqueous systems but also provides a robust framework for the design of more accurate and reliable force fields.", "label": 0}
