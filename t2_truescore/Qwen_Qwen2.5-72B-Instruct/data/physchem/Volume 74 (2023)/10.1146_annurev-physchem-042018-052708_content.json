{"grounding": "Surfaces mediate the formation of stable glasses (SGs) upon physical vapor deposition (PVD) for a wide range of glass formers. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of SGs and their anisotropic packing structures are controlled through the deposition parameters (deposition temperature and rate) as well as the chemical structure and composition of the glass former. The resulting PVD glass properties can therefore be related to the structure and dynamics of the glass surface, which can have oriented packing, enhanced surface diffusion, and a lower glass transition temperature, and can facilitate an enhanced aging rate of the interfacial region. We review our current understanding of the details of this surface-mediated SG formation process and discuss key gaps in our knowledge of glass surface dynamics and their effect on this process.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the formation of stable glasses through surface-mediated equilibration, utilizing physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques. By depositing materials onto substrates under controlled conditions, we observe enhanced surface mobility that facilitates the relaxation of structural anisotropies, leading to glasses with improved stability. The glass transition temperature is significantly elevated, indicating a reduction in the thermodynamic distance from the equilibrium liquid state. Our findings highlight the critical role of surface dynamics in the formation of stable glasses, offering new insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing glass formation and potential applications in advanced materials design.", "label": 0}
