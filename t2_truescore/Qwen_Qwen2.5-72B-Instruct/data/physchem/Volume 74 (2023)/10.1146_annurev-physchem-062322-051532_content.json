{"grounding": "Elementary events that determine photochemical outcomes and molecular functionalities happen on the femtosecond and subfemtosecond timescales. Among the most ubiquitous events are the nonadiabatic dynamics taking place at conical intersections. These facilitate ultrafast, nonradiative transitions between electronic states in molecules that can outcompete slower relaxation mechanisms such as fluorescence. The rise of ultrafast X-ray sources, which provide intense light pulses with ever-shorter durations and larger observation bandwidths, has fundamentally revolutionized our spectroscopic capabilities to detect conical intersections. Recent theoretical studies have demonstrated an entirely new signature emerging once a molecule traverses a conical intersection, giving detailed insights into the coupled nuclear and electronic motions that underlie, facilitate, and ultimately determine the ultrafast molecular dynamics. Following a summary of current sources and experiments, we survey these techniques and provide a unified overview of their capabilities. We discuss their potential to dramatically increase our understanding of ultrafast photochemistry.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, facilitated by free-electron lasers, to investigate elementary molecular events at conical intersections. Conical intersections play a crucial role in photochemical processes, governing the non-adiabatic dynamics that dictate the fate of excited molecules. By employing time-resolved X-ray techniques, we capture the transient structural changes and electronic rearrangements that occur on femtosecond timescales. Our findings reveal the intricate dynamics at these intersections, providing insights into the mechanisms of photoinduced reactions. This research advances the understanding of fundamental photochemical processes and paves the way for the development of new materials and technologies in areas such as solar energy conversion and photocatalysis.", "label": 0}
