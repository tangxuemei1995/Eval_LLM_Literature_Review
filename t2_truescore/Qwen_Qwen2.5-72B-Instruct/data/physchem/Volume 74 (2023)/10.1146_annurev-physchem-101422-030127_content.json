{"grounding": "Phillip L. Geissler made important contributions to the statistical mechanics of biological polymers, heterogeneous materials, and chemical dynamics in aqueous environments. He devised analytical and computational methods that revealed the underlying organization of complex systems at the frontiers of biology, chemistry, and materials science. In this retrospective we celebrate his work at these frontiers.", "generated_text": "This coda commemorates Phillip L. Geissler\u2019s contributions to statistical mechanics, chemical dynamics, and the study of biological systems in aqueous environments. His work on algorithm and model development has significantly advanced our understanding of complex systems, leaving a lasting legacy in the scientific community.", "label": 0}
