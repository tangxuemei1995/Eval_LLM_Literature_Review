{"grounding": "The magneto-optical signatures of colloidal noble metal nanostructures, spanning both discrete nanoclusters (<2 nm) and plasmonic nanoparticles (>2 nm), exhibit rich structure-property correlations, impacting applications including photonic integrated circuits, light modulation, applied spectroscopy, and more. For nanoclusters, electron doping and single-atom substitution modify both the intensity of the magneto-optical response and the degree of transient spin polarization. Nanoparticle size and morphology also modulate the magnitude and polarity of plasmon-mediated magneto-optical signals. This intimate interplay between nanostructure and magneto-optical properties becomes especially apparent in magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) spectroscopic data. Whereas MCD spectroscopy informs on a metal nanostructure's steady-state extinction properties, its MCPL counterpart is sensitive to electronic spin and orbital angular momenta of transiently excited states. This review describes the size- and structure-dependent magneto-optical properties of nanoscale metals, emphasizing the increasingly important role of MCPL in understanding transient spin properties and dynamics.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures, focusing on plasmon-mediated magneto-optics. Noble metal nanostructures, including superatoms, exhibit unique optical and magnetic behaviors due to their size and shape-dependent plasmonic resonances. We explore the spin-polarized emission and magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) in these systems, which are crucial for developing advanced optical devices and sensors. The research employs a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and MCPL. Our findings reveal that the magnetic field can significantly modulate the optical properties of noble metal nanostructures, opening new avenues for the design of magneto-optical materials with tailored functionalities.", "label": 1}
