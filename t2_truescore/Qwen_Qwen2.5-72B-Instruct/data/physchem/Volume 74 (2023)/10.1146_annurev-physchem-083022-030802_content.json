{"grounding": "Reactions at solid\u2013water interfaces play a foundational role in water treatment systems, catalysis, and chemical separations, and in predicting chemical fate and transport in the environment. Over the last century, experimental measurements and computational models have made tremendous progress in capturing reactions at solid surfaces. The interfacial reactivity of a solid surface, however, can change dramatically and unexpectedly when it is confined to the nanoscale. Nanoconfinement can arise in different geometries such as pores/cages (3D confinement), channels (2D confinement), and slits (1D confinement). Therefore, measurements on unconfined surfaces, and molecular models parameterized based on these measurements, fail to capture chemical behaviors under nanoconfinement. This review evaluates recent experimental and theoretical advances, with a focus on adsorption at solid\u2013water interfaces. We review how nanoconfinement alters the physico-chemical properties of water, and how the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water dictate energetics, pathways, and products of adsorption in nanopores. Finally, the implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the adsorption mechanisms at nanoconfined solid\u2013water interfaces, focusing on the role of nanopores and surface complexation in influencing the speciation of adsorbed species. Using a combination of experimental techniques and computational modeling, we explore how nanoconfinement alters the adsorption behavior of various ions and molecules. Results indicate that the unique properties of nanopores, such as reduced dimensionality and enhanced surface-to-volume ratio, significantly affect the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium. Surface complexation models were employed to elucidate the speciation of adsorbed species, revealing the formation of distinct complexes under nanoconfined conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental processes governing adsorption in confined environments, with implications for applications in water purification, catalysis, and environmental remediation.", "label": 1}
