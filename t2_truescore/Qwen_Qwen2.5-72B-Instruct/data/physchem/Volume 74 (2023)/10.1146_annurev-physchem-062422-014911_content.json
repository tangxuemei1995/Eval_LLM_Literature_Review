{"grounding": "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanostructures result in subwavelength optical confinement that enhances light\u2013matter interactions, for example, aiding the sensitivity of surface spectroscopies. The dissipation of surface plasmons as electronic and vibrational excitations sets the limit for field confinement but also provides opportunities for photochemistry, photocatalysis, and photothermal heating. Optimization for either goal requires a deeper understanding of this photothermalization process. In this review, we focus on recent insights into the physics and dynamics governing photothermalization of LSPRs in metallic nanostructures, emphasizing comparisons between the steady-state behavior and ultrafast time-resolved studies. The differences between these regimes inform how to best optimize plasmonic systems for applications under relatively low-intensity, continuous illumination (e.g., sunlight).", "generated_text": "This study investigates the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the steady-state behavior of metallic nanoparticles. Using Raman thermometry, we quantify the temperature distribution and the dynamics of nonthermal carriers, including hot electrons, generated upon light excitation. Our findings reveal that the steady-state regime is characterized by a rapid thermalization process, where hot electrons transfer energy to the lattice, leading to a significant temperature rise. This process is crucial for applications in photocatalysis, where the localized heat can enhance reaction rates. The results provide insights into optimizing the design of plasmonic nanostructures for efficient energy conversion and catalytic processes.", "label": 0}
