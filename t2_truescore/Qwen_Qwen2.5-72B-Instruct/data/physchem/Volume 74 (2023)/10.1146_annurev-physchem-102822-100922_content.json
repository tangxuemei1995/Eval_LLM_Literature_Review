{"grounding": "We review our recent quantum stochastic model for spectroscopic lineshapes in the presence of a coevolving and nonstationary background population of excitations. Starting from a field theory description for interacting bosonic excitons, we derive a reduced model whereby optical excitons are coupled to an incoherent background via scattering as mediated by their screened Coulomb coupling. The Heisenberg equations of motion for the optical excitons are then driven by an auxiliary stochastic population variable, which we take to be the solution of an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process. Here, we present an overview of the theoretical techniques we have developed as applied to predicting coherent nonlinear spectroscopic signals. We show how direct (Coulomb) and exchange coupling to the bath give rise to distinct spectral signatures and discuss mathematical limits on inverting spectral signatures to extract the background density of states.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate interplay between excitation-induced dephasing and many-body effects in the context of exciton scattering, utilizing advanced coherent nonlinear spectroscopy techniques. By applying quantum stochastic calculus, we analyze the optical signatures that emerge from stochastic processes in complex quantum systems. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of exciton scattering are significantly influenced by many-body interactions, leading to distinct spectral features that can be directly observed in nonlinear optical experiments. These results provide a deeper understanding of the underlying quantum dynamics and offer new insights into the control and manipulation of excitonic processes in advanced materials.", "label": 0}
