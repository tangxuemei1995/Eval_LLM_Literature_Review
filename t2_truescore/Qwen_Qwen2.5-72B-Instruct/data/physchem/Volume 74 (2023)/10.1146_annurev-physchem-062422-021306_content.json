{"grounding": "High-resolution vibrational spectra of C\u2013H, O\u2013H, and N\u2013H stretches depend on both molecular conformation and environment as well as provide a window into the frequencies of many other vibrational degrees of freedom as a result of mode mixing. We review current theoretical strategies that are being deployed to both aid and guide the analysis of the data that are encoded in these spectra. The goal is to enhance the power of vibrational spectroscopy as a tool for probing conformational preferences, hydrogen bonding effects away from equilibrium, and energy flow pathways. Recent years have seen an explosion of new methods and strategies for solving the nuclear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Rather than attempt a comprehensive review, this work highlights specific molecular systems that we have chosen as representing bonding motifs that are important to chemistry and biology. We focus on the choices theoretical chemists make regarding the level of electronic structure theory, the representation of the potential energy surface, the selection of coordinates, preferences in basis sets, and methods of solution.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the anharmonic effects on the vibrational spectra of high-frequency modes in molecular systems. By employing advanced computational methods, we analyze the extent of mode mixing and resonances that arise due to anharmonic interactions. Our results demonstrate significant deviations from harmonic approximations, particularly in the high-frequency regime, where anharmonic couplings lead to pronounced mode mixing and spectral shifts. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving the accuracy of vibrational spectroscopy predictions and the interpretation of experimental data. The study highlights the importance of incorporating anharmonic corrections in theoretical models to achieve a more precise understanding of molecular vibrations.", "label": 0}
