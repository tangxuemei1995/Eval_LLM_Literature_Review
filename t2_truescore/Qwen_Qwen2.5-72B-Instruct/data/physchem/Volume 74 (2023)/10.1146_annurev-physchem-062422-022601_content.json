{"grounding": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques are powerful tools to investigate polymer systems. In this review, we address how these techniques have been applied to hydrogel nano- and microparticles, so-called nano- or microgels. We outline which research questions on microgels could be addressed and what new insights could be achieved. Studies of the morphology, shape, and deformation of microgels; their internal compartmentalization; the cross-linker distribution and polarity inside them; and their dynamics and diffusion are summarized. In particular, the abilities to super-resolve structures in three dimensions have boosted the research field and have also allowed researchers to obtain impressive 3D images of deformed microgels. Accessing information beyond 3D localization, such as spectral and lifetime properties and correlative imaging or the combination of data with other methods, shines new light onto polymer systems and helps us understand their complexity in detail. Such future trends and developments are also addressed.", "generated_text": "This study presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, utilizing advanced nanoscopy techniques to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution. Microgels, dynamic and adaptive polymer networks, were labeled with specific fluorescent markers to enable detailed visualization of their internal structure and dynamics. The imaging protocol, combining stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with adaptive optics, allowed for the reconstruction of 3D models with sub-diffraction limit resolution, revealing the intricate polymer network architecture and the distribution of functional components within the microgels. Correlative microscopy techniques were employed to validate the structural information obtained from super-resolution images, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. This method provides a powerful tool for the study of microgel behavior in adaptive materials, offering insights into their mechanical properties and potential applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.", "label": 0}
