{"grounding": "Ground-state Kohn-Sham density functional theory provides, in principle, the exact ground-state energy and electronic spin densities of real interacting electrons in a static external potential. In practice, the exact density functional for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy must be approximated in a computationally efficient way. About 20 mathematical properties of the exact xc functional are known. In this work, we review and discuss these known constraints on the xc energy and hole. By analyzing a sequence of increasingly sophisticated density functional approximations (DFAs), we argue that (a) the satisfaction of more exact constraints and appropriate norms makes a functional more predictive over the immense space of many-electron systems and (b) fitting to bonded systems yields an interpolative DFA that may not extrapolate well to systems unlike those in the fitting set. We discuss both how the class of well-described systems has grown along with constraint satisfaction and the possibilities for future functional development.", "generated_text": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a cornerstone in computational chemistry and materials science, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This study explores the predictive power of DFT by focusing on the role of exact constraints and appropriate norms in the construction of density functionals. We demonstrate that adherence to exact constraints, such as the uniform electron gas limit and the strong-interaction limit, significantly enhances the accuracy of exchange-correlation energy predictions. Furthermore, the use of appropriate norms, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, ensures that the functionals are well-behaved and physically meaningful. Our results show that functionals satisfying these criteria outperform conventional functionals in predicting electronic structures across a diverse set of systems, including molecules, solids, and surfaces. This work underscores the importance of theoretical rigor in the development of density functionals and provides a robust framework for future advancements in DFT.", "label": 1}
