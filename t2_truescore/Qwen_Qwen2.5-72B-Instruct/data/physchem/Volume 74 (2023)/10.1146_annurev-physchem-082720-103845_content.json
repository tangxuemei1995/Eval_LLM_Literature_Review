{"grounding": "Gas-phase molecular spectroscopy is a natural playground for accurate quantum-chemical computations. However, the molecular bricks of life (e.g., DNA bases or amino acids) are challenging systems because of the unfavorable scaling of quantum-chemical models with the molecular size (active electrons) and/or the presence of large-amplitude internal motions. From the theoretical point of view, both aspects prevent the brute-force use of very accurate but very expensive state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methodologies. From the experimental point of view, both features lead to congested gas-phase spectra, whose assignment and interpretation are not at all straightforward. Based on these premises, this review focuses on the current status and perspectives of the fully a priori prediction of the spectral signatures of medium-sized molecules (containing up to two dozen atoms) in the gas phase with special reference to rotational and vibrational spectroscopies of some representative molecular bricks of life.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of computational spectroscopy to elucidate the gas-phase rotational and vibrational spectra of the molecular bricks of life, including amino acids and nucleobases. The inherent flexibility and anharmonicity of these molecules pose significant challenges for accurate spectral prediction. We employ advanced quantum chemical methods and anharmonic force fields to simulate their spectra, comparing the results with experimental data. The findings highlight the importance of considering anharmonic effects to achieve precise spectral assignments, which are crucial for understanding the fundamental properties and interactions of these essential biomolecules. This work advances the field of computational spectroscopy, providing a robust framework for the analysis of complex molecular systems in the gas phase.", "label": 0}
