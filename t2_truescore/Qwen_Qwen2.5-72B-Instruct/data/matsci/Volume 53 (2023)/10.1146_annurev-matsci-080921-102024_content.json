{"grounding": "Most heterogeneous catalytic processes occur between combinations of gases, liquids, and solids at elevated temperatures. They play a critical role for society in energy production, health care, a cleaner environment, industrial products, food, fuel cells, battery technologies, and photocatalysis. Dynamic gas\u2013solid catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level, with active catalyst structures forming, and often also progressively and competitively deactivating, under reaction conditions. There is increasing evidence that single atoms and small clusters of atoms can act as primary active sites in catalytic reactions. Understanding and directing the reactions at the atomic level under controlled operating conditions are crucial for the development of improved materials and processes. We review advances in dynamic in situ microscopy for directly probing heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic level in live action and real time. Benefits include new knowledge and improved management of process fundamentals for greater efficiency and sustainability.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of dynamic in situ electron microscopy (DISEM) to observe live-action single-atom catalysis, marking a significant advancement in the field of chemical research. By integrating advanced microscopy techniques with real-time catalytic processes, we were able to visualize the structural and chemical transformations of single-atom catalysts under reaction conditions. The results provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of catalytic activity and stability, revealing the dynamic nature of single-atom sites and their interactions with reactants. This approach not only enhances our fundamental understanding of catalytic processes but also opens new avenues for the design and optimization of more efficient and robust catalysts. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, potentially impacting areas such as energy conversion, environmental remediation, and industrial chemistry.", "label": 0}
