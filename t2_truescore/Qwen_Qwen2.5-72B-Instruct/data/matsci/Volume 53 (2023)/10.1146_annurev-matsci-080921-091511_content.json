{"grounding": "Grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials migrate to reduce the total excess energy. It has recently been found that the factors governing migration rates of boundaries in bicrystals are insufficient to explain boundary migration in polycrystals. We first review our current understanding of the atomistic mechanisms of grain boundary migration based on simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. We then review our current understanding at the continuum scale based on simulations and observations using high-energy diffraction microscopy. We conclude that detailed comparisons of experimental observations with atomistic simulations of migration in polycrystals (rather than bicrystals) are required to better understand the mechanisms of grain boundary migration, that the driving force for grain boundary migration in polycrystals must include factors other than curvature, and that current simulations of grain growth are insufficient for reproducing experimental observations, possibly because of an inadequate representation of the driving force.", "generated_text": "Grain boundary migration is a critical process in the evolution of microstructure in polycrystalline materials, significantly influencing their mechanical and physical properties. This study investigates the mechanisms and kinetics of grain boundary migration in various polycrystalline systems, focusing on the role of thermal energy, applied stress, and solute segregation. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and computational modeling, we elucidate the factors that govern grain growth and the stability of grain boundaries. The findings reveal that the migration rate is highly dependent on the grain boundary character and the presence of impurities, which can either enhance or impede the movement of grain boundaries. These insights provide a foundation for the development of advanced materials with tailored microstructures and improved performance.", "label": 1}
