{"grounding": "High-throughput data generation methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms have given rise to a new era of computational materials science by learning the relations between composition, structure, and properties and by exploiting such relations for design. However, to build these connections, materials data must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be processed by an ML model. Data sets in materials science vary in format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models vary in scope and properties of interest. Here, we review context-dependent strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as inputs or outputs for ML models. Furthermore, we discuss how modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact questions that have not been fully resolved and thus require further investigation.", "generated_text": "The success of machine learning (ML) in materials science hinges on the effective representation of materials' properties and structures. This review explores various representation methods, including feature engineering techniques that capture the essential characteristics of materials, such as chemical composition, crystal structure, and electronic properties. We discuss the application of generative models to create new materials with desired properties, and the integration of graph-based and spectral methods to represent complex crystal structures. The review highlights the importance of domain-specific knowledge in feature selection and the potential of deep learning approaches to automate the representation process. Case studies demonstrate the impact of these methods on predicting material properties and accelerating materials discovery.", "label": 1}
