{"grounding": "Hydrous transition metal oxides (TMOs) are redox-active materials that confine structural water within their bulk, organized in 1D, 2D, or 3D networks. In an electrochemical cell, hydrous TMOs can interact with electrolyte species not only via their outer surface but also via their hydrous inner surface, which can transport electrolyte species to the interior of the material. Many TMOs operating in an aqueous electrochemical environment transform to hydrous TMOs, which then serve as the electrochemically active phase. This review summarizes the physicochemical properties of hydrous TMOs and recent mechanistic insights into their behavior in electrochemical reactions of interest for energy storage, conversion, and environmental applications. Particular focus is placed on first-principles calculations and operando characterization to obtain an atomistic view of their electrochemical mechanisms. Hydrous TMOs represent an important class of energy and environmental materials in aqueous and nonaqueous environments. Further understanding of their interaction with electrolyte species is likely to yield advancements in electrochemical reactivity and kinetics for energy and environmental applications.", "generated_text": "This review focuses on the recent advancements in the application of hydrous transition metal oxides (HTMOs) for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, as well as environmental remediation. HTMOs, characterized by their unique structural water content, exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties that make them promising candidates for various applications. The presence of structural water facilitates ion insertion and de-insertion processes, enhancing the rate capability and cycling stability of these materials. This work highlights the role of structural water in modulating the electrochemical performance of HTMOs, including their use in supercapacitors, batteries, and water splitting. Additionally, the environmental applications of HTMOs, such as the removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants from water, are discussed. The review also addresses the challenges and future perspectives in the design and synthesis of HTMOs to optimize their performance for practical applications.", "label": 1}
