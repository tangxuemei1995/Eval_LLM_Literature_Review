{"grounding": "If variety is the spice of life, then abnormal grain growth (AGG) may be the materials processing equivalent of sriracha sauce. Abnormally growing grains can be prismatic, dendritic, or practically any shape in between. When they grow at least an order of magnitude larger than their neighbors in the matrix\u2014a state we call extreme AGG\u2014we can examine the abnormal/matrix interface for clues to the underlying mechanism. Simulating AGG for various formulations of the grain boundary (GB) equation of motion, we show that anisotropies in GB mobility and energy leave a characteristic fingerprint in the abnormal/matrix boundary. Except in the case of prismatic growth, the morphological signature of most reported instances of AGG is consistent with a certain degree of GB mobility variability. Open questions remain, however, concerning the mechanism by which the corresponding growth advantage is established and maintained as the GBs of abnormal grains advance through the matrix.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the mechanisms and microstructural outcomes of extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) in polycrystalline materials. By examining the interplay between grain boundary energy and mobility, we elucidate the conditions under which EAGG occurs, leading to the formation of exceptionally large grains. The role of Zener pinning, where second-phase particles impede grain boundary motion, is critically assessed to understand its impact on the grain growth kinetics. Experimental results and microstructural analyses reveal that a combination of high grain boundary energy and reduced pinning effectiveness can trigger EAGG, resulting in a bimodal grain size distribution. These findings provide insights into the control of microstructure in materials processing, with implications for enhancing mechanical properties and performance.", "label": 1}
