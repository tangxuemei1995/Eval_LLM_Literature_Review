{"grounding": "Natural wood has been used for construction, fuel, and furniture for thousands of years because of its versatility, renewability, and aesthetic appeal. However, new opportunities for wood are arising as researchers have developed ways to tune the material's optical, thermal, mechanical, and ionic transport properties by chemically and physically modifying wood's naturally porous structure and chemical composition. Such modifications can be used to produce sustainable, functional materials for various emerging applications such as automobiles, construction, energy storage, and environmental remediation. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in engineered wood for sustainable technologies, including thermal and light management, environmental remediation, nanofluidics, batteries, and structural materials with high strength-to-weight ratios. Additionally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future of wood research are discussed, providing a guideline for the further development of next-generation, sustainable wood-based materials.", "generated_text": "This review explores the advancements in engineered wood technologies, focusing on the integration of nanocellulose and the development of transparent wood, which offer significant potential for sustainable construction and thermal management. Engineered wood products, such as cross-laminated timber and fiber-reinforced composites, have gained attention for their environmental benefits and structural performance. The incorporation of nanocellulose enhances mechanical properties and provides new functionalities, such as improved thermal insulation and moisture resistance. Transparent wood, achieved through delignification and polymer impregnation, opens avenues for energy-efficient building materials that can transmit light while maintaining structural integrity. These innovations not only contribute to sustainable building practices but also address the growing demand for eco-friendly materials in various industries. This paper discusses the current state of research, challenges, and future prospects of engineered wood technologies, highlighting their role in advancing sustainable construction and thermal management solutions.", "label": 0}
