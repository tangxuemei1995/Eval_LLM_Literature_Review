{"grounding": "Tailor-made additives (TMAs) have found a role in crystal morphology engineering and control by specific binding to crystal surfaces through stereo-chemical recognition. The utility of TMAs, however, has been largely limited to crystal growth from solutions. In this review, we illustrate examples where TMAs have been used to influence the growth of crystals during cooling of their melts. In solution, the crystal growth driving force is governed by solute supersaturation, which corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium. In growth from melts, however, undercooling is the important thermodynamic parameter responsible for crystallization outcomes, a key difference that can influence the manner in which TMAs affect growth kinetics, crystal morphology, nucleation, enantioselective surface recognition, and the determination of the absolute sense of polar axes. When the crystallization driving force in a melt is small and diffusion is comparatively high, TMAs can exert their influence on well-faceted single crystals with the stereochemical richness observed in solution growth. Under high supercooling, where the driving force is large, ensembles of crystals can grow radially, masking stereochemical information and requiring new optical tools for understanding the influence of TMAs on emerging crystals.", "generated_text": "The use of tailor-made additives in the melt crystallization process of molecular crystals is explored to understand their impact on crystal morphology and properties. This study investigates the role of additives in the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals, with a particular focus on the influence of chirality and polarity. Through a combination of experimental techniques and computational modeling, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of additives can significantly alter the growth kinetics and the final crystal structure. The results indicate that additives with complementary chirality and polarity to the host molecules can promote the formation of unique crystal morphologies, such as twisted spherulites, which exhibit enhanced optical and mechanical properties. However, the effectiveness of these additives is highly dependent on their concentration and the specific molecular interactions within the crystalline system. This research provides valuable insights into the design of additives for the controlled growth of molecular crystals, highlighting both the potential benefits and the challenges associated with this approach.", "label": 1}
