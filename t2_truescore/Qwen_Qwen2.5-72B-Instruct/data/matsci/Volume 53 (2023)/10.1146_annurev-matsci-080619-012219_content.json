{"grounding": "The energy-efficient manipulation of the properties of functional materials is of great interest from both a scientific and an applied perspective. The application of electric fields is one of the most widely used methods to induce significant changes in the properties of materials, such as their structural, transport, magnetic, and optical properties. This article presents an overview of recent research on the manipulation of the electronic and magnetic properties of various material systems via electrolyte-based ionic gating. Oxides, magnetic thin-film heterostructures, and van der Waals 2D layers are discussed as exemplary systems. The detailed mechanisms through which ionic gating can induce significant changes in material properties, including their crystal and electronic structure and their electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, are summarized. Current and potential future functional devices enabled by such ionic control mechanisms are also briefly summarized, especially with respect to the emerging field of neuromorphic computing. Finally, a brief outlook and some key challenges are presented.", "generated_text": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for modulating the electronic and magnetic properties of materials, particularly in transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals 2D materials. This method involves the controlled movement of ions within a material, which can induce significant changes in its electronic structure and magnetic behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that ionic gating can enhance superconductivity in certain materials, stabilize novel magnetic phases, and even enable the reversible tuning of electronic properties. These advancements have significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic and spintronic devices, including those for neuromorphic computing. This review highlights the latest progress in ionic gating techniques, their impact on material properties, and the potential applications in advanced technological systems.", "label": 1}
