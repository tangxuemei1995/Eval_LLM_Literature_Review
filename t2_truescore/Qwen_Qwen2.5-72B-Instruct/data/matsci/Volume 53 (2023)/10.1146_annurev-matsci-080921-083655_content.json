{"grounding": "The increasing consumption of nonrenewable materials urgently calls for the design and fabrication of sustainable alternatives. New generations of materials should be derived from renewable sources, processed using environmentally friendly methods, and designed considering their full life cycle, especially their end-of-life fate. Here, we review recent advances in developing sustainable polymers from biological matter (biomatter), including progress in the extraction and utilization of bioderived monomers and polymers, as well as the emergence of polymers produced directly from unprocessed biomatter (entire cells or tissues). We also discuss applications of sustainable polymers in bioplastics, biocomposites, and cementitious biomaterials, with emphasis on relating their performance to underlying fundamental mechanisms. Finally, we provide a future outlook for sustainable material development, highlighting the need for more accurate and accessible tools for assessing life-cycle impacts and socioeconomic challenges as this field advances.", "generated_text": "This review highlights recent advancements in the development of sustainable polymers derived from biological matter, emphasizing their potential to replace traditional petrochemical-based materials. The focus is on biopolymers and biocomposites, which are increasingly being utilized in various applications, including construction and packaging. Key areas of progress include the enhancement of mechanical properties, thermal stability, and biodegradability of these materials. The integration of renewable resources, such as lignocellulosic fibers and agricultural by-products, into cementitious materials is also discussed, showcasing their role in reducing environmental impact. The review concludes with an outlook on future research directions, emphasizing the need for scalable and economically viable processes to facilitate the widespread adoption of sustainable polymers.", "label": 1}
