{"grounding": "Owing to its unique structure, morphology, and crystal quality, low-dimensional (L-D) ice has attracted increasing attention in recent years. With a size (at least in one dimension) between that of a single water molecule and a snowflake, L-D ice does not only appear as an intermediate state during the dimensional change but can also manifest extraordinary characteristics, from its molecular structures to its physical properties, which offer exciting opportunities for a better understanding and utilization of ice. In this article, we start with a brief introduction to the crystal growth, structure, and typical characterization techniques of ice and then review recent progress in the study of crystal growth, molecular structures, phase morphologies, and physical properties of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional (0-, 1-, and 2D) ice. Extraordinary behaviors of ice in low dimensions and extreme conditions are highlighted. Finally, the future outlook for the physical study and technological applications of L-D ice is briefly discussed.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the unique properties of low-dimensional and confined ice, focusing on its crystal growth, morphology, and physical properties. Using advanced characterization techniques, we explore how confinement in nanoscale environments affects the formation and stability of ice structures. Our findings reveal that the morphology of ice in confined spaces deviates significantly from bulk ice, exhibiting distinct low-dimensional structures. These structures display altered optical and mechanical properties, which are crucial for understanding ice behavior in various natural and technological contexts. The interface between ice and confining materials plays a critical role in determining the growth kinetics and final morphology of the ice crystals. This research provides valuable insights into the fundamental aspects of ice formation and has implications for fields such as materials science, environmental science, and cryobiology.", "label": 1}
