{"grounding": "We review the class of materials known as polar metals, in which polarity and metallicity coexist in the same phase. While the notion of polar metals was first invoked more than 50 years ago, their practical realization has proved challenging since the itinerant carriers required for metallicity tend to screen any polarization. Huge progress has been made in the last decade, with many mechanisms for combining polarity and metallicity proposed and the first examples, LiOsO3 and WTe2, identified experimentally. The availability of polar metallic samples has opened a new paradigm in polar metal research, with implications in the fields of topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity, spintronics, and superconductivity. Here, we review the principles and techniques that have been developed to design and engineer polar metals and describe some of their interesting properties, with a focus on the most promising directions for future work.", "generated_text": "Polar metals, a class of materials that simultaneously exhibit metallic conductivity and spontaneous electric polarization, have emerged as a fascinating subject of condensed matter physics. This review explores the fundamental principles and recent advancements in the field of polar metals, with a focus on perovskite-based materials. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity, often mutually exclusive properties, is discussed in the context of improper ferroelectricity, where the polarization arises from a structural distortion rather than a direct charge displacement. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have unveiled the unique electronic and magnetic properties of these materials, opening new avenues for applications in next-generation electronic devices. The prospects for engineering polar metals with tailored functionalities through strain engineering and interface design are also highlighted, underscoring the potential of these materials in advanced technological applications.", "label": 1}
