{"grounding": "The evolution of IgE in mammals added an extra layer of immune protection at body surfaces to provide a rapid and local response against antigens from the environment. The IgE immune response employs potent expulsive and inflammatory forces against local antigen provocation, at the risk of damaging host tissues and causing allergic disease. Two well-known IgE receptors, the high-affinity Fc\u03b5RI and low-affinity CD23, mediate the activities of IgE. Unlike other known antibody receptors, CD23 also regulates IgE expression, maintaining IgE homeostasis. This mechanism evolved by adapting the function of the complement receptor CD21. Recent insights into the dynamic character of IgE structure, its resultant capacity for allosteric modulation, and the potential for ligand-induced dissociation have revealed previously unappreciated mechanisms for regulation of IgE and IgE complexes. We describe recent research, highlighting structural studies of the IgE network of proteins to analyze the uniquely versatile activities of IgE and anti-IgE biologics.", "generated_text": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in allergic responses and is characterized by its unique structure and interactions with Fc\u03b5RI and CD23 receptors. This review elucidates the molecular architecture of IgE, focusing on the constant and variable regions that confer its specificity and effector functions. The Fc\u03b5RI, a high-affinity receptor, is primarily expressed on mast cells and basophils, mediating immediate hypersensitivity reactions. CD23, a low-affinity receptor, is involved in the presentation of allergens and the regulation of IgE production. Recent advances in biologics, such as omalizumab, target the Fc region of IgE, blocking its binding to Fc\u03b5RI and CD23, thereby reducing allergic inflammation. The mechanisms of action of these anti-IgE biologics involve allosteric modulation, which alters the conformation of IgE and its receptors, disrupting downstream signaling pathways. Understanding these intricate interactions provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for allergic diseases.", "label": 1}
