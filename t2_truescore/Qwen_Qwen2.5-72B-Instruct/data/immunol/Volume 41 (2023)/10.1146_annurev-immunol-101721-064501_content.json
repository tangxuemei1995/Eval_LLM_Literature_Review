{"grounding": "There is a dramatic remodeling of the T cell compartment during aging. The most notorious changes are the reduction of the naive T cell pool and the accumulation of memory-like T cells. Memory-like T cells in older people acquire a phenotype of terminally differentiated cells, lose the expression of costimulatory molecules, and acquire properties of senescent cells. In this review, we focus on the different subsets of age-associated T cells that accumulate during aging. These subsets include extremely cytotoxic T cells with natural killer properties, exhausted T cells with altered cytokine production, and regulatory T cells that gain proinflammatory features. Importantly, all of these subsets lose their lymph node homing capacity and migrate preferentially to nonlymphoid tissues, where they contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammaging.", "generated_text": "Aging is associated with a decline in immune function, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, which is characterized by the accumulation of highly differentiated T cell subsets. These subsets, marked by altered phenotypes and functions, contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue deterioration. Thymus involution, a hallmark of aging, reduces the output of na\u00efve T cells, leading to an expansion of memory and effector T cells. This shift in the T cell repertoire exacerbates senescence and inflammation, impacting various tissues. Recent studies have identified specific T cell subsets, such as senescence-associated T cells, that play a pivotal role in age-related tissue damage. Understanding the mechanisms by which these subsets contribute to tissue deterioration may provide new therapeutic targets for mitigating the effects of aging.", "label": 1}
