{"grounding": "Type 2 immunity mediates protective responses to helminths and pathological responses to allergens, but it also has broad roles in the maintenance of tissue integrity, including wound repair. Type 2 cytokines are known to promote fibrosis, an overzealous repair response, but their contribution to healthy wound repair is less well understood. This review discusses the evidence that the canonical type 2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are integral to the tissue repair process through two main pathways. First, essential for the progression of effective tissue repair, IL-4 and IL-13 suppress the initial inflammatory response to injury. Second, these cytokines regulate how the extracellular matrix is modified, broken down, and rebuilt for effective repair. IL-4 and/or IL-13 amplifies multiple aspects of the tissue repair response, but many of these pathways are highly redundant and can be induced by other signals. Therefore, the exact contribution of IL-4R\u03b1 signaling remains difficult to unravel.", "generated_text": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key cytokines in type 2 immune responses, playing critical roles in wound repair and tissue homeostasis. These cytokines modulate inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, essential processes for effective wound healing. Both IL-4 and IL-13 activate signaling pathways that enhance fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, promoting ECM deposition and tissue integrity. Additionally, they regulate the recruitment and activation of immune cells, such as macrophages and eosinophils, which contribute to the resolution of inflammation and the promotion of tissue repair. Studies in helminth infections and models of tissue injury have highlighted the dual role of these cytokines in both protecting against pathogens and facilitating wound healing. However, dysregulated IL-4 and IL-13 signaling can lead to excessive fibrosis and impaired wound healing, underscoring the delicate balance required for optimal tissue repair.", "label": 1}
