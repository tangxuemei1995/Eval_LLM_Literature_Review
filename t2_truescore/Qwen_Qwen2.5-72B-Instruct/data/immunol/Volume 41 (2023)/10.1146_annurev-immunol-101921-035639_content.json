{"grounding": "The complement system is an ancient collection of proteolytic cascades with well-described roles in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. With the convergence of a revolution in complement-directed clinical therapeutics, the discovery of specific complement-associated targetable pathways in the central nervous system, and the development of integrated multi-omic technologies that have all emerged over the last 15 years, precision therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and processes appears to be within reach. As a sensor of tissue distress, the complement system protects the brain from microbial challenge as well as the accumulation of dead and/or damaged molecules and cells. Additional more recently discovered diverse functions of complement make it of paramount importance to design complement-directed neurotherapeutics such that the beneficial roles in neurodevelopment, adult neural plasticity, and neuroprotective functions of the complement system are retained.", "generated_text": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in brain function and pathology. Specifically, C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement pathway, is involved in synaptic pruning, a process essential for neuronal plasticity and circuit refinement. Recent studies highlight the dual role of complement in neuroprotection and neuroinflammation, with microglia serving as key effectors. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dysregulated complement activation contributes to excessive synaptic loss and chronic inflammation, exacerbating disease progression. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms by which complement mediates neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation, and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting complement pathways to mitigate neurodegenerative processes.", "label": 1}
