{"grounding": "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-\u03b2 maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-\u03b2 is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-\u03b2 is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-\u03b2 regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.", "generated_text": "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of T cell function, influencing the development, differentiation, and activation of various T cell subsets. In CD4+ T helper cells, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) while inhibiting the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. In CD8+ T cells, TGF-\u03b2 can induce anergy or promote the development of memory T cells, depending on the context. TGF-\u03b2 also modulates the function of innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, contributing to mucosal immunity and tissue repair. Additionally, TGF-\u03b2 is crucial for maintaining T cell quiescence and can inhibit T cell activation, thus preventing excessive immune responses. Understanding the complex interplay between TGF-\u03b2 and T cell subsets is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses in various diseases.", "label": 1}
