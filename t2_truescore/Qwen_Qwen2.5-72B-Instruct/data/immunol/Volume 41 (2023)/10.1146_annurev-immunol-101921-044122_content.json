{"grounding": "T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have complementary roles in tumor immunity, and dual T cell and NK cell attack thus offers opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. Recent work has also shown that NK cells play an important role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors and thus enhance induction of CD8 T cell responses, while IL-2 secreted by T cells activates NK cells. Targeting of immune evasion mechanisms from the activating NKG2D receptor and its MICA and MICB ligands on tumor cells offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance T cell\u2013 and NK cell\u2013mediated immunity. These inhibitory receptor-ligand systems include CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines that profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors.", "generated_text": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to harness the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. This study focuses on the design of novel immunotherapies that simultaneously engage T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to enhance antitumor responses. By utilizing bispecific antibodies and engineered cytokines, we aim to bridge the gap between these two critical components of the immune system. Our results demonstrate that the combination of T cell and NK cell activation leads to a synergistic effect, resulting in more effective tumor cell lysis and a reduction in tumor burden in preclinical models. Furthermore, the therapy shows potential for overcoming resistance mechanisms often observed in monotherapies. These findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of dual-targeting immunotherapies to improve outcomes for cancer patients.", "label": 1}
