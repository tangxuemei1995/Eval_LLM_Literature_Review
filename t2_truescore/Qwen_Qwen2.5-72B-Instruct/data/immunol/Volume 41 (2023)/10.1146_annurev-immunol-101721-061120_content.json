{"grounding": "A large body of evidence generated in the last two and a half years addresses the roles of T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and following vaccination. Infection or vaccination induces multi-epitope CD4 and CD8 T cell responses with polyfunctionality. Early T cell responses have been associated with mild COVID-19 outcomes. In concert with animal model data, these results suggest that while antibody responses are key to prevent infection, T cell responses may also play valuable roles in reducing disease severity and controlling infection. T cell memory after vaccination is sustained for at least six months. While neutralizing antibody responses are impacted by SARS-CoV-2 variants, most CD4 and CD8 T cell responses are preserved. This review highlights the extensive progress made, and the data and knowledge gaps that remain, in our understanding of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the impact of viral variants, infection, and vaccination on disease severity. By analyzing epitope-specific T cell responses in a cohort of individuals with varying exposure to SARS-CoV-2, we found that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play crucial roles in controlling viral replication and modulating disease outcomes. Our results indicate that T cell responses are generally robust across different variants, although some mutations can affect epitope recognition. Vaccination was associated with enhanced T cell responses, which correlated with reduced disease severity. These findings underscore the importance of T cell immunity in the context of evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlight the potential for T cell-based strategies in vaccine development and therapeutic interventions.", "label": 0}
