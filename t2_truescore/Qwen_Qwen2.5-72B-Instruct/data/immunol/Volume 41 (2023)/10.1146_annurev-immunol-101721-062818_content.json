{"grounding": "The epithelial tissues that line our body, such as the skin and gut, have remarkable regenerative prowess and continually renew throughout our lifetimes. Owing to their barrier function, these tissues have also evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms to swiftly heal and limit the penetration of harmful agents following injury. Researchers now appreciate that epithelial regeneration and repair are not autonomous processes but rely on a dynamic cross talk with immunity. A wealth of clinical and experimental data point to the functional coupling of reparative and inflammatory responses as two sides of the same coin. Here we bring to the fore the immunological signals that underlie homeostatic epithelial regeneration and restitution following damage. We review our current understanding of how immune cells contribute to distinct phases of repair. When unchecked, immune-mediated repair programs are co-opted to fuel epithelial pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, understanding the reparative functions of immunity may advance therapeutic innovation in regenerative medicine and epithelial inflammatory diseases.", "generated_text": "The intricate dialogue between immune cells and epithelial tissues plays a pivotal role in the processes of regeneration and repair. This cross talk is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to injury or infection. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of immune mediators in modulating the behavior of epithelial stem cells, which are crucial for tissue regeneration. Inflammatory signals can both promote and inhibit repair, depending on the context and the specific immune cells involved. For instance, macrophages and T cells can secrete factors that enhance stem cell proliferation and differentiation, while excessive inflammation can lead to chronic tissue damage and fibrosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction is critical for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue repair and prevent inflammatory diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the immune-epithelial cross talk, emphasizing its implications for regenerative medicine and the treatment of inflammatory disorders.", "label": 1}
