{"grounding": "Over the last decade, immunometabolism has emerged as a novel interdisciplinary field of research and yielded significant fundamental insights into the regulation of immune responses. Multiple classical approaches to interrogate immunometabolism, including bulk metabolic profiling and analysis of metabolic regulator expression, paved the way to appreciating the physiological complexity of immunometabolic regulation in vivo. Studying immunometabolism at the systems level raised the need to transition towards the next-generation technology for metabolic profiling and analysis. Spatially resolved metabolic imaging and computational algorithms for multi-modal data integration are new approaches to connecting metabolism and immunity. In this review, we discuss recent studies that highlight the complex physiological interplay between immune responses and metabolism and give an overview of technological developments that bear the promise of capturing this complexity most directly and comprehensively.", "generated_text": "Systems immunology approaches are increasingly being applied to unravel the complex interplay between immune responses and metabolic processes. By integrating high-throughput data from transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging, these methods offer a comprehensive view of immunometabolism. Computational biology tools enable the modeling of dynamic interactions within immune cells, revealing how metabolic pathways influence immune function and vice versa. This review highlights recent advances in using systems immunology to understand the regulatory networks that govern immune cell metabolism, with implications for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders and immune-related diseases.", "label": 1}
