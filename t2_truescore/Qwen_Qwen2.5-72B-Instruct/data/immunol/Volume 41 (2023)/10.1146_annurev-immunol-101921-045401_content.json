{"grounding": "Characterization of RNA modifications has identified their distribution features and molecular functions. Dynamic changes in RNA modification on various forms of RNA are essential for the development and function of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the value of innovative RNA modification profiling technologies to uncover the function of these diverse, dynamic RNA modifications in various immune cells within healthy and diseased contexts. Further, we explore our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby aberrant RNA modifications modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment and point out outstanding research questions.", "generated_text": "RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), play crucial roles in the regulation of immune responses. These modifications influence the epitranscriptome, affecting gene expression and RNA stability. In antiviral immunity, m6A modifications enhance the recognition and clearance of viral pathogens. In antitumor immunity, RNA modifications modulate the tumor microenvironment, influencing the activation and function of immune cells. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related diseases.", "label": 0}
