{"grounding": "Autoreactive B cells and interferons are central players in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. The partial success of drugs targeting these pathways, however, supports heterogeneity in upstream mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent insights from genetic and immune monitoring studies of patients that are refining our understanding of these basic mechanisms. Among them, novel mutations in genes affecting intrinsic B cell activation or clearance of interferogenic nucleic acids have been described. Mitochondria have emerged as relevant inducers and/or amplifiers of SLE pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms that include disruption of organelle integrity or compartmentalization, defective metabolism, and failure of quality control measures. These result in extra- or intracellular release of interferogenic nucleic acids as well as in innate and/or adaptive immune cell activation. A variety of classic and novel SLE autoantibody specificities have been found to recapitulate genetic alterations associated with monogenic lupus or to trigger interferogenic amplification loops. Finally, atypical B cells and novel extrafollicular T helper cell subsets have been proposed to contribute to the generation of SLE autoantibodies. Overall, these novel insights provide opportunities to deepen the immunophenotypic surveillance of patients and open the door to patient stratification and personalized, rational approaches to therapy.", "generated_text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and the production of autoantibodies. While the pathogenesis of SLE is multifaceted, recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of interferons (IFNs) in disease progression. IFNs, particularly type I IFNs, are overexpressed in SLE patients and contribute to the activation of immune cells, leading to increased production of autoantibodies and systemic inflammation. However, the pathogenesis of SLE extends beyond the interferon pathway. Cell death, particularly necroptosis and apoptosis, plays a critical role in the release of self-antigens, which can be recognized by the immune system, leading to the formation of immune complexes. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also emerged as a significant factor, as damaged mitochondria can release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that exacerbate inflammation. Additionally, the extrafollicular activation of B cells, which occurs outside of germinal centers, contributes to the rapid production of autoantibodies and the perpetuation of the autoimmune response. This review integrates these key aspects of SLE pathogenesis, emphasizing the interplay between interferon signaling, cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, and B cell activation, and highlights potential therapeutic targets for intervention.", "label": 1}
