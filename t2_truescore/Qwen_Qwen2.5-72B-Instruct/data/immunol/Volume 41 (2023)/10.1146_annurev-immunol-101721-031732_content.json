{"grounding": "The innate immune system detects pathogens via germline-encoded receptors that bind to conserved pathogen ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Here we consider an additional strategy of pathogen sensing called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI involves detection of pathogen-encoded virulence factors, also called effectors. Pathogens produce effectors to manipulate hosts to create a replicative niche and/or block host immunity. Unlike PAMPs, effectors are often diverse and rapidly evolving and can thus be unsuitable targets for direct detection by germline-encoded receptors. Effectors are instead often sensed indirectly via detection of their virulence activities. ETI is a viable strategy for pathogen sensing and is used across diverse phyla, including plants, but the molecular mechanisms of ETI are complex compared to simple receptor/ligand-based PAMP detection. Here we survey the mechanisms and functions of ETI, with a particular focus on emerging insights from animal studies. We suggest that many examples of ETI may remain to be discovered, hiding in plain sight throughout immunology.", "generated_text": "Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) is a sophisticated defense mechanism in plants that recognizes specific pathogen-derived effector proteins, distinguishing it from the more general Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI). ETI is activated when plant resistance (R) proteins, often nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, directly or indirectly detect the presence of pathogen effectors. This recognition triggers a robust immune response, including localized cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and the upregulation of defense-related genes. Recent studies have revealed that ETI can also involve the concept of 'guard immunity,' where R proteins monitor the integrity of host targets that are manipulated by pathogen effectors. This intricate surveillance system ensures that even subtle virulence strategies are countered, providing a layered defense against a wide range of pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of ETI is crucial for developing strategies to enhance plant resistance in agricultural settings.", "label": 0}
