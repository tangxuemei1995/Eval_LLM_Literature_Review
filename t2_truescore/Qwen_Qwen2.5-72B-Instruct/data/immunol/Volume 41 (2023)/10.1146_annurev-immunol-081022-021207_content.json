{"grounding": "As an important sensor in the innate immune system, NLRP3 detects exogenous pathogenic invasions and endogenous cellular damage and responds by forming the NLRP3 inflammasome, a supramolecular complex that activates caspase-1. The three major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are NLRP3, which captures the danger signals and recruits downstream molecules; caspase-1, which elicits maturation of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and processing of gasdermin D to mediate cytokine release and pyroptosis; and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which functions as a bridge connecting NLRP3 and caspase-1. In this article, we review the structural information that has been obtained on the NLRP3 inflammasome and its components or subcomplexes, with special focus on the inactive NLRP3 cage, the active NLRP3-NEK7 (NIMA-related kinase 7)-ASC inflammasome disk, and the PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD homotypic filamentous scaffolds of the inflammasome. We further implicate structure-derived mechanisms for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "generated_text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in innate immunity by assembling a multiprotein complex that activates caspase-1, leading to the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Recent structural studies have elucidated the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. The NLRP3 protein, upon activation, oligomerizes and recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which forms filamentous structures. These ASC filaments serve as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1, facilitating its autocatalytic cleavage into active caspase-1. High-resolution cryo-EM structures have revealed the intricate details of these interactions, including the specific domains involved in NLRP3-ASC and ASC-caspase-1 binding. Understanding these structural mechanisms provides insights into the regulation of inflammasome activity and potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases.", "label": 1}
