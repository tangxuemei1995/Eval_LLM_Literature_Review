{"grounding": "Myeloid cells are a significant proportion of leukocytes within tissues, comprising granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. With the identification of various myeloid cells that perform separate but complementary functions during homeostasis and disease, our understanding of tissue myeloid cells has evolved significantly. Exciting findings from transcriptomics profiling and fate-mapping mouse models have facilitated the identification of their developmental origins, maturation, and tissue-specific specializations. This review highlights the current understanding of tissue myeloid cells and the contributing factors of functional heterogeneity to better comprehend the complex and dynamic immune interactions within the healthy or inflamed tissue. Specifically, we discuss the new understanding of the contributions of granulocyte-monocyte progenitor\u2013derived phagocytes to tissue myeloid cell heterogeneity as well as the impact of niche-specific factors on monocyte and neutrophil phenotype and function. Lastly, we explore the developing paradigm of myeloid cell heterogeneity during inflammation and disease.", "generated_text": "Tissue myeloid cells, including macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, play critical roles in immune responses and tissue homeostasis. These cells originate from granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and exhibit significant heterogeneity in their functions and phenotypes across different tissues. Recent advances in fate-mapping and single-cell transcriptomics have elucidated the distinct developmental pathways and niches that influence the differentiation and function of GMP-derived cells. This review highlights the current understanding of the origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, emphasizing the role of GMPs in generating monocytes and neutrophils. We discuss how tissue-specific microenvironments and reprogramming events contribute to the diversity of myeloid cell functions, providing insights into their roles in health and disease.", "label": 1}
