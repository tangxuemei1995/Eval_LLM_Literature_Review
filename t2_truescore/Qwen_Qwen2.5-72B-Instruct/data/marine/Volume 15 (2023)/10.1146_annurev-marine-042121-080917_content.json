{"grounding": "To thrive in nutrient-poor waters, coral reefs must retain and recycle materials efficiently. This review centers microbial processes in facilitating the persistence and stability of coral reefs, specifically the role of these processes in transforming and recycling the dissolved organic matter (DOM) that acts as an invisible currency in reef production, nutrient exchange, and organismal interactions. The defining characteristics of coral reefs, including high productivity, balanced metabolism, high biodiversity, nutrient retention, and structural complexity, are inextricably linked to microbial processing of DOM. The composition of microbes and DOM in reefs is summarized, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical processes carried out by microorganisms in diverse reef habitats are explored in a variety of key reef processes, including decomposition, accretion, trophictransfer, and macronutrient recycling. Finally, we examine how widespread habitat degradation of reefs is altering these important microbe\u2013DOM interactions, creating feedbacks that reduce reef resilience to global change.", "generated_text": "Coral reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental changes, and the interactions between microbes and dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a crucial role in their function and resilience. This study investigates how microbial communities process DOM, influencing nutrient cycling and oxygen dynamics. Microbiomes associated with coral reefs were found to rapidly degrade DOM, which can lead to localized deoxygenation events, particularly in areas with high organic matter input. These processes are essential for maintaining the balance of nutrients and can affect the overall health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Understanding these microbial interactions is vital for predicting and mitigating the impacts of environmental stressors on coral reefs, such as climate change and pollution.", "label": 1}
