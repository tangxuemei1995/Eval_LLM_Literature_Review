{"grounding": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was the largest in US history, covering more than 1,000 km of shorelines and causing losses that exceeded $50 billion. While oil transformation processes are understood at the laboratory scale, the extent of the Deepwater Horizon spill made it challenging to integrate these processes in the field. This review tracks the Deepwater Horizon oil during its journey from the Mississippi Canyon block 252 (MC252) wellhead, first discussing the formation of the oil and gas plume and the ensuing oil droplet size distribution, then focusing on the behavior of the oil on the water surface with and without waves. It then reports on massive drifter experiments in the Gulf of Mexico and the impact of the Mississippi River on the oil transport. Finally, it concludes by addressing the formation of oil\u2013particle aggregates. Although physical processes lend themselves to numerical modeling, we attempted to elucidate them without using advanced modeling, as our goal is to enhance communication among scientists, engineers, and other entities interested in oil spills.", "generated_text": "The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 released an unprecedented amount of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, leading to extensive research on the mechanisms of oil transport and dispersion. This study investigates the key processes governing the spreading and dispersion of oil droplets, focusing on droplet formation and the role of eddy diffusivity in the marine environment. Using a combination of field data, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations, we analyze the size distribution of oil droplets and their subsequent transport by ocean currents. Our findings indicate that the initial droplet size distribution is significantly influenced by the pressure and flow rate at the wellhead, while subsequent dispersion is dominated by turbulent mixing and eddy diffusivity. The results highlight the importance of these factors in predicting the fate and impact of oil spills, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and response strategies.", "label": 1}
