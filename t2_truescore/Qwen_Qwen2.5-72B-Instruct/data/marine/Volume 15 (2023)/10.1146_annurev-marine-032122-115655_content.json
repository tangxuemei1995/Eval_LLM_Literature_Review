{"grounding": "The oceanic waters below a depth of 200 m represent, in terms of volume, the largest habitat of the biosphere, harboring approximately 70% of the prokaryotic biomass in the oceanic water column. These waters are characterized by low temperature, increasing hydrostatic pressure, and decreasing organic matter supply with depth. Recent methodological advances in microbial oceanography have refined our view of the ecology of prokaryotes in the dark ocean. Here, we review the ecology of prokaryotes of the dark ocean, present data on the biomass distribution and heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotic production in the major oceanic basins, and highlight the phylogenetic and functional diversity of this part of the ocean. We describe the connectivity of surface and deep-water prokaryotes and the molecular adaptations of piezophilic prokaryotes to high hydrostatic pressure. We also highlight knowledge gaps in the ecology of the dark ocean's prokaryotes and their role in the biogeochemical cycles in the largest habitat of the biosphere.", "generated_text": "This study explores the distribution, diversity, and metabolic activity of prokaryotes in the deep ocean's water column, a vast and largely unexplored habitat. Using advanced molecular techniques and in situ measurements, we characterized the bacterial and archaeal communities at various depths, revealing a high degree of vertical stratification and niche specialization. Our findings indicate that despite the extreme conditions, including high pressure and low nutrient availability, these microorganisms exhibit significant metabolic activity, contributing to key biogeochemical cycles. The discovery of novel taxa and metabolic pathways underscores the deep ocean's role as a reservoir of microbial diversity and functional potential, with implications for understanding the global carbon cycle and the limits of life on Earth.", "label": 0}
