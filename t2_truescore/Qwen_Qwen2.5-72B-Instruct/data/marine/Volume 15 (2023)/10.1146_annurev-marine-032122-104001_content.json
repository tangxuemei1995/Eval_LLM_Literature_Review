{"grounding": "Nitrogen is a major limiting element for biological productivity, and thus understanding past variations in nitrogen cycling is central to understanding past and future ocean biogeochemical cycling, global climate cycles, and biodiversity. Organic nitrogen encapsulated in fossil biominerals is generally protected from alteration, making it an important archive of the marine nitrogen cycle on seasonal to million-year timescales. The isotopic composition of fossil-bound nitrogen reflects variations in the large-scale nitrogen inventory, local sources and processing, and ecological and physiological traits of organisms. The ability to measure trace amounts of fossil-bound nitrogen has expanded with recent method developments. In this article, we review the foundations and ground truthing for three important fossil-bound proxy types: diatoms, foraminifera, and corals. We highlight their utility with examples of high-resolution evidence for anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the oceans, glacial\u2013interglacial-scale assessments of nitrogen inventory change, and evidence for enhanced CO2 drawdown in the high-latitude ocean. Future directions include expanded method development, characterization of ecological and physiological variation, and exploration of extended timescales to push reconstructions further back in Earth's history.", "generated_text": "This study explores the utility of nitrogen isotopes (\u03b415N) preserved in biomineralized fossils, specifically diatoms, foraminifera, and corals, to reconstruct ancient nutrient cycling and environmental conditions. By analyzing \u03b415N values in these microfossils from various geological periods, we gain insights into past oceanic nitrogen dynamics and their implications for paleoceanography. Diatoms, known for their silica-based frustules, provide a continuous record of surface ocean conditions, while foraminifera and corals offer deeper water column and reef environment perspectives. Our results indicate significant variations in \u03b415N values across different taxa and time periods, reflecting changes in nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and upwelling processes. These findings enhance our understanding of the interplay between biological productivity and oceanographic conditions in the past, and provide a robust framework for interpreting modern and future changes in marine ecosystems.", "label": 1}
