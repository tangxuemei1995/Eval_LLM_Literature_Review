{"grounding": "The regular movements of waves and tides are obvious representations of the oceans\u2019 rhythmicity. But the rhythms of marine life span across ecological niches and timescales, including short (in the range of hours) and long (in the range of days and months) periods. These rhythms regulate the physiology and behavior of individuals, as well as their interactions with each other and with the environment. This review highlights examples of rhythmicity in marine animals and algae that represent important groups of marine life across different habitats. The examples cover ecologically highly relevant species and a growing number of laboratory model systems that are used to disentangle key mechanistic principles. The review introduces fundamental concepts of chronobiology, such as the distinction between rhythmic and endogenous oscillator\u2013driven processes. It also addresses the relevance of studying diverse rhythms and oscillators, as well as their interconnection, for making better predictions of how species will respond to environmental perturbations, including climate change. As the review aims to address scientists from the diverse fields of marine biology, ecology, and molecular chronobiology, all of which have their own scientific terms, we provide definitions of key terms throughout the article.", "generated_text": "Marine organisms exhibit a variety of biological rhythms that are synchronized with environmental cycles, including daily (circadian), tidal (circatidal), lunar (circalunar), and annual (circannual) rhythms. These rhythms are regulated by endogenous oscillators that allow organisms to anticipate and adapt to predictable changes in their environment. Recent studies have highlighted the complexity and diversity of these timing mechanisms across different marine taxa, from algae to animals. For instance, circadian rhythms in photosynthetic activity and gene expression have been well-documented in marine algae, while circatidal rhythms in behavior and physiology are prevalent in intertidal animals. Circalunar rhythms, such as reproductive cycles and migration patterns, are also crucial for many marine species. However, the impacts of climate change, including altered temperature and light regimes, pose significant challenges to these finely tuned biological clocks. Research is increasingly focusing on how these environmental perturbations affect the synchronization of endogenous oscillators and the potential consequences for marine ecosystems. Understanding these rhythms and their responses to environmental changes is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change on marine biodiversity.", "label": 1}
