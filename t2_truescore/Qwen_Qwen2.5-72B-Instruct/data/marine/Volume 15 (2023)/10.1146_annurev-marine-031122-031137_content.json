{"grounding": "Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified. Here, we summarize the importance of carbonate burial in the ocean\u2013climate system, review methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments, discuss advances in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial over the past three decades, and identify gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, as well as innovative modeling approaches, are highlighted as new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial.", "generated_text": "This study synthesizes proxy data and model simulations to reconstruct the global burial of marine carbonates during the Quaternary, focusing on glacial-interglacial cycles. The analysis reveals significant variability in carbonate burial rates, influenced by changes in ocean chemistry, sea level, and biological productivity. During glacial periods, reduced sea levels and altered ocean circulation patterns led to decreased carbonate burial in shallow marine environments, while interglacial periods saw enhanced burial due to higher sea levels and increased nutrient availability. Despite these insights, substantial uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the impact of ocean acidification and the role of deep-sea carbonate dissolution. Future research should aim to refine proxy records and improve model parameterizations to better constrain the long-term carbon cycle and its feedbacks with climate. This work underscores the importance of marine carbonates in the global carbon cycle and highlights the need for continued interdisciplinary research to address persisting uncertainties.", "label": 0}
