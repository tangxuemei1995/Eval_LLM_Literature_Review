{"grounding": "Lipids are structurally diverse biomolecules that serve multiple roles in cells. As such, they are used as biomarkers in the modern ocean and as paleoproxies to explore the geological past. Here, I review lipid geochemistry, biosynthesis, and compartmentalization; the varied uses of lipids as biomarkers; and the evolution of analytical techniques used to measure and characterize lipids. Advancements in high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry have revolutionized the lipidomic and metabolomic fields, both of which are quickly being integrated into marine meta-omic studies. Lipidomics allows us to analyze tens of thousands of features, providing an open analytical window and the ability to quantify unknown compounds that can be structurally elucidated later. However, lipidome annotation is not a trivial matter and represents one of the biggest challenges for oceanographers, owing in part to the lack of marine lipids in current in silico databases and data repositories. A case study reveals the gaps in our knowledge and open opportunities to answer fundamental questions about molecular-level control of chemical reactions and global-scale patterns in the lipidscape.", "generated_text": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the metabolic processes and environmental interactions of microorganisms in marine ecosystems. Recent advancements in lipidomic techniques, including high-resolution mass spectrometry and meta-omics approaches, have significantly enhanced our ability to identify and quantify complex lipid mixtures in environmental samples. These techniques provide insights into the biosynthesis, degradation, and cycling of lipids, which are essential biomarkers for microbial activity and community structure. This review highlights the integration of lipidomics with microbial oceanography and biogeochemistry, emphasizing the application of these tools to study lipid geochemistry in diverse marine environments. The synergistic use of lipidomics and meta-omics data offers a comprehensive view of the functional and ecological roles of lipids in marine biogeochemical cycles, contributing to a deeper understanding of the Earth's carbon and nutrient cycles.", "label": 1}
