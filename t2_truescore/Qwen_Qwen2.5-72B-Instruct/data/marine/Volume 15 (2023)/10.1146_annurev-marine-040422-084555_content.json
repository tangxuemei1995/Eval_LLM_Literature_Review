{"grounding": "The modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV), traditionally defined as statistical patterns of variance, reflect to first order the ocean's integration (i.e., reddening) of atmospheric forcing that arises from both a shift and a change in strength of the climatological (time-mean) atmospheric circulation. While these patterns concisely describe PDV, they do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. In this review, we synthesize past analysis using an empirical dynamical model constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies drawn from several reanalysis products, showing that the PDV modes of variance result from two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific\u2013central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio\u2013Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. Both eigenmodes highlight how two-way tropical\u2013extratropical teleconnection dynamics are the primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. While the NP-CP mode captures interannual- to decadal-scale variability, the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific.", "generated_text": "This study explores the modes and mechanisms of Pacific decadal-scale variability, focusing on the interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes in the Pacific Ocean. Decadal-scale variability in the Pacific, characterized by shifts in sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric circulation patterns, significantly influences global climate patterns and regional weather phenomena. The research integrates observational data and climate model simulations to elucidate the role of ocean\u2013atmosphere teleconnections, particularly the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in modulating decadal variability. Key findings highlight the importance of subsurface ocean heat content, wind stress anomalies, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in driving long-term climate fluctuations. The study also examines the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the frequency and intensity of decadal-scale events, suggesting that warming trends may alter the traditional patterns of Pacific variability. These insights are crucial for improving climate prediction models and enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions within the Earth's climate system.", "label": 0}
