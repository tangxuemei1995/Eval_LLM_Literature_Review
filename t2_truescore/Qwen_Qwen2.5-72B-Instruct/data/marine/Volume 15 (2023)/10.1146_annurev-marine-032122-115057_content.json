{"grounding": "Exchange of material across the nearshore region, extending from the shoreline to a few kilometers offshore, determines the concentrations of pathogens and nutrients near the coast and the transport of larvae, whose cross-shore positions influence dispersal and recruitment. Here, we describe a framework for estimating the relative importance of cross-shore exchange mechanisms, including winds, Stokes drift, rip currents, internal waves, and diurnal heating and cooling. For each mechanism, we define an exchange velocity as a function of environmental conditions. The exchange velocity applies for organisms that keep a particular depth due to swimming or buoyancy. A related exchange diffusivity quantifies horizontal spreading of particles without enough vertical swimming speed or buoyancy to counteract turbulent velocities. This framework provides a way to determinewhich processes are important for cross-shore exchange for a particular study site, time period, and particle behavior.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the mechanisms and dynamics of cross-shore exchange processes in the nearshore region, focusing on the transport of plankton, pollutants, and particles. Utilizing a combination of field observations and numerical modeling, we examine the roles of turbulence, wind, surface waves, and internal waves in facilitating these exchanges. Results indicate that surface waves and internal waves significantly enhance the vertical mixing and horizontal transport of particles, while wind-driven currents play a crucial role in the lateral distribution of pollutants. The study highlights the importance of these physical processes in shaping the nearshore ecosystem and the potential implications for environmental management and coastal zone protection.", "label": 0}
