{"grounding": "Tidal marshes and mangroves are increasingly valued for nature-based mitigation of coastal storm impacts, such as flooding and shoreline erosion hazards, which are growing due to global change. As this review highlights, however, hazard mitigation by tidal wetlands is limited to certain conditions, and not all hazards are equally reduced. Tidal wetlands are effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves, but long-period storm surges, which elevate sea levels up to several meters for up to more than a day, are attenuated less effectively, or in some cases not at all, depending on storm conditions, wetland properties, and larger-scale coastal landscape geometry. Wetlands often limit erosion, but storm damage to vegetation (especially mangrove trees) can be substantial, and recovery may take several years. Longer-term wetland persistence can be compromised when combined with other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Due to these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects need to adopt adaptive management strategies.", "generated_text": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of tidal wetlands, specifically marshes and mangroves, as nature-based solutions for coastal storm protection. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we analyze the physical mechanisms by which these ecosystems mitigate the impacts of cyclones and hurricanes, including wave attenuation, storm surge reduction, and erosion control. The research highlights the critical role of vegetation structure and density in enhancing these protective functions. Additionally, we explore the integration of marshes and mangroves into coastal engineering strategies, emphasizing their potential to complement traditional hard infrastructure. The findings suggest that preserving and restoring these natural buffers can significantly enhance flood protection, offering a sustainable and cost-effective approach to coastal resilience. The study also identifies key challenges and opportunities for policymakers and practitioners in implementing nature-based solutions at scale.", "label": 1}
