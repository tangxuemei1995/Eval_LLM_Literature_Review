{"grounding": "Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is rapidly attracting interest, as climate change is putting ecosystems at risk and endangering human communities globally. Due to the centrality of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, augmenting the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean could be a powerful mechanism for the removal of legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Using a sociotechnical system lens, this review identifies the sets of considerations that need to be included within robust assessments for OCDR decision-making. Specifically, it lays out the state of technical assessments of OCDR approaches along with key financial concerns, social issues (including public perceptions), and the underlying ethical debates and concerns that would need to be addressed if OCDR were to be deployed as a carbon dioxide removal strategy.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the sociotechnical dimensions of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies, integrating insights from climate finance, public perception, and environmental ethics. Ocean CDR, including methods such as seaweed cultivation and ocean alkalinity enhancement, holds significant potential for mitigating climate change. However, these technologies are not without controversy. The paper examines the financial mechanisms required to support large-scale deployment, the public's attitudes towards these interventions, and the ethical implications of altering marine ecosystems. It highlights the need for transparent governance frameworks and inclusive stakeholder engagement to ensure that ocean CDR aligns with broader sustainability goals. The findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach that considers both the technical feasibility and the social acceptability of these emerging technologies.", "label": 1}
