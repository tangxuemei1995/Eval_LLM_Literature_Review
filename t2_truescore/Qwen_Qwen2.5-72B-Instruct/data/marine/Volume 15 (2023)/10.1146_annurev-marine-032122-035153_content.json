{"grounding": "Understanding the nature of organic matter flux in the ocean remains a major goal of oceanography because it impacts some of the most important processes in the ocean. Sinking particles are important for carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and its movement to the deep ocean. They also feed life below the ocean's productive surface and sustain life in the deep sea, in addition to depositing organic matter on the seafloor. However, the magnitude of all of these processes is dependent on the transformation of sinking particles during their journey through the water column. This review focuses on the movement of organic matter from the surface ocean to the deep sea via the biological carbon pump and examines the processes that prevent this downward movement\u2014namely, attenuation via microbial colonization and zooplankton feeding. It also discusses how the depth-specific interactions among microbes, zooplankton, and aggregates determine carbon export as well as nutrient recycling, which in turn impact ocean production and Earth's climate.", "generated_text": "The biological carbon pump (BCP) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by transferring organic carbon from the surface ocean to the deep sea. This process, primarily driven by marine snow and fecal pellets, is subject to flux attenuation due to microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding. Marine snow, composed of aggregates of organic matter, serves as a vehicle for carbon export, while fecal pellets produced by zooplankton are more dense and sink faster, enhancing carbon sequestration. Microbial degradation, however, can significantly reduce the amount of carbon reaching the deep ocean. Understanding the dynamics of these processes is essential for predicting the efficiency of the BCP and its impact on climate regulation. This review synthesizes recent findings on the mechanisms governing carbon export, highlighting the interplay between biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence the BCP.", "label": 1}
