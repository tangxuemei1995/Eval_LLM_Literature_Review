{"grounding": "Climatic extremes are becoming increasingly common against a background trend of global warming. In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)\u2014discrete periods of anomalously warm water\u2014have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence andimpacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.", "generated_text": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs), defined as prolonged periods of anomalously high sea surface temperatures, are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. This study synthesizes recent research on the biological impacts of MHWs across various marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and open ocean environments. The findings highlight significant disruptions to ecosystem services, such as fisheries productivity and carbon sequestration, as well as shifts in species distributions and community compositions. MHWs have been linked to mass mortality events, reduced reproductive success, and altered phenological patterns in marine organisms. The cumulative effects of these extreme events exacerbate the challenges posed by ongoing ocean warming, leading to long-term environmental changes that may be irreversible. This review underscores the urgent need for adaptive management strategies and global efforts to mitigate climate change to preserve the integrity and resilience of marine ecosystems.", "label": 1}
