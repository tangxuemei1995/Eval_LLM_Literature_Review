{"grounding": "The world's eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) contribute disproportionately to global ocean productivity and provide critical ecosystem services to human society. The impact of climate change on EBUSs and the ecosystems they support is thus a subject of considerable interest. Here, we review hypotheses of climate-driven change in the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of EBUSs; describe observed changes over recent decades; and present projected changes over the twenty-first century. Similarities in historical and projected change among EBUSs include a trend toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions, mitigatedwarming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies, and enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer. However, there remains significant uncertainty in how EBUSs will evolve with climate change, particularly in how the sometimes competing changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification will affect productivity and ecosystem structure. We summarize the commonalities and differences in historical and projected change in EBUSs and conclude with an assessment of key remaining uncertainties and questions. Future studies will need to address these questions to better understand, project, and adapt to climate-driven changes in EBUSs.", "generated_text": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are critical marine ecosystems that support high biological productivity and fisheries. This study investigates the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on changes in wind patterns, sea surface temperature, and nutrient availability. Using a combination of historical data analysis, climate models, and field observations, we assess the variability and trends in upwelling intensity and timing. Results indicate a significant shift in upwelling dynamics, with potential implications for marine biodiversity and fisheries. Increased sea surface temperatures and altered wind patterns are projected to reduce upwelling intensity in some regions, while enhancing it in others. These changes could lead to shifts in species distribution and abundance, affecting the resilience of these ecosystems. The study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on EBUS and the communities that depend on them.", "label": 1}
