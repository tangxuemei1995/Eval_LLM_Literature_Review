{"grounding": "Despite increasing evidence of its involvement in several key functions of the cerebral cortex, the vestibular sense rarely enters our consciousness. Indeed, the extent to which these internal signals are incorporated within cortical sensory representation and how they might be relied upon for sensory-driven decision-making, during, for example, spatial navigation, is yet to be understood. Recent novel experimental approaches in rodents have probed both the physiological and behavioral significance of vestibular signals and indicate that their widespread integration with vision improves both the cortical representation and perceptual accuracy of self-motion and orientation. Here, we summarize these recent findings with a focus on cortical circuits involved in visual perception and spatial navigation and highlight the major remaining knowledge gaps. We suggest that vestibulo-visual integration reflects a process of constant updating regarding the status of self-motion, and access to such information by the cortex is used for sensory perception and predictions that may be implemented for rapid, navigation-related decision-making.", "generated_text": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues in the cerebral cortex is crucial for spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception. This study explores how these sensory modalities are combined to enhance the accuracy and reliability of self-motion perception and spatial orientation. Using a combination of neuroimaging techniques and behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that specific regions of the cerebral cortex, including the posterior parietal cortex and the medial temporal lobe, play a pivotal role in the multisensory integration of vestibular and visual information. Our findings reveal that the dynamic interplay between these sensory inputs not only supports the perception of self-motion but also contributes to the formation of stable spatial representations. These results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of vestibular and visual cues, highlighting the importance of multisensory processing in the context of spatial navigation and perception.", "label": 1}
