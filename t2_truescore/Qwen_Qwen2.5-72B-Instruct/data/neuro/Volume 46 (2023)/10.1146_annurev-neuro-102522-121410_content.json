{"grounding": "Primates have evolved diverse cognitive capabilities to navigate their complex social world. To understand how the brain implements critical social cognitive abilities, we describe functional specialization in the domains of face processing, social interaction understanding, and mental state attribution. Systems for face processing are specialized from the level of single cells to populations of neurons within brain regions to hierarchically organized networks that extract and represent abstract social information. Such functional specialization is not confined to the sensorimotor periphery but appears to be a pervasive theme of primate brain organization all the way to the apex regions of cortical hierarchies. Circuits processing social information are juxtaposed with parallel systems involved in processing nonsocial information, suggesting common computations applied to different domains. The emerging picture of the neural basis of social cognition is a set of distinct but interacting subnetworks involved in component processes such as face perception and social reasoning, traversing large parts of the primate brain.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent findings on the specialized neural networks that underpin social cognition in the primate brain. Key regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, fusiform face area, and prefrontal cortex, are intricately involved in processing social information, such as facial expressions and gaze direction. These areas form a distributed network that supports the recognition and interpretation of social cues, essential for effective social interaction. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging, have elucidated the functional connectivity and structural organization of these networks, revealing how they integrate sensory input with social knowledge. The review also highlights the role of these networks in disorders of social cognition, such as autism spectrum disorder, where disruptions in social brain function are evident. Understanding the neural mechanisms of social cognition is crucial for developing targeted interventions and therapies for social cognitive deficits.", "label": 0}
