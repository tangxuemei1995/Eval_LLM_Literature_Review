{"grounding": "This review explores the interface between circadian timekeeping and the regulation of brain function by astrocytes. Although astrocytes regulate neuronal activity across many time domains, their cell-autonomous circadian clocks exert a particular role in controlling longer-term oscillations of brain function: the maintenance of sleep states and the circadian ordering of sleep and wakefulness. This is most evident in the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the molecular clock of astrocytes suffices to drive daily cycles of neuronal activity and behavior. In Alzheimer's disease, sleep impairments accompany cognitive decline. In mouse models of the disease, circadian disturbances accelerate astroglial activation and other brain pathologies, suggesting that daily functions in astrocytes protect neuronal homeostasis. In brain cancer, treatment in the morning has been associated with prolonged survival, and gliomas have daily rhythms in gene expression and drug sensitivity. Thus, circadian time is fast becoming critical to elucidating reciprocal astrocytic-neuronal interactions in health and disease.", "generated_text": "Circadian rhythms, regulated by the internal circadian clock, play a crucial role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, including sleep-wake cycles and metabolic processes. Astrocytes, once considered mere support cells, are now recognized as active participants in these rhythms through calcium signaling and the release of gliotransmitters. This review explores the dual role of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial effects on sleep quality and cognitive function, as well as their potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Recent studies have shown that disrupted circadian rhythms in astrocytes can lead to impaired calcium homeostasis, contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the role of astrocytes in glioma, a type of brain cancer, is discussed, emphasizing the complex interplay between circadian dysregulation and tumor progression. Understanding these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for treating circadian-related disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.", "label": 1}
