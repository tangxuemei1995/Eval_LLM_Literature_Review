{"grounding": "Examination of cognition has historically been approached from language and introspection. However, human language\u2013dependent definitions ignore the evolutionary roots of brain mechanisms and constrain their study in experimental animals. We promote an alternative view, namely that cognition, including memory, can be explained by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions. Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states. Exaptation of such circuits was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche. We illustrate that exploration gives rise to a cognitive map, and in turn, environment-disengaged computation allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning). Such brain-body interactions not only occur during waking but also persist during sleep. These exaptation steps are illustrated by the dual, endocrine-homeostatic and memory, contributions of the hippocampal system, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the body and brain, particularly focusing on the hippocampus and its role in memory through the lens of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). By integrating concepts of homeostasis and allostasis, we examine how the hippocampus not only supports memory consolidation but also contributes to the regulation of bodily functions such as glucose metabolism. Our findings suggest that SWRs facilitate the exaptation of memory processes, enabling the brain to optimize body control and maintain physiological balance. This body-brain partnership highlights the adaptive significance of memory in supporting complex cognitive functions and physiological homeostasis, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive and metabolic health.", "label": 1}
