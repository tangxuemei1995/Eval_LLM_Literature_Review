{"grounding": "Flexible behavior requires the creation, updating, and expression of memories to depend on context. While the neural underpinnings of each of these processes have been intensively studied, recent advances in computational modeling revealed a key challenge in context-dependent learning that had been largely ignored previously: Under naturalistic conditions, context is typically uncertain, necessitating contextual inference. We review a theoretical approach to formalizing context-dependent learning in the face of contextual uncertainty and the core computations it requires. We show how this approach begins to organize a large body of disparate experimental observations, from multiple levels of brain organization (including circuits, systems, and behavior) and multiple brain regions (most prominently the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and motor cortices), into a coherent framework. We argue that contextual inference may also be key to understanding continual learning in the brain. This theory-driven perspective places contextual inference as a core component of learning.", "generated_text": "Context-dependent learning, a critical aspect of adaptive behavior, involves the integration of environmental cues to guide learning and memory processes. This study explores the computational and neural mechanisms underlying context-dependent learning, emphasizing the roles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex. Using a combination of computational modeling and neuroimaging techniques, we demonstrate that Bayesian inference provides a robust framework for understanding how these brain regions dynamically interact to encode and retrieve context-specific information. Our findings reveal that the prefrontal cortex plays a pivotal role in modulating the hippocampal and thalamic circuits, facilitating the formation of context-dependent memories. Additionally, the motor cortex is shown to be crucial for the execution of context-appropriate behaviors. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural bases of continual learning and have implications for the development of more effective learning algorithms and therapeutic interventions for cognitive disorders.", "label": 1}
