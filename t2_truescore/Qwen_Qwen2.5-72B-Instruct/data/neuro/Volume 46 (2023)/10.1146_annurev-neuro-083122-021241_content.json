{"grounding": "Radial cell columns are a hallmark feature of cortical architecture in many mammalian species. It has long been held, based on the lack of orientation columns, that such functional units are absent in rodent primary visual cortex (V1). These observations led to the view that rodent visual cortex has a fundamentally different network architecture than that of carnivores and primates. While columns may be lacking in rodent V1, we describe in this review that modular clusters of inputs to layer 1 and projection neurons in the layers below are prominent features of the mouse visual cortex. We propose that modules organize thalamocortical inputs, intracortical processing streams, and transthalamic communications that underlie distinct sensory and sensorimotor functions.", "generated_text": "The modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex integrates feedforward and feedback information streams through patchy connections, particularly in layer 1. These connections, enriched with M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, facilitate the dynamic interaction between processing streams, enhancing the hierarchical processing of visual information. This integration is crucial for the refinement of visual perception and the coordination of complex visual tasks. The study reveals how the interplay between these streams contributes to the functional organization of the visual cortex, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying visual processing and perception.", "label": 0}
