{"grounding": "All mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol to maintain membrane integrity. The transport of this hydrophobic lipid is mediated by lipoproteins. Cholesterol is especially enriched in the brain, particularly in synaptic and myelin membranes. Aging involves changes in sterol metabolism in peripheral organs and also in the brain. Some of those alterations have the potential to promote or to counteract the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of general principles of sterol metabolism in humans and mice, the most widely used model organism in biomedical research. We discuss changes in sterol metabolism that occur in the aged brain and highlight recent developments in cell type\u2013specific cholesterol metabolism in the fast-growing research field of aging and age-related diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cell type\u2013specific cholesterol handling and the interplay between cell types critically influence age-related disease processes.", "generated_text": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in the aging brain and the development of age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in neurons and microglia, with dysregulation contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review summarizes current understanding of cholesterol metabolism in the context of aging, focusing on the interplay between neurons and microglia. We discuss how age-related changes in cholesterol synthesis, transport, and efflux can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in neuronal membranes, impairing synaptic function and increasing vulnerability to neurotoxic insults. Additionally, we explore the role of microglial cholesterol metabolism in modulating inflammatory responses and the clearance of amyloid-beta, a key pathological feature of AD. Understanding these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for preventing or treating age-related neurological disorders.", "label": 1}
