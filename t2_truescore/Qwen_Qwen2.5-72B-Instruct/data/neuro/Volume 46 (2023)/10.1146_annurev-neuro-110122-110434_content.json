{"grounding": "The field of stereotactic neurosurgery developed more than 70 years ago to address a therapy gap for patients with severe psychiatric disorders. In the decades since, it has matured tremendously, benefiting from advances in clinical and basic sciences. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe, treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders is currently poised to transition from a stage of empiricism to one increasingly rooted in scientific discovery. Current drivers of this transition are advances in neuroimaging, but rapidly emerging ones are neurophysiological\u2014as we understand more about the neural basis of these disorders, we will more successfully be able to use interventions such as invasive stimulation to restore dysfunctional circuits to health. Paralleling this transition is a steady increase in the consistency and quality of outcome data. Here, we focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, two topics that have received the most attention in terms of trial volume and scientific effort.", "generated_text": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for treatment-resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and depression. This review synthesizes recent advancements in psychiatric neurosurgery, focusing on the neuromodulatory effects of DBS. Clinical trials and case studies indicate that DBS targeting the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) and subgenual cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 25) can significantly reduce symptom severity in both conditions. Mechanistic insights suggest that DBS modulates dysfunctional neural circuits, restoring normal activity patterns and improving cognitive and affective processing. However, the optimal stimulation parameters and long-term efficacy remain areas of active investigation. This paper also discusses the challenges and ethical considerations associated with DBS, including patient selection criteria and the potential for side effects. Future research should aim to refine targeting strategies and personalize treatment protocols to maximize therapeutic outcomes.", "label": 1}
