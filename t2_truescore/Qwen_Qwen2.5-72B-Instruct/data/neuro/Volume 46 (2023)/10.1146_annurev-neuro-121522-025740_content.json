{"grounding": "Striosomes form neurochemically specialized compartments of the striatum embedded in a large matrix made up of modules called matrisomes. Striosome-matrix architecture is multiplexed with the canonical direct-indirect organization of the striatum. Striosomal functions remain to be fully clarified, but key information is emerging. First, striosomes powerfully innervate nigral dopamine-containing neurons and can completely shut down their activity, with a following rebound excitation. Second, striosomes receive limbic and cognition-related corticostriatal afferents and are dynamically modulated in relation to value-based actions. Third, striosomes are spatially interspersed among matrisomes and interneurons and are influenced by local and global neuromodulatory and oscillatory activities. Fourth, striosomes tune engagement and the motivation to perform reinforcement learning, to manifest stereotypical behaviors, and to navigate valence conflicts and valence discriminations. We suggest that, at an algorithmic level, striosomes could serve as distributed scaffolds to provide formats of the striatal computations generated through development and refined through learning. We propose that striosomes affect subjective states. By transforming corticothalamic and other inputs to the functional formats of the striatum, they could implement state transitions in nigro-striato-nigral circuits to affect bodily and cognitive actions according to internal motives whose functions are compromised in neuropsychiatric conditions.", "generated_text": "The striatum, a key component of the basal ganglia, is intricately involved in the regulation of motor and cognitive functions. Within this structure, striosomes and matrisomes form distinct microcircuits that are crucial for the dynamic coupling of volition and action. Striosomes, which are enriched in dopamine receptors, are hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the reinforcement learning process, facilitating the association between actions and their outcomes. Conversely, matrisomes, characterized by their dense connectivity with the cortex and thalamus, are thought to integrate contextual information and guide goal-directed behavior. Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between these two scaffolds, suggesting that their coordinated activity is essential for adaptive behavior. Specifically, dopamine signaling within striosomes modulates the activity of matrisomes, thereby fine-tuning the selection and execution of motor actions. This dynamic coupling is particularly evident in tasks that require the integration of sensory input, decision-making, and motor output. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this interaction could provide valuable insights into the neural basis of learning and motor control, with potential implications for the treatment of disorders affecting the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Huntington\u2019s disease.", "label": 0}
