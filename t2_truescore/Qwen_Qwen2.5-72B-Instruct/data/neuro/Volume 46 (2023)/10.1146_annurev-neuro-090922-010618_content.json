{"grounding": "In mammals, the activity of neurons in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is modulated by the animal's position and its movement through space. At multiple stages of this distributed circuit, distinct populations of neurons can represent a rich repertoire of navigation-related variables like the animal's location, the speed and direction of its movements, or the presence of borders and objects. Working together, spatially tuned neurons give rise to an internal representation of space, a cognitive map that supports an animal's ability to navigate the world and to encode and consolidate memories from experience. The mechanisms by which, during development, the brain acquires the ability to create an internal representation of space are just beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we examine recent work that has begun to investigate the ontogeny of circuitry, firing patterns, and computations underpinning the representation of space in the mammalian brain.", "generated_text": "The formation of a cognitive map, a neural representation of the spatial environment, is a fundamental aspect of navigation and memory. This process involves the coordinated development of circuits in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus are key components, forming a spatially organized network that supports spatial navigation and memory. Recent studies have elucidated the developmental mechanisms underlying the maturation of these circuits, including the role of experience-dependent plasticity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the developmental trajectory of these circuits, highlighting the interplay between genetic programs and environmental influences. Understanding these processes is crucial for advancing our knowledge of spatial cognition and may provide insights into disorders affecting spatial memory and navigation.", "label": 1}
