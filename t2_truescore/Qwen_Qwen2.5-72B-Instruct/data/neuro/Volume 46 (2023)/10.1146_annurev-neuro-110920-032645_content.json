{"grounding": "Many animals can navigate toward a goal they cannot see based on an internal representation of that goal in the brain's spatial maps. These maps are organized around networks with stable fixed-point dynamics (attractors), anchored to landmarks, and reciprocally connected to motor control. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding these networks, focusing on studies in arthropods. One factor driving recent progress is the availability of the Drosophila connectome; however, it is increasingly clear that navigation depends on ongoing synaptic plasticity in these networks. Functional synapses appear to be continually reselected from the set of anatomical potential synapses based on the interaction of Hebbian learning rules, sensory feedback, attractor dynamics, and neuromodulation. This can explain how the brain's maps of space are rapidly updated; it may also explain how the brain can initialize goals as stable fixed points for navigation.", "generated_text": "This review explores the role of neural networks in navigation, focusing on the integration of memory, menotaxis, and path integration mechanisms. We examine how head direction cells and dopamine signaling contribute to the formation and maintenance of spatial representations. The paper discusses the computational principles underlying coordinate transformations that enable accurate navigation. By synthesizing findings from both experimental and theoretical studies, we highlight the intricate interplay between neural connections and computations that underpin navigational abilities in complex environments.", "label": 0}
