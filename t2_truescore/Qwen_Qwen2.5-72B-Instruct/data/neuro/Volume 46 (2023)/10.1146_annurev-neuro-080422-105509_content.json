{"grounding": "Migraine is a complex neurovascular pain disorder linked to the meninges, a border tissue innervated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent fibers chiefly from the trigeminal nerve. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of this nerve surrounding large blood vessels evokes headache patterns as in migraine, and the brain, blood, and meninges are likely sources of headache triggers. Cerebrospinal fluid may play a significant role in migraine by transferring signals released from the brain to overlying pain-sensitive meningeal tissues, including dura mater. Interactions between trigeminal afferents, neuropeptides, and adjacent meningeal cells and tissues cause neurogenic inflammation, a critical target for current prophylactic and abortive migraine therapies. Here we review the importance of the cranial meninges to migraine headaches, explore the properties of trigeminal meningeal afferents, and briefly review emerging concepts, such as meningeal neuroimmune interactions, that may one day prove therapeutically relevant.", "generated_text": "Migraine, a debilitating neurological disorder, is intricately linked to the meninges, the protective layers surrounding the brain. This review explores the role of meningeal mechanisms, particularly the activation of meningeal afferents and the trigeminal nerve, in the pathophysiology of migraine. Neurogenic inflammation, triggered by the release of inflammatory mediators, contributes to the sensitization of these afferents, amplifying pain signals and leading to the characteristic throbbing headache. Cortical spreading depression, a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is also implicated in initiating and propagating migraine attacks. Understanding these mechanisms provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies to alleviate migraine symptoms and improve patient outcomes.", "label": 1}
