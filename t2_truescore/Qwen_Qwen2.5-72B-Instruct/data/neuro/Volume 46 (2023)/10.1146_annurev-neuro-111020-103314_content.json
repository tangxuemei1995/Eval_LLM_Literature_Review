{"grounding": "Emotions are fundamental to our experience and behavior, affecting and motivating all aspects of our lives. Scientists of various disciplines have been fascinated by emotions for centuries, yet even today vigorous debates abound about how to define emotions and how to best study their neural underpinnings. Defining emotions from an evolutionary perspective and acknowledging their important functional roles in supporting survival allows the study of emotion states in diverse species. This approach enables taking advantage of modern tools in behavioral, systems, and circuit neurosciences, allowing the precise dissection of neural mechanisms and behavior underlying emotion processes in model organisms. Here we review findings about the neural circuit mechanisms underlying emotion processing across species and try to identify points of convergence as well as important next steps in the pursuit of understanding how emotions emerge from neural activity.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advances in the field of circuit neuroscience, focusing on the neural circuits that underpin emotion states across species. By integrating findings from rodent, non-human primate, and human studies, we elucidate the core neural substrates and mechanisms that govern emotional valence. Key circuits, including those involving the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and insula, are examined in detail, highlighting their roles in processing positive and negative affect. Cross-species approaches reveal both conserved and divergent features, offering insights into the evolution of emotional processing. Advanced techniques such as optogenetics and in vivo imaging have provided unprecedented resolution, enabling a more nuanced understanding of how these circuits dynamically interact to shape emotional behavior. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in advancing our knowledge of the neural basis of emotion.", "label": 1}
