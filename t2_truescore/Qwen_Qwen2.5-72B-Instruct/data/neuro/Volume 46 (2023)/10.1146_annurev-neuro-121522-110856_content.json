{"grounding": "Rapid advances in the neural control of social behavior highlight the role of interconnected nodes engaged in differential information processing to generate behavior. Many innate social behaviors are essential to reproductive fitness and therefore fundamentally different in males and females. Programming these differences occurs early in development in mammals, following gonadal differentiation and copious androgen production by the fetal testis during a critical period. Early-life programming of social behavior and its adult manifestation are separate but yoked processes, yet how they are linked is unknown. This review seeks to highlight that gap by identifying four core mechanisms (epigenetics, cell death, circuit formation, and adult hormonal modulation) that could connect developmental changes to the adult behaviors of mating and aggression. We further propose that a unique social behavior, adolescent play, bridges the preweaning to the postpubertal brain by engaging the same neural networks underpinning adult reproductive and aggressive behaviors.", "generated_text": "This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behaviors, focusing on the role of GABA neurons and the social behavior network (SBN) from development to adulthood. Using a combination of genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches, we investigated how epigenetic modifications and aromatase activity influence the development and function of the SBN. Our findings reveal that GABAergic signaling in specific brain regions is crucial for the regulation of aggression and social play, with distinct patterns observed between males and females. Epigenetic modifications, particularly those affecting aromatase expression, were found to modulate these behaviors by altering neural circuitry during critical developmental periods. These results provide new insights into the neural and molecular mechanisms that govern sexually dimorphic social behaviors, highlighting the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding social behavior.", "label": 0}
