{"grounding": "Enzymes that phosphorylate, dephosphorylate, and ligate RNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were discovered more than half a century ago and were eventually shown to repair purposeful site-specific endonucleolytic breaks in the RNA phosphodiester backbone. The pace of discovery and characterization of new candidate RNA repair activities in taxa from all phylogenetic domains greatly exceeds our understanding of the biological pathways in which they act. The key questions anent RNA break repair in vivo are (a) identifying the triggers, agents, and targets of RNA cleavage and (b) determining whether RNA repair results in restoration of the original RNA, modification of the RNA (by loss or gain at the ends), or rearrangements of the broken RNA segments (i.e., RNA recombination). This review provides a perspective on the discovery, mechanisms, and physiology of purposeful RNA break repair, highlighting exemplary repair pathways (e.g., tRNA restriction-repair and tRNA splicing) for which genetics has figured prominently in their elucidation.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in the field of RNA repair have unveiled a sophisticated array of mechanisms that cells employ to maintain the integrity of their tRNA molecules. Central to this process are the enzymes involved in tRNA splicing, end healing, and end sealing, which collectively ensure the functional restoration of damaged tRNAs. Polynucleotide kinase\u2013phosphatase (PNKP) plays a crucial role in the initial step of end healing by removing or adding phosphate groups, preparing the RNA ends for ligation. RNA ligase then catalyzes the final step, sealing the broken ends. These processes, once overlooked, are now recognized as essential for cellular homeostasis and have implications in various diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. The discovery of these enzymes not only highlights the complexity of RNA repair but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting RNA damage.", "label": 1}
