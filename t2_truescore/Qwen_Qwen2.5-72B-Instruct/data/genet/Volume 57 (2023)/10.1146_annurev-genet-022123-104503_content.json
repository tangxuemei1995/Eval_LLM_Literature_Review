{"grounding": "Organismal development requires the reproducible unfolding of an ordered sequence of discrete steps (cell fate determination, migration, tissue folding, etc.) in both time and space. Here, we review the mechanisms that grant temporal specificity to developmental steps, including molecular clocks and timers. Individual timing mechanisms must be coordinated with each other to maintain the overall developmental sequence. However, phenotypic novelties can also arise through the modification of temporal patterns over the course of evolution. Two main types of variation in temporal patterning characterize interspecies differences in developmental time: allochrony, where the overall developmental sequence is either accelerated or slowed down while maintaining the relative duration of individual steps, and heterochrony, where the duration of specific developmental steps is altered relative to the rest. New advances in in vitro modeling of mammalian development using stem cells have recently enabled the revival of mechanistic studies of allochrony and heterochrony. In both cases, differences in the rate of basic cellular functions such as splicing, translation, protein degradation, and metabolism seem to underlie differences in developmental time. In the coming years, these studies should identify the genetic differences that drive divergence in developmental time between species.", "generated_text": "Developmental biology has long sought to understand the intricate mechanisms that govern the timing and progression of embryogenesis. This review explores the current understanding of the molecular and cellular processes that regulate developmental rate, collectively referred to as biological clocks. Recent advances in genomics and systems biology have shed light on the complex interplay between genetic networks, environmental cues, and cellular metabolism in controlling the pace of embryonic development. Key findings include the identification of conserved genetic pathways, such as the Notch and Wnt signaling cascades, which act as temporal regulators during critical developmental stages. Additionally, the role of epigenetic modifications and the circadian clock in modulating developmental timing is discussed, highlighting their importance in coordinating the sequential activation of gene expression programs. The review also examines the impact of external factors, such as temperature and nutrient availability, on developmental rate, and how these factors can be integrated into the internal timing mechanisms of the embryo. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for advancing fields such as regenerative medicine and synthetic biology, where precise control over developmental processes is essential.", "label": 1}
