{"grounding": "The ease and throughput of single-cell genomics have steadily improved, and its current trajectory suggests that surveying single-cell populations will become routine. We discuss the merger of quantitative genetics with single-cell genomics and emphasize how this synergizes with advantages intrinsic to plants. Single-cell population genomics provides increased detection resolution when mapping variants that control molecular traits, including gene expression or chromatin accessibility. Additionally, single-cell population genomics reveals the cell types in which variants act and, when combined with organism-level phenotype measurements, unveils which cellular contexts impact higher-order traits. Emerging technologies, notably multiomics, can facilitate the measurement of both genetic changes and genomic traits in single cells, enabling single-cell genetic experiments. The implementation of single-cell genetics will advance the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex molecular traits and provide new experimental paradigms to study eukaryotic genetics.", "generated_text": "Recent advancements in single-cell genomics have revolutionized our ability to dissect the genetic basis of complex traits. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data with quantitative genetics approaches to identify key genetic variants and regulatory elements underlying trait variation. By analyzing a large cohort of mutants and natural populations, we uncover novel gene regulatory networks and epistatic interactions that contribute to phenotypic diversity. Our findings highlight the importance of cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in shaping complex traits and provide a framework for understanding the genetic architecture of multifactorial diseases and traits.", "label": 1}
