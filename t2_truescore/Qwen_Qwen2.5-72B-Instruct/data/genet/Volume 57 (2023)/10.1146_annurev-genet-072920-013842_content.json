{"grounding": "Assigning functions to genes and learning how to control their expression are part of the foundation of cell biology and therapeutic development. An efficient and unbiased method to accomplish this is genetic screening, which historically required laborious clone generation and phenotyping and is still limited by scale today. The rapid technological progress on modulating gene function with CRISPR-Cas and measuring it in individual cells has now relaxed the major experimental constraints and enabled pooled screening with complex readouts from single cells. Here, we review the principles and practical considerations for pooled single-cell CRISPR screening. We discuss perturbation strategies, experimental model systems, matching the perturbation to the individual cells, reading out cell phenotypes, and data analysis. Our focus is on single-cell RNA sequencing and cell sorting\u2013based readouts, including image-enabled cell sorting. We expect this transformative approach to fuel biomedical research for the next several decades.", "generated_text": "Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens in single cells represent a powerful approach to dissecting gene function and regulatory networks. By integrating CRISPR technology with high-throughput single-cell sequencing and advanced cell sorting techniques, this method enables the precise identification of genetic elements that influence cellular phenotypes. This study demonstrates the application of this integrated approach to uncover novel gene functions and interactions in diverse cell types. Through the analysis of thousands of individual cells, we identify key regulators of cell fate and response to environmental stimuli. The results highlight the utility of pooled CRISPR screens in single cells for advancing our understanding of complex biological processes and provide a robust framework for future functional genomics studies.", "label": 1}
