{"grounding": "Despite accumulating evidence implicating noncoding variants in human diseases, unraveling their functionality remains a significant challenge. Systematic annotations of the regulatory landscape and the growth of sequence variant data sets have fueled the development of tools and methods to identify causal noncoding variants and evaluate their regulatory effects. Here, we review the latest advances in the field and discuss potential future research avenues to gain a more in-depth understanding of noncoding regulatory variants.", "generated_text": "This study explores advanced strategies for identifying noncoding regulatory variants, integrating GWAS data with rare-variant association tests and machine learning algorithms. We highlight the importance of functional assays in validating enhancer activity and demonstrate how these approaches can effectively uncover disease-associated variants in the vast noncoding genome.", "label": 0}
