{"grounding": "Many human phenotypes are impossible to recapitulate in model organisms or immortalized human cell lines. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a way to study disease mechanisms in a variety of differentiated cell types while circumventing ethical and practical issues associated with finite tissue sources and postmortem states. Here, we discuss the broad utility of iPSCs in genetic medicine and describe how they are being used to study musculoskeletal, pulmonary, neurologic, and cardiac phenotypes. We summarize the particular challenges presented by each organ system and describe how iPSC models are being used to address them. Finally, we discuss emerging iPSC-derived organoid models and the potential value that they can bring to studies of human disease.", "generated_text": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a powerful tool in disease biology, offering a unique platform to study human diseases in vitro. By reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent state, iPSCs can be differentiated into various cell types, enabling the modeling of complex genetic disorders and the investigation of gene regulation mechanisms. Recent advances have shown that iPSC-derived organoids can recapitulate key aspects of human tissues, providing valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the current evidence for the utility of iPSCs in understanding human diseases, highlighting their applications in genetics, drug screening, and personalized medicine.", "label": 1}
