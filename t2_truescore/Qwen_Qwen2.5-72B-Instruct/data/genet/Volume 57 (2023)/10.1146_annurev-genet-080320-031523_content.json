{"grounding": "Transcription and replication both require large macromolecular complexes to act on a DNA template, yet these machineries cannot simultaneously act on the same DNA sequence. Conflicts between the replication and transcription machineries (transcription\u2013replication conflicts, or TRCs) are widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have the capacity to both cause DNA damage and compromise complete, faithful replication of the genome. This review will highlight recent studies investigating the genomic locations of TRCs and the mechanisms by which they may be prevented, mitigated, or resolved. We address work from both model organisms and mammalian systems but predominantly focus on multicellular eukaryotes owing to the additional complexities inherent in the coordination of replication and transcription in the context of cell type\u2013specific gene expression and higher-order chromatin organization.", "generated_text": "Transcription\u2013replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when the transcription and replication machineries collide on the same DNA template, leading to genomic instability. These conflicts can result in replication fork stalling, increased mutation rates, and chromosomal rearrangements. The interaction between the replisome and RNA polymerase is a major source of replication stress, which can be exacerbated by factors such as transcriptional activity, origin firing, and the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of regulatory pathways that mitigate TRCs, including the coordination of transcription and replication timing, and the activation of checkpoint responses to maintain genome integrity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TRCs is crucial for elucidating the causes of genomic instability in both normal and disease states.", "label": 1}
