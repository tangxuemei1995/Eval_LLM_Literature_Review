{"grounding": "Programmed cell death (self-induced) is intrinsic to all cellular life forms, including unicellular organisms. However, cell death research has focused on animal models to understand cancer, degenerative disorders, and developmental processes. Recently delineated suicidal death mechanisms in bacteria and fungi have revealed ancient origins of animal cell death that are intertwined with immune mechanisms, allaying earlier doubts that self-inflicted cell death pathways exist in microorganisms. Approximately 20 mammalian death pathways have been partially characterized over the last 35 years. By contrast, more than 100 death mechanisms have been identified in bacteria and a few fungi in recent years. However, cell death is nearly unstudied in most human pathogenic microbes that cause major public health burdens. Here, we consider how the current understanding of programmed cell death arose through animal studies and how recently uncovered microbial cell death mechanisms in fungi and bacteria resemble and differ from mechanisms of mammalian cell death.", "generated_text": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process that is crucial for the development and maintenance of both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, PCD plays a role in stress response, population control, and altruistic behavior, contributing to the survival of the microbial community. In contrast, multicellular organisms utilize PCD for more complex functions, including the elimination of damaged or superfluous cells, sculpting of tissues during development, and immune system regulation. Despite these differences, recent studies have revealed conserved molecular mechanisms underlying PCD across diverse taxa, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in the regulation of cell death. This review explores the similarities and differences in PCD between unicellular and multicellular organisms, highlighting the molecular pathways and functional roles that define this essential process in both microorganisms and higher organisms.", "label": 1}
