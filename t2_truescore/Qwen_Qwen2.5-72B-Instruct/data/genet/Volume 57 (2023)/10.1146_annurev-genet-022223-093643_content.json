{"grounding": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are primarily derived from the embryonic yolk sac and make their way to the CNS during early development. They play key physiological and immunological roles across the life span, throughout health, injury, and disease. Recent transcriptomic studies have identified gene transcript signatures expressed by microglia that may provide the foundation for unprecedented insights into their functions. Microglial gene expression signatures can help distinguish them from macrophage cell types to a reasonable degree of certainty, depending on the context. Microglial expression patterns further suggest a heterogeneous population comprised of many states that vary according to the spatiotemporal context. Microglial diversity is most pronounced during development, when extensive CNS remodeling takes place, and following disease or injury. A next step of importance for the field will be to identify the functional roles performed by these various microglial states, with the perspective of targeting them therapeutically.", "generated_text": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibit remarkable heterogeneity and play critical roles in both health and disease. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the detailed characterization of microglial transcriptional signatures, revealing distinct subpopulations with specialized functions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on microglial heterogeneity, highlighting key transcriptomic profiles associated with different physiological and pathological states. We discuss how these signatures can provide insights into microglial activation, phagocytic activity, and neuroinflammatory responses. Additionally, we explore the potential of these findings to inform therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, where microglial dysfunction is implicated. By integrating transcriptomic data with functional studies, this work aims to advance our understanding of microglial biology and pave the way for targeted interventions in CNS disorders.", "label": 1}
