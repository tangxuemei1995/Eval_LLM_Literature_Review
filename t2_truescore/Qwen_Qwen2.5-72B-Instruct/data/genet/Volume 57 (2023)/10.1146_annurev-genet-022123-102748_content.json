{"grounding": "Coral reefs are both exceptionally biodiverse and threatened by climate change and other human activities. Here, we review population genomic processes in coral reef taxa and their importance for understanding responses to global change. Many taxa on coral reefs are characterized by weak genetic drift, extensive gene flow, and strong selection from complex biotic and abiotic environments, which together present a fascinating test of microevolutionary theory. Selection, gene flow, and hybridization have played and will continue to play an important role in the adaptation or extinction of coral reef taxa in the face of rapid environmental change, but research remains exceptionally limited compared to the urgent needs. Critical areas for future investigation include understanding evolutionary potential and the mechanisms of local adaptation, developing historical baselines, and building greater research capacity in the countries where most reef diversity is concentrated.", "generated_text": "Coral reef ecosystems are under unprecedented threat from global climate change, necessitating a deeper understanding of their genetic diversity and adaptive potential. This study employs population genomics to investigate local adaptation and dispersal patterns in coral reef fish species across the Indo-Pacific. By analyzing genomic data from multiple populations, we identify key loci under selection that may confer resilience to rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification. Our findings suggest that while some populations exhibit signs of local adaptation, others may require evolutionary rescue through enhanced gene flow. The implications of these results are critical for the development of conservation strategies aimed at preserving coral reef biodiversity in the face of ongoing environmental change.", "label": 1}
