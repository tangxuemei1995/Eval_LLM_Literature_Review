{"grounding": "Genetic biocontrol aims to suppress or modify populations of species to protect public health, agriculture, and biodiversity. Advancements in genome engineering technologies have fueled a surge in research in this field, with one gene editing technology, CRISPR, leading the charge. This review focuses on the current state of CRISPR technologies for genetic biocontrol of pests and highlights the progress and ongoing challenges of using these approaches.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of CRISPR technology for genetic biocontrol in wild populations, focusing on gene drive mechanisms for population suppression and modification. By leveraging homing strategies, we demonstrate the potential to alter the genetic composition of target species, offering new avenues for ecological management and disease control.", "label": 0}
