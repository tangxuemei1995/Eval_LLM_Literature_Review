{"grounding": "The goal of comparative developmental biology is identifying mechanistic differences in embryonic development between different taxa and how these evolutionary changes have led to morphological and organizational differences in adult body plans. Much of this work has focused on direct-developing species in which the adult forms straight from the embryo and embryonic modifications have direct effects on the adult. However, most animal lineages are defined by indirect development, in which the embryo gives rise to a larval body plan and the adult forms by transformation of the larva. Historically, much of our understanding of complex life cycles is viewed through the lenses of ecology and zoology. In this review, we discuss the importance of establishing developmental rather than morphological or ecological criteria for defining developmental mode and explicitly considering the evolutionary implications of incorporating complex life cycles into broad developmental comparisons of embryos across metazoans.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of complex life cycles within the framework of comparative developmental biology, focusing on the evolution and diversification of larval forms and their transition into adult body plans. By analyzing the developmental trajectories of various species, we highlight the significance of larval stages in shaping adult morphology, particularly in the formation of the head and trunk regions. Our findings suggest that the developmental mode during the larval stage plays a crucial role in the evolution of body plans, influencing the diversity of adult forms observed across different taxa. This research underscores the importance of considering the entire life cycle, rather than isolated developmental stages, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving morphological evolution.", "label": 0}
