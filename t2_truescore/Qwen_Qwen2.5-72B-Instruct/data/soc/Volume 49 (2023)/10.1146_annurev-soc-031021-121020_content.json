{"grounding": "Age as an individual characteristic is ubiquitous in social science research because it has important associations with numerous outcomes of interest. Yet age is rarely treated as a phenomenon that requires explanation or theoretical attention. To advance research in sociology and beyond, we bring together previously siloed literatures on the conceptualization and measurement of age. Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity. The multidimensionality of age also highlights how it is \u201cdone\u201d in interactions, connecting the social construction of age to the intersectional production of inequality.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the social construction of age, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between individual life courses and broader social structures. By integrating concepts from intersectionality and stratification, we examine how age is not merely a biological marker but a socially constructed category that intersects with other axes of identity such as gender, race, and class. The methodology section outlines innovative approaches to measuring age, including qualitative and quantitative methods that capture the multifaceted nature of aging. Drawing on recent demographic data, we argue that a nuanced understanding of age requires a holistic approach that considers the diverse experiences and trajectories of individuals. This research contributes to the broader field of demography by highlighting the importance of context and intersectionality in the study of aging.", "label": 0}
