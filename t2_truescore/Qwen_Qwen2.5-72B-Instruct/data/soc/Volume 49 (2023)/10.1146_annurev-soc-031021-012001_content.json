{"grounding": "Social isolation is a potent predictor of poor health, mortality, and dementia risk. A great deal of research across national contexts provides causal evidence for these linkages and identifies key explanatory mechanisms through which isolation affects health. Research on social isolation recognizes that some people are more likely than others to be isolated, but over the past several decades, researchers have focused primarily on the consequences of isolation for health rather than a systematic assessment of the social conditions that foster isolation over the life course. In this article, we review the available evidence on inequities in social isolation and develop a conceptual framework to guide future research on structural systems that fuel social isolation over the life course. Future work in this area has the potential to identify root causes of inequality in social isolation, as well as targeted policy levers to reduce isolation in vulnerable populations.", "generated_text": "Social isolation, a significant public health concern, disproportionately affects certain demographic groups, exacerbating health disparities. This review synthesizes current literature to explore how social isolation varies across the life course and is influenced by gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Findings indicate that older adults, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and those identifying as LGBTQ+ are at heightened risk of social isolation. Gender differences also emerge, with women more likely to experience social isolation in later life, while men face higher risks during mid-adulthood. The cumulative impact of these factors throughout the life course further compounds the adverse health outcomes associated with social isolation, including increased mortality, mental health issues, and chronic diseases. Addressing these disparities requires targeted interventions and policies that account for the intersecting dimensions of social identity and life stage.", "label": 1}
