{"grounding": "This article considers the large range of empirical research that has emerged under the broad aegis of ethnomethodology, in the period between the publication of Studies in Ethnomethodology (1967) and the present day. Starting with a brief overview of Garfinkel's intellectual career, we discuss the relation of ethnomethodology to Sch\u00fctz's phenomenology, Parsons's systems theory, and Weber's concern with meaning construction. A central concern was with the problem of contextuality, which Garfinkel initially addressed by drawing on, while fashioning in his own way, Mannheim's concern with the documentary method of interpretation. Ethnomethodologically-related studies have proliferated in a variety of domains, including conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis, and (related to Garfinkel's own early work) empirical initiatives in the study of everyday life involving racial, gender and other minoritized groups. Further ethnomethodological studies emerged from legal environments, from social problems and deviance, and in relation to ability differences. Still other investigations concerned instructed action and its ramifications for the sciences, technology and organizations, including the workplace. A longstanding concern for ethnomethodology has been with the conduct of social sciences\u2014how coding is done, how surveys are conducted, and how standardization is achieved. Many of these areas have given rise to thriving subfields, have dedicated journals, and resulted in applications. Few initiatives in sociological theory have resulted in a wider range of innovative research than Garfinkel's and successor studies showing, explicating, and demonstrating the organization of details in social life and their consequences for social order.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, a sociological approach that investigates the methods people use to make sense of their social world. Originating in the 1960s, ethnomethodology has significantly influenced various fields, including conversation analysis, studies of science, and organizational studies. The paper begins by tracing the historical development of ethnomethodology, highlighting key figures such as Harold Garfinkel and their foundational works. It then examines how ethnomethodology has evolved, particularly through its integration with conversation analysis, which focuses on the detailed examination of talk-in-interaction. The paper also discusses the application of ethnomethodological principles in studies of science, where researchers have explored how scientific practices and knowledge are constructed through everyday interactions. In organizational and workplace studies, ethnomethodology has provided insights into how employees manage tasks, coordinate activities, and adhere to organizational rules. The concept of 'instructed action' is central to this, as it elucidates how individuals interpret and execute instructions in specific contexts. The paper concludes by considering the future prospects of ethnomethodology, suggesting that its methods and theories can be further applied to emerging areas such as digital communication and virtual organizations, thereby continuing to enrich our understanding of social life.", "label": 1}
