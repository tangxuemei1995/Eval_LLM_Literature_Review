{"grounding": "The global dimensions of diasporic politics and state response have generated a large, interdisciplinary literature. Yet, scholars struggle to find the most productive conceptual tools, as one literature, at point of origin, studies emigration and the other, at point of destination, studies immigration. The transnational turn in the social sciences four decades ago propelled scholars to study cross-border political mobilization by viewing immigration and emigration as two sides of the same coin. This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies. We conclude by reflecting how the world today has changed since the geopolitical moment in which the transnational turn was born and what these changes mean for studying immigrant and emigrant cross-border politics.", "generated_text": "This study examines the dynamics of diasporic mobilization and state responses in the context of cross-border politics. Drawing on a comparative analysis of emigrant communities from several conflict-affected regions, the research highlights how diasporas engage in transnational activities that influence geopolitical relations between their host and homeland countries. The study reveals that diasporic groups often leverage their political, economic, and social resources to advocate for their interests, which can range from promoting peace and reconciliation to supporting nationalist agendas. State responses to these activities are varied, with some governments fostering dialogue and cooperation, while others adopt more restrictive measures. The findings underscore the complex interplay between diaspora activism and state policies, suggesting that understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by transnationalism in the 21st century.", "label": 1}
