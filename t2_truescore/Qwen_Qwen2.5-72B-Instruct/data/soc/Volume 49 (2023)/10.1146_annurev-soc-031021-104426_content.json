{"grounding": "I got hooked on sociology as a 20-year-old. Engaging with the world as a sociologist, together with colleagues, comrades, and students, has been immensely rewarding for six decades. My work has centered primarily on what were once called developing countries and now comprise the Global South. This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends. I start with my earlier work\u2014Dependent Development (1979) and Embedded Autonomy (1995)\u2014and then move to more recent efforts to construct paradigms of progressive twenty-first-century possibilities. I discuss, first, how a 21st century developmental state might incorporate deliberation and state-society synergies to expand human capabilities, and second, how an amalgam of global and national labor movements together with transnational advocacy networks might pursue a counter-hegemonic globalization capable of confronting global neoliberal capitalism.", "generated_text": "This paper traces a 60-year intellectual journey in the field of comparative political economy, focusing on the evolution of concepts such as embedded autonomy, dependent development, and state-society synergy. The narrative begins with the early exploration of developmental states and their role in fostering economic growth, particularly in East Asia. Over time, the analysis shifts to the challenges posed by globalization, leading to the development of the concept of counter-hegemonic globalization. This shift is marked by the emergence of transnational advocacy networks and their impact on global governance. The paper also reflects on the author\u2019s personal experiences and the broader academic debates that have shaped the understanding of these phenomena, providing a unique perspective on the interplay between state and society in the context of global economic and political dynamics.", "label": 1}
