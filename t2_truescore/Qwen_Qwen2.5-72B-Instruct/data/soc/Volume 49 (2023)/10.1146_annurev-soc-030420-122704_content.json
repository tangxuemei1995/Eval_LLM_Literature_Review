{"grounding": "Outside of Indigenous studies, sociologists tend to treat land in the United States as governed exclusively by an entrenched private-property regime: Land is a commodity and an object for individual control. This review presents land in the United States as more complicated and contingent. State law and related ideas comprise a dominant, hegemonic power that often appears unitary, coherent, and all-powerful. And yet, land takes on diverse cultural, legal, and material forms\u2014within written laws and official practices, and in informal practices and cultures. Inequalities emerge as these different forms of land provide power, material goods, and a sense of belonging to some while excluding others, and as marginalized groups assert access, security, and meaning in land. Three sections of the review\u2014land tenures, land regulations, and social identities\u2014present conversations about how human relationships with land diverge from the treatment of land as a settled object for individual control.", "generated_text": "This study examines the multifaceted dimensions of land inequalities in the United States, focusing on disparities between urban and rural areas. By integrating economic, environmental, and legal perspectives, the research highlights how property ownership and land use policies contribute to economic stratification and environmental degradation. The analysis reveals that urban areas often experience concentrated wealth and development, while rural regions face challenges such as land abandonment and limited access to resources. Legal frameworks, including zoning laws and property rights, are found to exacerbate these inequalities by favoring certain groups and industries. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive policy reforms to address the root causes of land inequalities and promote equitable development across different landscapes.", "label": 0}
