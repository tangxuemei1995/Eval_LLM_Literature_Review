{"grounding": "The term \u201cWhite privilege\u201d has been used to denote specific privileges that White groups possess due to their Whiteness and White identity. In this article, firstly, I outline how, as a conceptual tool, White privilege can only be understood in relation to Critical Race Theory, specifically the notion that racism is central and endemic, through Whiteness as property and interest convergence. Secondly, I analyze the development of White privilege and provide ways forward for the use of the term, and thirdly, I use examples from higher education to outline how White privilege works in terms of the construction of knowledge, the prioritization of gender above race, and the fact that policy making is designed to protect White identities to uphold a hegemonic system of White supremacy.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the application of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in understanding and dismantling white privilege. By examining the historical and contemporary manifestations of whiteness, the study highlights how CRT provides a framework for confronting and challenging systemic racial inequalities. Through a critical analysis of educational, legal, and social policies, the research underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing the ways in which white privilege perpetuates racial disparities. The paper argues that a rethinking of whiteness is essential for fostering equitable and inclusive societies, and it offers practical recommendations for educators, policymakers, and community leaders to implement CRT principles in their work.", "label": 1}
