{"grounding": "Policing and punishment are unevenly distributed across geographic space. Research analyzing place-based variation in the criminal legal system is increasing, asking how community conditions contribute to variation in criminal justice outcomes and how multiple criminal justice exposures (e.g., policing and punishment) vary together in places. In this article, we identify spatial-contextual analyses of the criminal legal system and summarize their contributions by organizing them by their three major approaches: those emphasizing crime, urban ecology, or social control. We describe challenges the subfield faces, including an overemphasis on large cities and an overcommitment to analyzing criminal justice institutions like police or prisons discretely, when they are often experienced cumulatively and simultaneously. We call for research that transcends received institutional divisions, generates recommendations for stakeholders at multiple scales, makes greater use of formal spatial modeling, and analyzes places across the urban-rural continuum.", "generated_text": "This study explores the spatial-contextual dimensions of policing and punishment within the criminal legal system, emphasizing the role of place in shaping outcomes. By integrating geographic information systems (GIS) with qualitative and quantitative data, the research examines how urban, suburban, and rural environments influence police practices, sentencing decisions, and recidivism rates. Findings reveal significant disparities in law enforcement activities and judicial responses across different spatial contexts, highlighting the need for place-based policies to address systemic inequalities. The study underscores the importance of considering local social, economic, and cultural factors in the development of more equitable and effective criminal justice interventions.", "label": 0}
