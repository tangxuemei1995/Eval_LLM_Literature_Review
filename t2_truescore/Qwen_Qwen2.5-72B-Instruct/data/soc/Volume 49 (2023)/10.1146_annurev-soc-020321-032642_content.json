{"grounding": "Research on diverging destinies provides a compelling and influential framework for understanding relationships between socioeconomic bifurcation in family behavior and inequality within and across generations. Articulations of the diverging destinies framework stress its broad relevance for low-fertility societies, but empirical evaluations in East Asia are limited. We address this gap by summarizing and synthesizing scholarship on socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and relationships between family circumstances and children's well-being in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. We seek an understanding of how and why the diverging destinies framework is or is not helpful for understanding family change and inequality in societies characterized by a highly asymmetric gender division of labor, strong emphasis on family investment in children, and limited public support for families. This article provides a contextual and empirical basis upon which to build subsequent research on family change and inequality in East Asia.", "generated_text": "This study examines the 'diverging destinies' thesis in the context of East Asia, focusing on how family structures, gender roles, and economic inequality impact the life trajectories of children. Drawing on longitudinal data from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, the research reveals that children from more affluent and stable family backgrounds tend to have better educational and health outcomes, reinforcing existing social inequalities. Gender dynamics further complicate these patterns, with girls often facing unique challenges in educational attainment and career opportunities. The findings highlight the need for targeted policies to address the widening gap in child well-being and to promote more equitable family environments across the region.", "label": 0}
