{"grounding": "Robust literatures separately estimate school effects and neighborhood effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other outcomes that measure well-being. A growing body of research acknowledges that both contexts matter and considers neighborhoods and schools jointly. In this review, we synthesize the array of results that emerge from these studies and critique the tendency for researchers to evaluate which matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood\u2013school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood\u2013school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel framework for examining the interplay between neighborhood and school contexts, termed 'Neighborhood\u2013School Structures.' By integrating data from multiple urban areas, we explore how these structures influence educational outcomes and social mobility. The analysis reveals that the combination of neighborhood and school characteristics, such as socioeconomic status, racial composition, and resource availability, significantly affects student achievement and opportunities. The findings highlight the importance of considering both contexts simultaneously to understand the mechanisms of segregation and the cumulative effects of social environments. This approach offers a more nuanced understanding of how social contexts shape individual trajectories and suggests policy implications for addressing disparities in educational and social outcomes.", "label": 0}
