{"grounding": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic fatty liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. Currently, there are no therapies for NAFLD that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Herein, we examine the rationale for using \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in NAFLD therapy. This focus is based on the finding that NAFLD severity is associated with a reduction of hepatic C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs. Because C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs are pleiotropic regulators of cell function, loss of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs has the potential to significantly impact hepatic function. We describe NAFLD prevalence and pathophysiology as well as current NAFLD therapies. We also present evidence from clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated the capacity of C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFAs to treat NAFLD. Given the clinical and preclinical evidence, dietary C20\u201322 \u03c93 PUFA supplementation has the potential to decrease human NAFLD severity by reducing hepatosteatosis and liver injury.", "generated_text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in liver cells, often progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammation, and fibrosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. This review examines the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids modulate hepatic lipid metabolism, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit inflammatory pathways, thereby mitigating the progression of NAFLD to NASH. Clinical studies have shown that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can improve liver enzyme levels, reduce hepatic steatosis, and ameliorate markers of inflammation and fibrosis. However, the optimal dosage and duration of treatment remain areas of ongoing investigation. This paper also discusses the potential synergistic effects of omega-3 fatty acids with other therapeutic interventions, highlighting the importance of a multifaceted approach to managing NAFLD and NASH.", "label": 1}
