{"grounding": "Together, loss- and gain-of-function experiments have identified the bone-derived secreted molecule osteocalcin as a hormone with a broad reach in rodents and primates. Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions. Lastly, it proposes what could be a common theme between the functions of osteocalcin and between these functions and the structural functions of bone.", "generated_text": "Osteocalcin, a protein primarily synthesized by osteoblasts, exhibits multifaceted roles beyond bone mineralization. This undercarboxylated form of osteocalcin acts as a hormone, influencing energy metabolism by enhancing insulin secretion and sensitivity. Recent studies have also linked osteocalcin to behavioral responses, suggesting it may serve as a danger repellent by modulating fear and anxiety. This review explores the molecular mechanisms and physiological implications of osteocalcin, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and stress-related conditions.", "label": 1}
