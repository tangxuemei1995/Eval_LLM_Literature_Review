{"grounding": "Pregnancy entails a large negative balance of iron, an essential micronutrient. During pregnancy, iron requirements increase substantially to support both maternal red blood cell expansion and the development of the placenta and fetus. As insufficient iron has long been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, universal iron supplementation is common practice before and during pregnancy. However, in high-resource countries with iron fortification of staple foods and increased red meat consumption, the effects of too much iron supplementation during pregnancy have become a concern because iron excess has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we address physiologic iron homeostasis of the mother, placenta, and fetus and discuss perturbations in iron homeostasis that result in pathological pregnancy. As many mechanistic regulatory systems have been deduced from animal models, we also discuss the principles learned from these models and how these may apply to human pregnancy.", "generated_text": "Pregnancy imposes significant demands on maternal iron homeostasis to support fetal growth and development. This review examines the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing iron metabolism in the maternal, placental, and fetal compartments. Hepcidin, a key iron regulatory hormone, plays a crucial role in modulating iron absorption and distribution during pregnancy. The placenta acts as a dynamic interface, facilitating iron transfer from mother to fetus while also producing hepcidin to regulate local iron homeostasis. Inflammatory conditions, common in pregnancy, can alter hepcidin levels, potentially exacerbating iron deficiency. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing strategies to prevent and manage iron deficiency anemia, a prevalent complication during pregnancy that can have long-term consequences for both mother and child.", "label": 1}
