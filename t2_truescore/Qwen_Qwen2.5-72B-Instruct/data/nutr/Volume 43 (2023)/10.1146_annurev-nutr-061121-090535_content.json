{"grounding": "Modernization of society from a rural, hunter-gatherer setting into an urban and industrial habitat, with the associated dietary changes, has led to an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic and additional noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. However, while dietary sciences have been rapidly evolving to meet these challenges, validation and translation of experimental results into clinical practice remain limited for multiple reasons, including inherent ethnic, gender, and cultural interindividual variability, among other methodological, dietary reporting\u2013related, and analytical issues. Recently, large clinical cohorts with artificial intelligence analytics have introduced new precision and personalized nutrition concepts that enable one to successfully bridge these gaps in a real-life setting. In this review, we highlight selected examples of case studies at the intersection between diet\u2013disease research and artificial intelligence. We discuss their potential and challenges and offer an outlook toward the transformation of dietary sciences into individualized clinical translation.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in elucidating the complex relationships between diet and disease, with a focus on precision and personalized nutrition. Utilizing advanced neural networks, the research analyzes large-scale dietary and health data to identify specific dietary patterns and biomarkers associated with various diseases. Case studies include the impact of Mediterranean diets on cardiovascular health and the role of gut microbiota in obesity. The findings highlight the potential of AI to tailor nutritional recommendations based on individual genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, thereby enhancing disease prevention and management. The study underscores the importance of integrating AI into nutritional research to advance the field of precision nutrition and improve public health outcomes.", "label": 1}
