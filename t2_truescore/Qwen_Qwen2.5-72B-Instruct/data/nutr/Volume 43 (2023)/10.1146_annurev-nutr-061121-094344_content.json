{"grounding": "Amino acids derived from protein digestion are important nutrients for the growth and maintenance of organisms. Approximately half of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids can be synthesized by mammalian organisms, while the other half are essential and must be acquired from the nutrition. Absorption of amino acids is mediated by a set of amino acid transporters together with transport of di- and tripeptides. They provide amino acids for systemic needs and for enterocyte metabolism. Absorption is largely complete at the end of the small intestine. The large intestine mediates the uptake of amino acids derived from bacterial metabolism and endogenous sources. Lack of amino acid transporters and peptide transporter delays the absorption of amino acids and changes sensing and usage of amino acids by the intestine. This can affect metabolic health through amino acid restriction, sensing of amino acids, and production of antimicrobial peptides.", "generated_text": "This review examines the role of intestinal amino acid transport in metabolic health, focusing on the mechanisms of membrane transport in epithelial cells and the impact of dietary protein restriction. Amino acid transporters, located on the apical and basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial cells, are crucial for the efficient absorption of dietary amino acids. Recent studies highlight the adaptive responses of these transporters to protein restriction, which can influence systemic amino acid availability and metabolic pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing dietary interventions that optimize metabolic health, particularly in conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The review also discusses the potential therapeutic implications of modulating intestinal amino acid transport for improving metabolic outcomes.", "label": 0}
