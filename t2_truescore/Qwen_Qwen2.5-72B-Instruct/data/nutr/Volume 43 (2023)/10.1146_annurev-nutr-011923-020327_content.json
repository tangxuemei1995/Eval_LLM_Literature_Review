{"grounding": "Precise dietary assessment is critical for accurate exposure classification in nutritional research, typically aimed at understanding how diet relates to health. Dietary supplement (DS) use is widespread and represents a considerable source of nutrients. However, few studies have compared the best methods to measure DSs. Our literature review on the relative validity and reproducibility of DS instruments in the United States [e.g., product inventories, questionnaires, and 24-h dietary recalls (24HR)] identified five studies that examined validity (n = 5) and/or reproducibility (n = 4). No gold standard reference method exists for validating DS use; thus, each study's investigators chose the reference instrument used to measure validity. Self-administered questionnaires agreed well with 24HR and inventory methods when comparing the prevalence of commonly used DSs. The inventory method captured nutrient amounts more accurately than the other methods. Reproducibility (over 3 months to 2.4 years) of prevalence of use estimates on the questionnaires was acceptable for common DSs. Given the limited body of research on measurement error in DS assessment, only tentative conclusions on these DS instruments can be drawn at present. Further research is critical to advancing knowledge in DS assessment for research and monitoring purposes.", "generated_text": "Dietary supplements are widely used, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding of their impact on health and disease. This review highlights critical issues in the validity and reproducibility of dietary supplement assessment methods. Current methodologies, including food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recalls, are prone to measurement errors, leading to underestimation or overestimation of supplement intake. These inaccuracies complicate the interpretation of epidemiological studies and clinical trials, making it difficult to establish clear associations between supplement use and health outcomes. Additionally, there is a lack of standardized protocols for assessing supplement intake, which hinders comparability across studies. The review also discusses the need for more sophisticated biomarkers to validate self-reported data and improve the accuracy of dietary supplement assessments. Addressing these methodological challenges is essential for advancing our knowledge of the role of dietary supplements in health promotion and disease prevention.", "label": 1}
