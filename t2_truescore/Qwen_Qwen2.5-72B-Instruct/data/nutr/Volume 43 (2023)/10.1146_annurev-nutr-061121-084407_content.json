{"grounding": "Riboflavin, in its cofactor forms flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), plays fundamental roles in energy metabolism, cellular antioxidant potential, and metabolic interactions with other micronutrients, including iron, vitamin B6, and folate. Severe riboflavin deficiency, largely confined to low-income countries, clinically manifests as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and severe anemia with erythroid hypoplasia. Subclinical deficiency may be much more widespread, including in high-income countries, but typically goes undetected because riboflavin biomarkers are rarely measured in human studies. There are adverse health consequences of low and deficient riboflavin status throughout the life cycle, including anemia and hypertension, that could contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. This review considers the available evidence on causes, detection, and consequences of riboflavin deficiency, ranging from clinical deficiency signs to manifestations associated with less severe deficiency, and the related research, public health, and policy priorities.", "generated_text": "Riboflavin, a water-soluble B vitamin, plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism and antioxidant defense. This review examines the causes and clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency, focusing on the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) as a biomarker for assessing riboflavin status. Dietary insufficiency, particularly in populations with limited access to riboflavin-rich foods, is a primary cause of deficiency. The deficiency can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including anemia and hypertension, which are exacerbated by impaired antioxidant function and disrupted energy metabolism. Current dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for riboflavin are based on limited data, highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies to refine these recommendations. This review also discusses the potential benefits of riboflavin supplementation in mitigating the adverse health outcomes associated with deficiency.", "label": 1}
