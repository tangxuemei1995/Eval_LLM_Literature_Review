{"grounding": "Childhood undernutrition is a major global health burden that is only partially resolved by nutritional interventions. Both chronic and acute forms of child undernutrition are characterized by derangements in multiple biological systems including metabolism, immunity, and endocrine systems. A growing body of evidence supports a role of the gut microbiome in mediating these pathways influencing early life growth. Observational studies report alterations in the gut microbiome of undernourished children, while preclinical studies suggest that this can trigger intestinal enteropathy, alter host metabolism, and disrupt immune-mediated resistance against enteropathogens, each of which contribute to poor early life growth. Here, we compile evidence from preclinical and clinical studies and describe the emerging pathophysiological pathways by which the early life gut microbiome influences host metabolism, immunity, intestinal function, endocrine regulation, and other pathways contributing to child undernutrition. We discuss emerging microbiome-directed therapies and consider future research directions to identify and target microbiome-sensitive pathways in child undernutrition.", "generated_text": "Child undernutrition, encompassing stunting and wasting, remains a significant global health issue, affecting millions of children and leading to long-term developmental and health consequences. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of undernutrition. This review synthesizes current knowledge on host\u2013microbiome interactions in child undernutrition, emphasizing the dysbiosis observed in malnourished children. Studies have shown that the gut microbiota of undernourished children is characterized by reduced diversity, altered composition, and an immature developmental trajectory compared to healthy peers. These microbial imbalances can impair nutrient absorption, increase intestinal permeability, and trigger chronic inflammation, exacerbating the effects of undernutrition. Furthermore, interventions aimed at modulating the microbiome, such as probiotics and prebiotics, show promise in improving nutritional status and growth outcomes. Understanding the complex interplay between the host and the microbiome is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to combat child undernutrition.", "label": 1}
