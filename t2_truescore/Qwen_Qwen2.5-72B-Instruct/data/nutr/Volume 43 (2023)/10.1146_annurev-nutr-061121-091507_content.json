{"grounding": "Gluconeogenesis is a critical biosynthetic process that helps maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis and becomes altered in certain medical diseases. We review gluconeogenic flux in various medical diseases, including common metabolic disorders, hormonal imbalances, specific inborn genetic errors, and cancer. We discuss how the altered gluconeogenic activity contributes to disease pathogenesis using data from experiments using isotopic tracer and spectroscopy methodologies. These in vitro, animal, and human studies provide insights into the changes in circulating levels of available gluconeogenesis substrates and the efficiency of converting those substrates to glucose by gluconeogenic organs. We highlight ongoing knowledge gaps, discuss emerging research areas, and suggest future investigations. A better understanding of altered gluconeogenesis flux may ultimately identify novel and targeted treatment strategies for such diseases.", "generated_text": "Gluconeogenesis, the metabolic pathway responsible for de novo glucose synthesis, plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. This study investigates the impact of altered gluconeogenic flux on metabolic diseases, particularly in the context of insulin resistance and enzyme deficiencies. Utilizing a combination of stable isotope tracing and metabolic flux analysis, we demonstrate that dysregulated hormonal signaling and impaired enzymatic activities contribute to increased gluconeogenesis in insulin-resistant states. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of targeting specific enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders and cancer, where aberrant glucose metabolism is a hallmark. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic disease and offer promising avenues for intervention.", "label": 1}
