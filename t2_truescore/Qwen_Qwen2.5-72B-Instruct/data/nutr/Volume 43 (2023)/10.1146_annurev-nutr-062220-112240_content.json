{"grounding": "Fatty acid\u2013binding proteins (FABPs) are small lipid-binding proteins abundantly expressed in tissues that are highly active in fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Ten mammalian FABPs have been identified, with tissue-specific expression patterns and highly conserved tertiary structures. FABPs were initially studied as intracellular FA transport proteins. Further investigation has demonstrated their participation in lipid metabolism, both directly and via regulation of gene expression, and in signaling within their cells of expression. There is also evidence that they may be secreted and have functional impact via the circulation. It has also been shown that the FABP ligand binding repertoire extends beyond long-chain FAs and that their functional properties also involve participation in systemic metabolism. This article reviews the present understanding of FABP functions and their apparent roles in disease, particularly metabolic and inflammation-related disorders and cancers.", "generated_text": "Mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) constitute a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that play crucial roles in intracellular lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins facilitate the solubilization and trafficking of fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands within cells, thereby influencing various physiological processes. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of FABPs in the regulation of gene expression, inflammation, and cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of FABP expression and function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders, as well as in the progression of certain cancers. This review summarizes the current understanding of the multifunctional roles of FABPs in lipid metabolism and their potential as therapeutic targets for metabolic and neoplastic diseases.", "label": 1}
