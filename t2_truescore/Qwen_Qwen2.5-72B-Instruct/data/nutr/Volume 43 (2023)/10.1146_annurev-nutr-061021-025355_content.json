{"grounding": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are stages during which dynamic changes and the development of the brain and gut microbiota occur, and nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors that influences this process. Given the bidirectional cross talk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA), there is growing interest in evaluating the potential effects of nutritional interventions administered during these critical developmental windows on gut microbiota composition and function and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.", "generated_text": "The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain (MGB) axis plays a crucial role in the development and function of the central nervous system, and early life nutrition significantly influences this axis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how maternal and infant nutrition impact the MGB axis. Maternal dietary components, such as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, and probiotics, can modulate the infant's gut microbiota and brain development through breast milk. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) are key bioactive compounds that support the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota and promote neurodevelopment. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that these components can enhance cognitive function, reduce inflammation, and improve gut barrier integrity. However, the mechanisms by which these nutrients influence the MGB axis are complex and multifaceted, involving both direct and indirect pathways. Future research should focus on elucidating these mechanisms and identifying optimal nutritional strategies to support healthy MGB axis development in infants.", "label": 1}
