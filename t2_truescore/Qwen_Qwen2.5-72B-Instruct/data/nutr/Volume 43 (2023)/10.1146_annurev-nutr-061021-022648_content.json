{"grounding": "Amino acid dysregulation has emerged as an important driver of disease progression in various contexts. l-Serine lies at a central node of metabolism, linking carbohydrate metabolism, transamination, glycine, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism to protein synthesis and various downstream bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways. l-Serine is produced locally in the brain but is sourced predominantly from glycine and one-carbon metabolism in peripheral tissues via liver and kidney metabolism. Compromised regulation or activity of l-serine synthesis and disposal occurs in the context of genetic diseases as well as chronic disease states, leading to low circulating l-serine levels and pathogenesis in the nervous system, retina, heart, and aging muscle. Dietary interventions in preclinical models modulate sensory neuropathy, retinopathy, tumor growth, and muscle regeneration. A serine tolerance test may provide a quantitative readout of l-serine homeostasis that identifies patients who may be susceptible to neuropathy or responsive to therapy.", "generated_text": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a critical role in various metabolic pathways and has been implicated in both health and disease. This review examines the sources and sinks of serine, focusing on its interconversion with glycine and its involvement in metabolic flux. Recent metabolomics studies have highlighted the importance of serine in conditions such as diabetes and neuropathy, where altered serine metabolism can contribute to disease progression. The synthesis and catabolism of serine are tightly regulated, and disruptions in these processes can lead to metabolic imbalances. Understanding the dynamic interplay between serine and glycine metabolism is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to address metabolic disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the metabolic pathways of serine, its role in health, and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in disease states.", "label": 1}
