{"grounding": "Diet is an important determinant of health and consequently is often implicated in the development of disease, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, given the high prevalence of meal-related symptoms. The mechanisms underlying diet-driven pathophysiology are not well understood, but recent studies suggest that gut microbiota may mediate the effect of diet on GI physiology. In this review, we focus primarily on two distinct GI diseases where the role of diet has been best studied: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss how the concurrent and sequential utilization of dietary nutrients by the host and gut microbiota determines the eventual bioactive metabolite profiles in the gut and the biological effect of these metabolites on GI physiology. We highlight several concepts that can be gleaned from these findings, such as how distinct effects of an individual metabolite can influence diverse GI diseases, the effect of similar dietary interventions on multiple disease states, and the need for extensive phenotyping and data collection to help make personalized diet recommendations.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the development and management of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional dyspepsia. This review explores the role of diet\u2013microbiome interactions in modulating the gut\u2013brain axis and the subsequent impact on inflammation and metabolic processes. Metabolomics studies have revealed that specific dietary components, such as fermentable fibers and polyphenols, can influence the composition and activity of the gut microbiota, leading to the production of beneficial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These metabolites play a pivotal role in maintaining gut barrier integrity and regulating immune responses. However, dysbiosis, often induced by a Western diet high in fat and sugar, can disrupt these processes, contributing to chronic inflammation and GI symptoms. Emerging microbiome-targeted therapies, including prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), offer promising strategies to restore microbial balance and alleviate symptoms. This review highlights the potential of these interventions and underscores the importance of personalized dietary approaches in the management of GI disorders.", "label": 1}
