{"grounding": "Since the early 1990s, single-molecule detection in solution at room temperature has enabled direct observation of single biomolecules at work in real time and under physiological conditions, providing insights into complex biological systems that the traditional ensemble methods cannot offer. In particular, recent advances in single-molecule tracking techniques allow researchers to follow individual biomolecules in their native environments for a timescale of seconds to minutes, revealing not only the distinct pathways these biomolecules take for downstream signaling but also their roles in supporting life. In this review, we discuss various single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques developed to date, with an emphasis on advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking systems that not only achieve ultrahigh spatiotemporal resolution but also provide sufficient working depths suitable for tracking single molecules in 3D tissue models. We then summarize the observables that can be extracted from the trajectory data. Methods to perform single-molecule clustering analysis and future directions are also discussed.", "generated_text": "Recent advances in single-molecule tracking (SMT) and imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to study the dynamics and interactions of individual molecules in complex biological systems. Techniques such as feedback-control tracking and point-spread-function (PSF) engineering have improved the precision and resolution of SMT, allowing for the accurate localization of molecules with nanometer-scale precision. Multiple plane microscopy (MPM) has further expanded the capabilities of SMT by enabling the simultaneous tracking of molecules in multiple focal planes, thus providing a more comprehensive view of molecular behavior in three-dimensional space. Advanced trajectory and clustering analysis methods have also been developed to extract meaningful information from the large datasets generated by these techniques, facilitating the identification of molecular interactions and the characterization of dynamic processes. These advancements collectively represent a significant leap forward in the field of single-molecule biophysics, opening new avenues for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cellular processes.", "label": 1}
