{"grounding": "The identification of thousands of proteins and their relative levels of expression has furthered understanding of biological processes and disease and stimulated new systems biology hypotheses. Quantitative proteomics workflows that rely on analytical assays such as mass spectrometry have facilitated high-throughput measurements of proteins partially due to multiplexing. Multiplexing allows proteome differences across multiple samples to be measured simultaneously, resulting in more accurate quantitation, increased statistical robustness, reduced analysis times, and lower experimental costs. The number of samples that can be multiplexed has evolved from as few as two to more than 50, with studies involving more than 10 samples being denoted as enhanced multiplexing or hyperplexing. In this review, we give an update on emerging multiplexing proteomics techniques and highlight advantages and limitations for enhanced multiplexing strategies.", "generated_text": "This study introduces an advanced multiplexing technology, termed hyperplexing, designed to significantly enhance the throughput and efficiency of proteomics research. By integrating high-throughput methodologies with automated sample processing, hyperplexing enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple protein samples, thereby reducing experimental time and increasing data resolution. The technology leverages sophisticated labeling techniques and mass spectrometry to achieve unparalleled precision in protein quantification and identification. Initial applications in complex biological systems have demonstrated the capability of hyperplexing to uncover subtle proteomic changes, making it a powerful tool for biomarker discovery and disease mechanism elucidation. This innovation promises to revolutionize the field of proteomics by facilitating large-scale, comprehensive studies with enhanced accuracy and scalability.", "label": 0}
