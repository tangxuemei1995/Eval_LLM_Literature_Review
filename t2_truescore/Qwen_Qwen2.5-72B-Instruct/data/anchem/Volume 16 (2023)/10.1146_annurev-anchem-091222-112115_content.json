{"grounding": "This article critically reviews analytical method validation and quality control applied to the environmental chemistry field. The review focuses on the determination of organic micropollutants (OMPs), specifically emerging contaminants and pesticides, in the aquatic environment. The analytical technique considered is (gas and liquid) chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), including high-resolution MS for wide-scope screening purposes. An analysis of current research practices outlined in the literature has been performed, and key issues and analytical challenges are identified and critically discussed. It is worth emphasizing the lack of specific guidelines applied to environmental analytical chemistry and the minimal regulation of OMPs in waters, which greatly affect method development and performance, requirements for method validation, and the subsequent application to samples. Finally, a proposal is made for method validation and data reporting, which can be understood as starting points for further discussion with specialists in environmental analytical chemistry.", "generated_text": "This study explores efficient validation strategies for the detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples, emphasizing the integration of advanced chromatographic techniques and mass spectrometry. Method validation is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of analytical results, particularly in environmental monitoring. The research outlines a comprehensive approach to quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC), including the assessment of method precision, accuracy, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). Liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS and GC-MS) are highlighted for their sensitivity and selectivity in analyzing a wide range of organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial chemicals. The study also discusses the importance of matrix effects and the use of internal standards to mitigate potential interferences. Practical recommendations for implementing these validation strategies in routine environmental monitoring are provided, aiming to enhance the overall robustness and reproducibility of analytical methods.", "label": 1}
