{"grounding": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect tropical and subtropical countries and are caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. These kinds of diseases spread quickly due to the tropical climate and limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care, which make exposed people more vulnerable. NTDs are reported to be difficult and inefficient to diagnose. As mentioned, most NTDs occur in countries that are socially vulnerable, and the lack of resources and access to modern laboratories and equipment intensify the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, leading to an increase in the mortality rate. Portable and low-cost microfluidic systems have been widely applied for clinical diagnosis, offering a promising alternative that can meet the needs for fast, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tests in developing countries. This review provides a critical overview of microfluidic devices that have been reported in the literature for the detection of the most common NTDs over the past 5 years.", "generated_text": "This study explores the development and application of low-cost microfluidic systems for the rapid and accurate detection of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Utilizing paper-based microfluidics, we have designed and optimized a series of point-of-care (POC) testing devices that integrate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic test (ICT) principles. These devices are capable of detecting specific biomarkers associated with NTDs such as leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, and Chagas disease. The microfluidic platforms were validated using clinical samples, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional laboratory methods. The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of these POC tests make them particularly suitable for resource-limited settings, where NTDs are most prevalent. This research highlights the potential of microfluidic technology to improve clinical diagnosis and surveillance of NTDs, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and disease control.", "label": 0}
