{"grounding": "In situ water monitoring sensors are critical to gain an understanding of ocean biochemistry and ecosystem health. They enable the collection of high-frequency data and capture ecosystem spatial and temporal changes, which in turn facilitate long-term global predictions. They are used as decision support tools in emergency situations and for risk mitigation, pollution source tracking, and regulatory monitoring. Advanced sensing platforms exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. To be fit-for-purpose, sensors must withstand the challenging marine environment and provide data at an acceptable cost. Significant technological advancements have catalyzed the development of new and improved sensors for coastal and oceanographic applications. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, more cost-effective, and increasingly specialized and diversified. This article, therefore, provides a review of the state-of-the art oceanographic and coastal sensors. Progress in sensor development is discussed in terms of performance and the key strategies used for achieving robustness, marine rating, cost reduction, and antifouling protection.", "generated_text": "This review provides an overview of the current state and future prospects of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring. The integration of advanced sensor networks has significantly enhanced our ability to collect real-time data on various oceanographic parameters, including temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. However, challenges such as biofouling, power supply, and data transmission remain critical issues that limit the long-term deployment and reliability of these sensors. The review discusses recent advancements in sensor technology, including the development of anti-fouling coatings and energy-efficient designs, which are crucial for improving the performance and longevity of sensor networks. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the complex challenges of coastal and ocean monitoring, emphasizing the need for robust data management and analysis frameworks to support informed decision-making in marine resource management and environmental conservation.", "label": 1}
