{"grounding": "Offering superb speed, chemical specificity, and analytical sensitivity, direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies are highly amenable for the molecular analysis of complex tissues to aid in disease characterization and help identify new diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. By enabling detection of clinically actionable molecular profiles from tissues and cells, direct MS technologies have the potential to guide treatment decisions and transform sample analysis within clinical workflows. In this review, we highlight recent health-related developments and applications of direct MS technologies that exhibit tangible potential to accelerate clinical research and disease diagnosis, including oncological and neurodegenerative diseases and microbial infections. We focus primarily on applications that employ direct MS technologies for tissue analysis, including MS imaging technologies to map spatial distributions of molecules in situ as well as handheld devices for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis.", "generated_text": "This review highlights recent advancements and emerging medical applications of direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies for tissue analysis, focusing on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), ambient ionization techniques, and handheld MS-based devices. These technologies enable rapid, label-free molecular profiling of tissues, facilitating real-time clinical diagnostics and intraoperative decision-making. Ambient ionization methods, such as desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI), have been particularly impactful in clinical settings due to their ease of use and minimal sample preparation. Handheld MS devices, designed for point-of-care applications, offer the potential for on-site analysis, enhancing the accessibility and speed of diagnostic procedures. The integration of these MS technologies into clinical workflows promises to improve patient outcomes by providing more accurate and timely molecular information. This review also discusses the challenges and future directions in translating these innovative tools from the research laboratory to the clinical environment.", "label": 1}
