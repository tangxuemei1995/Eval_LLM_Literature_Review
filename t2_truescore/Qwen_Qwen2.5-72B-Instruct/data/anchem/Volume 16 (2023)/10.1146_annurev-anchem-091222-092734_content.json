{"grounding": "In recent years, there has been a revived appreciation for the importance of spatial context and morphological phenotypes for both understanding disease progression and guiding treatment decisions. Compared with conventional 2D histopathology, which is the current gold standard of medical diagnostics, nondestructive 3D pathology offers researchers and clinicians the ability to visualize orders of magnitude more tissue within their natural volumetric context. This has been enabled by rapid advances in tissue-preparation methods, high-throughput 3D microscopy instrumentation, and computational tools for processing these massive feature-rich data sets. Here, we provide a brief overview of many of these technical advances along with remaining challenges to be overcome. We also speculate on the future of 3D pathology as applied in translational investigations, preclinical drug development, and clinical decision-support assays.", "generated_text": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is emerging as a powerful tool for nondestructive 3D pathology, offering high-resolution imaging with minimal tissue damage. This technique, combined with advanced computational and digital pathology methods, enables the detailed visualization of complex tissue structures and cellular interactions. LSFM facilitates optical-sectioning microscopy, which is crucial for spatial biology studies, allowing researchers to map the precise location and context of cellular events within tissues. This approach is particularly valuable in precision medicine, where accurate and comprehensive tissue analysis is essential for personalized treatment strategies. By integrating LSFM with translational research and clinical assays, this technology has the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes, paving the way for more effective and targeted medical interventions.", "label": 0}
