{"grounding": "Cell functions rely on signal transduction\u2014the cascades of molecular interactions and biochemical reactions that relay extracellular signals to the cell interior. Dissecting principles governing the signal transduction process is critical for the fundamental understanding of cell physiology and the development of biomedical interventions. The complexity of cell signaling is, however, beyond what is accessible by conventional biochemistry assays. Thanks to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly used for the quantitative measurement and manipulation of cell signaling. Even though research in this area is still in its infancy, it has the potential to yield new, paradigm-shifting knowledge of cell biology and lead to biomedical innovations. To highlight this importance, we summarize in this review studies that pioneered the development and application of NPs for cell signaling, from quantitative measurements of signaling molecules to spatiotemporal manipulation of cell signal transduction.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of nanoparticles as advanced tools for the interrogation of cell signaling pathways. By leveraging the unique properties of nanoparticles, including their ability to be manipulated magnetically and optically, we have developed a platform for intracellular sensing and quantitative imaging. These nanoparticles were designed to specifically target key signaling molecules, allowing for real-time monitoring of their activity within living cells. The magnetic manipulation capability enables precise control over the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles, facilitating the study of localized signaling events. Optical manipulation, on the other hand, provides a non-invasive means to activate or inhibit signaling pathways, offering unprecedented control over cellular processes. Our results demonstrate the potential of these nanoparticles to enhance our understanding of complex cell signaling networks, with implications for both fundamental research and therapeutic applications.", "label": 0}
