{"grounding": "Gel matrices are fundamental to electrophoresis analyses of biopolymers in microscale channels. Both capillary gel and microchannel gel electrophoresis systems have produced fundamental advances in the scientific community. These analytical techniques remain as foundational tools in bioanalytical chemistry and are indispensable in the field of biotherapeutics. This review summarizes the current state of gels in microscale channels and provides a brief description of electrophoretic transport in gels. In addition to the discussion of traditional polymers, several nontraditional gels are introduced. Advances in gel matrices highlighted include selective polymers modified to contain added functionality as well as thermally responsive gels formed through self-assembly. This review discusses cutting-edge applications to challenging areas of discovery in DNA, RNA, protein, and glycan analyses. Finally, emerging techniques that result in multifunctional assays for real-time biochemical processing in capillary and three-dimensional channels are identified.", "generated_text": "This review examines the application of gels in microscale electrophoresis, focusing on capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microfluidic gel electrophoresis. Gels serve as sieving matrices, enabling the separation of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans based on size and charge. The use of microscale formats offers enhanced resolution, faster analysis times, and reduced sample and reagent consumption. Recent advancements in gel formulations and microfabrication techniques have further improved the efficiency and versatility of these methods. This paper discusses the principles, advantages, and challenges of using gels in microscale electrophoresis, highlighting key applications in genomics, proteomics, and glycomics. The integration of these techniques with other microfluidic components is also explored, underscoring their potential for high-throughput and point-of-care diagnostics.", "label": 1}
