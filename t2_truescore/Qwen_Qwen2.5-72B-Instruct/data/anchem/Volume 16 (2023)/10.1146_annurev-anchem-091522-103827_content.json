{"grounding": "Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix and exhibit a set of properties that distinguish them from free-living bacteria. Biofilms are exposed to a variety of mechanical and chemical cues resulting from fluid motion and mass transport. Microfluidics provides the precise control of hydrodynamic and physicochemical microenvironments to study biofilms in general. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in microfluidics-based biofilm research, including understanding the mechanism of bacterial adhesion and biofilm development, assessment of antifouling and antimicrobial properties, development of advanced in vitro infection models, and advancement in methods to characterize biofilms. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of microfluidics-assisted biofilm research.", "generated_text": "This review explores the application of microfluidic platforms in the study of biofilms, focusing on flow dynamics and shear stress effects. Microfluidic devices enable precise control over environmental conditions, facilitating in situ visualization of biofilm formation and development. These systems are crucial for understanding antifouling mechanisms and antimicrobial resistance, offering a high-throughput approach to screen potential therapeutic agents. Additionally, the integration of microfluidics with organ-on-chip and biosensor technologies enhances the physiological relevance of biofilm models, providing valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions and drug efficacy. This interdisciplinary approach paves the way for innovative solutions in biotechnology and medical research.", "label": 0}
