{"grounding": "Recent developments in ion mobility (IM) technology have expanded the capability to separate and characterize gas-phase ions of biomolecules, especially when paired with mass spectrometry. This next generation of IM technology has been ushered in by creative innovation focused on both instrument architectures and how electric fields are applied. In this review, we focus on the application of high-resolution and multidimensional IM to biomolecular analyses, encompassing the fields of glycomics, lipidomics, peptidomics, and proteomics. We highlight selected research that demonstrates the application of the new IM toolkit to challenging biomolecular systems. Through our review of recently published literature, we outline the current strengths of respective technologies and perspectives for future applications.", "generated_text": "This study explores the integration of next-generation ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) with mass spectrometry (MS) to enhance the depth and resolution of multidimensional analyses for biomolecules. By leveraging advanced IMS techniques, we achieve improved separation and structural elucidation of complex mixtures, facilitating more accurate molecular identification. The combined approach offers significant advantages in resolving isomers and conformers, providing deeper insights into the structural dynamics of biomolecules. This methodology is particularly valuable in proteomics and metabolomics, where detailed structural information is crucial for understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms.", "label": 1}
