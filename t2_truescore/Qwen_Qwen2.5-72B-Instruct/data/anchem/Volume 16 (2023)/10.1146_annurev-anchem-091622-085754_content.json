{"grounding": "Label-free electrochemical biosensing leverages the advantages of label-free techniques, low cost, and fewer user steps, with the sensitivity and portability of electrochemical analysis. In this review, we identify four label-free electrochemical biosensing mechanisms: (a) blocking the electrode surface, (b) allowing greater access to the electrode surface, (c) changing the intercalation or electrostatic affinity of a redox probe to a biorecognition unit, and (d) modulating ion or electron transport properties due to conformational and surface charge changes. Each mechanism is described, recent advancements are summarized, and relative advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are discussed. Furthermore, two avenues for gaining further diagnostic information from label-free electrochemical biosensors, through multiplex analysis and incorporating machine learning, are examined.", "generated_text": "This review highlights recent advancements in label-free electrochemical methods for disease detection, emphasizing their role in biosensing and diagnostics. These methods leverage the intrinsic electrical properties of biomolecules, enabling sensitive and specific detection without the need for labels. Key techniques, including impedance spectroscopy, amperometry, and voltammetry, are discussed, along with their applications in detecting biomarkers for various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and infectious diseases. The integration of nanomaterials and microfluidics further enhances the performance and miniaturization of these sensors, making them promising tools for point-of-care diagnostics. The review also addresses the challenges and future perspectives in the field, underscoring the potential of label-free electrochemical methods to revolutionize clinical diagnostics.", "label": 1}
