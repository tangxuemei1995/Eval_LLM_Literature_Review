{"grounding": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging records spatially resolved molecular vibrational spectra, enabling a comprehensive measurement of the chemical makeup and heterogeneity of biological tissues. Combining this novel contrast mechanism in microscopy with the use of artificial intelligence can transform the practice of histopathology, which currently relies largely on human examination of morphologic patterns within stained tissue. First, this review summarizes IR imaging instrumentation especially suited to histopathology, analyses of its performance, and major trends. Second, an overview of data processing methods and application of machine learning is given, with an emphasis on the emerging use of deep learning. Third, a discussion on workflows in pathology is provided, with four categories proposed based on the complexity of methods and the analytical performance needed. Last, a set of guidelines, termed experimental and analytical specifications for spectroscopic imaging in histopathology, are proposed to help standardize the diversity of approaches in this emerging area.", "generated_text": "Digital histopathology has been revolutionized by the integration of infrared spectroscopic imaging, offering a non-destructive, label-free method for detailed tissue analysis. This study explores the application of infrared spectroscopic imaging in conjunction with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of digital pathology. By leveraging the chemical specificity of infrared spectroscopy, this approach provides high-resolution chemical images that can distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues with unprecedented precision. The integration of deep learning algorithms further automates the process, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. This research demonstrates the potential of infrared spectroscopic imaging to transform digital pathology, improving patient outcomes through more precise and timely diagnoses.", "label": 0}
