{"grounding": "Developing a deeper understanding of dynamic chemical, electronic, and morphological changes at interfaces is key to solving practical issues in electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs). To unravel this complexity, an assortment of tools with distinct capabilities and spatiotemporal resolutions have been used to creatively visualize interfacial processes as they occur. This review highlights how electrochemical scanning probe techniques (ESPTs) such as electrochemical atomic force microscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy, scanning ion conductance microscopy, and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy are uniquely positioned to address these challenges in EESSs. We describe the operating principles of ESPTs, focusing on the inspection of interfacial structure and chemical processes involved in Li-ion batteries and beyond. We discuss current examples, performance limitations, and complementary ESPTs. Finally, we discuss prospects for imaging improvements and deep learning for automation. We foresee that ESPTs will play an enabling role in advancing EESSs as we transition to renewable energies.", "generated_text": "This review explores the application of advanced scanning probe methods, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), in the electrochemical imaging of interfaces in energy storage systems, particularly batteries. These techniques offer high spatial resolution and the ability to probe local electrochemical activity, enabling a deeper understanding of interfacial phenomena. Recent advancements in automation and deep learning have further enhanced the capabilities of these methods, facilitating more efficient and accurate data acquisition and analysis. The review highlights key applications in battery research, such as the investigation of electrode degradation, electrolyte stability, and the formation of solid-electrolyte interphases. Future prospects, including the integration of multiple imaging modalities and the development of in situ and operando techniques, are also discussed, underscoring the potential for these methods to drive innovation in energy storage technology.", "label": 1}
