{"grounding": "Life-course epidemiologists have developed sophisticated models for how exposures throughout life\u2014from gestation to old age\u2014shape health, sometimes years after the exposure occurred. The field, however, has been slow to adopt robust causal inference methods, including quasi-experimental designs. This reflects, at least in part, a tension between (a) study designs that maximize our ability to make causal claims and (b) exposure operationalizations that correspond with life-course theories. In this narrative review, we attempt to mitigate that tension. We first discuss the unique challenges for causal inference in life-course epidemiology. We then outline how quasi-experimental methods have already contributed to testing life-course theories, as well as the limitations of the quasi-experimental methods therein. We close with solutions that bridge the gap between modern developments in causal inference and life-course epidemiology, including redefined estimands to maximize public health impact; marginal structural and structural nested models; longitudinal instrumental variables approaches; leveraging new data linkages, such as with detailed residential histories; and triangulation across methods, including adopting a pluralistic approach to causal inference.", "generated_text": "This paper addresses the critical need to reconcile the methodologies of life-course epidemiology and causal inference to enhance our understanding of health trajectories over the lifespan. Life-course epidemiology emphasizes the importance of temporal and contextual factors in shaping health outcomes, while causal inference provides robust methods to establish cause-and-effect relationships. By integrating these approaches, we can better disentangle the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social determinants of health. This review highlights the potential of quantitative methods, such as natural experiments and advanced statistical techniques, to bridge the divide between these fields. We discuss the application of these methods in real-world studies, demonstrating their utility in addressing key research questions in life-course epidemiology. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of innovative methodologies to advance our understanding of health across the life course.", "label": 1}
