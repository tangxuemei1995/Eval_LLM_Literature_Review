{"grounding": "All human societies are permeated by collectively shared entities that govern daily social interactions and promote coordination and cooperation: norms. While the study of norm development is not new to developmental psychology, it has only recently been the target of an interdisciplinary wave of research using new methodologies and (often) complementary theoretical accounts to describe and explain the origins and potentially species-unique aspects of human norm psychology. Here we review recent developmental research showing that young children swiftly acquire and infer norms in a variety of social contexts. Moreover, children actively enforce these norms, even as unaffected bystanders, when third parties do things the wrong way. This research suggests that the foundations of human norm psychology can be found in early childhood. Deeper insights into the ontogenetic roots of norm psychology may contribute to understanding the evolutionary emergence of human cooperation and its maintenance in the contemporary world.", "generated_text": "This study explores the acquisition and application of norms in young children, focusing on the interplay between norm psychology and social-cognitive development. Through a series of observational and experimental tasks, we investigated how children aged 3 to 6 years understand and apply social norms, including moral and conventional norms. Results indicate that children demonstrate a nuanced understanding of normativity, distinguishing between different types of norms and their contexts. Furthermore, the study reveals that children's ability to apply norms is influenced by their social-cognitive development, with older children showing more sophisticated reasoning and application. These findings contribute to our understanding of how young children integrate norms into their social behavior, highlighting the importance of both cognitive and social factors in the development of normative behavior.", "label": 0}
