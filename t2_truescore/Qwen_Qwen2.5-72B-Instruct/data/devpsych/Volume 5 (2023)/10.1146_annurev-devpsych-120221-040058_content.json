{"grounding": "Cognitive control is defined as a set of processes required for the organization of goal-directed thoughts and actions. It is linked to success throughout life including health, wealth, and social capital. How to support the development of cognitive control is therefore an intensively discussed topic. Progress in understanding how this critical life skill can be optimally scaffolded in long-lasting ways has been disappointing. I argue that this effort has been hampered by the predominant perspective that cognitive control is a competence or ability, the development of which is driven by predetermined maturational sequences. I propose that this traditional view needs to be overhauled in light of a growing body of evidence suggesting that cognitive control allocation is a both highly dynamic and rational process subject to cost\u2013benefit analyses from early in development. I discuss the ramifications of shifting our perspective on cognitive control mechanisms in relation to how we design interventions. I close by spelling out new avenues for scientific inquiry.", "generated_text": "This study presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, integrating insights from cognitive psychology and computational modeling. We propose that the development of cognitive control is driven by a maturation process that optimizes the allocation of cognitive resources based on the expected value of control. Through a series of computational simulations, we demonstrate that this rational model can account for age-related changes in cognitive control tasks, such as the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and switch between tasks. The model predicts that as children mature, their cognitive control improves due to a more efficient evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with control engagement. Empirical data from behavioral experiments support these predictions, showing that children's performance on cognitive control tasks aligns with the model's expected value calculations. This rational account provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive control in childhood.", "label": 0}
