{"grounding": "Although the intergenerational transmission of risk for depression is well documented, the mechanisms and moderators involved in this transmission of risk from depressed parents to their offspring are not clear. In this review, we discuss the progress that has been made over the past two decades in studying offspring of depressed parents and describe the maladaptive characteristics of these offspring in a diverse range of domains, including clinical, cognitive, and biological functioning. Despite recent advances in this area, there are unresolved questions that warrant further investigation involving the nature of risk transmission from parent to offspring, the specificity of findings to depression, and the role of factors that often accompany depression. We discuss these issues and offer directions for future research that we believe will move the field forward in gaining a better understanding of the relation between parental depression and altered psychobiological functioning in their offspring.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes current research on the functioning of offspring of depressed parents, highlighting the psychobiological and neurostructural correlates. Studies consistently show increased risk for mood and anxiety disorders, with emerging evidence linking these outcomes to altered brain structure, particularly in regions involved in emotion regulation. However, the impact of environmental factors, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, remains underexplored. Unresolved issues include the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate causal pathways and the role of genetic and epigenetic factors. Future research should also focus on developing targeted interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of parental depression on offspring, considering the complex interplay between biological and environmental factors.", "label": 1}
