{"grounding": "Research on early biomarkers and behavioral precursors of autism has led to interventions initiated during the infant period that could potentially change the course of infant brain and behavioral development in autism. This article integrates neuroscience and clinical perspectives to explore how knowledge of infant brain and behavioral development can inform the design of infant autism interventions. Focusing on infants \u226412 months, we review studies on behavioral precursors of autism and their neural correlates and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of infant autism interventions. We then consider how contemporary developmental social neuroscience theories of autism can shed light on the therapeutic strategies used in infant autism interventions and offer a new perspective that emphasizes improving child outcome and well-being by enhancing infant\u2013environment fit. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research that incorporates brain-based measures to inform individualized approaches to intervention and discuss ethical issues raised by infant autism interventions. Readers are referred to \nSupplemental Table 1\n for a glossary of terms used in this article.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in developmental social neuroscience to inform early interventions for infants at risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). By integrating neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic studies, we highlight the critical periods during early brain development that are particularly sensitive to environmental influences. Key findings indicate that early social experiences, such as parent-infant interactions, can modulate neural circuits involved in social cognition and communication, which are often atypical in ASD. We discuss the potential of targeted interventions, such as parent-mediated therapies, to enhance social engagement and neural connectivity in high-risk infants. These interventions aim to capitalize on the brain's plasticity during the first years of life, potentially mitigating the severity of ASD symptoms. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to assess the long-term efficacy of these interventions and to identify biomarkers that can predict response to treatment. This integrative approach underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary framework in advancing our understanding of ASD and improving early intervention strategies.", "label": 1}
