{"grounding": "Cognitive flexibility, or the ability to mentally switch between tasks according to changing environmental demands, supports optimal life outcomes, making it an important executive function to study across development. Here we review the literature examining the development of cognitive flexibility, with an emphasis on studies using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The neuroimaging literature suggests that key brain regions important for cognitive flexibility include the inferior frontal junction and regions within the midcingulo-insular network, including the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices. We further discuss challenges surrounding studying cognitive flexibility during neurodevelopment, including inconsistent terminology, the diversity of fMRI task paradigms, difficulties with isolating cognitive flexibility from other executive functions, and accounting for developmental changes in cognitive strategy. Future directions include assessing how developmental changes in brain network dynamics enable cognitive flexibility and examining potential modulators of cognitive flexibility including physical activity and bilingualism.", "generated_text": "Cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function, undergoes significant development throughout childhood and adolescence. This review synthesizes recent advances in developmental neuroimaging, particularly through task fMRI, to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility. Studies consistently highlight the involvement of the prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions, in mediating flexible cognitive processes. Developmental trajectories indicate that these regions exhibit protracted maturation, with functional connectivity strengthening over time. However, individual differences in cognitive flexibility are also influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, and experience. Future research should focus on longitudinal designs to better understand the dynamic interplay between brain structure, function, and behavior. Additionally, integrating multimodal imaging techniques and ecological assessments will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural bases of cognitive flexibility across development.", "label": 1}
