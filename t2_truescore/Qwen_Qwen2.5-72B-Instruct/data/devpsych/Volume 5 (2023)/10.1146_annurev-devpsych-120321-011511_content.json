{"grounding": "Adolescence is a period of life that encompasses biological maturation and profound change in social roles. It is also a period associated with the onset of mental health problems. The field of developmental cognitive neuroscience has advanced our understanding of the development of the brain within its immediate social and cultural context. In a time of rising rates of mental health problems among adolescents across the globe, it is important to understand how the wider societal, structural, and cultural contexts of young people are impacting their biological and social-cognitive maturation. In this article, we review the landscape of youth mental health and brain development during adolescence and consider the potential role of brain research in understanding the effects of current social determinants of adolescent mental health, including socioeconomic inequality, city living, and eco-anxiety about the climate crisis.", "generated_text": "This study adopts a neuroecosocial framework to explore the multifaceted influences on adolescent development, integrating biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Utilizing youth-led methods, the research examines how social inequalities, urbanicity, and the climate crisis intersect to impact mental health outcomes in adolescents. Findings highlight the critical role of community resilience and policy interventions in mitigating adverse effects, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to support youth well-being in rapidly changing environments. The study underscores the importance of empowering adolescents to lead research and advocacy efforts, fostering a more inclusive and responsive approach to addressing the complex challenges they face.", "label": 0}
