{"grounding": "Intimate relationships are hotbeds of emotion. This article presents key findings and current directions in research on couples\u2019 emotion regulation across adulthood as a critical context in which older adults not only maintain functioning but may also outshine younger adults. First, I introduce key concepts, defining qualities (i.e., dynamic, coregulatory, bidirectional, bivalent), and measures (i.e., self-report versus performance-based) of couples\u2019 emotion regulation. Second, I highlight a socioemotional turn in our understanding of adult development with the advent of socioemotional selectivity theory. Third, I offer a life-span developmental perspective on emotion regulation in couples (i.e., across infancy, adolescence and young adulthood, midlife, and late life). Finally, I present the idea that emotion regulation may shift from \u201cme to us\u201d across adulthood and discuss how emotion regulation in couples may become more important, better, and increasingly consequential (e.g., for relationship outcomes, well-being, and health) with age. Ideas for future research are then discussed.", "generated_text": "This study examines the dynamics of emotion regulation in couples across different stages of adulthood, focusing on how aging influences these processes. Utilizing a longitudinal design, data were collected from 300 couples aged 25 to 75 years, assessing their emotion regulation strategies, relationship satisfaction, and individual well-being. Results indicate that older couples tend to employ more adaptive emotion regulation techniques, such as cognitive reappraisal, which are positively correlated with higher relationship satisfaction and lower levels of distress. Younger couples, in contrast, are more likely to use maladaptive strategies like suppression, which can lead to increased conflict and reduced well-being. The findings highlight the importance of age-related changes in emotion regulation and suggest potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing relationship quality and emotional health in couples across the lifespan.", "label": 0}
