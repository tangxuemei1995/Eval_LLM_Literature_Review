{"grounding": "Poverty is associated with changes in brain development and elevates the risk for psychopathology in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Although the field is rapidly expanding, there are methodological challenges that raise questions about the validity of current findings. These challenges include the interrelated issues of reliability, effect size, interindividual heterogeneity, and replicability. To address these issues, we propose a multipronged approach that spans short-, medium-, and long-term solutions, including changes to data pipelines along with more comprehensive data acquisition of environment, brain, and mental health. Additional suggestions are to use open science approaches, more robust statistical analyses, and replication testing. Furthermore, we propose increased integration between advanced analytical approaches using large samples and neuroscience models in intervention research to enhance the interpretability of findings. Collectively, these approaches will expand the application of neuroimaging findings and provide a foundation for eventual policy changes designed to improve conditions for children in poverty.", "generated_text": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the impact of poverty on brain development and mental health, highlighting the role of neuroimaging and developmental psychopathology. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in replicating findings and translating research into effective interventions. Studies consistently show that chronic adversity associated with poverty can alter brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in stress regulation, cognition, and emotion. However, the heterogeneity of poverty-related stressors and the complex interplay with genetic and environmental factors complicate efforts to establish causal pathways. Neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI and fMRI, have been instrumental in identifying these neural changes, but issues of replicability and reproducibility persist. Future research must address these methodological challenges and integrate multidisciplinary approaches to better understand the mechanisms underlying poverty's effects on brain development and mental health, ultimately informing more targeted and effective interventions.", "label": 0}
