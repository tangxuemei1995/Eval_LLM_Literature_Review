{"grounding": "This is an evaluative review of the field of prenatal substance exposure, with a focus on neurobiological and behavioral outcomes from infancy to young adulthood. We provide an overall evaluation of the state of the field and comment on current conceptual and methodological issues in need of attention. Although there are many studies of prenatal substance exposure, developmental frameworks that incorporate and reflect the lived experiences of children and families have seldom been employed in this field. In addition, although there are some common effects (e.g., on fetal growth) between major substances, there are also unique effects. Thus, we discuss the role of specific substances but note that polysubstance exposure is common, and models and methods used to date may not be sufficient to advance understanding of coexposure or polyexposure effects. We discuss these conceptual and methodological weaknesses and provide suggestions for future directions.", "generated_text": "Prenatal substance exposure (PSE) is a significant public health concern, affecting developmental outcomes in children exposed to substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs during pregnancy. This review synthesizes current research on the long-term impacts of PSE, highlighting the complex interplay between prenatal adversity and early developmental trajectories. Studies consistently show that PSE is associated with increased risks of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems, as well as poorer academic performance and social functioning. However, the severity of these outcomes varies widely, influenced by factors such as the type and quantity of substance exposure, maternal health, and postnatal environmental support. Interventions targeting at-risk families, including prenatal care and postnatal support services, are crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of PSE and promoting healthier developmental outcomes.", "label": 0}
