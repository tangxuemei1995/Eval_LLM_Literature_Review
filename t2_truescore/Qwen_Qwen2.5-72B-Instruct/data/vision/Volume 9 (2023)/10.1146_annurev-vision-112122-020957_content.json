{"grounding": "Rod and cone photoreceptors degenerate in retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, robbing the visual system of light-triggered signals necessary for sight. However, changes in the retina do not stop with the photoreceptors. A stereotypical set of morphological and physiological changes, known as remodeling, occur in downstream retinal neurons. Some aspects of remodeling are homeostatic, with structural or functional changes compensating for partial loss of visual inputs. However, other aspects are nonhomeostatic, corrupting retinal information processing to obscure vision mediated naturally by surviving photoreceptors or artificially by vision-restoration technologies. In this review, I consider the mechanism of remodeling and its consequences for residual and restored visual function; discuss the role of retinoic acid, a critical molecular trigger of detrimental remodeling; and discuss strategies for suppressing retinoic acid biosynthesis or signaling as therapeutic possibilities for mitigating vision loss.", "generated_text": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of irreversible blindness. These conditions are characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, leading to retinal remodeling and synaptic plasticity, which exacerbate vision loss. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying retinal remodeling and highlights potential therapeutic strategies to suppress this process. By targeting specific signaling pathways and modulating synaptic plasticity, it may be possible to preserve retinal structure and function, thereby mitigating vision loss. Preclinical studies in animal models have shown promising results, suggesting that interventions aimed at suppressing retinal remodeling could offer a novel approach to treating these debilitating disorders.", "label": 1}
