{"grounding": "The basal ganglia (BG) make up a prominent nexus between visual and motor-related brain regions. In contrast to the BG's well-established roles in movement control and value-based decision making, their contributions to the transformation of visual input into an action remain unclear, especially in the context of perceptual decisions based on uncertain visual evidence. This article reviews recent progress in our understanding of the BG's contributions to the formation, evaluation, and adjustment of such decisions. From theoretical and experimental perspectives, the review focuses on four key stations in the BG network, namely, the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which can have different roles and together support the decision process.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum and pallidum, in visual perceptual decisions. Using a combination of behavioral tasks and neurophysiological recordings, we examined how these structures contribute to saccadic choices and reaction times. Our findings suggest that the basal ganglia are involved in the sequential analysis of visual signals, facilitating the accumulation of sensory evidence and the thresholding process that underlies decision-making. Signal detection theory was applied to model the decision process, revealing that the basal ganglia modulate the balance between speed and accuracy in perceptual decisions. These results provide insights into the neural mechanisms that support visual perception and decision-making.", "label": 0}
