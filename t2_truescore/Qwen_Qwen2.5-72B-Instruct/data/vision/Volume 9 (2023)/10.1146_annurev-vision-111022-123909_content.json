{"grounding": "This review examines the concept of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) in patients with macular diseases. Considering monocular and binocular viewing, we (a) explain how to identify the PRL and discuss the pitfalls associated with its measurement, (b) review the current hypotheses for PRL development, (c) assess whether the PRL is the new reference point of the ocular motor system, and discuss (d) the functional and (e) the clinical implications of the PRL. We conclude that the current definition of the PRL is probably incomplete and should incorporate the need to evaluate the PRL in the framework of binocular viewing. We emphasize the need for more research.", "generated_text": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a critical concept in understanding visual adaptation in individuals with central vision loss, such as those with macular degeneration. The PRL refers to a specific area outside the fovea that patients use for fixation and visual tasks. This study explores the characteristics of the PRL, its role in fixation stability, and the differences in PRL selection between monocular and binocular viewing. Findings indicate that the PRL is highly variable among individuals and is influenced by the extent and location of central vision loss, emphasizing the importance of personalized rehabilitation strategies to enhance visual function.", "label": 1}
