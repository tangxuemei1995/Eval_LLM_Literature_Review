{"grounding": "Global health security threats and the public health impact resulting from emerging infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks continuously emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to preparedness, management of disease outbreaks, and health sequelae associated with emergent pathogens. A spectrum of associated ophthalmic manifestations, along with the potential persistence of emerging viral pathogens in ocular tissues, highlight the importance of an ophthalmic approach to contributing to efforts in the response to public health emergencies from disease outbreaks. This article summarizes the ophthalmic and systemic findings, epidemiology, and therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens identified by the World Health Organization as high-priority pathogens with epidemic potential.", "generated_text": "This review highlights the ophthalmic manifestations and pathogenic mechanisms of emerging viral infections, focusing on COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease. These viruses can cause a range of ocular complications, including uveitis, conjunctivitis, and retinal disorders, which may persist even after systemic recovery. The review discusses the current understanding of viral persistence in ocular tissues and the implications for long-term patient management. Emphasis is placed on the importance of early diagnosis and interdisciplinary collaboration to mitigate the impact of these emerging infectious diseases on ocular health.", "label": 1}
