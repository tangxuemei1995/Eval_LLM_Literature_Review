{"grounding": "Augmented reality (AR) systems aim to alter our view of the world and enable us to see things that are not actually there. The resulting discrepancy between perception and reality can create compelling entertainment and can support innovative approaches to education, guidance, and assistive tools. However, building an AR system that effectively integrates with our natural visual experience is hard. AR systems often suffer from visual limitations and artifacts, and addressing these flaws requires basic knowledge of perception. At the same time, AR system development can serve as a catalyst that drives innovative new research in perceptual science. This review describes recent perceptual research pertinent to and driven by modern AR systems, with the goal of highlighting thought-provoking areas of inquiry and open questions.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the perceptual science underpinning augmented reality (AR) display systems, focusing on how visual perception interacts with AR technologies. We review the latest advancements in AR display systems, including optical see-through and video see-through displays, and discuss their implications for visual perception. Key findings highlight the importance of accurate depth cues, color consistency, and motion parallax in enhancing the realism and usability of AR experiences. The paper also addresses the challenges of perceptual latency and visual discomfort, proposing solutions to mitigate these issues. By integrating insights from cognitive and perceptual psychology, this research aims to inform the design of more effective and user-friendly AR systems.", "label": 1}
