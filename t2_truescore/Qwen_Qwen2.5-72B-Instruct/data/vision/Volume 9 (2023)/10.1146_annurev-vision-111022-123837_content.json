{"grounding": "The pervasiveness of mobile devices and other associated technologies has affected all aspects of our daily lives. People with visual impairments are no exception, as they increasingly tend to rely on mobile apps for assistance with various visual tasks in daily life. Compared to dedicated visual aids, mobile apps offer advantages such as affordability, versatility, portability, and ubiquity. We have surveyed hundreds of mobile apps of potential interest to people with vision impairments, either released as special assistive apps claiming to help in tasks such as text or object recognition (n = 68), digital accessibility (n = 84), navigation (n = 44), and remote sighted service (n = 4), among others, or marketed as general camera magnification apps that can be used for visual assistance (n = 77). While assistive apps as a whole received positive feedback from visually impaired users, as reported in various studies, evaluations of the usability of every app were typically limited to user reviews, which are often not scientifically informative. Rigorous evaluation studies on the effect of vision assistance apps on daily task performance and quality of life are relatively rare. Moreover, evaluation criteria are difficult to establish, given the heterogeneity of the visual tasks and visual needs of the users. In addition to surveying literature on vision assistance apps, this review discusses the feasibility and necessity of conducting scientific research to understand visual needs and methods to evaluate real-world benefits.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the impact of mobile applications as assistive devices for individuals with vision impairments, focusing on their role in enhancing daily living and accessibility. A comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data from user surveys and app usage analytics was conducted. The findings indicate that mobile apps designed with accessibility features significantly improve the independence and quality of life for visually impaired users. These apps facilitate a range of activities, including navigation, reading, and communication, by leveraging advanced technologies such as text-to-speech, object recognition, and GPS. However, the study also highlights several challenges, such as the need for more intuitive user interfaces, better integration with existing assistive technologies, and increased awareness among the visually impaired community. Additionally, the research underscores the importance of ongoing user feedback and iterative design processes to ensure that apps remain effective and user-friendly. The implications of this study suggest that mobile apps have the potential to play a crucial role in vision rehabilitation and should be integrated into comprehensive care plans for individuals with vision impairments.", "label": 1}
