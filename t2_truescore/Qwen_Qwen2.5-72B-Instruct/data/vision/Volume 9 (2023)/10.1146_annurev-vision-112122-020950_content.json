{"grounding": "Because the central nervous system is largely nonrenewing, neurons and their synapses must be maintained over the lifetime of an individual to ensure circuit function. Age is a dominant risk factor for neural diseases, and declines in nervous system function are a common feature of aging even in the absence of disease. These alterations extend to the visual system and, in particular, to the retina. The retina is a site of clinically relevant age-related alterations but has also proven to be a uniquely approachable system for discovering principles that govern neural aging because it is well mapped, contains diverse neuron types, and is experimentally accessible. In this article, we review the structural and molecular impacts of aging on neurons within the inner and outer retina circuits. We further discuss the contribution of non-neuronal cell types and systems to retinal aging outcomes. Understanding how and why the retina ages is critical to efforts aimed at preventing age-related neural decline and restoring neural function.", "generated_text": "The retina, a complex neural tissue responsible for visual processing, undergoes significant structural and functional changes with aging. This review examines the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related alterations in retinal neurons and synapses. Recent studies have identified key proteins and signaling pathways that contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired protein homeostasis. Advanced imaging techniques and transcriptomic analyses have revealed distinct molecular landscapes in aging retinal layers, highlighting the heterogeneity of age-related changes. These findings provide insights into the progressive decline in visual function and suggest potential therapeutic targets for age-related retinal diseases. Understanding the intricate interplay between structural integrity and functional performance in the aging retina is crucial for developing interventions to preserve vision in the elderly population.", "label": 1}
