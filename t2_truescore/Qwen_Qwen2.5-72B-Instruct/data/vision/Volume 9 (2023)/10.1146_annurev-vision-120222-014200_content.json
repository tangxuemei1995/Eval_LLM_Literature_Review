{"grounding": "Perception and memory are traditionally thought of as separate cognitive functions, supported by distinct brain regions. The canonical perspective is that perceptual processing of visual information is supported by the ventral visual stream, whereas long-term declarative memory is supported by the medial temporal lobe. However, this modular framework cannot account for the increasingly large body of evidence that reveals a role for early visual areas in long-term recognition memory and a role for medial temporal lobe structures in high-level perceptual processing. In this article, we review relevant research conducted in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. We conclude that the evidence is largely inconsistent with theoretical proposals that draw sharp functional boundaries between perceptual and memory systems in the brain. Instead, the weight of the empirical findings is best captured by a representational-hierarchical model that emphasizes differences in content, rather than in cognitive processes within the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the interplay between perception and memory in the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe, focusing on the perirhinal cortex. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral experiments, we explore how these regions contribute to the encoding and retrieval of visual information. Results indicate that the perirhinal cortex plays a critical role in the transition from perceptual processing to memory formation, facilitating the integration of visual features into coherent object representations. Furthermore, the ventral visual stream is shown to be involved in the initial stages of visual processing, while the medial temporal lobe, particularly the perirhinal cortex, is essential for the consolidation of these perceptions into long-term memory. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and memory, highlighting the importance of the perirhinal cortex in bridging these cognitive processes.", "label": 0}
