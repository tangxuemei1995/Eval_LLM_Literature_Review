{"grounding": "Some visual properties are consistent across a wide range of environments, while other properties are more labile. The efficient coding hypothesis states that many of these regularities in the environment can be discarded from neural representations, thus allocating more of the brain's dynamic range to properties that are likely to vary. This paradigm is less clear about how the visual system prioritizes different pieces of information that vary across visual environments. One solution is to prioritize information that can be used to predict future events, particularly those that guide behavior. The relationship between the efficient coding and future prediction paradigms is an area of active investigation. In this review, we argue that these paradigms are complementary and often act on distinct components of the visual input. We also discuss how normative approaches to efficient coding and future prediction can be integrated.", "generated_text": "This study explores the dual principles of efficient coding and predictive coding in the visual system, highlighting their complementary roles in neural information processing. Using the information bottleneck method, we analyze how the visual cortex optimizes the trade-off between the amount of information retained about the visual input and the computational resources required. Our findings reveal that efficient coding mechanisms, which compress sensory data to reduce redundancy, work in tandem with predictive coding, which anticipates future inputs based on past experiences. This synergy enhances the system's ability to process complex visual scenes with high accuracy and low energy consumption. The results provide insights into the fundamental principles governing neural coding and offer implications for the design of more efficient artificial visual systems.", "label": 1}
