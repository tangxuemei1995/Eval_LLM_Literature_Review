{"grounding": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are machine learning algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision due to their remarkable successes in tasks like object classification and segmentation. The success of DNNs as computer vision algorithms has led to the suggestion that DNNs may also be good models of human visual perception. In this article, we review evidence regarding current DNNs as adequate behavioral models of human core object recognition. To this end, we argue that it is important to distinguish between statistical tools and computational models and to understand model quality as a multidimensional concept in which clarity about modeling goals is key. Reviewing a large number of psychophysical and computational explorations of core object recognition performance in humans and DNNs, we argue that DNNs are highly valuable scientific tools but that, as of today, DNNs should only be regarded as promising\u2014but not yet adequate\u2014computational models of human core object recognition behavior. On the way, we dispel several myths surrounding DNNs in vision science.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the adequacy of deep neural networks (DNNs) as models of human visual perception, focusing on object recognition tasks. By comparing the performance of state-of-the-art DNNs with human psychophysical data, we assess the extent to which these computational models can replicate human visual processing. Our analysis reveals that while DNNs exhibit remarkable accuracy in object recognition, they often fail to capture the nuanced and context-dependent aspects of human perception. Specifically, DNNs show discrepancies in their sensitivity to visual features and their robustness to image transformations, suggesting that current models may not fully account for the complexity of human visual processing. These findings highlight the need for more sophisticated computational models that integrate higher-level cognitive processes and dynamic, context-sensitive mechanisms to better align with human visual behavior.", "label": 1}
