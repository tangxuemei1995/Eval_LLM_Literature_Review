{"grounding": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure that is relevant for sensation, cognition, and action. In nonhuman primates, a rich history of studies has provided unprecedented detail about this structure's role in controlling orienting behaviors; as a result, the primate SC has become primarily regarded as a motor control structure. However, as in other species, the primate SC is also a highly visual structure: A fraction of its inputs is retinal and complemented by inputs from visual cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex. Motivated by this, recent investigations are revealing the rich visual pattern analysis capabilities of the primate SC, placing this structure in an ideal position to guide orienting movements. The anatomical proximity of the primate SC to both early visual inputs and final motor control apparatuses, as well as its ascending feedback projections to the cortex, affirms an important role for this structure in active perception.", "generated_text": "The superior colliculus (SC) plays a pivotal role in the primate visual system, integrating sensory inputs and coordinating motor outputs to guide eye movements and orienting behaviors. This review synthesizes recent findings on the visual functions of the primate SC, highlighting its involvement in active vision and the neural mechanisms underlying spatial attention and target selection. Studies using electrophysiological recordings and behavioral paradigms have revealed that the SC encodes visual stimuli in a topographic map, facilitating rapid and accurate saccades. Moreover, the SC interacts with higher cortical areas to modulate visual processing and enhance the salience of behaviorally relevant stimuli. These interactions are crucial for adaptive behaviors, such as tracking moving objects and navigating complex environments. The SC's role in integrating multisensory information and its influence on downstream motor structures underscore its importance in the orchestration of goal-directed actions. This review also discusses the implications of SC dysfunction in neurological disorders affecting visual and motor functions.", "label": 1}
