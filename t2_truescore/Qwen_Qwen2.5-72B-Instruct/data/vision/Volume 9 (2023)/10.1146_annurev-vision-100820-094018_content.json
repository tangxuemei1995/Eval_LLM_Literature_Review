{"grounding": "We live on a planet that is bathed in daily and seasonal sunlight cycles. In this context, terrestrial life forms have evolved mechanisms that directly harness light energy (plants) or decode light information for adaptive advantage. In animals, the main light sensors are a family of G protein\u2013coupled receptors called opsins. Opsin function is best described for the visual sense. However, most animals also use opsins for extraocular light sensing for seasonal behavior and camouflage. While it has long been believed that mammals do not have an extraocular light sensing capacity, recent evidence suggests otherwise. Notably, encephalopsin (OPN3) and neuropsin (OPN5) are both known to mediate extraocular light sensing in mice. Examples of this mediation include photoentrainment of circadian clocks in skin (by OPN5) and acute light-dependent regulation of metabolic pathways (by OPN3 and OPN5). This review summarizes current findings in the expanding field of extraocular photoreception and their relevance for human physiology.", "generated_text": "Nonvisual opsins, a diverse group of photosensitive proteins, have emerged as key players in extraocular light sensing, extending beyond the classical role of visual opsins in the retina. These opsins, including melanopsin and neuropsin, are expressed in various tissues outside the eye, such as the skin, brain, and peripheral organs, where they mediate a range of physiological responses to light. Recent studies have highlighted their involvement in regulating the circadian clock, influencing sleep-wake cycles, and modulating metabolic processes. For instance, melanopsin in the suprachiasmatic nucleus helps synchronize the circadian rhythm with environmental light cues, while opsins in the skin may contribute to the regulation of circadian gene expression and skin homeostasis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the expanding roles of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing, emphasizing their significance in maintaining physiological balance and health.", "label": 1}
