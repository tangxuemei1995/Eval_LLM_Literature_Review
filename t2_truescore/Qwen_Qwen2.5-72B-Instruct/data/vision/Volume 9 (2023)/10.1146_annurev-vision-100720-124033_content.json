{"grounding": "Using natural scenes is an approach to studying the visual and eye movement systems approximating how these systems function in everyday life. This review examines the results from behavioral and neurophysiological studies using natural scene viewing in humans and monkeys. The use of natural scenes for the study of cerebral cortical activity is relatively new and presents challenges for data analysis. Methods and results from the use of natural scenes for the study of the visual and eye movement cortex are presented, with emphasis on new insights that this method provides enhancing what is known about these cortical regions from the use of conventional methods.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the role of the cerebral cortex in visual search using natural scenes in rhesus monkeys. By recording neural activity in the visual cortex and frontal eye field during saccadic eye movements, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the processing of complex visual information. Our findings suggest that the cerebral cortex integrates multiple visual features to guide attention and facilitate efficient search, highlighting the importance of naturalistic stimuli in understanding neural processing.", "label": 0}
