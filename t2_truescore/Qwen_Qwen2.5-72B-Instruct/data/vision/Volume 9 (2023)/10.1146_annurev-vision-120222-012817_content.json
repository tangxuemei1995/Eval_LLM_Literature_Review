{"grounding": "Inherited and age-associated vision loss is often associated with degeneration of the cells of the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The mammalian retina, being a postmitotic neural tissue, does not have the capacity to repair itself through endogenous regeneration. There has been considerable excitement for the development of cell replacement approaches since the isolation and development of culture methods for human pluripotent stem cells, as well as the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. This has now been combined with novel three-dimensional organoid culture systems that closely mimic human retinal development in vitro. In this review, we cover the current state of the field, with emphasis on the cell delivery challenges, role of the recipient immunological microenvironment, and challenges related to connectivity between transplanted cells and host circuitry both locally and centrally to the different areas of the brain.", "generated_text": "Retinal degeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), poses significant challenges for vision restoration. This review examines the factors influencing stem cell\u2013based regenerative approaches, focusing on the use of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to regenerate RPE and photoreceptors. The immune microenvironment, critical for the survival and integration of transplanted cells, is discussed, highlighting the role of immune modulation in enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, the differentiation efficiency of PSCs into functional retinal cells and the optimization of delivery methods are explored. Recent studies indicate that the success of these therapies is contingent upon a balanced immune response and the precise targeting of cell replacement. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state of stem cell therapy for retinal degeneration and identifies key areas for future research.", "label": 1}
