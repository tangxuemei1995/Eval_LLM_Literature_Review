{"grounding": "Oxidative stress is an important and pervasive physical stress encountered by all kingdoms of life, including bacteria. In this review, we briefly describe the nature of oxidative stress, highlight well-characterized protein-based sensors (transcription factors) of reactive oxygen species that serve as standards for molecular sensors in oxidative stress, and describe molecular studies that have explored the potential of direct RNA sensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, we describe the gaps in knowledge of RNA sensors\u2014particularly regarding the chemical modification of RNA nucleobases. RNA sensors are poised to emerge as an essential layer of understanding and regulating dynamic biological pathways in oxidative stress responses in bacteria and, thus, also represent an important frontier of synthetic biology.", "generated_text": "This review highlights the role of RNAs as sensors of oxidative stress in bacteria, focusing on the mechanisms by which RNA molecules detect and respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies have shown that specific RNA sequences can undergo oxidation, leading to conformational changes that trigger stress response pathways. These RNA sensors, including riboswitches and small regulatory RNAs, play a crucial role in modulating gene expression to mitigate oxidative damage. The integration of these natural RNA-based sensors into synthetic biology platforms offers promising avenues for developing robust stress-responsive circuits in engineered bacteria. Understanding the intricate interplay between RNA oxidation and bacterial stress responses is essential for advancing our knowledge of microbial adaptation and for the design of novel biotechnological applications.", "label": 1}
