{"grounding": "Are deep eutectic solvents (DESs) a promising alternative to conventional solvents? Perhaps, but their development is hindered by a plethora of misconceptions. These are carefully analyzed here, beginning with the very meaning of DESs, which has strayed far beyond its original scope of eutectic mixtures of Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acids and bases. Instead, a definition that is grounded on thermodynamic principles and distinguishes between eutectic and deep eutectic is encouraged, and the types of precursors that can be used to prepare DESs are reviewed. Landmark works surrounding the sustainability, stability, toxicity, and biodegradability of these solvents are also discussed, revealing piling evidence that numerous DESs reported thus far, particularly those that are choline based, lack sufficient sustainability-related traits to be considered green solvents. Finally, emerging DES applications are reviewed, emphasizing their most remarkable feature: the ability to liquefy a solid compound with a target property, allowing its use as a liquid solvent.", "generated_text": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a class of green solvents, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of DESs, focusing on their formation, properties, and applications. DESs are typically composed of a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor, which, when mixed in specific ratios, exhibit a significant melting temperature depression, leading to the formation of a liquid phase at room temperature. The solid\u2013liquid equilibrium of DESs is influenced by the nature of the components and their ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be tailored for specific applications. This review also discusses the environmental benefits of DESs, their role in green chemistry, and the challenges associated with their large-scale production and application. The potential of DESs in catalysis, extraction, and material synthesis is highlighted, underscoring their importance in sustainable chemical processes.", "label": 1}
