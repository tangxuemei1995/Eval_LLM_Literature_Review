{"grounding": "Alternative polymer feedstocks are highly desirable to address environmental, social, and security concerns associated with petrochemical-based materials. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has emerged as one critical feedstock in this regard because it is an abundant and ubiquitous renewable resource. LCB can be deconstructed to generate valuable fuels, chemicals, and small molecules/oligomers that are amenable to modification and polymerization. However, the diversity of LCB complicates the evaluation of biorefinery concepts in areas including process scale-up, production outputs, plant economics, and life-cycle management. We discuss aspects of current LCB biorefinery research with a focus on the major process stages, including feedstock selection, fractionation/deconstruction, and characterization, along with product purification, functionalization, and polymerization to manufacture valuable macromolecular materials. We highlight opportunities to valorize underutilized and complex feedstocks, leverage advanced characterization techniques to predict and manage biorefinery outputs, and increase the fraction of biomass converted into valuable products.", "generated_text": "This review explores the current state and future prospects of lignocellulosic biorefineries, focusing on the production of biobased polymers. Lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable and abundant resource, offers significant potential for sustainable chemical production. However, the efficient valorization of this biomass into high-value products faces several challenges, including pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation processes. Recent engineering innovations, such as integrated bioprocessing and advanced separation technologies, have shown promise in enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of biorefineries. Life-cycle management approaches are crucial for optimizing resource use and minimizing environmental impacts. This paper also highlights emerging opportunities in biobased polymer production, such as the development of novel biopolymers and the integration of circular economy principles. These advancements are essential for transitioning towards a more sustainable and resilient biobased economy.", "label": 1}
