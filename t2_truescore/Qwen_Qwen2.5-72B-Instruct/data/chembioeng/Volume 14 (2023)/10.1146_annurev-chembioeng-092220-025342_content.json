{"grounding": "Thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures are important in many fields of science and engineering. However, experimental data are scarce in this field, so prediction methods are vital. Different types of physical prediction methods are available, ranging from molecular models over equations of state to models of excess properties. These well-established methods are currently being complemented by new methods from the field of machine learning (ML). This review focuses on the rapidly developing interface between these two approaches and gives a structured overview of how physical modeling and ML can be combined to yield hybrid models. We illustrate the different options with examples from recent research and give an outlook on future developments.", "generated_text": "This study presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (ML) techniques with traditional physical models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of thermodynamic predictions for fluid mixtures. By leveraging the strengths of both methodologies, the proposed model effectively captures complex non-linear interactions within the mixture while maintaining a solid foundation in thermodynamic principles. The ML component is trained on a comprehensive dataset of experimental thermodynamic properties, allowing it to generalize well across a wide range of conditions. The hybrid model demonstrates superior performance in predicting phase behavior, critical points, and other thermodynamic properties compared to conventional methods, offering significant potential for applications in chemical engineering and materials science.", "label": 0}
