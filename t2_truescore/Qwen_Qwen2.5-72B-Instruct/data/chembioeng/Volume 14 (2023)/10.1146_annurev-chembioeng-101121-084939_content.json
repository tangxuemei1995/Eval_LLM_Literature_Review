{"grounding": "Active colloids use energy input at the particle level to propel persistent motion and direct dynamic assemblies. We consider three types of colloids animated by chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. For each type, we review the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level and discuss their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. These microscopic systems provide useful experimental models of nonequilibrium many-body physics in which dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. Freed from the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium, active colloids assemble to form materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Colloidal machines based on engineered particles and their assemblies provide a basis for mobile robots with increasing levels of autonomy. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding and applying active colloids to create material systems that mimic the functions of living matter. We highlight opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute to this growing field.", "generated_text": "Active colloids, a class of self-propelled particles, have emerged as a paradigmatic model system for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in soft matter. These particles, capable of converting energy from their environment into directed motion, exhibit complex collective behaviors that are not observed in passive systems. This review highlights recent advances in the design, synthesis, and application of active colloids, emphasizing their potential as both fundamental models for active matter and as functional materials and machines. We discuss the role of interparticle interactions, external fields, and confinement in shaping the dynamic assemblies and emergent properties of active colloidal systems. Furthermore, we explore the prospects of using active colloids in various technological applications, including targeted drug delivery, environmental remediation, and microscale actuation. The challenges and future directions in the field are also addressed, underscoring the interdisciplinary nature of research at the interface of physics, chemistry, and engineering.", "label": 1}
