{"grounding": "Drying drops of colloidal dispersions have attracted attention from researchers since the nineteenth century. The multiscale nature of the problem involving physics at different scales, namely colloidal and interfacial phenomena as well as heat, mass, and momentum transport processes, combined with the seemingly simple yet nontrivial shape of the drops makes drying drop problems rich and interesting. The scope of such studies widens as the physical and chemical nature of dispersed entities in the drop vary and as evaporation occurs in more complex configurations. This review summarizes past and contemporary developments in the field, emphasizing the physicochemical and hydrodynamical principles that govern the processes occurring within a drying drop and the resulting variety of patterns generated on the substrate.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the evaporation dynamics and pattern formation in sessile drops of colloidal dispersions. Through a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we explore the influence of particle concentration, substrate properties, and environmental conditions on the drying process. Our findings reveal the emergence of distinct evaporative patterns, including coffee-ring effects and uniform coatings, which are governed by evaporation-driven flows within the drop. The research also highlights the role of particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions in determining the final deposit morphology. These insights are crucial for optimizing the drying of complex fluids in various industrial and technological applications, such as inkjet printing and thin-film deposition.", "label": 0}
