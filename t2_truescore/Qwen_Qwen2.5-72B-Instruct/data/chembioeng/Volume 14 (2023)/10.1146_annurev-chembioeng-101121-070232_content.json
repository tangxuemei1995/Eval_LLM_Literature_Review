{"grounding": "From the first clinical trial by Dr. W.F. Anderson to the most recent US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics, 2017) and Zolgensma (Novartis, 2019), gene therapy has revamped thinking and practice around cancer treatment and improved survival rates for adult and pediatric patients with genetic diseases. A major challenge to advancing gene therapies for a broader array of applications lies in safely delivering nucleic acids to their intended sites of action. Peptides offer unique potential to improve nucleic acid delivery based on their versatile and tunable interactions with biomolecules and cells. Cell-penetrating peptides and intracellular targeting peptides have received particular focus due to their promise for improving the delivery of gene therapies into cells. We highlight key examples of peptide-assisted, targeted gene delivery to cancer-specific signatures involved in tumor growth and subcellular organelle\u2013targeting peptides, as well as emerging strategies to enhance peptide stability and bioavailability that will support long-term implementation.", "generated_text": "The development of peptide-based vectors for gene delivery represents a promising strategy in biomolecular engineering, particularly for the intracellular delivery of therapeutic molecules such as silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and oligonucleotides. These vectors leverage the unique properties of intracellular targeting peptides to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape, critical steps for effective gene delivery. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of these vectors in various preclinical models, showing improved stability, reduced toxicity, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peptide-based vectors for treating genetic disorders and cancers. This review summarizes the current state of peptide-based gene delivery systems, highlighting key design considerations, mechanisms of action, and the latest findings from preclinical and clinical studies. The integration of these vectors into therapeutic strategies holds significant promise for personalized medicine and the treatment of previously intractable diseases.", "label": 1}
