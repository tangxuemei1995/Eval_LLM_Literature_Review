{"grounding": "Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable chemicals and fuels driven by renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Understanding the structure\u2013activity relationship and the reaction mechanism is significant for tuning electrocatalyst selectivity. Therefore, characterizing catalyst dynamic evolution and reaction intermediates under reaction conditions is necessary but still challenging. We first summarize the most recent progress in mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous CO2/CO reduction using in situ/operando techniques, including surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies, X-ray- and electron-based techniques, and mass spectroscopy, along with discussing remaining limitations. We then offer insights and perspectives to accelerate the future development of in situ/operando techniques.", "generated_text": "This review highlights the recent advancements in in situ and operando characterization techniques for electrochemical CO2 reduction, focusing on the elucidation of reaction mechanisms, catalyst dynamics, and electrolyte interactions. Techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are discussed for their ability to probe reaction intermediates and catalyst active sites under working conditions. These methods provide critical insights into the structural and electronic changes that occur during the reduction process, enabling the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for CO2 conversion.", "label": 1}
