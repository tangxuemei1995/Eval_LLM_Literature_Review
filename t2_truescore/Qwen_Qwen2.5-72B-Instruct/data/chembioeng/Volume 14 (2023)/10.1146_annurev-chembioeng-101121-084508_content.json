{"grounding": "There is growing interest in identifying antibodies that protect against infectious diseases, especially for high-risk individuals and pathogens for which no vaccine is yet available. However, pathogens that manifest as opportunistic or latent infections express complex arrays of virulence-associated proteins and are adept at avoiding immune responses. Some pathogens have developed strategies to selectively destroy antibodies, whereas others create decoy epitopes that trick the host immune system into generating antibodies that are at best nonprotective and at worst enhance pathogenesis. Antibody engineering strategies can thwart these efforts by accessing conserved neutralizing epitopes, generating Fc domains that resist capture or degradation and even accessing pathogens hidden inside cells. Design of pathogen-resistant antibodies can enhance protection and guide development of vaccine immunogens against these complex pathogens. Here, we discuss general strategies for design of antibodies resistant to specific pathogen defense mechanisms.", "generated_text": "The escalating challenge of pathogen immune evasion necessitates innovative strategies in antibody engineering to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This review explores recent advancements in passive immunization and vaccine development, focusing on Fc engineering, bispecific antibodies, and antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs). Fc engineering optimizes antibody effector functions, improving their ability to recruit immune cells and neutralize pathogens. Bispecific antibodies, designed to simultaneously target two distinct antigens, offer enhanced specificity and potency. ADCs combine the targeting precision of antibodies with the cytotoxic power of drugs, providing a potent weapon against infectious diseases. These engineered antibodies represent a promising frontier in combating pathogens that have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the immune system, offering new hope for the development of more effective and durable therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
