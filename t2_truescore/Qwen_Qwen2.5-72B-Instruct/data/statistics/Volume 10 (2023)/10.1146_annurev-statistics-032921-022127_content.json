{"grounding": "In the era of precision medicine, time-to-event outcomes such as time to death or progression are routinely collected, along with high-throughput covariates. These high-dimensional data defy classical survival regression models, which are either infeasible to fit or likely to incur low predictability due to overfitting. To overcome this, recent emphasis has been placed on developing novel approaches for feature selection and survival prognostication. In this article, we review various cutting-edge methods that handle survival outcome data with high-dimensional predictors, highlighting recent innovations in machine learning approaches for survival prediction. We cover the statistical intuitions and principles behind these methods and conclude with extensions to more complex settings, where competing events are observed. We exemplify these methods with applications to the Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort study, one of the largest cancer epidemiology cohorts investigating the complex mechanisms of lung cancer.", "generated_text": "High-dimensional survival analysis is a critical area in precision medicine, where the number of potential predictors often far exceeds the number of observations. This paper reviews recent advancements in methods and applications, focusing on feature screening, machine learning, and artificial neural networks. We discuss the integration of these techniques to enhance statistical inference and predictive accuracy in survival models. Through case studies in oncology and cardiology, we demonstrate how these methods can identify significant biomarkers and improve patient risk stratification. The application of these advanced analytical tools not only aids in personalized treatment planning but also contributes to the broader goals of data science in healthcare.", "label": 1}
