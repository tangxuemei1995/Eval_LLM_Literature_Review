{"grounding": "Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are closely related tasks, with the former concerning in-sample goodness (or lack) of fit and the latter addressing predictive performance out-of-sample. We review the ubiquitous setting in which forecasts are cast in the form of quantiles or quantile-bounded prediction intervals. We distinguish unconditional calibration, which corresponds to classical coverage criteria, from the stronger notion of conditional calibration, as can be visualized in quantile reliability diagrams. Consistent scoring functions\u2014including, but not limited to, the widely used asymmetricpiecewise linear score or pinball loss\u2014provide for comparative assessment and ranking, and link to the coefficient of determination and skill scores. We illustrate the use of these tools on Engel's food expenditure data, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub.", "generated_text": "This study presents a comprehensive framework for model diagnostics and forecast evaluation in the context of quantile regression. We introduce and compare various tools, including the reliability diagram, coverage plot, and Murphy diagram, to assess the calibration and sharpness of quantile forecasts. The reliability diagram evaluates the consistency between predicted and observed quantiles, while the coverage plot checks the proportion of observations falling within the predicted intervals. The Murphy diagram provides a detailed comparison of scoring functions, facilitating the identification of model strengths and weaknesses. Through empirical applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of quantile forecasts, which are crucial for decision-making in fields such as finance, meteorology, and economics.", "label": 1}
