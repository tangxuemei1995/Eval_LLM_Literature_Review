{"grounding": "By linking conceptual theories with observed data, generative models can support reasoning in complex situations. They have come to play a central role both within and beyond statistics, providing the basis for power analysis in molecular biology, theory building in particle physics, and resource allocation in epidemiology, for example. We introduce the probabilistic and computational concepts underlying modern generative models and then analyze how they can be used to inform experimental design, iterative model refinement, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and agent based simulation. We emphasize a modular view of generative mechanisms and discuss how they can be flexibly recombined in new problem contexts. We provide practical illustrations throughout, and code for reproducing all examples is available at \nhttps://github.com/krisrs1128/generative_review\n. Finally, we observe how research in generative models is currently split across several islands of activity, and we highlight opportunities lying at disciplinary intersections.", "generated_text": "This paper provides an interdisciplinary perspective on generative models, integrating insights from computer science, statistics, and decision-making. We explore the application of generative models in simulation and experimental design, highlighting their role in creating realistic scenarios for testing and validation. The paper discusses the use of agent-based models and particle filters to simulate complex systems, emphasizing their utility in understanding emergent behaviors and decision-making processes. We also examine methods for model evaluation, including goodness-of-fit techniques, to ensure that generative models accurately represent the underlying data and processes. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the versatility and power of generative models across various domains, from social sciences to engineering.", "label": 1}
