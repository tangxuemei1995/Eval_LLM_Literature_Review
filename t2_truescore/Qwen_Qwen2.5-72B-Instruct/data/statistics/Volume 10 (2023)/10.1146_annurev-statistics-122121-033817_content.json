{"grounding": "Recent technological advances allow for the collection of massive data in the study of complex phenomena over time and/or space in various fields. Many of these data involve sequences of high-dimensional or non-Euclidean measurements, where change-point analysis is a crucial early step in understanding the data. Segmentation, or offline change-point analysis, divides data into homogeneous temporal or spatial segments, making subsequent analysis easier; its online counterpart detects changes in sequentially observed data, allowing for real-time anomaly detection. This article reviews a nonparametric change-point analysis framework that utilizes graphs representing the similarity between observations. This framework can be applied to data as long as a reasonable dissimilarity distance among the observations can be defined. Thus, this framework can be applied to a wide range of applications, from high-dimensional data to non-Euclidean data, such as imaging data or network data. In addition, analytic formulas can be derived to control the false discoveries, making them easy off-the-shelf data analysis tools.", "generated_text": "This study introduces a novel graph-based change-point analysis method for detecting abrupt changes in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. By leveraging nonparametric graph-based tests and scan statistics, the proposed method effectively identifies change points without assuming a specific distribution of the data. The approach constructs a graph from the data, where nodes represent observations and edges are weighted based on a similarity measure. Change points are detected by evaluating the tail probability of the scan statistic over subgraphs, allowing for the identification of local changes in network structures. The method is validated through extensive simulations and real-world applications, demonstrating superior performance in detecting change points in complex, high-dimensional datasets compared to existing methods. This work has significant implications for various fields, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and financial market monitoring.", "label": 0}
