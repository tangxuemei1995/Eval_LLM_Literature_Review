{"grounding": "For real-valued parameters, significance tests can be motivated as three-decision methods, in which we either assert the sign of the parameter above or below a specified null value, or say nothing either way. Tukey viewed this as a \u201csensible formulation\u201d of tests, unlike the widely taught null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) system that is today's default. We review the three-decision framework, collecting the substantial literature on how other statistical tools can be usefully motivated in this way. These tools include close Bayesian analogs of frequentist power calculations, p-values, confidence intervals, and multiple testing corrections. We also show how three-decision arguments can straightforwardly resolve some well-known difficulties in the interpretation and criticism of testing results. Explicit results are shown for simple conjugate analyses, but the methods discussed apply generally to real-valued parameters.", "generated_text": "This paper introduces and evaluates three-decision methods as a more nuanced and practical approach to significance testing. Unlike traditional binary hypothesis testing, which often leads to oversimplified conclusions, three-decision methods allow researchers to make more informed decisions by considering not only the null and alternative hypotheses but also the possibility of inconclusive results. This framework is grounded in decision theory and enhances the sensitivity and power of statistical tests, particularly in the context of multiple testing. Through simulations and real-world applications, we demonstrate that three-decision methods can reduce Type I and Type II errors while providing a more comprehensive understanding of the data. The implications for sensitivity analysis and the broader field of statistical inference are discussed, highlighting the potential for these methods to improve the reliability and interpretability of research findings.", "label": 0}
