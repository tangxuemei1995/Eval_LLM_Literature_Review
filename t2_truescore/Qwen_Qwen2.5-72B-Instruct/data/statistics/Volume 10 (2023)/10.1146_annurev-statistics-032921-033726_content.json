{"grounding": "Modern studies from a variety of fields record multiple functional observations according to either multivariate, longitudinal, spatial, or time series designs. We refer to such data as second-generation functional data because their analysis\u2014unlike typical functional data analysis, which assumes independence of the functions\u2014accounts for the complex dependence between the functional observations and requires more advanced methods. In this article, we provide an overview of the techniques for analyzing second-generation functional data with a focus on highlighting the key methodological intricacies that stem from the need for modeling complex dependence, compared with independent functional data. For each of the four types of second-generation functional data presented\u2014multivariate functional data, longitudinal functional data, functional time series and spatially functional data\u2014we discuss how the widely popular functional principal component analysis can be extended to these settings to define, identify main directions of variation, and describe dependence among the functions. In addition to modeling, we also discuss prediction, statistical inference, and application to clustering. We close by discussing future directions in this area.", "generated_text": "This study introduces the concept of second-generation functional data, which encompasses spatial, longitudinal, and multivariate functional data, as well as functional time series. We extend traditional functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to accommodate these complex data structures, providing a robust framework for dimension reduction and feature extraction. The proposed methods are validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the intrinsic variability and temporal/spatial dependencies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of second-generation functional data in statistical modeling, leading to improved accuracy and interpretability in various applications, including environmental monitoring, biomedical research, and financial analysis.", "label": 1}
