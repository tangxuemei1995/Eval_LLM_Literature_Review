{"grounding": "Dependent survival data arise in many contexts. One context is clustered survival data, where survival data are collected on clusters such as families or medical centers. Dependent survival data also arise when multiple survival times are recorded for each individual. Frailty models are one common approach to handle such data. In frailty models, the dependence is expressed in terms of a random effect, called the frailty. Frailty models have been used with both the Cox proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time model. This article reviews recent developments in the area of frailty models in a variety of settings. In each setting we provide a detailed model description, assumptions, available estimation methods, and R packages.", "generated_text": "This review examines recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data, including clustered, recurrent, and competing event data. We discuss the application of accelerated failure time models, Cox regression, and modern machine learning techniques such as regression trees and random survival forests. These methods account for unobserved heterogeneity and dependencies within clusters, enhancing the accuracy of survival predictions. The review highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach, providing guidance for researchers in selecting appropriate models for their data.", "label": 0}
