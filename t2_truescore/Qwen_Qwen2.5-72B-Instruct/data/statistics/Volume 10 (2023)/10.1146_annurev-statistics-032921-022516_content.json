{"grounding": "Over the past few years, interest has increased in models defined on positive and negative integers. Several application areas lead to data that are differences between positive integers. Some important examples are price changes measured discretely in financial applications, pre- and posttreatment measurements of discrete outcomes in clinical trials, the difference in the number of goals in sports events, and differencing of count-valued time series. This review aims at bringing together a wide range of models that have appeared in the literature in recent decades. We provide an extensive review on discrete distributions defined for integer data and then consider univariate and multivariate time-series models, including the class of autoregressive models, stochastic processes, and ARCH-GARCH\u2013 (autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic\u2013) type models.", "generated_text": "This study explores advanced models for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We examine the application of thinning operators in constructing integer-valued autoregressive processes, which are essential for modeling count data. The Skellam distribution, characterized by the difference of two independent Poisson-distributed random variables, is highlighted for its utility in capturing overdispersion and zero-inflation. Through simulations and real-world applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in various fields, including ecology, finance, and epidemiology. The results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate distributions and operators to accurately model integer data, enhancing predictive accuracy and interpretability.", "label": 1}
