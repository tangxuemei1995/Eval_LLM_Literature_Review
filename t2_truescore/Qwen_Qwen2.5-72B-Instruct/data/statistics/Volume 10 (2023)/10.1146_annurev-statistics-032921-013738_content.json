{"grounding": "We expose the statistical foundations of deep learning with the goal of facilitating conversation between the deep learning and statistics communities. We highlight core themes at the intersection; summarize key neural models, such as feedforward neural networks, sequential neural networks, and neural latent variable models; and link these ideas to their roots in probability and statistics. We also highlight research directions in deep learning where there are opportunities for statistical contributions.", "generated_text": "This paper provides an overview of deep learning from a statistical perspective, focusing on the fundamental concepts of neural networks, pattern recognition, and optimization techniques. It explores the evolution of deep learning models, their statistical underpinnings, and the challenges and opportunities in the field, offering insights into the practical applications and future directions.", "label": 0}
