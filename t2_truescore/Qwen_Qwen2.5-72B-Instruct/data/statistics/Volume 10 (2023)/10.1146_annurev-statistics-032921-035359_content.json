{"grounding": "Surrogate markers are often used in clinical trials settings when obtaining a final outcome to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment requires a long wait, is expensive to obtain, or both. Formal definitions of surrogate marker quality resulting from a large variety of estimation approaches have been proposed over the years. I review this work, with a particular focus on approaches that use the causal inference paradigm, as these conceptualize a good marker as one in the causal pathway between the treatment and outcome. I also focus on efforts to evaluate the risk of a surrogate paradox, a damaging situation where the surrogate is positively associated with the outcome, and the causal effect of the treatment on the surrogate is in a helpful direction, but the ultimate causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is harmful. I then review some recent work in robust surrogate marker estimation and conclude with a discussion and suggestions for future research.", "generated_text": "Surrogate endpoints are biomarkers intended to substitute for clinical outcomes in clinical trials, aiming to expedite drug development and regulatory approval. This review examines the criteria for validating surrogate endpoints, focusing on the Prentice criteria, which require a surrogate to be causally related to the clinical outcome and to capture the treatment effect. Recent advancements in causal inference methods, such as principal stratification, have enhanced the evaluation of surrogates by addressing the surrogate paradox, where a surrogate may appear effective while the treatment has no impact on the clinical outcome. We discuss the application of these methods in various therapeutic areas and highlight the challenges in establishing causal effectiveness and causal association. The review underscores the importance of rigorous validation to ensure that surrogate endpoints accurately reflect the clinical benefit of interventions, thereby improving the reliability and efficiency of clinical trials.", "label": 1}
