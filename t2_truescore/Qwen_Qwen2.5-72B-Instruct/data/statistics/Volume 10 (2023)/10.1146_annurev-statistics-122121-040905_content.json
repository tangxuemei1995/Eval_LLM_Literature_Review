{"grounding": "I consider the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, from late-1980s Gibbs sampling to present-day gradient-based methods and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. In parallel, I show how these ideas have been implemented in successive generations of statistical software for Bayesian inference. These software packages have been instrumental in popularizing applied Bayesian modeling across a wide variety of scientific domains. They provide an invaluable service to applied statisticians in hiding the complexities of MCMC from the user while providing a convenient modeling language and tools to summarize the output from a Bayesian model. As research into new MCMC methods remains very active, it is likely that future generations of software will incorporate new methods to improve the user experience.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the advancements in simulation-based Bayesian analysis, focusing on computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs). We review the capabilities of popular statistical software tools, including BUGS, Stan, and JAGS, in facilitating Bayesian inference and graphical model construction. The discussion highlights the efficiency and flexibility of these tools in handling complex models and large datasets, emphasizing their role in modern Bayesian computation. Through case studies and practical examples, we demonstrate the application of these methods in various fields, showcasing the potential of simulation-based approaches in advancing Bayesian analysis.", "label": 1}
