{"grounding": "Clustering is the task of automatically gathering observations into homogeneous groups, where the number of groups is unknown. Through its basis in a statistical modeling framework, model-based clustering provides a principled and reproducible approach to clustering. In contrast to heuristic approaches, model-based clustering allows for robust approaches to parameter estimation and objective inference on the number of clusters, while providing a clustering solution that accounts for uncertainty in cluster membership. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the theory underpinning model-based clustering, to outline associated inferential approaches, and to highlight recent methodological developments that facilitate the use of model-based clustering for a broad array of data types. Since its emergence six decades ago, the literature on model-based clustering has grown rapidly, and as such, this review provides only a selection of the bibliography in this dynamic and impactful field.", "generated_text": "Model-based clustering is a powerful approach for identifying groups within complex datasets by leveraging probabilistic models, particularly mixture models. This method employs the expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively estimate the parameters of the underlying distributions, thereby assigning data points to clusters. Bayesian inference further enhances the robustness of the clustering process by incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty. Recent advancements in computational methods and software have made model-based clustering more accessible and efficient, enabling its application in a wide range of fields, from genomics to market segmentation. This review discusses the theoretical foundations, practical considerations, and software tools available for model-based clustering, highlighting its advantages and limitations in handling high-dimensional and heterogeneous data.", "label": 1}
