{"grounding": "This article reviews recent progress in high-dimensional bootstrap. We first review high-dimensional central limit theorems for distributions of sample mean vectors over the rectangles, bootstrap consistency results in high dimensions, and key techniques used to establish those results. We then review selected applications of high-dimensional bootstrap: construction of simultaneous confidence sets for high-dimensional vector parameters, multiple hypothesis testing via step-down, postselection inference, intersection bounds for partially identified parameters, and inference on best policies in policy evaluation. Finally, we also comment on a couple of future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of the empirical bootstrap and multiplier bootstrap methods in high-dimensional data settings, leveraging the high-dimensional central limit theorem. We address challenges in multiple testing and simultaneous inference, demonstrating the effectiveness of these bootstrap techniques in controlling family-wise error rates and false discovery rates. Through extensive simulations and real data applications, we provide evidence of the robustness and accuracy of these methods in high-dimensional contexts.", "label": 0}
