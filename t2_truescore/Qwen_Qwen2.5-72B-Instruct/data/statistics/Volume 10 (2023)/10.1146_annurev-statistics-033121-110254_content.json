{"grounding": "Rich data generating mechanisms are ubiquitous in this age of information and require complex statistical models to draw meaningful inference. While Bayesian analysis has seen enormous development in the last 30 years, benefitting from the impetus given by the successful application of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the combination of big data and complex models conspire to produce significant challenges for the traditional MCMC algorithms. We review modern algorithmic developments addressing the latter and compare their performance using numerical experiments.", "generated_text": "This paper reviews approximate methods for Bayesian computation, focusing on techniques such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coresets, divide and conquer, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and subsampling. These methods are essential for handling complex models and large datasets, providing efficient and scalable solutions to Bayesian inference problems. The review highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering insights into their practical applications and future research directions.", "label": 0}
