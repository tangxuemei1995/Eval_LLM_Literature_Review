{"grounding": "This article proposes a set of categories, each one representing a particular distillation of important statistical ideas. Each category is labeled a \u201csense\u201d because we think of these as essential in helping every statistical mind connect in constructive and insightful ways with statistical theory, methodologies, and computation, toward the ultimate goal of building statistical phronesis. The illustration of each sense with statistical principles and methods provides a sensical tour of the conceptual landscape of statistics, as a leading discipline in the data science ecosystem.", "generated_text": "This paper explores six statistical senses that are essential for robust data analysis: bootstrap, data augmentation, exchangeability, likelihood, propensity score, and randomized replication. These methods enhance the reliability and validity of statistical inferences, particularly in complex datasets. By integrating probabilistic sampling and shrinkage estimation, we demonstrate how these senses can be effectively applied to improve model accuracy and reduce bias. The paper provides a comprehensive overview and practical guidelines for their implementation.", "label": 0}
