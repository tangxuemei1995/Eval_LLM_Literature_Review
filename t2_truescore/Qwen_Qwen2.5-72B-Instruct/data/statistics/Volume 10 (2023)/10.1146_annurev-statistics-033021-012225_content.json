{"grounding": "Exoplanets can be detected with various observational techniques. Among them, radial velocity (RV) has the key advantages of revealing the architecture of planetary systems and measuring planetary mass and orbital eccentricities. RV observations are poised to play a key role in the detection and characterization of Earth twins. However, the detection of such small planets is not yet possible due to very complex, temporally correlated instrumental and astrophysical stochastic signals. Furthermore, exploring the large parameter space of RV models exhaustively and efficiently presents difficulties. In this review, we frame RV data analysis as a problem of detection and parameter estimation in unevenly sampled, multivariate time series. The objective of this review is two-fold: to introduce the motivation, methodological challenges, and numerical challenges of RV data analysis to nonspecialists, and to unify the existing advanced approaches in order to identify areas for improvement.", "generated_text": "The detection of exoplanets using radial velocity (RV) measurements is a complex task, often complicated by correlated noise and uneven sampling. This study presents advanced statistical methods to address these challenges, focusing on the accurate modeling of RV time series data. We employ multivariate time series analysis to account for the interdependencies in RV signals and develop robust models for noise characterization. Model comparison techniques, including Bayesian model selection, are utilized to assess the presence of exoplanets and to evaluate the impact of model misspecification. Our methods are validated using both simulated and real RV data, demonstrating improved detection rates and reduced false positives. The results highlight the importance of rigorous statistical approaches in exoplanet detection, particularly in the presence of complex noise structures and sparse data.", "label": 1}
