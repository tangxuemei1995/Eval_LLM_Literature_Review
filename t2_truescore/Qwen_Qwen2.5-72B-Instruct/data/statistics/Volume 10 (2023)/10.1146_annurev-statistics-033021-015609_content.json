{"grounding": "Several major global challenges, including climate change and water scarcity, warrant a scientific approach to generating solutions. Developing high quality and robust capacity in (bio)statistics is key to ensuring sound scientific solutions to these challenges, so collaboration between academic and research institutes should be high on university agendas. To strengthen capacity in the developing world, South\u2013North partnerships should be a priority. The ideas and examples of statistical capacity-building presented in this article are the result of several monthly online discussions between a mixedgroup of authors having international experience and formal links with Hasselt University in Belgium. The discussion focuses on statistical capacity-building through education (teaching), research, and societal impact. We have adopted an example-based approach, and in view of the background of the authors, the examples refer mainly to biostatistical capacity-building. Although many universities worldwide have already initiated university collaborations for development, we hope and believe that our ideas and concrete examples can serve as inspiration to further strengthen South\u2013North partnerships on statistical capacity-building.", "generated_text": "This paper explores the development of sustainable statistical capacity-building initiatives in Africa, with a specific focus on biostatistics. The importance of robust biostatistical skills in addressing public health challenges and advancing research is underscored. The paper highlights the role of South\u2013North collaboration in fostering educational programs, research partnerships, and consulting services that enhance human capital. It discusses successful models of capacity-building, including the establishment of regional training centers and the integration of practical, data-driven projects into curricula. The paper also examines the challenges of resource constraints, brain drain, and the need for continuous professional development. Recommendations include the creation of a pan-African network of biostatisticians, increased funding for local institutions, and the development of tailored training programs that align with regional health priorities. The ultimate goal is to build a self-sustaining biostatistical workforce capable of driving evidence-based decision-making and innovation in Africa.", "label": 0}
