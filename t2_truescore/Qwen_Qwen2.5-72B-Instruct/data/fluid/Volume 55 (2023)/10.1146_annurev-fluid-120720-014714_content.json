{"grounding": "A common feature of many free surface flows\u2014drop/bubble breakup or coalescence and film/sheet rupture\u2014is the occurrence of hydrodynamic singularities. Accurately computing such flows with continuum mechanical, multidimensional free surface flow algorithms is a challenging task given these problems\u2019 multiscale nature, which necessitates capturing dynamics occurring over disparate length scales across 5\u20136 orders of magnitude. In drop breakup, the thinning of fluid threads that form and eventually pinch-off must be simulated until the thread's radius is about 10 nm. When two drops approach one another, the thickness of the fluid film separating them must fall below 10 nm before coalescence is said to have occurred. If the initial drop radii are 1 mm, simulations must remain faithful to the physics as thread radius or film thickness falls from 10\u22123 m to below 10\u22128 m. Here we review significant findings in interfacial flows with hydrodynamic singularities spearheaded by sharp interface algorithms. These multidimensional algorithms can achieve resolution that to date has only been possible with the use of simple 1D evolution equations.", "generated_text": "This study explores the application of sharp interface methods for the simulation and analysis of free surface flows characterized by singularities, focusing on the phenomena of breakup and coalescence. Utilizing advanced numerical techniques, including finite element methods, the research addresses the complex dynamics of drops, jets, and filaments, which are critical in applications such as ink jet printing, microfluidics, and sprays. The paper presents a detailed examination of the pinch-off process, where a liquid filament breaks into smaller droplets, and the coalescence of droplets, where multiple droplets merge into a single entity. The methods developed in this study accurately capture the evolution of the free surface and the formation of singularities, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the sharp interface approach in handling the intricate geometries and rapid changes in topology associated with these phenomena, offering a valuable tool for both fundamental research and industrial applications.", "label": 1}
