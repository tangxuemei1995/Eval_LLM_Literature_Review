{"grounding": "Although face masks have been used for over a century to provide protection against airborne pathogens and pollutants, close scrutiny of their effectiveness has peaked in the past two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The simplicity of face masks belies the complexity of the physical phenomena that determine their effectiveness as a defense against airborne infections. This complexity is rooted in the fact that the effectiveness of face masks depends on the combined effects of respiratory aerodynamics, filtration flow physics, droplet dynamics and their interactions with porous materials, structural dynamics, physiology, and even human behavior. At its core, however, the face mask is a flow-handling device, and in the current review, we take a flow physics\u2013centric view of face masks and the key phenomena that underlie their function. We summarize the state of the art in experimental measurements, as well as the growing body of computational studies that have contributed to our understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of face masks. The review also lays out some of the important open questions and technical challenges associated with the effectiveness of face masks.", "generated_text": "The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the critical role of face masks in mitigating the airborne transmission of respiratory infections. This study investigates the flow physics of face masks, focusing on the mechanisms by which they reduce the dispersion of respiratory droplets and aerosols. Using a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental measurements, we analyze the effectiveness of various mask materials and designs in filtering particles and altering airflow patterns. The results show that masks significantly reduce the velocity and range of exhaled droplets, with higher filtration efficiencies observed in N95 respirators compared to surgical and cloth masks. However, the study also reveals that the fit and seal of the mask are crucial factors in determining its overall effectiveness. The findings provide valuable insights into the optimal design and use of face masks to minimize the risk of respiratory infection transmission, particularly in indoor environments where airborne transmission is a significant concern.", "label": 1}
