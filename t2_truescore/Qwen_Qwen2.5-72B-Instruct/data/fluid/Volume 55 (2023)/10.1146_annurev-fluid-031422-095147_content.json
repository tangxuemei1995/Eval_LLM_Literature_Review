{"grounding": "Oceanic motions with spatial scales of 200 m\u201320 km, called submesoscales, are ubiquitous in the upper ocean and serve as a key intermediary between larger-scale balanced dynamics and unbalanced turbulence. Here, we introduce the fluid dynamics of submesoscales and contrast them with motions at larger and smaller scales. We summarize the various ways in which submesoscales develop due to instabilities that extract potential or kinetic energy from larger-scale balanced currents; some instabilities have counterparts at larger scales, while others are distinct to the submesoscale regime. Submesoscales modify the density stratification in the upper ocean and redistribute energy between scales. These energy transfers are complex, having both up-scale and down-scale components. Submesoscale eddies and fronts also contribute to a spatially heterogeneous distribution of shear and restratification that leave an imprint on upper ocean turbulence. The impact of submesoscales on the Earth's climate remains an exciting research frontier.", "generated_text": "Submesoscale dynamics, characterized by processes occurring at spatial scales of 0.1 to 10 kilometers, play a crucial role in the upper ocean's energy and material fluxes. This study investigates the mechanisms driving submesoscale turbulence, eddies, and fronts, and their implications for oceanic and atmospheric interactions. Using high-resolution numerical simulations and in-situ observations, we explore how submesoscale features modulate heat, momentum, and nutrient transport. Our findings reveal that submesoscale processes significantly enhance vertical mixing and horizontal advection, contributing to the redistribution of heat and nutrients in the upper ocean. These dynamics are particularly important in regions of strong frontal activity, where they can influence local and regional climate patterns. Understanding these processes is essential for improving climate models and predicting the ocean's response to global environmental changes.", "label": 1}
