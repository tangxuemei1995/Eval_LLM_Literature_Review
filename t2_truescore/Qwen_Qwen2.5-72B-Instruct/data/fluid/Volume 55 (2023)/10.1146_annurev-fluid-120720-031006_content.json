{"grounding": "Understanding inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid flows requires mathematical and computational tools that are tailored to such flows and distinct from methods used to understand the canonical problem of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. We review some recent developments in the theory of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, placing special emphasis on several kinds of quasi-linear approximations and their corresponding statistical formulations. Aspects of quasi-linear theory that have received insufficient attention in the literature are discussed, and open questions are framed.", "generated_text": "This review summarizes recent advancements in the theories of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, focusing on quasi-linear approaches and statistical methods. Key developments include refined models for turbulence in geophysical and astrophysical contexts, enhanced predictive capabilities for engineering applications, and improved understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. The integration of experimental data and high-fidelity simulations is highlighted as crucial for validating theoretical predictions.", "label": 0}
