{"grounding": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) are versatile and efficient computational techniques to solve flow problems in complex geometric configurations that retain the simplicity and efficiency of Cartesian structured meshes. Although these methods became known in the 1970s and gained credibility only in the new millennium, they had already been conceived and implemented at the beginning of the 1960s, even if the early computers of those times did not allow researchers to exploit their potential. Nowadays IBMs are established numerical schemes employed for the solution of many complex problems in which fluid mechanics may account for only part of the multiphysics dynamics. Despite the indisputable advantages, these methods also have drawbacks, and each problem should be carefully analyzed before deciding which particular IBM implementation is most suitable and whether additional modeling is necessary. High\u2013Reynolds number flows constitute one of the main limitations of IBMs owing to the resolution of thin wall shear layers, which cannot benefit from anisotropic grid refinement at the boundaries. To alleviate this weakness, researchers have developed IBM-compliant wall models and local grid refinement strategies, although in these cases possible pitfalls must also be considered.", "generated_text": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems, particularly in scenarios where the geometry of the domain is intricate or dynamically changing. Originating from the pioneering work of Peskin in the 1970s, IBMs have evolved to address a wide range of applications, from cardiovascular flows to fluid-structure interaction in engineering systems. This review provides a historical perspective on the development of IBMs, highlighting key advancements in numerical techniques and wall models that have enhanced their accuracy and efficiency. Recent developments in high-fidelity simulations and the integration of machine learning algorithms have further expanded the capabilities of IBMs, enabling more realistic and computationally efficient modeling of complex systems. Looking forward, the future outlook for IBMs includes the exploration of adaptive mesh refinement, enhanced coupling with other numerical methods, and the application to emerging fields such as microfluidics and biological systems. The ongoing research aims to address the challenges of scalability and robustness, ensuring that IBMs remain a versatile and indispensable tool in the simulation of multiphysics problems.", "label": 1}
