{"grounding": "Over the past several decades, computational fluid dynamics has been increasingly used in the aerospace industry for the design and study of new and derivative aircraft. In this review we survey the CFD application process and note its place and importance within the everyday work of industry. Furthermore, the centrality of geometry and importance of turbulence models, higher-order numerical algorithms, output-based mesh adaptation, and numerical design optimization are discussed. Challenges in each area are noted and specific suggestions for investment are made. The review concludes with an outlook toward a future in which certification by analysis and model-based design are standard practice, along with a reminder of the steps necessary to lead the industry there.", "generated_text": "This paper provides an in-depth perspective on the current state of aerospace computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology, highlighting its advancements and the challenges it faces in industrial applications. Recent developments in high-fidelity simulations, turbulence modeling, and multiphysics coupling have significantly enhanced the predictive capabilities of CFD. However, issues such as computational cost, model accuracy, and the integration of CFD with other design tools remain critical barriers to its widespread adoption. The future of aerospace CFD is likely to be shaped by emerging technologies, including machine learning, exascale computing, and cloud-based platforms, which promise to address these challenges and revolutionize the field.", "label": 1}
