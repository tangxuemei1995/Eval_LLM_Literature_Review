{"grounding": "Particles floating at interfaces are commonly observed in nature, as well as in industrial processes. When the particles are non-Brownian particles, large deformations of the interface are created that induce long-ranged capillary interactions and lead to the formation of particle rafts with unique characteristics. In this review we discuss recent efforts in investigating particle raft formation and the role of the rafts\u2019 own weight during dynamic clustering. Under specific conditions, these rafts can ultimately collapse and sink. When subjected to external or internal forces, the raft undergoes large deformations that test the mechanical characteristics of this interfacial composite material. It can behave as a continuous elastic sheet under compression, although its discrete nature can also trigger its fragmentation via interparticle interactions. Finally, armored droplets, drops covered by a protective shell of particles, can lose their integrity when submitted to dynamic deformations, resulting in the ejection of particles or the fracturing of the armor. Open questions to understand the properties of this material are highlighted and future research to understand the fundamental physics of particle rafts, the customization of the cluster formation, or the disassembly of this collective material is suggested.", "generated_text": "This study explores the formation and stability of particle rafts and armored droplets, focusing on the interplay between capillarity, buoyancy, and interfacial rheology. Particle-laden interfaces exhibit unique mechanical properties due to the self-assembly of particles at fluid interfaces, which can lead to the formation of robust, elastic structures. We investigate how the size, shape, and surface properties of particles influence the formation and stability of these structures. Through a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the elastic modulus of particle rafts is significantly enhanced by the capillary forces that arise from the curvature of the fluid interface. Additionally, we examine the role of buoyancy in the formation of armored droplets, where a dense layer of particles encapsulates a liquid core, providing mechanical protection and altering the droplet's rheological behavior. Our findings have implications for a wide range of applications, including the design of microcapsules, emulsion stabilization, and the development of new materials with tunable mechanical properties.", "label": 0}
