{"grounding": "In the past few decades various particle image\u2013based volumetric flow measurement techniques have been developed that have demonstrated their potential in accessing unsteady flow properties quantitatively in various experimental applications in fluid mechanics. In this review, we focus on physical properties and circumstances of 3D particle\u2013based measurements and what knowledge can be used for advancing reconstruction accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution, as well as completeness. The natural candidate for our focus is 3D Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT), which allows for position, velocity, and acceleration to be determined alongside a large number of individual particle tracks in the investigated volume. The advent of the dense 3D LPT technique Shake-The-Box in the past decade has opened further possibilities for characterizing unsteady flows by delivering input data for powerful data assimilation techniques that use Navier\u2013Stokes constraints. As a result, high-resolution Lagrangian and Eulerian data can be obtained, including long particle trajectories embedded in time-resolved 3D velocity and pressure fields.", "generated_text": "This study presents an advanced 3D Lagrangian particle tracking method for fluid mechanics, utilizing iterative particle reconstruction techniques such as Shake-The-Box. The method enables the accurate reconstruction of particle trajectories in complex fluid flows, providing detailed insights into one- and multipoint statistics. By analyzing the velocity gradient tensor, the technique offers a comprehensive understanding of fluid dynamics, including the identification of vortices and strain fields. Additionally, the integration of 3D pressure field data through data assimilation enhances the accuracy of the reconstructed flow fields. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing the intricate dynamics of turbulent flows, making it a valuable tool for both experimental and numerical studies in fluid mechanics.", "label": 0}
