{"grounding": "Rotation with thermally induced buoyancy governs many astrophysical and geophysical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, sun, and Earth's liquid-metal outer core. Rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection (RRBC) is an experimental system that has features of rotation and buoyancy, where a container of height H and temperature difference \u0394 between its bottom and top is rotated about its vertical axis with angular velocity \u03a9. The strength of buoyancy is reflected in the Rayleigh number (\u223cH\n3\u0394) and that of the Coriolis force in the Ekman and Rossby numbers (\u223c\u03a9\u22121). Rotation suppresses the convective onset, introduces instabilities, changes the velocity boundary layers, modifies the shape of thermal structures from plumes to vortical columns, affects the large-scale circulation, and can decrease or enhance global heat transport depending on buoyant and Coriolis forcing. RRBC is an extremely rich system, with features directly comparable to geophysical and astrophysical phenomena. Here we review RRBC studies, suggest a unifying heat transport scaling approach for the transition between rotation-dominated and buoyancy-dominated regimes in RRBC, and discuss non-Oberbeck\u2013Boussinesq and centrifugal effects.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of turbulent rotating Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, a fundamental process in fluid dynamics characterized by the interaction of buoyancy-driven convection and Coriolis forces. Through a combination of direct numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements, we explore the impact of rotation on heat transport and flow structure. The results reveal that rotation significantly alters the convective patterns, leading to the formation of large-scale coherent structures and a reduction in the Nusselt number, which quantifies the efficiency of heat transfer. The transition from non-rotating to rotating convection is marked by a shift in the scaling laws governing the heat flux, indicating a change in the dominant transport mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into the role of rotation in enhancing or suppressing turbulence and heat transport, with implications for a wide range of natural and industrial processes, including geophysical flows and thermal management systems.", "label": 1}
