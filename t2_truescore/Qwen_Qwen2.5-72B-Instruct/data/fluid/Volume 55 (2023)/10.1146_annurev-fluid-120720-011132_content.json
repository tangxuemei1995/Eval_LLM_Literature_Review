{"grounding": "Density stratification due to temperature or salinity variations greatly influences the flow around and the sedimentation of objects such as particles, drops, bubbles, and small organisms in the atmosphere, oceans, and lakes. Density stratification hampers the vertical flow and substantially affects the sedimentation of an isolated object, the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of objects, and the collective behavior of suspensions in various ways, depending on the relative magnitude of stratification, inertia (advection), and viscous (diffusion) effects. This review discusses these effects and their hydrodynamic mechanisms in some commonly observed fluid\u2013particle transport phenomena in oceans and the atmosphere. Physical understanding of these mechanisms can help us better model these phenomena and, hence, predict their geophysical, engineering, ecological, and environmental implications.", "generated_text": "This study investigates the dynamics of particles, drops, and bubbles in stratified fluids, focusing on their behavior within the pycnocline. The interaction between microorganisms and the stratified environment is also explored, highlighting the impact on particle-laden flows. Experimental and numerical methods are employed to analyze the vertical and horizontal motion of these elements, revealing the complex interplay between buoyancy, turbulence, and fluid density gradients. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of stratified flow phenomena, with implications for environmental and industrial applications, such as oceanography and chemical processing.", "label": 1}
