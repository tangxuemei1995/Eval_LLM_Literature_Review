{"grounding": "Transitional\u2013turbulent spots bridge the deterministic laminar state with the stochastic turbulent state and affect the transition zone length in engineering flows. Turbulent spot research over the past four decades has expanded from incompressible flat-plate boundary layer and pipe flow to hypersonic boundary layer flow, turbomachinery flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, and a range of more complex flows. Progress has been made on the origination, composition, demarcation, growth, mutual interaction, reproduction, sustainability, and self-organization of turbulent spots. The hypothesis that transitional\u2013turbulent spots are a basic module of the fully turbulent boundary layer has been proven through the discovery of locally generated turbulent\u2013turbulent spots dominating the wall layer. Splitting of transitional\u2013turbulent spots in pipe flow has been linked to a life cycle localized in the spot frontal section. This review discusses these advances and outlines future research directions.", "generated_text": "This study provides new insights into the dynamics and evolution of turbulent spots in various flow configurations, including boundary layers, pipe flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, turbomachinery flow, and hypersonic flow. Through a combination of direct numerical simulations and experimental observations, we elucidate the mechanisms governing the formation, growth, and breakdown of turbulent spots during the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Key findings include the identification of critical Reynolds number thresholds for spot initiation, the role of streamwise vortices in spot propagation, and the influence of wall curvature and compressibility effects on spot morphology. These results enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between coherent structures and turbulence, offering valuable implications for flow control and turbulence modeling in engineering applications.", "label": 0}
