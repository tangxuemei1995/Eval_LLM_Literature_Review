{"grounding": "Since the seminal studies by Osborne Reynolds in the nineteenth century, pipe flow has served as a primary prototype for investigating the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded flows. Despite the apparent simplicity of this flow, various facets of this problem have occupied researchers for more than a century. Here we review insights from three distinct perspectives: (a) stability and susceptibility of laminar flow, (b) phase transition and spatiotemporal dynamics, and (c) dynamical systems analysis of the Navier\u2014Stokes equations. We show how these perspectives have led to a profound understanding of the onset of turbulence in pipe flow. Outstanding open points, applications to flows of complex fluids, and similarities with other wall-bounded flows are discussed.", "generated_text": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow is a complex phenomenon characterized by the interplay of shear flow, transient growth, and the dynamics of turbulent puffs and slugs. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the onset of turbulence, focusing on the role of intermittency and transient chaos. Using a combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations, we explore the critical conditions under which laminar flow becomes unstable, leading to the formation and propagation of turbulent structures. Our findings suggest that the transition process can be described by a model of directed percolation, providing new insights into the universal aspects of this transition.", "label": 0}
