{"grounding": "A rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a realization of pressure-gain combustion, wherein a traveling detonation wave confined in a chamber provides shock-based compression along with chemical heat release. Due to the high wave speeds, such devices can process high mass flow rates in small volumes, leading to compact and unconventional designs. RDEs involve unsteady and multiscale physics, and their operational characteristics are determined by an equilibrium between large- and small-scale processes. While RDEs can provide a significant theoretical gain in efficiency, achieving this improvement requires an understanding of the multiscale coupling. Specifically, unavoidable nonidealities, such as unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and multiple competing waves associated with practical designs, need to be understood and managed. The secondary combustion processes arise from fuel/air injection and unsteady and incomplete mixing, and can create spurious losses. In addition, a combination of multiple detonation and secondary waves compete and define the dynamical behavior of mixing, heat release distribution, and the overall mode of operation of the device. This review discusses the current understanding of such nonidealities and describes the tools and techniques used to gain insight into the extreme unsteady environment in such combustors.", "generated_text": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in propulsion technology, leveraging pressure gain combustion to achieve higher efficiency and performance compared to conventional gas turbines. However, the practical implementation of RDEs is hindered by several nonidealities that can significantly impact their performance. This study investigates key nonidealities, including unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, deflagration loss, and the presence of multiple competing waves. Unsteady mixing, characterized by the temporal and spatial variations in fuel and oxidizer distribution, can lead to incomplete combustion and reduced efficiency. Secondary combustion, occurring in regions where the primary detonation wave has already passed, can further complicate the combustion process and introduce additional losses. Deflagration loss, where the combustion process transitions from a detonation to a deflagration, can severely degrade the pressure gain and overall performance. Additionally, the presence of multiple competing waves, including secondary waves, can lead to instabilities and reduced engine operability. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of these nonidealities, offering insights into their mechanisms and potential mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability and efficiency of RDEs.", "label": 1}
