{"grounding": "N- and O-glycans are both important constituents of viral envelope glycoproteins. O-linked glycosylation can be initiated by any of 20 different human polypeptide O-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases, resulting in an important functional O-glycan heterogeneity. O-glycans are organized as solitary glycans or in clusters of multiple glycans forming mucin-like domains. They are functional both in the viral life cycle and in viral colonization of their host. Negatively charged O-glycans are crucial for the interactions between glycosaminoglycan-binding viruses and their host. A novel mechanism, based on controlled electrostatic repulsion, explains how such viruses solve the conflict between optimized viral attachment to target cells and efficient egress of progeny virus. Conserved solitary O-glycans appear important for viral uptake in target cells by contributing to viral envelope fusion. Dual roles of viral O-glycans in the host B cell immune response, either epitope blocking or epitope promoting, may be exploitable for vaccine development. Finally, specific virus-induced O-glycans may be involved in viremic spread.", "generated_text": "O-linked glycans play a crucial role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins, particularly in regions such as the mucin-like domain. These glycans, including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, are involved in various stages of the viral life cycle, from initial attachment to the host cell to the final egress of the virion. The dense glycosylation in the mucin-like domain can act as a shield, protecting the virus from host immune responses and facilitating viral entry. Additionally, these glycans can interact with cellular receptors, enhancing the virus's ability to attach and infect host cells. Understanding the specific roles of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins is essential for the development of effective vaccines and antiviral strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge on the structure and functional significance of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins, highlighting their importance in viral pathogenesis and potential as therapeutic targets.", "label": 1}
