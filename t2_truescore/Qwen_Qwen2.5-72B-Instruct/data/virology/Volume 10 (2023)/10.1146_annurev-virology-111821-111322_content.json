{"grounding": "Bacteriophages are enigmatic entities that defy definition. Classically, they are specialist viruses that exclusively parasitize bacterial hosts. Yet this definition becomes limiting when we consider their ubiquity in the body coupled with their vast capacity to directly interact with the mammalian host. While phages certainly do not infect nor replicate within mammalian cells, they do interact with and gain unfettered access to the eukaryotic cell structure. With the growing appreciation for the human virome, coupled with our increased application of phages to patients within clinical settings, the potential impact of phage-mammalian interactions is progressively recognized. In this review, we provide a detailed mechanistic overview of how phages interact with the mammalian cell surface, the processes through which said phages are internalized by the cell, and the intracellular processing and fate of the phages. We then summarize the current state-of-the-field with respect to phage-mammalian interactions and their associations with health and disease states.", "generated_text": "This study elucidates the intricate mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, focusing on the roles of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and the host's immune response. Bacteriophages, as components of the virome, can influence mammalian cell function and homeostasis. We demonstrate that upon exposure, mammalian cells internalize bacteriophages through endocytic pathways, which are then trafficked through the endosomal system. This process triggers specific signaling cascades that modulate intracellular immunity and inflammation. Our findings reveal that the presence of bacteriophages can activate pattern recognition receptors, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the enhancement of antiviral defenses. These results provide new insights into the dynamic interplay between mammalian cells and the virome, highlighting the potential implications for host health and disease.", "label": 0}
