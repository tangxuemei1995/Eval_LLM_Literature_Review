{"grounding": "Understanding the factors that shape viral evolution is critical for developing effective antiviral strategies, accurately predicting viral evolution, and preventing pandemics. One fundamental determinant of viral evolution is the interplay between viral protein biophysics and the host machineries that regulate protein folding and quality control. Most adaptive mutations in viruses are biophysically deleterious, resulting in a viral protein product with folding defects. In cells, protein folding is assisted by a dynamic system of chaperones and quality control processes known as the proteostasis network. Host proteostasis networks can determine the fates of viral proteins with biophysical defects, either by assisting with folding or by targeting them for degradation. In this review, we discuss and analyze new discoveries revealing that host proteostasis factors can profoundly shape the sequence space accessible to evolving viral proteins. We also discuss the many opportunities for research progress proffered by the proteostasis perspective on viral evolution and adaptation.", "generated_text": "Viral evolution is intricately linked to the host's proteostasis networks, which regulate protein folding, stability, and degradation. This study explores how viral adaptation is influenced by the host's stress response and chaperone systems, which can both facilitate and constrain viral replication. Using a combination of virology, biophysics, and systems biology approaches, we demonstrate that viruses exploit host chaperones to enhance their protein folding efficiency, thereby accelerating their adaptation to antiviral drugs and immune pressures. However, this reliance on host proteostasis also creates vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between viral evolution and host protein quality control mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of strategies to combat viral drug and immune system resistance.", "label": 1}
