{"grounding": "The large genetic and structural divergences between plants and fungi may hinder the transmission of viruses between these two kingdoms to some extent. However, recent accumulating evidence from virus phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of naturally occurring virus cross-infection suggest the occurrence of past and current transmissions of viruses between plants and plant-associated fungi. Moreover, artificial virus inoculation experiments showed that diverse plant viruses can multiply in fungi and vice versa. Thus, virus cross-infection between plants and fungi may play an important role in the spread, emergence, and evolution of both plant and fungal viruses and facilitate the interaction between them. In this review, we summarize current knowledge related to cross-kingdom virus infection in plants and fungi and further discuss the relevance of this new virological topic in the context of understanding virus spread and transmission in nature as well as developing control strategies for crop plant diseases.", "generated_text": "This study explores the intricate cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses, focusing on mechanisms of virus transmission and extracellular transfer. We investigate how these viruses can infect hosts across different kingdoms, highlighting the role of virus-virus interactions in facilitating or inhibiting cross-kingdom infections. Through a combination of molecular biology, virology, and ecological studies, we provide evidence of the potential for plant viruses to infect fungi and vice versa, suggesting a broader host range than previously recognized. The implications of these findings for biocontrol strategies and the management of viral diseases in agricultural systems are discussed, emphasizing the need for a more integrated approach to understanding and managing viral infections across different biological kingdoms.", "label": 0}
