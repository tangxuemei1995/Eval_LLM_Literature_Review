{"grounding": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome is the final stage of biological information transfer and represents an irreversible commitment to gene expression. Accurate translation of messenger RNA is therefore essential to all life, and spontaneous errors by the translational machinery are highly infrequent (\u223c1/100,000 codons). Programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121PRF) is a mechanism in which the elongating ribosome is induced at high frequency to slip backward by one nucleotide at a defined position and to continue translation in the new reading frame. This is exploited as a translational regulation strategy by hundreds of RNA viruses, which rely on \u22121PRF during genome translation to control the stoichiometry of viral proteins. While early investigations of \u22121PRF focused on virological and biochemical aspects, the application of X-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and the advent of deep sequencing and single-molecule approaches have revealed unexpected structural diversity and mechanistic complexity. Molecular players from several model systems have now been characterized in detail, both in isolation and, more recently, in the context of the elongating ribosome. Here we provide a summary of recent advances and discuss to what extent a general model for \u22121PRF remains a useful way of thinking.", "generated_text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a critical mechanism employed by many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, to regulate the expression of essential proteins. This process involves the ribosome slipping by one or more nucleotides during translation, thereby altering the reading frame and producing distinct proteins from a single mRNA. The structural elements that mediate PRF, such as pseudoknots and slippery sequences, are highly conserved and play a pivotal role in viral replication and pathogenesis. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical assays have provided detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PRF, revealing the dynamic interactions between the ribosome, mRNA, and viral factors. This review summarizes the current understanding of PRF, highlighting the structural and functional features of viral pseudoknots and their impact on translation efficiency. Additionally, the implications of PRF for antiviral drug development and therapeutic strategies are discussed, emphasizing the potential of targeting these unique translational control elements to combat viral infections.", "label": 1}
