{"grounding": "Plant viruses of the genus Tobamovirus cause significant economic losses in various crops. The emergence of new tobamoviruses such as the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) poses a major threat to global agriculture. Upon infection, plants mount a complex immune response to restrict virus replication and spread, involving a multilayered defense system that includes defense hormones, RNA silencing, and immune receptors. To counter these defenses, tobamoviruses have evolved various strategies to evade or suppress the different immune pathways. Understanding the interactions between tobamoviruses and the plant immune pathways is crucial for the development of effective control measures and genetic resistance to these viruses. In this review, we discuss past and current knowledge of the intricate relationship between tobamoviruses and host immunity. We use this knowledge to understand the emergence of ToBRFV and discuss potential approaches for the development of new resistance strategies to cope with emerging tobamoviruses.", "generated_text": "Tobamoviruses, including Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), pose significant threats to global agriculture by evading and manipulating plant immune responses. This review explores the intricate interplay between tobamoviruses and plant defense mechanisms, focusing on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), resistance (R) genes, RNA silencing, and salicylic acid (SA) signaling. PTI acts as the first line of defense, recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, tobamoviruses can suppress PTI, necessitating the activation of R genes for effective resistance. RNA silencing, a potent antiviral mechanism, is also targeted by tobamoviruses, which encode suppressors to counteract this defense. SA signaling plays a crucial role in systemic acquired resistance, enhancing plant defenses against viral infections. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing robust strategies to protect crops from tobamovirus infections.", "label": 1}
