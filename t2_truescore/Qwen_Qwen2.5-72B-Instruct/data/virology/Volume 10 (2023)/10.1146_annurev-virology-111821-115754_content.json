{"grounding": "The mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT) hosts a diverse and highly active microbiota composed of bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. Studies of the GIT microbiota date back more than a century, although modern techniques, including mouse models, sequencing technology, and novel therapeutics in humans, have been foundational to our understanding of the roles of commensal microbes in health and disease. Here, we review the impacts of the GIT microbiota on viral infection, both within the GIT and systemically. GIT-associated microbes and their metabolites alter the course of viral infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct interactions with virions, alteration of the GIT landscape, and extensive regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Mechanistic understanding of the full breadth of interactions between the GIT microbiota and the host is still lacking in many ways but will be vital for the development of novel therapeutics for viral and nonviral diseases alike.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between the host microbiota and viral infections is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in disease outcomes. This review synthesizes recent findings on how the gut microbiota and its metabolites modulate the host's antiviral immune responses, particularly through interferon signaling pathways. Studies have shown that specific microbial taxa and their metabolites can enhance or suppress interferon production, influencing the susceptibility to and severity of viral infections. Additionally, the virome, the collection of viruses within the microbiome, plays a role in shaping the microbial community and its interactions with the host. Understanding these complex interactions could lead to novel therapeutic strategies that leverage the microbiota to prevent or treat viral infections.", "label": 1}
