{"grounding": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order Mononegavirales, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome, to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. To perform the different steps that are necessary for these processes, the nsNSV polymerases undergo a series of coordinated conformational transitions. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures, combined with a history of biochemical and molecular biology studies, have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. In this review, we consider each of the steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication and suggest how these relate to solved polymerase structures.", "generated_text": "Nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses, including members of the order Mononegavirales such as paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses, are characterized by their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that is essential for viral replication and transcription. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the structural and functional mechanisms of RdRPs from these viruses. High-resolution crystal structures and cryo-EM reconstructions have provided insights into the catalytic and regulatory domains of RdRPs, revealing conserved motifs and unique features that contribute to their specificity and efficiency. The interactions between RdRP and viral nucleoproteins, as well as host factors, are crucial for the regulation of viral gene expression and replication. Additionally, the role of RdRP in error-prone replication and the implications for viral evolution and pathogenesis are discussed. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NNS RNA virus replication and offer potential targets for antiviral drug development.", "label": 1}
