{"grounding": "Negative-stranded RNA viruses are a large group of viruses that encode their genomes in RNA across multiple segments in an orientation antisense to messenger RNA. Their members infect broad ranges of hosts, and there are a number of notable human pathogens. Here, we examine the development of reverse genetic systems as applied to these virus families, emphasizing conserved approaches illustrated by some of the prominent members that cause significant human disease. We also describe the utility of their genetic systems in the development of reporter strains of the viruses and some biological insights made possible by their use. To conclude the review, we highlight some possible future uses of reporter viruses that not only will increase our basic understanding of how these viruses replicate and cause disease but also could inform the development of new approaches to therapeutically intervene.", "generated_text": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), pose significant threats to human health. These viruses have been extensively studied using genetic systems that facilitate the manipulation of their genomes. Recent advancements have led to the development of reporter strains, such as fluorescent and bioluminescent variants, which enable real-time monitoring of viral replication and spread in cell cultures and animal models. These tools have enhanced our understanding of viral pathogenesis, host-virus interactions, and the evaluation of antiviral compounds. This review summarizes the genetic systems used to generate these reporter strains and highlights their experimental applications in virology research, emphasizing their utility in elucidating viral life cycles and developing novel therapeutic strategies.", "label": 1}
