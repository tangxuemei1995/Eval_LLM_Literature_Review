{"grounding": "Nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids across the intact nuclear envelope is an exceptional vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic translocation resulting in the delivery of herpesvirus capsids into the cytosol. Budding of the (nucleo)capsid at and scission from the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) resulting in a transiently enveloped virus particle in the perinuclear space followed by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The dimeric NEC oligomerizes into a honeycomb-shaped coat underlining the INM to induce membrane curvature and scission. Mutational analyses complemented structural data defining functionally important regions. Questions remain, including where and when the NEC is formed and how membrane curvature is mediated, vesicle formation is regulated, and directionality is secured. The composition of the primary enveloped virion and the machinery mediating fusion of the primary envelope with the ONM is still debated. While NEC-mediated budding apparently follows a highly conserved mechanism, species and/or cell type\u2013specific differences complicate understanding of later steps.", "generated_text": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), are characterized by their ability to replicate within the host cell nucleus and subsequently exit this compartment. The nuclear egress complex (NEC), composed of viral proteins, plays a crucial role in this process by facilitating the budding of primary enveloped virions (PEVs) at the inner nuclear membrane. Despite significant advances, the precise mechanisms governing NEC assembly, the regulation of nuclear membrane fusion, and the subsequent release of PEVs remain areas of active investigation. This review summarizes the current understanding of herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting recent findings and identifying key gaps in our knowledge. Understanding these processes is essential for developing novel antiviral strategies that target the early stages of the viral life cycle.", "label": 1}
