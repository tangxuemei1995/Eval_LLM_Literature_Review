{"grounding": "There are at least 21 families of enveloped viruses that infect mammals, and many contain members of high concern for global human health. All enveloped viruses have a dedicated fusion protein or fusion complex that enacts the critical genome-releasing membrane fusion event that is essential before viral replication within the host cell interior can begin. Because all enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion, it behooves us to know how viral fusion proteins function. Viral fusion proteins are also major targets of neutralizing antibodies, and hence they serve as key vaccine immunogens. Here we review current concepts about viral membrane fusion proteins focusing on how they are triggered, structural intermediates between pre- and postfusion forms, and their interplay with the lipid bilayers they engage. We also discuss cellular and therapeutic interventions that thwart virus-cell membrane fusion.", "generated_text": "Viral membrane fusion, a critical step in the infection process, involves intricate interactions between viral fusion proteins and host cell membranes. This review elucidates the mechanisms of class I, II, and III viral fusion proteins, highlighting their distinct conformational changes and the formation of trimers-of-hairpins. The energetics of fusion, driven by the insertion of fusion peptides and loops into the target membrane, are discussed in the context of lipid dynamics and the role of fusion restriction factors. Recent studies reveal the importance of conformational intermediates and the dynamic nature of lipid rearrangements, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets to inhibit viral entry.", "label": 1}
