{"grounding": "The global rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and the waning efficacy of antibiotics urge consideration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Phage therapy is a classic approach where bacteriophages (bacteria-specific viruses) are used against bacterial infections, with many recent successes in personalized medicine treatment of intractable infections. However, a perpetual challenge for developing generalized phage therapy is the expectation that viruses will exert selection for target bacteria to deploy defenses against virus attack, causing evolution of phage resistance during patient treatment. Here we review the two main complementary strategies for mitigating bacterial resistance in phage therapy: minimizing the ability for bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance and driving (steering) evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. We discuss future research directions that might further address the phage-resistance problem, to foster widespread development and deployment of therapeutic phage strategies that outsmart evolved bacterial resistance in clinical settings.", "generated_text": "The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global health, necessitating the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. Phage therapy, utilizing bacteriophages to target and lyse specific bacterial pathogens, has gained renewed interest. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria remains a critical challenge. This study explores the use of phage cocktails and the exploitation of evolutionary trade-offs to enhance the efficacy and durability of phage therapy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that phage cocktails can effectively reduce the likelihood of resistance emergence. Additionally, we identify specific genetic mutations associated with phage resistance that confer fitness costs, such as reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to other phages. These findings suggest that by carefully selecting phage combinations and leveraging evolutionary trade-offs, it is possible to develop robust phage therapies that can overcome the evolution of bacterial resistance.", "label": 1}
