{"grounding": "Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\u2013stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS (cyclic nucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) antiphage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGLRs (cGAS-like receptors) and bacterial CD-NTases (cGAS/dinucleotide-cyclase in Vibrio (DncV)-like nucleotidyltransferases) in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.", "generated_text": "The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway represents a critical component of the innate immune system, responsible for detecting cytosolic DNA and initiating antiviral defense mechanisms. Recent discoveries have expanded this paradigm to include the cyclic dinucleotide-based signaling systems (CBASS), which utilize nucleotide second messengers to mediate immune responses. This review explores the origins and mechanisms of these signaling pathways, highlighting the role of cGAS and STING in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). We also discuss the cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and their involvement in generating cyclic dinucleotides that activate STING, leading to the production of type I interferons and other inflammatory cytokines. Understanding the intricate interplay between these components is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate innate immune responses in infectious diseases and cancer.", "label": 1}
