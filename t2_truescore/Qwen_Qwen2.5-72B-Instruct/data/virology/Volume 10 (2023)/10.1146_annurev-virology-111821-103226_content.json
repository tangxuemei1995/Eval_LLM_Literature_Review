{"grounding": "Phase separation of viral biopolymers is a key factor in the formation of cytoplasmic viral inclusions, known as sites of virus replication and assembly. This review describes the mechanisms and factors that affect phase separation in viral replication and identifies potential areas for future research. Drawing inspiration from studies on cellular RNA-rich condensates, we compare the hierarchical coassembly of ribosomal RNAs and proteins in the nucleolus to the coordinated coassembly of viral RNAs and proteins taking place within viral factories in viruses containing segmented RNA genomes. We highlight the common characteristics of biomolecular condensates in viral replication and how this new understanding is reshaping our views of virus assembly mechanisms. Such studies have the potential to uncover unexplored antiviral strategies targeting these phase-separated states.", "generated_text": "This review explores the intersection of viral biology and biomolecular condensates, focusing on how viruses, particularly those with segmented RNA genomes like rotaviruses, exploit phase transitions to form viral factories or viroplasms. These dynamic, membrane-less compartments facilitate efficient viral replication and assembly by concentrating viral components and sequestering host factors. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and function of these condensates, revealing parallels with cellular biomolecular condensates. Understanding these processes not only enhances our knowledge of viral infection strategies but also provides insights into the broader principles of biomolecular organization and phase behavior in cells.", "label": 1}
