{"grounding": "Enteric viruses display intricate adaptations to the host mucosal immune system to successfully reproduce in the gastrointestinal tract and cause maladies ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening disease upon extraintestinal dissemination. However, many viral infections are asymptomatic, and their presence in the gut is associated with an altered immune landscape that can be beneficial or adverse in certain contexts. Genetic variation in the host and environmental factors including the bacterial microbiota influence how the immune system responds to infections in a remarkably viral strain\u2013specific manner. This immune response, in turn, determines whether a given virus establishes acute versus chronic infection, which may have long-lasting consequences such as susceptibility to inflammatory disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction between enteric viruses and the immune system that underlie the impact of these ubiquitous infectious agents on our health.", "generated_text": "Enteric viruses, including norovirus, play a significant role in shaping the immune response within the intestine. These viruses can modulate both innate and adaptive immune pathways, influencing the balance between tolerance and inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms by which enteric viruses interact with the intestinal mucosa, altering the expression of cytokines and chemokines, and affecting the function of immune cells such as dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. This immunomodulation can lead to both protective and pathological outcomes, depending on the viral strain and host factors. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for developing strategies to prevent and treat enteric viral infections and associated diseases. The dynamic interplay between the virome and the host immune system underscores the importance of a holistic approach to studying intestinal health and disease.", "label": 1}
