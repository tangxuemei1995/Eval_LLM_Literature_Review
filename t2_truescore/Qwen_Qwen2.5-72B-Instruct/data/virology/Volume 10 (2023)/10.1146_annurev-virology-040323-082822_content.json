{"grounding": "Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) continue to experience chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which drives the persistence of latent HIV and prevalence of clinical comorbidities. Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to suboptimal immunity is necessary for developing therapeutics that improve the quality of life of PLWH. Although previous studies have found associations between gut dysbiosis and immune dysfunction, the cellular/molecular cascades implicated in the manifestation of aberrant immune responses downstream of microbial perturbations in PLWH are incompletely understood. Recent literature has highlighted that two abundant metabolite families, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), play a crucial role in shaping immunity. These metabolites can be produced and/or modified by bacterial species that make up the gut microbiota and may serve as the causal link between changes to the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction in PLWH. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the microbiome on HIV acquisition and latent HIV persistence despite ART. Further, we describe cellular/molecular cascades downstream of SCFAs and BAs that drive innate or adaptive immune responses responsible for promoting latent HIV persistence in PLWH. This knowledge can be used to advance HIV cure efforts.", "generated_text": "The intricate relationship between the gut microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and the regulation of immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence is a burgeoning area of research. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune system, and dysbiosis can lead to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which are hallmarks of HIV infection. SCFAs, primarily produced through the fermentation of dietary fibers by gut bacteria, have been shown to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. They can also influence the expression of genes involved in viral latency, potentially affecting HIV persistence. Bile acids, on the other hand, are known to interact with specific receptors that regulate immune cell function and metabolism, further impacting the inflammatory milieu and viral reservoirs. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the gut microbiome and its metabolites as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune dysfunction and reduce HIV persistence. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms by which the microbiome, SCFAs, and bile acids influence immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence, and discusses the implications for developing novel therapeutic interventions.", "label": 1}
