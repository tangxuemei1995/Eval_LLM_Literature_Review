{"grounding": "Large seismogenic faults consist of approximately meter-thick fault cores surrounded by hundreds-of-meters-thick damage zones. Earthquakes are generated by rupture propagation and slip within fault cores and dissipate the stored elastic strain energy in fracture and frictional processes in the fault zone and in radiated seismic waves. Understanding this energy partitioning is fundamental in earthquake mechanics to explain fault dynamic weakening and causative rupture processes operating over different spatial and temporal scales. The energy dissipated in the earthquake rupture propagation along a fault is called fracture energy or breakdown work. Here we review fracture energy estimates from seismological, modeling, geological, and experimental studies and show that fracture energy scales with fault slip. We conclude that although material-dependent constant fracture energies are important at the microscale for fracturing grains of the fault zone, they are negligible with respect to the macroscale processes governing rupture propagation on natural faults.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tEarthquake ruptures propagate on geological faults and dissipate energy in fracture and frictional processes from micro- (less than a millimeter) to macroscale (centimeters to kilometers).\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy dissipated in earthquake rupture propagation is called fracture energy (G) or breakdown work (W\nb) and scales with coseismic slip.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tFor earthquake ruptures in natural faults, the estimates of G and W\nb are consistent with a macroscale description of causative processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe energy budget of an earthquake remains controversial, and contributions from different disciplines are required to unravel this issue.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "This study investigates the fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes, focusing on the dynamic weakening processes and their implications for the earthquake energy budget. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of seismic events, we explore the relationship between fracture energy, which is the energy required to create new fracture surfaces, and breakdown work, which encompasses the total energy dissipated during the rupture process. Our findings reveal that dynamic weakening mechanisms, such as flash heating and melt lubrication, play a critical role in reducing the effective friction on fault zones, thereby influencing the rupture dynamics and the overall energy budget of earthquakes. We also examine the spatial and temporal variations in fracture energy and breakdown work across different fault zone structures, highlighting the importance of fault zone heterogeneity in controlling the energy release during seismic events. The results provide new insights into the complex interplay between fault zone properties and the energetics of earthquake ruptures, with significant implications for earthquake hazard assessment and the development of more accurate predictive models.", "label": 0}
