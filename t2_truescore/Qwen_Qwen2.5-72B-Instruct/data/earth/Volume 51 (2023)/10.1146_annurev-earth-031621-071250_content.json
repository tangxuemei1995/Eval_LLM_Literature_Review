{"grounding": "The early to mid-Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) is ostensibly the largest magnitude (approximately +5 to +30\u2030), longest duration (ca. 130\u2013250 million years) positive carbon isotope excursion measured in carbonate rocks in Earth history. The LJE has been attributed to large nutrient fluxes, an increase in the size of the biosphere, a reorganization of the global carbon cycle, and oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, significant debate remains about its genesis, synchroneity, global-versus-local extent, and role in atmospheric oxygenation. Here we review existing models and mechanisms suggested for the LJE and analyze a compilation of \u223c9,400 \u03b413Ccarb and associated contextual data. These data call into question the interpretation of the LJE as a globally synchronous carbon isotope excursion and suggest that any model for the LJE must account for both the absence of a clearly defined initiation and termination of the excursion and a facies-dependent expression of 13C-enrichment.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion (LJE) continues to challenge current understandings of the carbon cycle.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tUnderstanding this excursion is critical for reconstructing biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric oxygenation through Earth history.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tSome evidence indicates local rather than global changes in \u03b413CDIC and raises the possibility of asynchronous, local excursions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tResolving whether the LJE was globally synchronous or asynchronous is essential for discriminating between different models.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Carbon Isotope Excursion (LJCE) is a prominent feature in the geological record of the Paleoproterozoic era, characterized by a significant and prolonged positive \u03b413C excursion. This excursion, occurring approximately 2.22 to 2.06 billion years ago, is widely regarded as one of the most extreme carbon isotope anomalies in Earth's history. The LJCE is closely associated with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a period marked by a substantial increase in atmospheric oxygen levels. This study aims to deconstruct the LJCE by integrating geochemical, isotopic, and sedimentological data from multiple Precambrian basins. We explore the potential drivers of this excursion, including changes in the global carbon cycle, the role of microbial metabolism, and the impact of tectonic and volcanic activities. Our findings suggest that the LJCE may have been triggered by a combination of enhanced organic carbon burial and the oxidation of methane, leading to a significant shift in the carbon isotope composition of marine and terrestrial reservoirs. This research provides new insights into the complex interplay between biogeochemical processes and the evolution of Earth's atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic.", "label": 1}
