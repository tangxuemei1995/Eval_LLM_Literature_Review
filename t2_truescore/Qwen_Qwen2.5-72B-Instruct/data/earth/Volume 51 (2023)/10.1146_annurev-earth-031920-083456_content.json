{"grounding": "As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations rise and climate change becomes more destructive, geoengineering has become a subject of serious consideration. By reflecting a fraction of incoming sunlight, solar geoengineering could cool the planet quickly, but with uncertain effects on regional climatology, particularly hydrological patterns. Here, we review recent work on projected hydrologic outcomes of solar geoengineering, in the context of a robust literature on hydrological responses to climate change. While most approaches to solar geoengineering are expected to weaken the global hydrologic cycle, regional effects will vary based on implementation method and strategy. The literature on the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of geoengineering demonstrates that its implications for human welfare will depend on assumptions about underlying social conditions and objectives of intervention as well as the social lens through which projected effects are interpreted. We conclude with suggestions to reduce decision-relevant uncertainties in this novel field of Earth science inquiry.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe expected hydrological effects of reducing insolation are among the most uncertain and consequential impacts of solar geoengineering (SG).\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTheoretical frameworks from broader climate science can help explain SG's effects on global precipitation, relative humidity, and other aspects of hydroclimate.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tThe state of the knowledge on hydrological impacts of SG is unevenly concentrated among regions.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tProjected hydrological impacts from SG are scenario dependent and difficult to characterize as either harmful or beneficial.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "This study investigates the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering, a form of climate intervention aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change by modifying solar radiation. Utilizing a combination of climate models and historical data, we analyze the potential effects of solar radiation modification (SRM) on the hydrologic cycle, focusing on changes in precipitation patterns and water availability. Our findings suggest that while SRM can effectively reduce global mean temperatures, it may lead to significant alterations in regional hydrological processes. Specifically, we observe a decrease in precipitation in certain tropical and subtropical regions, which could exacerbate water scarcity issues. Conversely, some mid-latitude regions may experience increased precipitation, potentially leading to flooding and other hydrological extremes. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interactions between SRM and other climate change mitigation strategies to avoid unintended consequences. These results underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of the hydrological impacts of solar geoengineering before its implementation, to ensure that it does not inadvertently worsen existing climate-related challenges.", "label": 1}
