{"grounding": "Uncertainty about sea-level rise is dominated by uncertainty about iceberg calving, mass loss from glaciers or ice sheets by fracturing. Review of the rapidly growing calving literature leads to a few overarching hypotheses. Almost all calving occurs near or just downglacier of a location where ice flows into an environment more favorable for calving, so the calving rate is controlled primarily by flow to the ice margin rather than by fracturing. Calving can be classified into five regimes, which tend to be persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations in flow velocity, ice characteristics, or environmental forcing; these regimes can be studied instrumentally. Sufficiently large perturbations may cause sometimes-rapid transitions between regimes or between calving and noncalving behavior, during which fracturing may control the rate of calving. Regime transitions underlie the largest uncertainties in sea-level rise projections, but with few, important exceptions, have not been observed instrumentally. This is especially true of the most important regime transitions for sea-level rise. Process-based models informed by studies of ongoing calving, and assimilation of deep-time paleoclimatic data, may help reduce uncertainties about regime transitions. Failure to include calving accurately in predictive models could lead to large underestimates of warming-induced sea-level rise.\n\n\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tIceberg calving, the breakage of ice from glaciers and ice sheets, affects sea level and many other environmental issues.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tModern rates of iceberg calving usually are controlled by the rate of ice flow past restraining points, not by the brittle calving processes.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tCalving can be classified into five regimes, which are persistent, predictable, and insensitive to small perturbations.\n\n\u25aa\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tTransitions between calving regimes are especially important, and with warming might cause faster sea-level rise than generally projected.\n\n\n", "generated_text": "Iceberg calving, a critical process in the dynamics of ice sheets, significantly influences ice-sheet stability and contributes to global sea-level rise. This study synthesizes recent observations and modeling efforts to elucidate the mechanisms and regimes of iceberg calving in both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. We identify three primary calving regimes: rift-dominated, fracture-dominated, and melt-undercutting, each characterized by distinct environmental and structural conditions. Rift-dominated calving is prevalent in regions with extensive ice shelves, such as the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica, where large, tabular icebergs are calved through the propagation of pre-existing rifts. Fracture-dominated calving, observed in fast-flowing glaciers like Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6 in Greenland, is driven by the rapid propagation of crevasses and fractures, often triggered by oceanic and atmospheric forcing. Melt-undercutting, a process more common in tidewater glaciers, involves the undercutting of glacier fronts by submarine melt, leading to the destabilization and eventual calving of icebergs. The transitions between these regimes are influenced by factors such as ocean temperature, sea ice cover, and the structural integrity of the ice. Our analysis highlights the importance of these transitions in modulating ice-sheet mass loss and suggests that future projections of sea-level rise must account for the dynamic interplay between calving regimes and environmental conditions. This study provides a framework for understanding the complex processes governing iceberg calving and their implications for ice-sheet stability and global sea-level rise.", "label": 1}
